    <div class="md"><p>The cover up has been very thorough so it&#39;s hard to say for sure. Many call it a mudflood but this is a misnomer as it doesn&#39;t appear to have been a traditional flood . A more nuanced description would be mass soil liquefaction from some kind of huge earth quake or arial bombardment or electrical plasma phenomenon . Possibly triggering mud volcanos world wide. Then when all that stopped we can speculate that the lack of top soil led to huge world wide dust storms. In America they called this the dust bowl but perhaps it wasn&#39;t so localized it was just better documented there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t spoil all the fun, but they infiltrated and took over much of Egypt from ~1800-1500 bc.  They were kicked out in a way that very closely resembles the biblical exodus.  From there, they splintered into groups that went to Greece, England, Denmark, etc, and some stayed at the edge of Egypt, taking control of it at different times.  </p>

<p>These groups eventually morphed into what we consider the Greek empire, Roman empire, British empire, Jews, etc.  They&#39;ve been gradually consolidating these groups again, since the &quot;fall&quot; of Rome, and now Western Civilization (and most of the east) is back under their control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the nutshell version :)  It&#39;s a sprawling topic, and I didn&#39;t jump to these conclusions overnight.  Digging through old history with the hyksos question in mind led me through various rabbit holes, and I&#39;m <em>fairly</em> confident that this old family has been in the mix of things for a <em>very</em> long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. </p>

<p>Some things I have learned </p>

<p>-every call in the united states recorded by the government since 1964 
-NCR is now processing all credit purchases in the state of israel, and could be shut down with the push of a button in israel
-the police/fbi/cia are distributing fake lsd and fake mushrooms at music festivals and peace gatherings, infiltrating buddhist and new age movements, giving out some form of truth serum like GHB
-if you are an interesting person, an undercover will befriend you and may even be your best friend
-surveillance of persons of interest now includes various entrapments to see if you will attack or kidnap people in parks or parking lots or general situations
-your reddit profile will be used to build a psych profil and they will use it to craft a situation to entrap you</p>

<p>I investigate these threads further in my work over at steemit, you should check it out but it is a lot of reading.  I out more than few psy ops, like max spiers, the consious resistance and disobedient media.  Anarchulpulco and the Rainbow gathering are now run by the police/fbi/cia, so beware.  </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/@mindhawk">https://steemit.com/@mindhawk</a> </p>

<p>let me know what you think.</p>

<p>And remember the police/fbi/cia are trying to KNOW EVERYTHING, such that no future human movement will ever, ever surprise them.  They are looking ahead 10+ years, harassing people who only MIGHT become important later.  </p>

<p>And all of this is under the threat of the chinese or russians actually deploying mass remote mind control tech, like on Dr. Who.  </p>

<p>As in, if you buy drugs on the darknet, one  day, they might include components that make you vulnerable to satellite control for instance, like in the novel Nexus.  </p>

<p>In other words, the tin foil hat is no longer a joke.  Check out my Privacy Workshop &#39;inside your skull edition&#39;, there is in fact an epidemic of murderers hearing voices in the united states.   </p>

<p>The people who would be at the &quot;top&quot; of the mystery schools are still trying to catch up to what has been lost. </p>

<p>We all have varying degrees of knowledge about the nature of reality but it&#39;s silly to think anyone has the whole truth. Because the more you know the more you realize you don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>&quot;all that I know is that I know nothing&quot;</p>

<p>Im sure there are a fair few of us that have an idea of what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Just be willing to change your mind. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies are plentiful and it&#39;s difficult to get to the bottom of every rabbit hole. Even when you think you&#39;re correct you may still be misinformed on the topic. The smokescreen is vast and the clouds are numerous.</p>

<p>That is why to me the greatest rabbit hole is and always will be spirituality.</p>

<p>Some call it a conspiracy and some do not. The various spiritual realities of this Cosmos seem to be hidden from the populace, yet when one wants to go on the journey, the knowledge and path are there and available to all. There is plenty of misinformation in this area, as well as confusion (again, some of it might be there on purpose, but a lot of it is just people being confused with topics that they don&#39;t fully understand).</p>

<p>But the bottom line is this: the final rabbit hole is freedom.</p>

<p>Look within, engage in meditative and introspective, spiritual practices and clear your mind, let go of your pain and you&#39;ll see that there is a peace beyond it at all. Not only peace, but freedom, joy and love. This peace and freedom is actually always here now. If you become present and let go of any fog that comes up, you will experience it more and more.</p>

<p>This experience of peace and freedom is so much more than simply a pleasant state.</p>

<p>Within that there are the keys to the greatest wisdom - experientially seeing that all of the Cosmos is totally intertwined and ultimately in unity. Experiencing that unity and connection is felt as love. </p>

<p>The peace is also the portal to the understanding that you are not merely the body and/or the mind, but that you are the immortal Being that is beyond anything that appears on the screen of your perception. </p>

<p>Because this Cosmos is based on perception you will see that the more you realize your immortality, the more you will become immune to the world and the more power and control you will wield over your reality (not power <em>over</em> others but in <em>unity</em> with them). You will notice that within you there is a compass, a powerful sense of intuition that will help guide you onto a path that is in the best and highest good of you and all. Having your actions follow that compass, as best you can, you will see how life will become much smoother, co-incidences more apparent and how things will work themselves out far more easily.</p>

<p>In the end the path leads you to the state of imperturbability, where you are free to remain in the world and play, yet you know yourself to be fully beyond the world and are thus untouched by it. This is the state of many great masters, like Jesus or the Buddha, it is freedom in the most direct sense of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t think there is any &quot;one truth&quot; to be known. Or if there is it is unknowable to the mind of man.</p>

<p>As Mark Mothersbaugh once said&quot; &quot;The greatest weapon the conspiracy has is that it does not realize that it is itself a conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>IMO: There is no one man, or group behind the curtain, but many separate players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t spoil all the fun, but they infiltrated and took over much of Egypt from ~1800-1500 bc.  They were kicked out in a way that very closely resembles the biblical exodus.  From there, they splintered into groups that went to Greece, England, Denmark, etc, and some stayed at the edge of Egypt, taking control of it at different times.  </p>

<p>These groups eventually morphed into what we consider the Greek empire, Roman empire, British empire, Jews, etc.  They&#39;ve been gradually consolidating these groups again, since the &quot;fall&quot; of Rome, and now Western Civilization (and most of the east) is back under their control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the nutshell version :)  It&#39;s a sprawling topic, and I didn&#39;t jump to these conclusions overnight.  Digging through old history with the hyksos question in mind led me through various rabbit holes, and I&#39;m <em>fairly</em> confident that this old family has been in the mix of things for a <em>very</em> long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cover up has been very thorough so it&#39;s hard to say for sure. Many call it a mudflood but this is a misnomer as it doesn&#39;t appear to have been a traditional flood . A more nuanced description would be mass soil liquefaction from some kind of huge earth quake or arial bombardment or electrical plasma phenomenon . Possibly triggering mud volcanos world wide. Then when all that stopped we can speculate that the lack of top soil led to huge world wide dust storms. In America they called this the dust bowl but perhaps it wasn&#39;t so localized it was just better documented there. </p>
