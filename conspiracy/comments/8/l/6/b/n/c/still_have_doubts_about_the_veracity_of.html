       If you say chemtrails people scoff. But there are manufactured clouds in the sky every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think is most important and I rarely see anyone talk about this, is the process they use to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government or private planes spray and seed the air with silver iodide. The commercial planes fly through it and the water vapor combines with the chemicals forming the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s just insane to me that you can watch the contrails turn into clouds and people still won’t believe.

       Everyone knows contrails turn into clouds. That's just physics. Interesting you used the word "believe" as if it were a matter of faith. People scoff because you aren't as clever as you think. Chemtrails are the type of conspiracy the government pushes to discredit conspiracy theorists.

       Why do you need to post a theory to be allowed an opinion, much less have an opinion that doesn’t follow the narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ad hominem attacks never improve the theory, they just make you look blinkered and closed off to anything other than pushing your own agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discredit a post, do it by bolstering your theory with actual evidence or a scientific method that supports your idea over the rebuttal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m still waiting to see logistical evidence for silver iodide truck delivery to an airfield, photos of silver iodide being pumped into an aircraft or panels showing its deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is so impervious that you can’t find a trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every aircraft has to have a planned route. It is tracked, marked and identified. If you can see an aircraft in the air you can follow it online. And if you can’t? That’s a starting point. I still haven’t seen one post here showing a single piece actual evidence. Why not?

       ) The planes that do this are private or military. The commercial airlines do not seed the sky, but their exhaust, mixed with the silver iodide creates artificial clouds that cover the majority of our skies everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would love, is for more people to be aware of this so we can have an actual discussion of why this is happening, and assess the risks. But what we have now are people debating the existence of a very real government/private operation.

       You are proving my point. They turn in to clouds, now more than ever, because they are flying through pre-seeded silver iodide. That doesn't make you think, even for a second, something isn't right. You're just going to accept, "oh planes make clouds and everyone knows that but your conspiracy is irrational because planes making clouds is fine and we shouldn't worry about that."
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is simple. Planes are making clouds and it concerns me, because its not just a cloud here or there, its an entire overcast sky that came from planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of clouds we see now are what is outlined in the OP. That's not fucking natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing... growing up, I remember big puffy individual clouds. The clouds you could look at and see animals or castles. The clouds a five year old draws in a picture. I don't see those anymore. All I see are the Cyrus clouds that stem from fucking airplanes.

       Nice try.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an insanely huge issue that should not be pushed under the rug due to other unfortunate issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all breathing, eating, and absorbing through our skin, silver iodide, a lethal substance. Because no one can openly talk about this, we have literally no idea the type of ecological and irreparable damage this action is causing on our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next thing you are going to tell me is its a necessary evil due to pollution. ha!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure you are a shill, but I hope you can think about this very clearly. A toxic chemical is being dispersed in our skies daily. THAT IS NOT OK. I don't need you to remind me that there is pollution from oil, and it doesn't for one fucking second negate my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can honestly go fuck yourself for even saying "stop worrying about this". How obvious can you be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others reading my post, please acknowledge this person, in a conspiracy theory subredit just said to me once he/she realized my argument was valid and irrefutable, told me to "stop worrying about this".
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't wait to follow your comments and see what agendas you are pushing.

       I'd sure like some of that sweet shill money, it's been a minute since I've been accused of that. I care about the environment and there are real issues to worry about. But part of the conspiracy theory fun is the ego you get from secret knowledge. Conspiracies everybody knows about are just less fun.

       Your theory that there is some relation between the two is not backed up by any real scientific data. You know what else we are breathing, eating, and absorbing through our skin that is a lethal substance? H20. From what I can see it looks like the amounts of silver iodide dropped by the cloud seeding programs has been studied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry it beyond your comprehension that someone could look at this, and decide hey this stuff isn't the worst thing in the world, and there are much bigger fish to fry that is much better understood by the scientific community that still is not being addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There sure are a lot more people zipping around the world in tin cans these days. But rather than think about all the carbon they are spewing we've been sidetracked into this pointless and silly debate. I'd like to get a potential powerful environmentalist back on track to fight the carbon cartel. That's my agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all the heavy minerals dumped into the Colorado River due to a failure of the government to properly regulate and monitor old mining damns, oddball cloud seeding projects are such small potatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done, and you are probably right that my attempt to inject some rationality here is just shining a spotlight on the daycare.

       My friend, I share your concern for the environment. I understand where you are coming from and totally get your resentment towards pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by fighting the carbon cartel, why do you have to be OK with the gov and private companies shooting more pollution in the air? It's not a one or the other, friend, and I'm confused why you think it is. And that's why you seem shill-esqe. Also, claiming "oddball cloud seeding" is nefariously inaccurate. Cloud Seeding/ or more specifically injecting the atmosphere with silver iodide happens everyday almost 24 hours a day. Why do you continue to try and down play this? Just because you believe carbon emitters should be controlled, it in no way impacts what i am talking about or the significance I think it deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but I'm 100% against adding MORE toxic chemical(s) into the air, daily, in order to 1. create more rain, 2. stop the effects of pollution/global warming, regardless of other pollution causing activities going on. Geo-engineering is so massive and nuanced, that it is impossible to encapsulate all of whats happening at a given time. 
So when I say "They spray the air with silver Iodide and then planes fly through it and it creates clouds", that's not the end all be all, that's a section of GE that I don't believe many people know about. And as a citizen of the US and as a human in general, I resent the secretive nature of these programs and the zero public oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't pretend I have hidden knowledge or that it trips my ego. It's curious you point that out, as that's what is mentioned in the majority of MSM "why people are conspiracy theorist" articles. Do you truly believe what fox/Cnn/msnbc/vox/vice tells you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I deplore hidden knowledge. Maybe it didn't come across this way in my post, but I am trying to make people aware of this so it ISN"T secret knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can remember your initial comments, you immediately tried to disprove the significance of these programs. You literally said, don't worry about this. Dismissing it. I'm still so confused as to why?
      </p>
      <p>
       In no way are you injecting rationality, your blindly dismissing the severity of a secretive program and backing it up with Wikipedia and telling me not to worry about it? That's very shill like.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think i stroke my ego having "secret knowledge", you stroke the fuck out of your own ego by "injecting rationality".
      </p>
      <p>
       What conspiracies do you even think have truth to them? Do you believe the official 9/11 narrative? Do you believe they went to the moon? Do you believe rich people adhere to satanic philosophies?

       Geo-engineering will probably be the only way to save the species at this point. We've given up completely any real effort to limit carbon output, the mobsters with the gas stations took over the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are conflating two different things. Planes that fly sometimes create clouds. People want rain to fall because we have a whole lot of mouths to feed and natural and organic methods won't do the trick. Permaculture can't save the human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get me some peer-reviewed science on the bad effects of cloud seeding. I believe Flint still doesn't have clean water. I believe we went into Iraq under false pretenses and the US government covered up the war crimes it meant to commit and the ones it didn't. Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag. Foreign criminal organizations bought out US democracy. The rich don't need satan to be freaky evil sociopaths, but it makes for good theme parties.

       Just for the record. We do NOT get those trails here in Africa. I've literally never seen a "chemtrail" in real life. Furthermore, I remember when people first started noticing them in the 90's and how quickly it got worse.

       I've looked into some of these phenomena when I saw some of the square clouds pictures and the like. I personally wouldn't link a lot of them to chemtrails per se, alot seem more to me like HAARP is getting better at dialing in their experiments in upper atmospheric frequency testing and are able to more accurately produce artificial clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrails could very easily tie into that however if they needed to make a more "conductive" atmosphere to grasp control I guess if that's the reason behind it. I honestly have just never been a chemtrails guy, but I could see how it could be used.

       I think HAARP's geoengineering project and the government's/Harvard's project SOLAR SHIELD are two different things. HAARP is more about engineering weather whereas solar shield (chemtrails) is more about blocking UV rays/heat with aerosal metals to supply help to the failing ozone layer.

       That video is a great example to show how cloud seeding works. That video is probably the North Pacific test. I can post links for research cloud seeding experiments as well. Only they are well documented and are not what this thread is about. There’s no secrecy in these tests. There is no secrecy in the tests and efforts in the UAE to increase precipitation. In this case there is no conspiracy, it’s documented experiments for knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video does not show examples of chem trails only the science of cloud seeding, which is nothing new.

       And yet there isn’t any solid evidence presented here.

      <p>
       Why not?

      <p>
       Also wik - I already said I hadn’t looked for conspiracy evidence. But I have read several peer reviews to understand cloud seeding at a fundamental level.

       The cloud isn't new... the scientific classification of a particicular type of cloud is new.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an analogy - "new species" of animals are being found every year, but that doesn't mean those animals didn't exist 50 years ago ... it only means that scientists have only just found or classified them as a "new species".

       Nice try.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an insanely huge issue that should not be pushed under the rug due to other unfortunate issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all breathing, eating, and absorbing through our skin, silver iodide, a lethal substance. Because no one can openly talk about this, we have literally no idea the type of ecological and irreparable damage this action is causing on our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next thing you are going to tell me is its a necessary evil due to pollution. ha!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure you are a shill, but I hope you can think about this very clearly. A toxic chemical is being dispersed in our skies daily. THAT IS NOT OK. I don't need you to remind me that there is pollution from oil, and it doesn't for one fucking second negate my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can honestly go fuck yourself for even saying "stop worrying about this". How obvious can you be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others reading my post, please acknowledge this person, in a conspiracy theory subredit just said to me once he/she realized my argument was valid and irrefutable, told me to "stop worrying about this".
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't wait to follow your comments and see what agendas you are pushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers!
