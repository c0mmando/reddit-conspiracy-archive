        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about this, the current bible was not written by a primary source. At first, believe it was, but the church destroyed every original copy of the bible and made their own to increase their power.</p>

<p>This made manipulating the public very easily. Back then, anyone who questioned the integrity of the church or questioned Christianity itself would/could be tortured in horrific ways, scolded by other members of the public, they would suffer the lose all of their lands and often times even the accused&#39;s family would be harmed.</p>

<p>The Bible strongly defines morals that happens to give the church more power, money, control, while maintaining exponential spread at the same time. The church managed to not only combine itself, but take control of most of the governments of all the old world, or eastern half of the globe.</p>

<p>I mean, this is a pretty good deterrent if one wanted to question the church, break laws, or believe anything other than Christianity than this?
 Psalm 9:17 - &quot;The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.&quot;
The word &quot;nations&quot; in that quote from the bible refers to RACES OF PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Eternity in hell was much more of a deterrent to questioning/atheism than jail for life and torture.</p>

<p>The reason the church gained popularity so fast, I believe, is because as humans we always, always fear what we don&#39;t know. Our brain righteously considers the unknown to be a possible risk or danger. The Church provided answers to what we don&#39;t know about the world. They comforted our psychological fears, and provided the people with a common belief, therefore giving the sense of unity to the world.</p>

<p>When very, very intelligent people started questioning things that the church said because there was an apparent lack of evidence and reasoning, the church was not hesitant to silence those intelligent people. For if word of the churches mistakes and wrongs spread, they would lose their integrity. </p>

<p>Based on this evidence of the church&#39;s actions, I believe that the church demonstrated obvious intention to 
- Make money
- Gain as much power in the governments as they were able too.
- Promote, teach, and spread their definition of morals and &#39;laws&#39;.
- Deter the masses from questioning, believing differently, misbehaving against government laws, and committing actions against set morals and rules of the Bible.
- Manipulation and deception of the masses.</p>

<p>I am still surprised today that 31% of the population still is Christian, as the church and things taught in the Bible have not only been proven to be dishonest, deceiving, and manipulative, in EVERY BRANCH/offspring of Christianity, but a lot of what is taught in the Bible is just wrong. And then when you consider the corruption of the (old) Church... Also, the translations are very misinformative. What translations of the Bible should be is multiple of the most popular interpretations, and let the people decide what to interpret from sentences. But because the free decision of interpretation is not directly supported, we generally get ONE version of the endless interpretations.</p>

<p>So what do you all think? I will probably add to this as comments roll in. That is if they do anyway.</p>

<p>ps: I went to my grandma&#39;s church a couple weeks ago, and one of the educators was telling me why Jesus wrote the bible for me. Just kept nodding my head, while it kept hitting me over and over, this lady actually believes that Jesus Christ wrote the Bible. It&#39;s Awful... the lack of education while being a lifelong Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude!! I was discussing this with someone the other day!! I&#39;ve read books about this. The person/people(s) who wrote the Bible EVIDENTLY either had unique and rare interest in extraterrestrials and extraterrestrial spacecraft OR they had an encounter with one, which is presumably more likely than the first option. The Bible is LOADED with descriptions of contact with extraterrestrials...
all the way back to Eve claiming that grey humans impregnated her and took the child
To Abraham being abducted and going past other planets and the bible says that he visibly saw and passed other planets in our solar system and he stated that he just wanted to &quot;Return back to Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>What do you think about it? I do think there is for sure extraterrestrial involvement in the birth of Christianity... and not to seem like a nerd but I believe they also had to do with the creation of humans themselves. The amount of time that we would have taken to evolve from Homo-Erectus to Human should have been MILLIONS of years longer than evidence shows it did take, suggesting possible interference/modifications from extraterrestrials.  </p>

<p>I don’t doubt that something like that might very well have been the case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The “three wise men” and that bright ass “star of Bethlehem” were likely more than many of us are taught to believe.</p>

<p>I’m not familiar with those specific details, but I don’t doubt them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That much I <em>really</em> don’t doubt - as well as the birth and/or influencing of all other major religions on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and not to seem like a nerd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t sound like any more of a nerd than I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I believe they also had to do with the creation of humans themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say it seems to me they both go hand in hand.  It appears that certain ETs created a slave (humans) and they needed a means by which to keep that slave obedient - hence the creation of world religions as an effective, ubiquitous tool of indoctrination for this slave.  Sounds insane on the surface, but if one digs into the evidence, one begins to understand that this is where much of it is at least strongly pointing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The amount of time that we would have taken to evolve from Homo-Erectus to Human should have been MILLIONS of years longer than evidence shows it did take, suggesting possible interference/modifications from extraterrestrials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  The missing link between humans and our closest relative (the common and bonobo variants of the chimpanzee) is in all likelihood an ET hand manipulating chimpanzee genetics with their own genetics to create humans.</p>

<p>To be sure, however, humans cary <em>many</em> mutations and alterations in our genome that have been shown to have been all but impossible to have formed through natural evolution - i.e. it appears we were genetically tinkered with.  A lot.  It seems we’ve either been genetically tinkered and tampered with many times by <em>one</em> particular ET species, or many times by <em>many</em> different ET species throughout the millennia.</p>

<p>I’m betting on the latter.</p>

<p>A book in the 50s?  What book is that?  I don’t know what you’re talking about, honestly.  If you’re referring to Bramley’s book, then it has nothing to do with “the 50’s”.  It was published in 1989.</p>

After reading your response I looked it up again and see the first edition was released 1/1/89,and  that someone claiming to be sunlight publishing has been selling unauthorized editions of said book. 
     To respond to your second point, specifically, I have read a few posts by yourself on the conspiracy forum, specifically mentioning &quot;going down the rabbit hole&quot; followed by a link to this particular book.

<p>I think you may be right, and I will correct my post if so. I know there are different views and interpretations of hell. From my current understanding of the Bible, correct if wrong please, which I have studied lightly, there are multiple judgments and in judgments God wants Christians to understand the purpose of judgement is to promote and motivate godly living, and to create/increase trust in Christ as their personal savior.</p>

<p>BUT ---</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The doctrine of hell as a cosmic torture chamber was propounded by a number of prominent medieval thinkers, among them Augustine and Aquinas. This was widely accepted even for a lengthy amount of time after the mid-evil period.

</blockquote>

<p>There was a variety of different branches/offspring of Christianity back then, but, again please correct because I am not an expert at this at all and I would love to understand more thoroughly...</p>

<p>Did majority of Christians(during 400 AD – 1600 AD) hold the belief that hell was torture? And if so, when did this belief first start getting questioned/rejected?
Thank you for your time :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless, the book itself doesn’t teach about a hell or going to heaven for that matter. Most interpretations and traditions people follow now and more notably what probably influences your post, are traditions that were commonly found in pagan religions. Religions the Bible specifically warned against but as time went by, as humans do, they distort what originally was supposed to be. The Bible literally talks about that aspect of “false prophets” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. My post is talking about the organized corruption and purposeful manipulation by the Church in ABOUT 400 AD - 1500 AD. They mass manipulated entire states for their own power and money, and forced their beliefs onto people with the threat of torture worse than death and an eternity of after-death torture.</p>

<p>I think that religion and religious beliefs is completely based on the individual, I feel that Christianity is an outdated religion and it is completely different than what Jesus intended it to be, people used it for their own benefit and prosperity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree a bit as leaving religion or belief in it an open book. The paradox we all share is that there exist a truth but to completely figure that truth out the concept of faith is required. Faith being based on our interpretations of the only evidence we have available to us at our prospective eras(perceptual existence). Over time, religion became versions of what people did with the information available to them to explain this thing called life, naturally creating preference and conflict following.</p>

<p>With that said, as casually as it is, the semantics behind people being entitled “to believe as they please” has a lot to do with the aptitude in how we applaud respect toward one another’s freedom to think. What we forget is that despite differences in belief, we all mutually benefit from trying to figure out really what the truth is,collectively. Clearly, easier said then done especially when the dialogue should be so in-depth that the general questioning of another’s belief is highly encouraged as being the tool to tread the subject rather then dogmatic allegiance to something that logically can’t be proven but intensely speculated on. </p>

<p>It’s my belief, that it’s everyone’s collective responsibility to the world to first assess one’s own religion under absolute confidence that there is actually one answer and most likely what they believe specific to them has a high probability of actually being wrong. Once that’s understood, figuring out patterns and tying observations to what seems true as far as ancient text on psychology and overall philosophy, resembles accurate even in life scenarios today. They say language began and evolved from one place so religion is likely right along that same timeline. Working together, I think humanity would eventually crack through the distortion of beliefs passed along in time but it seems spiritually,we will never get there as a whole unless something so fucked up happens that makes “Unity” more a tool of survival. It makes the entire “end of the world” scenario one of the most interesting stories left to be witnessed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you dont know church folk. Theyre very simple and dont believe Jesus LITERALLY wrote the bible, they are just saying he is responsible for the bible--theyre his words and he caused the bible. Thats what simple, humble folk are like. They dont have to set things up perfectly because of grammar nazis on the internet.</p>

<p>The only thing I can glean from you is youre young and probably very lost in life. Ive been there. You think you know a lot, but really you know nothing beyond human concepts. The bible has a lot of absolute--*<em>absolute</em> truth i.e. truth from god. Lets even say god isnt real, the bible is a massive asset for understanding yourself and humanity. Lets say god is real, sadly it is, that means its a massive boon for anyone wanting to improve their life.</p>

<p>Hell is a real thing. Ive experienced parts of it--it is a depth of the soul so far from God. It is easy to say, well hell clearly isnt real. Its like when youre 7 and you think the world isnt that bad, until you accidentally wonder onto motherless and see some babyrape shit. I can tell you hell is a, technically, real thing that people create for themselves.</p>

<p>I think youre probably relatively young and maybe dont know a lot, or not as much as you think you do. Religion held power, for some good reasons (people dont just believe in the bible because muh hell, go on the street and ask them what their real reasoning for it is--a lot of the times it is fear of hell, and a lot of cases it isnt, its not that black and white) such as the truth in the bible of gods love which can be felt and experienced, gods creation, the good things etc, but also from fear from factions. </p>

<p>But trying to act like its one uniform group when factions, versions and differing nation states of christianity have been competing with each other throughout life is absurd. Christianity has control not because christianity sought control, Christianity has control because God sits at the top of most peoples priorities and Christianity has some good answers to that. Its like thinking there is a conspiracy by supermarkets to make money because they use food--not the fact that people need food, like people need and especially want spiritual guidance and knowledge, and deep down to learn about the world.</p>

<p>tbf I used to be young and think like you, then I actually went out of my way to understand it more than just criticize it. Youll find the answers if you look in the write place.</p>

<p>God speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way yes in other no.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of things in the bible that was modified like the mind-control Pharaoh, the number of the beast, the reasons behind some of YHVH actions.</p>

<p>But a lot of things not only continue the same but even other&#39;s religious text&#39;s have similar believe, Hell, the 7 sins, angels, god, temptation and Satan.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s surely things modified in the bible but there&#39;s a lot that not only can fit well with a lot of believes, it also make sense.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s the &quot;non-canon&quot; text both in Judaism and Christianity, some even taking from older text that&#39;s the one present that are retired from some reason that you probably know, like the reason of the flood, you will not go to hell just for not believe in Jesus and Satan corruption in religious secret places.</p>

<p>But all in all, i honestly think that the bible is really interesting and as a lot of good lessons and teachings, and Christianity is not really a bad thing, I know a lot of people that are Christian and are good persons</p>

The point I am trying to make is the manipulation of the general population that was caused by the people who controlled Christianity. You know, Believe in God or be tortured and slain, if your a jew we burn you alive at the stake, etc. They convinced people that they had the &quot;God given right&quot; to control the government and control land and a lot of the economy.</p>

<p>The thing is that the church in the middle ages never let any kind of other interpretations to the public just themselves, which made a box in people mind of how things is.</p>

<p>One example is &quot;You shall have no God before me&quot; that could be put as you shouldn&#39;t have any gods other than me or you shouldn&#39;t have any god higher than me, the priests just decide to use what they thought that are the best for the use, also is important to notice Jesus Christ actually saw people that use religion to get what they want and trashed they temple&#39;s</p>

Lucifer has deceived all you gentile, and you do stupid things like give Gods glory to Satan or the devil. Just like Job said if you only accept good from God and not evil then you are not he chosen. Gentiles don’t have a soul. Only the original line of Adam and Eve has the breath of life and they ate freely from the tree of life. Your people didn’t. So there is no afterlife. No Hell. You never going to heaven so i suggest you make the best out of the life you have now. Because that is all God is going to give you. He doesn’t hear you prayers, you’re not a Levite.

All gentiles have to do to get their blessing is to bless the Levite Priest. But the priesthood has been destroyed by God because we are being punished. God has cursed us.

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like a lot of New Testament doctrine. </p>

<p>Well my ancestors were priest and led Israel into idolatry and other abominations. God warned Abraham and Moses that their people will once again be taken back into Egypt which really means the house of bondage for 400 years by ship. (Deuteronomy 28) You can look at the US dollar and all the obelisks to understand America is Egypt. There are many curses like God will take stool and put it in our mouth. Everything we eat in this country has pork and is fertilized  with shit.  Our women are cursed with abnormal body shapes and their hair will be short and nappy. We are cursed to be killed in the streets but will find no justice in the courts. We will have no wealth and power. We are given unto our enemies. Understand that not all black people in America are hebrew. In fact God has stated that we are numbered in the thousands not millions. But since no one knows who is Hebrew anyone with dark skin is universally hated. God delights in punishing us. I never understood why I had such bad luck. Even I am successful something comes out of nowhere and brings me down to naught. God gave me multiple cancers, i’ve had multiple amputations and surgeries. And it was because i use to be in idolatry. I use to give Jesus all of God’s glory. God is not who the Romans tried to make us believe. He is terrible and merciful.   </p>

<p>God is going to send Elijah down here to show the gentiles who the Lord is. We are going to be rescued from our captivity and brought back to Israel. The government even has a bill that went into law to commentate the 400 years of captivity in 2019, they are going to give us gold and release us just like the first time we left Egypt. The end of the captivity is good for the world. Soon if you want to have your sin forgiven you can provide a Levite with a animal
sacrifice. If you want to get your blessing a Levite will be able to pray to God on your behalf. God only hears his priest, prophets, and kings. Not even other Hebrews can pray directly to God. There will be no more lies. No more of a small group of nephiliana controlling your life. You don’t have to worship God. If you are a gentile it’s a choice. If you are a Hebrew and worship other gods you will be put to death. There will be no more religion because it’s a waste of time. And you don’t have to do anything. No fighting. No protesting or marching. God is going to do everything.  Our slavemasters know this. They are getting ready to hide underground in their hidden cities. And God is going to pull them out like worms. God is going to also show the world what he did to his priest. And people will marvel in fear. This world is evil. Science is magic and their are constantly casting spells and curses on us by the things we watch, read, and eat. God is an extraterrestrial. The world tries to hide the existence of God because he makes them. All the atrocities like school shooting, war, natural disasters are judgements that God is carrying out on the world.  His face is turned from us right now. That is why you can turn on the TV and see Hebrews shot on the streets and our place in society is at the tail of a dog. God is terrible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would probably be helpful in your quest to condemn Catholic history if you were to begin by...studying Catholic history. Have you done so?</p>

<p>&quot;Back then, anyone who questioned the integrity of the church or questioned Christianity itself would/could be tortured in horrific ways, scolded by other members of the public, they would suffer the lose all of their lands and often times even the accused&#39;s family would be harmed.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;Back then&#39; Christians were persecuted and hunted. Not until Emperor Constantine were they even allowed to practice their religion. After he converted the social mores of the Empire may have remained largely the same even though the populace was converting. Should it strike you as strange that an Empire built on conquest would continue to employ its various control tactics? That would have remained so regardless of which (or any) religion the Emperor adopted.</p>

<p>Also, where is your source on the church having destroyed all primary documents?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Middle Ages the Catholic Church ran the biggest scam in history. </p>

<p>The church sold indulgences, which basically meant you paid them money and god would forgive your sins. This translated into the more money you give the church, the better your chance of going to heaven. This was a big deal back then because heaven and hell weren’t theoretical, it was absolute fact. Because everyone wants to get into heaven pretty much everyone, rich and poor, gave the church money. As a result, the church and clergy became infinitely rich. </p>

<p>If you know anything about the bible, this is pretty much anathema to everything Jesus taught. But they got away with it because the controlled information: the bible could only be written in Latin. Who could read Latin? The clergy. Who couldn’t read Latin? Everyone else. </p>

<p>Every so often a member of the clergy with morals would speak out against the church and their greed. They were branded heretics and killed. That changed with the invention of the printing press. When Martin Luther called the church out, the printing press allowed the bible to be cheaply and quickly printed into local languages. When people could read about Jesus themselves they realised it was a scam, and turned away from the church: Protestantism was born. </p>

<p>Tl;dr the Catholic Church ran the biggest, most successful scam in history. </p>

In researching sources for this post because I realized they are important, I saw that it is impossible to know how much wealth the church had because they were so rich. I do know about the Bible I&#39;ve studied it moderately. They mocked Jesus and his teachings and they silenced anyone who dare be a heretic and tell them to stop. </p>

<p>To me it&#39;s mind blowing that even the clergy were killed by the church, it really shows how much power they have and how money was always over human lives. The Ottoman empire rejected printing presses... </p>

<p>even after all of this our Pope is still one of the most powerful people on earth... mind boggling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our religions were written by someone long ago, people started following them, same as a cult, then groups splintered off, started their own version of it, then people split from them, starting their own version, so on and so on. We are where we are now. People need this to be real so they have something to believe in outside of their lives. I think it is a good and bad thing. I think it keeps people somewhat grounded in this life but it doesn&#39;t help as much as we need, right now. People aren&#39;t doing good for this life, they are doing good for the afterlife. If people lived for the now, instead of the future, I think our lives and planet would be completely different. I&#39;m talking about Christianity and Islam since those are the 2 biggest and most similar. Like how Islam terrorists use <em>their</em> version of the Koran as justification for killing people. They use violence to make their afterlife better. Christians do the same things, not blowing themselves up the regular, but they don&#39;t really do good deeds to help mankind/humanity, they do it for selfish reasons, like getting into heaven. </p>

I think religion can be good, but you are right. It kind of slows an individuals progress in life because they are so concerned about what&#39;s after. It kind of sets boundaries that a person can live their life with and be okay, it&#39;s comforting to think that you have God that always loves you and he&#39;s always there for you. And theres always a pastor and such. Im not Christian but I can definitely see how that can me comforting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was first awaken I had dreams of spaceships, giants, dragons just wrecking the world. I use to pray until i cried blood for God to spare gentiles that I considered innocent. God responded by breaking my neck. It just stopped hurting recently. There is nothing we can do to stay Gods hand. That was so hard for me to accept. We are just worms to him. </p>

<p>God enjoys killing as much as he does saving. He said so in the OT. The only thing i could do is try to follow all his commandments to the best of my ability. Like I stop eating forbidden food like pork, shrimp, lobster, etc... but the FDA allows pork into nearly everything we consume even Jello. I observe the sabbath from Friday sundown until Saturday sundown but if my work makes me come in, i have no choice. You just have to try your best to not do evil in the eyes of the Lord. But what is evil is consider good in this world. Like Jesus teaching to not chastise your brother if he doesn’t eat meat. Which by today’s standards sounds good and right. However God commanded his priest to keep the passover and eat the lamb every year. Even though something sounds good in the eyes of God it is not. I was hesitate about things like sacrificing animals until i understood why that is required. And it could change your perspective of God if you knew why the smell of burning animal fat is pleasing to him. Don’t trust in anything from man. Not his religion. His philosophy. Even his science. The first slave ship came in 1619 and it was called the Good Ship Jesus. I don’t know the date but everything God does is exact so I believe full disclosure next year. And when people realize that God has been ruling this world, it will change so many things about the way we perceive life. God is high technology. The things we marvel at like the newest iphone or A.I. is nothing compared to what the watchers have. Watchers are cloaked and are always around us. Sometimes you may glimpse them if certain atmospheric conditions are met or you are spiritually powerful. We call them ghost, aliens, vampires, demons, etc... </p>

</blockquote>
