        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the toughest lessons for me when I first got into researching and discussing conspiracy theories was this:</p>

<p><strong>Most people do not actually read books any more.</strong></p>

<p>I would bring up great novels like 1984, and people would say basic stuff which <em>gave the impression</em> that they had read the book, but upon digging deeper, I soon realised that they had not actually read the book.</p>

<p>Maybe they saw the movie, maybe they read the first chapter back in high school, but on almost every occasion, no, they had not read the book.</p>

<p>This explains why so few people seem to be aware of the many, many red pills which Orwell dropped in 1984.</p>

<p>One of my favourites is what he had to say about the bones of ancient creatures:</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.”</p>

<p>When were dinosaurs discovered? The nineteenth century. Look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen">Sir Richard Owen</a> and see who coined the term &#39;dinosaur&#39;.</p>

<p>If any of what I wrote above makes sense to you, then I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHWFkZDSHF0">this short video</a>.</p>

<p>If what I have written seems too &#39;out there&#39; to you right now, that is okay. As Orwell explains, the proles are not meant to understand.</p>

<p>This seems like a contradiction to me.</p>

<p>You say that we could not determine if what he was saying was true or false, and then say that he was mixing both. How can these two claims go together?</p>

<p>Either we can assess the truth of O&#39;Brien&#39;s claims or we cannot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great book and everyone should read it, but if one of your major takeaways was that Orwell was dropping &quot;red pills&quot; about dinosaurs then...I don&#39;t know.  I think you may have actually missed the point of what was actually happening in that scene.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That scene of the book is when O Brien is literally breaking down Winston&#39;s mind, his ability to question anything other than what the party says is truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about human perception and the ability of those in power to shape reality.  Even if Winston dug up a dinosaur bone with his own hands, even if he found an actual dinosaur egg and raised it to hatch and a baby velociraptor came out it, it wouldn&#39;t be real unless the Party said it was real.  </p>

<p>If he spoke about about what he saw, the party could smear his reputation.  If he wrote about it, they could track down every page and destroy it. Even pictures could be doctored.  Lives could be erased.  The party could alter perception and control reality so much that eventually, Winston would come to KNOW, for an absolute certainty, that 2+2= 5.</p>

<p>That passage isn&#39;t about dinosaurs anymore than it&#39;s about specks of dust or planets mentioned in the previous paragraphs.  It&#39;s about being able to shape what people think.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite part about mathematics, music, frequency, etc is that they transcend human creation. For example, we didn&#39;t invent the chords within music. We discovered that there are certain sounds and tones that when played together, for some magical reason, sound beautiful and pleasing to the ear. On the other hand, other combinations create dissonance and an unpleasantness. </p>

<p>Another example is the constant Pi. It&#39;s fascinating because there are super computers that work 24/7 crunching data and running calculations to continue discovering MORE numerals of Pi to this very day. We didn&#39;t select the number that Pi is, mathematicians found it, and it&#39;s woven into the very nature and design of our reality.</p>

<p>There is order in the chaos, and we certainly didn&#39;t put it there, we found it.</p>

<p>Most of his evidence is either a) he does not understand the basic math or phsyics b) he has not seen it in person c) anything not from the period is not a primary source but since he does not believe our dating techniques, then nothing can be a primary source so anything in the past, history, paleontology, archaeology, cosmology are all fake. d)  Experiments don&#39;t seem likely (his main issue with Cavenidish).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny how the horseshoe theory works... fundamentalist christians who believe the world was created in 7 days believe some combination of:
1) god or satan planted fossils to test us
2) that our dating techniques are wrong and these fossils are from the great flood
3) that paleontologist basically craft or sculpt fossils out of stone. </p>

<p>Step2thejep, who describes himself as the &quot;world&#39;s greatest skeptic&quot; believes:
1) That fossils are faked
2) Our dating techniques are fake or wrong
3) That paleontoligst plant fossils to deceive us</p>

<p>I guess both are forms of ignorance so to end up in similar places actually makes sense...</p>

<p>Just like I have a feeling a lot of people who believe god made earth in 7 days also disagree with human history, evolution, and archeology, cosmology, etc...</p>

<p>Same way step2thejep does not believe in any of those things...  although he does see 1989 videos of hulk hogan as predicting 9/11, and back to the future predicting 9/11, and clearly a passage from one of orwells books supports his theories and clearly modern education is out to make people dumb and compliant... you know because step2thejep can easily see through all of sciences ruses without any really understanding of the theories.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I presume, or rather, pretty sure, microscopy and other analysis can distinguish scratches from fossils. Amber fossils also seem to match up with the rock fossils. Definitely when it comes to skin, bones, organs etc the likely hood of intact or even any preservation is low. </p>

<p>But even if you take out western style trained paleontologist&#39;s discoveries you are still left with the fossils people find all the time in certain places or that are dug up and sold as dragon bones in eastern medicine. </p>

<p>Many of these fossils were discovered before people understood enough to really accurately or logically fake these fossils and hence you get a fossil record that while imperfect, largely makes sense from an evolutionary stand point...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US and the west are more in a Brave New World scenario where the world is controlled by dopamine instead of fear.  We still have surveillance of 1984 but we love to buy the spy devices and use them.  There are really only two sources of control over others:  Love and Fear.  Both are different.  Love (Brave New World) will keep you coming back and addicted to the status quo so that you consistently feed into it.  Fear (1984) makes you afraid to speak out against the status quo as you will be severely punished if you don&#39;t follow. Both are needed at specific times and in different places.  The US for example basically has it so that if you cannot be ruled by love then you will go to a place that will rule you by fear.  It is different in the Russia place where you are probably from.  Putin is a man to be feared along with those in his regime.  China too is more so ruled by fear in that their society now has a ranking system that can hinder your traveling.  </p>

<p>Dinosaurs are the remnants of the ice age.  What happened is that they shifted into birds as the more desireable traits due to food shortage, cold temperatures, etc were to shift to warm blooded, beaks (so that they could scrape the ground for seeds, worms, bugs, etc), and a smaller size.  Any time you have a shift in the entire global climate, you will see a shift in the natural selection of a species.  </p>

<p>Bones are millions of years old, very fragile. Even brushing dirt off of the bones runs the risk of damage and disintegration. In what scientist will do is find a bone, get its specifications, and then recreate that using casting and thats what you see in museums. Its not because the bones don&#39;t exist, its because they are far too fragile to place in public display. </p>
