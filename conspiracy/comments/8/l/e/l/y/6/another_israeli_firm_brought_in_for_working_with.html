    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you, there is one key difference between 2001 and 2018.</p>

<p>Back in 2001, the Pentagon/CIA didn&#39;t have 10 illegal bases in Syria, where US soldiers, oops I mean &quot;advisers&quot;, defend a front-line to carve out a safe space umbrella for terrorists like ISIS, oops I mean &quot;moderate rebels&quot;, who then attack the forces of the legally elected head of Syria in order to pull off Langley&#39;s coup, all as a favor to Zion, which threatens imminent nuclear WW3 because Russia is a legally invited guest of Syria to defend Syria, while the US is 100% in the wrong as an illegal invader, and it&#39;s only a matter of time until some accident pits US forces directly against Russian forces and then the powder keg blows, making 
the quicksand mutual defense treaties of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in WW1 look like school boys lighting firecrackers.</p>

<p>Playing slalom with nuclear WW3 over some shitty corner of irrelevant desert is all on Trump. As Commander in Chief all he&#39;d have to do is say &quot;GTFO&quot; and the Pentagon would exit Syria faster than a CH-53 taking off from the US Embassy rooftop in the Fall of Saigon.</p>

<p>But Trump ain&#39;t doing that. Trump wants to stay in Syria because every US President gets to start their own war instead of ending their predecessor&#39;s wars, and so Trump wants his ruin to to be Syria.</p>

<p>&quot;The more things change...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your second paragraph. </p>

<p>Regarding after that, instead of GTFO he ass blasted Isis, stopped arming and paying them, the white helmets, is trying to bring a coalition of middle eastern countries to police thier own nieghbour hood and more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the MSM, picking and choosing “colluders” like Saudi Arabia or Israel isn’t relevant, however any connection with a Russian or the Russian government is immediate, collusion, treason, criminal activity, etc. Those pesky Russians meddling about, it’s like a fucking scooby doo episode. I’m all for prosecuting illegal activity with anyone, including Russia. However, this has become an obvious witch hunt. I’m more of a Secular Talk and Jimmy Dore style progressive, for caveat. Don’t support Trump 99% of the time, but if you look back on how the whole Russian investigation started it’s very easy to see it was a ploy and diversion from addressing why Hilary lost. One of the most damming things is, Hilary’s team did a internal poll seeing what was the most disliked thing about her and it was the Uranium One scandal and their Russian connections, so they flip it around and with their connections to intelligence and the media and they seeded this narrative. Straight out of John Podestas playbook, he helped usher in this narrative. People can’t seem to look back and see how this started and give perspective on the whole ordeal. Of course if you go looking through any politician or elite, you’re going to find illegal activity, corruption, bribes, etc. Income the Trump apologist labels and deflection. Before that know it’s been almost two years and we’ve got some trolls and liars. Russian  collusion conspiracy theories are now widely accepted because of the propaganda and mind seeding of this topic. All in all a total deflection of how the system gave us Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main group of election fixers that are being protected are Republicans. They&#39;ve been routinely cheating on elections since they stole the White House in 2000. That one was very much in our faces. They are trying desperately to memory hole it. One way to do that is to rehabilitate the reputation of George W. Bush as someone with &quot;humanity&quot; compared to Donald Trump. Democrats seem to be buying into this revisionism. </p>

<p>The TV fills with Donald Trump scandals all day long and talks about little else. This benefits Donald Trump by increasing the amount of outrage in society and making people believe that all these charges flying around are equal. This discourages the majority who want Donald Trump out from taking action. People have been polarized for the most part on the DJT scandals, so who are they trying to convince? Today, the House passed a partial repeal of banking regulations. Could they find room on the TV to discuss that?</p>

<p>What you actually mean is that you read a bias article about a republican lobbyist and you fell for the bias spin of the article. You have to realize there are thousands of lobbyists in this country. Trump is not directly responsible for every single one.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8l4d0x/ap_report_trump_fundraisers_found_to_be_working/dzd827x/">https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8l4d0x/ap_report_trump_fundraisers_found_to_be_working/dzd827x/</a></p>
