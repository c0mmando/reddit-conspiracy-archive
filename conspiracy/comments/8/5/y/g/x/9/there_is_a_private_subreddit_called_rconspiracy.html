       Thanks. Who is in control of that community and why was it created? What gets discussed there? Are moderation decisions being discussed there and are non moderators of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       participating in those discussions?

       From my view, it's a community of core members invited in by the mod team (I have no idea how we were chosen) to try to find solutions to some of the problems facing the sub. There are discussions about things that can be done to try to bring it back to it's roots pre-2016 election hysteria.

       I have lobbied for an open forum where any conspiracy can be discussed in a CIVIL manner.

       If I described that subreddit as a secret cabal of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posters that are actively targeting people on here with opposing political views and formulating rules specifically meant to silence those posters, would that be a fairly accurate description in your personal opinion?

       You mean like the 800+ anti-trump subs that do just that?  Or how about TMOR who just hates all Conspiracy talk in general and also happens to be anti-trump?

       I'd assume there's a greater likelihood of non-Reddit hangouts on Discord or IRC, among other places.  Of course, this goes for all interested parties and not just the TMOR types because other groups have an interest in disrupting places like this to push their own agenda.  During the 2016 election I would periodically watch accounts that caught my interest and look at their comments for a couple days.  A few times I found people talking about heading to other sites to coordinate their memes and messages, and I'm guessing it didn't stop after November of that year.

       What does that have to do with creating a secret cabal to target posters who have a different political leaning or believe conspiracies you personally don't believe in? Censoring opposing viewpoints is pure intellectual cowardice.

       Yes, exactly, and the concern is that a great number of users can't handle that. We don't want this place to become just like everywhere else. There are a number of conspiracy theories which vindicate Donald Trump and those are allowed to be discussed here just as much as Trump/Russian collusion.

       Was that "pro-Russia"? What are you getting at?

      <p>
       I happen to believe that the Russia stuff is way overblown. I've been around awhile and I've seen a lot of "enemies" come and go and, in hindsight, it wasn't what the press led us to believe. I lean that way this time, too.

       Please don't twist my words. It seems like you are trying for some "gotcha" here for a "win" and that isn't honest discussion in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissing a theory of any kind is acceptable. The trouble lies when it becomes an absolute battle of insults and dishonest discourse. It isn't exchanging ideas, exploring a different point of view, looking at it from another angle like it should be. It is flinging shit until you feel like you won a battle of verbal trickery.

       I'd be more inclined to believe politics aren't involved if any of the users who support Trump and violate rules or whatever else had made it on the list as well. But as far as I can tell that's not the case.

       Again, it's not about political views. You can discuss anything you want here. But there are apolitical aspects of behavior which are abhorrent to this community.

       Then why is it only people who support a certain theory who made it on the list? If it was apolitical don't you think at least one person who is a Trump supporter or doesn't believe in the theory would make it on that list?

       Definitely not the case. I was invited and have access to the sub and it's really no big conspiracy. It's simply a place where users discuss how to deal with the overarching problems that plague this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically, there are plenty of people on both sides. I can absolutely assure you that it's not filled with "Trunp-supporters", as I feel many are trying to imply. I myself am not a Trump supporter in the least, but to be fair I'm not a supporter of either main political party.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely nohing sinister going on there, but I do agree that the name "conclave" may have an ominous ring to it. But nope, I haven't seen anything there that could be dubbed as a "conspiracy" against this main sub, the opposite really, it's more like a place to help make the sub better and not more filled with crappy partisan politics.

       I would definitely not say the purge list is related to any political leanings. Heck, even the screenshot you posted implies that Trump is not the issue here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is simply the case that this sub has been overhwelmed with users that are parroting MSM talking points. Whether these points are left or right leaning. This sub should be a place to discuss alternative views to mainstream events, thus I see no point in having threads here that actively support mainstream views. Whether the alternative theories are true or not (depends on the case of course), this sub should be the place to discuss them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't supoort a "purge list" personally, but something should be done about the influx of users that are unable to entertain any thought that is not part of the mainstream narrative. We have plenty of other subs for that, conspiracy should remain a place for discussions on alternative viewpoints, both those that appear less and those that appear more fringe.

       You're pretty much advocating for thought police, you understand that right? It's okay if people disagree, in fact disagreements are healthy provided they don't turn personal. Hiding from them or worse setting up a secret sub to create lists of people who don't subscribe to your chosen MSM narrative is pure intellectual cowardice.

       Did I ever say the deep state is out to get Trump? The deep state is its own law and is behind any president that is in charge. One way or another, the deep-state calls (or at least tries to) call the shots, regardless of who is president. It is up the people to wake up and see this, the change must fundamentally come from the bottom up, not the top down. Thus politics is not the answer in my opinion. That is my perspective on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I am not advocating thought police whatsoever. I think all viewpoints and opinions should be respected. That is why I said that a purge list is not the answer, if you re-read my post. However, I said that this sub has been swamped with people that parrot MSM talking points, whether they are related to Trump or not (I don't see why insistance on bringing up Trump anyway, he doesn't really have any power, a president is always mainly a figurehead). I don't think this actually helps discussion and I think that people with any viewpoint should be able to explain themselves better and listen to each-other's viewpoints in a well-mannered fashion, without ad-hominem attacks and sliding the conversation off topic, making a non political topic political....etc. all of which often happens on this sub.

       That was one user from that sub (that created a list) and is not representative of that sub as a whole. I have created and endorsed no lists and the majority there hasn't as well. It's not a group with any unified "agenda", it's simply users discussing how to make this sub better. And one user thought the way to do this is to expose those who he thinks are being provocative. But that doesn't mean everyone there or even the majority feels that way. I myself don't even know half the users on those supposed "shill-lists". As said, it's just one user's perspective.

       The reason the group is closed is in order to prevent brigading from anyone wishing to subvert this sub and that one as well. Shills, provocateurs, trolls....abound on Reddit these days, that is why the sub is closed.

       I agree with banning abusive users and those here not contributing to discussions in a civil manner. I'm a centrist both "sides" annoy me, but I wouldn't say ban them.

       I've never seen an issue with you and have no problem standing up for you as a user.  With that said, TMOR are using a user's comment to build the idea that the mods endorse that list and are going to ban those users.  I personally don't agree with banning people unless they brake the rules, even if I don't agree with them (Shit I could even be wrong with my point of view and have been at times).  With that said, I wouldn't be to concerned and please feel free to hit me up if you ever have a issue and would love to help.

       My biggest question was who tf was that person making lists, since I don’t recognize their name. Some regular seemed to agree with them, but obviously the screens don’t show much discussion about each individual, and of course don’t allow for us to respond or defend ourselves there.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal belief is that paid shills obviously exist, but that we have no way of knowing for sure or proving any one user is one. The best we can do, IMO, is raise the standards of discourse and track alts based on writing style and some other patterns. Thanks yo!

       Maybe bc I wasn’t around for a bit. Also i think some people were under the impression I was creating sockpuppet... false flags, I guess? But you couldn’t pay me to do what some of these crazies do. Tens of alts, obsessed with reddit 24/7.

       What's your opinion on the scope of the TMOR problem? I know often times I'll see the mods talking about them crosslinking and brigading when the posts have very few upvotes. Regardless of the low amount of upvotes, it seems that it is treated like they're influence is massive and I know it worries me that they could be used as a scapegoat to block out dissenting discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in this thread I can see flytape responding to another user asking about the sub and saying they're not entitled to the happenings of the sub, and then telling them to go back to TMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just know from my perspective seeing TMOR being blamed for everything and suddenly having a secret group of conspiracy users to fight it and help change the direction of the sub just feels fishy. Especially when as I said above, we can see members of the community, flytape in particular, gatekeeping and talking down to those that are questioning the decision

       You can check their sub right now and see their "declaration of war". The number of comments in an X-post
       <em>
        there
       </em>
       is not necessarily evidence that their alts are not
       <em>
        here
       </em>

       Where do you see a declaration of war? I just took a look over there and don't see anything regarding that. My concern is just that it looks like scapegoating that is leading to a community deciding how they want things to change in a non-transparent way. I know I hadn't heard of the conclave until the new mod announcements were made, and it seems that was the case for many others in here as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just know from my perspective a conspiracy community should not have a shadow group working behind the scenes to think of how to push the community in the way they want. It may seem useful for countering shilling, but shouldn't one of the goals of this community be to act transparently?

       As for the Conclave sub, I feel it is necessary to discuss what is working here and what isn't in a constructive manner without a bunch of arguments. We've tried it here before and it was a disaster.

       Is this the only comment you feel like replying to, in this entire post? As someone who's listed as one of those - what is it you and your friends called them? Persona non grata? As a "PNG", I'd really like to know more about why I, among other members here, have been singled out as, essentially, needing to be banned for my beliefs - and why you mods are collecting such names in the first place.

       I'm asking you as a mod here, not an individual poster. Why are mods collecting such names to begin with? Why does it seem like the names collected all have a specific (and unpopular with the mods) political slant? What's going to happen to these "PNGs"? Why do you think it's okay to publicly complain about censorship and elite groups secretly controlling and ruling the population, while essentially doing your own version of censorship through just that?

       A few of us only went to the TMOR post because we were pinged to inform us of the discussion regarding our tags elsewhere (the conclave post) that we could not see. I am not a part of any war or do I care to be in one.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being named (and accused of being another alt, which I am not btw) as a MSM shill is just crazy. I participate in political conspiracies because that is what I am passionate about. I read through just about everything posted in r/con but I refrain from commenting on those threads because I don't have enough information to feel comfortable adding to the discussions. If it has to do with flying or tech I may jump in as I was a military aviator and currently an program engineer that has worked developing consumer products for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am left leaning for sure but not a democrat or republican at all. I am very concerned about corporate dominance and the loss of personal freedoms more than anything so that's what attracts my attention. And yes I am a firm believer that Trump is a part of that group and should be scrutinized to the fullest.

       That's fair. My main concern right now is civility. There is no reason that conspiracy theorists of different leans can't coexist

       at how shitty people are to each other around here. They twist words, call names, act like every discussion is some debate to win with snark and technicalities. It is disheartening.

       I don't disagree the name calling happens form all sides and should be minimized. The extremes definitely make it difficult to want to participate, if you jump in you are likely to get slammed (from one or both sides) and that sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think timed mutes are better than bans. If someone is a repeat offender then maybe it goes to the next level. Everyone is guilty of getting heated and quick with the keyboard now and then. Banning folks should be a last resort and only if there is a real violation (threats, doxxing, etc.) - censorship is never the answer.

       Does TMoR come here and vote on threads? Yes. How many do or to what extent is up for debate depending on who you talk to.

       My view is they can be annoying and they can be disruptive. They also do target certain users over and over again. They aren't as innocent as they claim to be, but at the same time, they are not the biggest source of our problems.

       I can definitely respect that opinion because I feel similarly as well. I know you can clearly see them targeting specific users such as AP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of curiosity then, what do you consider to be one of the larger sources of problems? Or would it be the sort of thing that it's a general bad feeling about the direction of things rather than a more specific entity?

       I would agree with that as well. I tend to lurk more than comment or post anything and I always see people going and just implying anyone they disagree with is a shill. Sorta like they chose to etch their opinion in stone rather than write in a mutable manner, and I think that leads to it feeling more like people are fighting to try and force others to see their opinion as correct.

       I think you also need to consider the fact that r/conspiracy still has a modicum of free speech that being "a bunch of tinfoil hats on the lunatic fringe", as we are generally depicted to be elsewhere, would only give us even more attention and credibility if any serious efforts were ever made to try and limit or curtail that freedom of speech that still happens to exist here, but has been eliminated in increasingly more places throughout Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've become something of a catch-all for people with something they think is important to say with no other place to say it, simply for the sake and relief of getting some others to see and acknowledge it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may not be conspiracy related in any obvious or direct way but we can't say that some of them aren't important or that there isn't some value in us being made aware of them, all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was certainly some kind of a conspiracy to close down many of the subs some of those posters used to use or suffered changes to their rules that now prevent them from speaking openly about certain controversial topics they never had any trouble doing before and I think we need to understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think this sub actually has gained far more credibility and opened more minds than anyone appreciates. The amount of organised trolling and brigading on certain topics is a testament to that and that someone certainly thinks or is worried that we're getting too close to the truth for their own with enough eyes on what gets posted about it for them to need to do that.

       That's good to hear.  There would likely need to be some kind of consensus reached regarding what tags to use and there might be disagreements over what topics fit in which tags, but it could be workable.  Maybe if enough users start doing it on their own it will show whether or not it's effective.

       I'm not opposed, but I could see it getting overly contentious to the point of unworkable. If the end result is people being able to see the content they want here, and therefore spending more time contributing to what they're knowledgeable and passionate about, then I'm all for ti.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the end result is just extra complaining about the wrong flair being added, and sliding away from the actual topic at hand, then I'm not for it. It's certainly worth exploring.

       On a more general point, as a mod I have no problem with people criticizing me or the mod team for decisions we make. Sometimes we get things wrong, and we do bring our own biases to the table that can be hard to fully separate from our mod duties. My issue in general is that excessive criticism of the mod team or the sub
       <em>
        in conversations about specific conspiracy theories
       </em>
       does often have the effect, if not the intent, or sliding discussion.

       I get that a private sub is private but a public sub should be public. Not only that it seems wrong for a group to just arbitrarily drop names accusing them of being shills without letting the person know what is up. At least let them defend themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that I think that if a sub suppresses and bans posters that they do not agree with they just give Reddit more ammunition to do the same in kind with the various troublesome (from their pov) subs. If Reddit doesn't like r/con because they don't conform they can just ban the sub. Yes I know they do that under the T&amp;Cs when they want to but I am advocating that that is just as big a violation of free speech as it is for a mod to ban a 'dissenter' and it's worth noting that a dissenting opinion is not bad and should be used to strengthen your argument if at all possible.

       The same bad actors show up every time the mods try to do anything to better the community.  That's why they set up the conclave, as a barrier between the insanity of constantly being brigaded by TMOR and other shit hole subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       These bad actors like to pretend like they give a shit about what's best for Conspiracy when all they actually do is try to disrupt and destroy every attempt to improve the community.  You might have noticed a few of them around, they show up in every mod announcement or community outreach post to complain, they are never happy with anything, they rarely discuss conspiracies and always obsessively debunk them... Except for one Conspiracy, the orangraged Cheeto monster Conspiracy being pushed by the MSM and deep state empire.

       When I was unfairly banned from this sub, along with 12 other users during the same thread, I found out about it from a TMOR PM.  So I hopped over there, for the first time ever, to discuss what happened, because obviously I couldn't post here.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I messaged the mods to ask for a reversal of the unfair ban, I was blamed by the mods for being a part of TMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the mod who banned me caught enough hell to unban all of us from that thread.  So stupid.

       Submission statements and account age limits are two things that have been agreed upon to be implemented there. The ideas for that came earlier, but it was there where it was finally decided to take action and try to make this sub a more pleasant place again, where people can discuss any conspiracy without getting assaulted by people wanting to troll and harass them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think both measures were pretty successful, but still more should be done in order for this place to become a space where people respect each-other and all the varying opinions. That would be my vision of it, at least.

       So will that be part of the new rules that will be targeted at censoring the posters that get added to your private shill list? No one is allowed to be interested in just one conspiracy? Honestly I don't know how effective that would be with your planned stifling of all dissenting opinion. For instance, I also believe in aliens so you wouldn't be able to silence me with that rule. Maybe you guys should invite some of us posters you've already secretly labeled as shills to your little circlejerk for a focus group? We can help you create a solid set of rules that will help you ban us all.

       The problem is not the particular conspiracy theory, the problem is people relentlessly shitting on anyone who dares to consider the alternative (i.e. non-mainstream) narratives. Considering alternative narratives is kind of what we do here so it's a problem when a disproportionate fraction of our users can't tolerate opposing viewpoints.

       I understand that we'll never see eye to eye politically, especially on the Trump/Russia, but I guess I do want to try to explain how things feel around here as a lefty conspiracy junkie.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger, I wasted days on end reading all the 9/11 conspiracy stuff I could find. Everything from the Bush administration swapped the planes in air for drones/military aircraft and had all the passengers killed, to the lighter (and, imo far more plausible) Cheney and friends allowed it to happen for financial and geopolitical reasons.  I remember doing a presentation in a high school AP class about how the Bush admin was drumming up war in Iraq on flimsy reasoning. I've re-read John Titor's claims about the left-right divide and WW3 more times than I should probably admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal experiences with conspiracies have always had a left leaning to them. I know that's not what everyone thinks, and that frankly I'm probably in the minority among the conspiracy community. But, the comparison I'd make for today (with what I and others feel is supression of talk about Trump/Russia on this sub) is like if it were 2002 and the sub didn't allow any discussion of 9/11 conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's the President and he's under Federal investigation for possible conspiracy against the United States! How can people not want to talk about that? I want to hear your side and I want to talk about my side! Why can't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like must be ways to facilitate that kind of discussion without immediately devolving into shill accusations. More forceful moderation of shill accusations? Removing the downvote button so things don't get buried? I don't know, I'm not an expert on this shit, but I wish we could do better.

       No offense but that is pure insanity!  The problem is that the sub has been taken over with NOTHING BUT! Trump/Russia talk.  That's why everyone is unhappy, that's why no other conspiracies can be talked about.  And it's not your fault for being a lefty Conspiracy theorist, you sound legitimate.  It's the anti-trump crowd who are lefties without being Conspiracy theorists, they shut everything else down and it's annoying as fuck.  So if they have to go to get shit back to normal than I'm all for it.

       I do get what you're saying, as when a big thing happens re: Trump/Russia, the sub does get pretty flooded with stories. Where I'm coming from is that (often, at least) the story that "wins" and reaches the top is often either deleted, thrown in contest mode, and sometimes the submitter is banned (as happened recently with the Channel 4/CA post). There's usually a half dozen near identical posts that remain, but the discussion gets diffused between them and is really hard to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's incredibly frustrating as someone who wants to talk about that stuff, and obviously that's frustrating for people that want to avoid that crap and talk about other things. I know I've seen opposition to it in threads here recently, but I really think a stickied mega-thread for big current events isn't a bad idea. It prevents flooding and concentrates discussion. There's obviously downsides as well, and it requires a lot more active moderation, but I wish it would be tried as a tactic.

       That's because of the 800 resist network subs.  They overwhelm every sub on Reddit.  It's organized, obvious and annoying as hell.  We don't need Conspiracy to just be a mirror of /politics, /news, /worldnews etc etc.

       Well, sure, let's assume that is happening on the scale that people claim. Doesn't a megathread kind of solve that issue? Up/Downvotes don't matter, the sub doesn't get flooded, and if you avoid the comment section you're not going to get nuked with downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, removing downvotes would also solve that last part, and may convince people to be more willing to wade in with contrary opinions if they know they won't get auto-buried for being negative karma.

       You have to consider that a lot of these users may be new to the idea of conspiracies and questioning the offical narrative. Like it or not, the Trump/Russia story is the biggest conspiracy out there today. It's bound to attract new users eager to talk about Trump/Russia, and some of the more fringe ideas may seem a bit outlandish to them. I'm just speculating here but it's certainly something to consider.

       they do it in real life too. their chant is who shuts shit down we shut shit down. they are authoritarian bullies and carry that over to internet. they ruin everything for everyone instead of building something of their own. they are incapable of building things. easier to destroy than build.

       I'd like to quote a comment I just wrote in worldnews:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Neglecting the fact that "liberal" and "conservative" have come to mean such very different things than 100 or even 50 years ago, especially in the US, I think if anything can be said about conspiracy theorists as a whole it's that they distrust authority and concentration of power, especially when that power and authority are exercised opaquely. I think they always would choose more Liberty over more Authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think the change you see in conspiracy theorists today is more about the politicization and partisan-izing of conspiracy theories, and even more an influx of people using conspiracy theories for their partisan political purposes, rather than the people who were conspiracy theorists for decades now being more "conservative" (in the modern US meaning).
       </p>
       <p>
        And if you just want to take the term "conspiracy theory" at face value, the Trump-Russia collusion story is a conspiracy theory, and it's being pushed mostly by "liberals." That's not to say it's untrue — that's not what conspiracy theory means — and when Mueller's investigation concludes and we can see the evidence, we'll be in a better place to judge that.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When it comes to left- or right-leaning conspiracy theorists, I want to work
       <em>

       them any time we can come together for the purpose of more transparency and more liberty, even if we may disagree on a host of other issues.

      <p>
       This can't actually be done. If you've seen it on other subs, it's just  a CSS trick that can be easily circumvented, and with all the bad actors here, I think would lead to a worse situation.

      <p>
       Which is the purpose of the conclave sub to begin with. I get that the secrecy aspect can look bad, and it's not ideal to me either, yet I think it's better than nothing at this point. There've been two public leaks of it so far that I've seen, and I really think that's a misrepresentation of what goes on there. For the most part, it's a lot more dead than I'd like, but what I'm trying to use it for is to work out possible solutions that makes this place more conducive to civil discussion. I can't expect you to take my word for it, but I thought I'd at least give you my perspective.

       has discussion happened recently related to default sort days? like, default to New on Tuesdays, default to Old on Wednesdays, default to Controversial on Thursdays -- then go back to whatever the default setting is for Friday through Monday.

       I don't think so yet. How would that work, would that mean each thread would have it's default sort set for whatever that day's sort is? I could see that being interesting if nothing else. Mabye even randomize the day somehow so it couldn't be gamed as easily.

       Just because someone doesn't have the same mindset as you, doesn't make them a shill. I doubt the shill problem is as big as some people here thing it is.

       Also, just because Trump/Russia is reported on by MSM, doesn't mean it's 'anti-conspiracy'. Pretty sure Watergate was widely covered by the MSM. Was that not a huge conspiracy?

I start er getting creepy pm from assholes, so now I use this admitted alt for my non-banned account because of the ridiculous gatekeeping by a 100 day old account.

       Unfortunately that is not a feature moderators have control over. Even if we modify the CSS to remove the downvote button, this can be turned off at the user level in the site preferences. The manipulators would adapt to this seamlessly while some honest users would not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly advocate giving moderators more control over voting allowances within subreddits, but it simply isn't the case right now.

       Ah, that's a good point. It might help a bit, though, as it would remove some of the "herding" ability of the manipulators. If the average user who doesn't turn it off in their settings can't downvote someone, you'd limit the downvotes to mostly the manipulators at least. It might also give a bit more transparency to just how much or little manipulation is happening.

       Quite right. The ability to truly restrict voting based on age of account or length of subscription would seriously slow down vote manipulation. Unfortunately the admins won't give moderators such tools.

       The admins really don't give mods the tools to combat vote manipulation, which I think is at least in part because Reddit, Inc. benefits in multiple ways from said manipulation.

       For sure. From a data science perspective, I have to admit it there's a lot of really interesting insights that could be analyzed from this mass of communication hodgepodge. It would be fun to play around on

       Add flairs for posts, stricter moderation in some areas and lighter in others, stop the private sub bs, less bias in moderation, more consistent moderation, etc. You could probably write a paper on what should be done to clean this sub up, it certainly isn't to target certain users because you don't like what they believe.

       no, they didn't. if anything, the huge trump die-hard influx of the past two years made it a battleground. i've been here six years.

       nah. "the others" are mostly people who were already here. conspiracy went mainstream with trump. and if you say so, your reddit birthday is nov 2017. the account i'm posting from goes all the way back, bud.

       Dismissing things because they agree with popular consensus is not being a conspiracy theorist, it's being a contrarian. This place always loves showing polls of more people believing 9/11 or the JFK assassination were inside jobs, if that was the accepted view suddenly would you disagree because it was mainstream?

       Oh I've read it, and I see quite a few of those techniques used at some point by almost this entire sub.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely.

       I think it’s more that there’s no reason for a lot of these users to be here given they discuss one thing and that’s trump Russia and they absolutely do not contemplate for one second that it’s contrived. There’s really no debate to be had anyways. If it was printed in an article it’s fact and that’s it.

       This place also has markedly changed over the last year and it’s gotten progressively worse in terms of slowly morphing into a pseudo r/politics.

       Most of these guys were here first and it’s their home. To say they can’t take offense at people coming in here and shitting on them is kind of silly.

       Considering most of the arguments are crap and pretty quickly get to calling them shills, or just dismissing them because it's msm, I'm not surprised it's not swaying their opinions.

       I also don't care who was here first, I was here before the majority of the userbase and you'll never see me use that to support my positions. Most of these people crying about shills got here in the last 4 or so years.

       Isn’t that what r/politics does in their sub? You get banned straight away if you have a view they don’t like.

       Prove it. People post all kinds of right wing articles there, and make pro-trump comments. Over and over. Same people. Never seen them get banned.

       Isn't it a bit underhanded to make that offer only after a whole slate of new mods were approved? My understanding is that the sub was purely invite only up until the new mods were announced, though I'm curious if you know different.

       Just going by the subreddit age. It'd be hard for me to tell when it's active, since it was only announced after new mods were chosen about a week ago. So obviously it's been active for longer than that.

       I answered this elsewhere, but there's two reasons for that. 1) Modmail in incredibly unwieldy for carrying on long conversations about ongoing issues. 2) We decided to bring in other members of the community to get more user input on things. Many of the members of the conclave have been on this sub for 5+ years, remember the sub before the craziness of 2016, and have valuable insight to offer.

      <p>
       Be specific in what your asking, namely, do I think for r/conspiracy to work properly it needs mods? Because all the conclave is, in essence, is an advisory panel and discussion forum for mods and a select group of users. The conclave members have no power except to advise and persuade the mod team. And my answer would be yes, absolutely, and this is from someone who would identify as an anarchist if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first reason the sub needs mods is obvious and unavoidable. If we got rid of the mods, or the mods did not enforce site-wide rules, this sub would either be banned by the admins, or replaced by a mod team who would enforce their rules. Given that this sub would not exist but for Reddit, inc., at least a minimal mod team is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet I think your question also asks whether such a mod team should also implement and enforce their own rules, above and beyond what's required. To this, I would also say yes (given the platform of reddit as it exists). My reasoning for this is that without a mod team to limit the discussion to that of conspiracy theories, this sub would become a microcosm of the larger reddit demographic. Conspiracy theorists as such are a minority, and specifically a minority which other people and organizations do not want to have a voice. Without moderation that gives conspiracy theorists, and those skeptical of specific conspiracy theories, a place to voice their opinions and evidence, conspiracy theorists would not have any central place to congregate and exchange information on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an anarchist and a voluntaryist, ultimately, I would like a place that looks nothing like reddit. I would much prefer a system of voluntary moderation, where users could subscribe to and even be their own moderators. Don't like a mod's decision? Don't subscribe to that mod. Want a more curated experience that censors vulgarity, opinions you don't like, topics you don't find interesting, etc.? Subscribe to mods that will give you that experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit doesn't allow that structurally within a sub, but what reddit does do is gives you the free choice to go to any other sub, or to create your own, and run it as you see fit. r/worldpolitics is essentially unmoderated, other than site-wide rules. r/ConspiracyII and r/conspiracyundone have their own set of moderation practices. Or make your own and build it up if you don't like those. Besides site-wide rules, reddit essentially is anarchistic with the caveat of first come, first served for real estate (sub names). If you want to participate here, you have to abide by this mod team's decisions.

       I feel like you're missing the word "covert." Obviously mods are necessary for every subreddit. Most subreddits don't have separate private subreddits that invite users to influence moderation policy secretly.

       And I feel like you're putting too much focus on that word. Let's say we didn't have the conclave, or we shut it down today. Do you really think users wouldn't message the mod team to tell us their ideas on how to fix the sub, or who they wanted to see banned? Do you think they wouldn't PM specific mods who they thought would be sympathetic to them? I can assure, both of these happened long before the conclave was a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, our internal mod deliberations are also private — covert, if you will, just like every other sub on this site (barring maybe a few insignificant ones). Moreover, we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       publish all our mod logs, and I'm not sure if any sub as large as ours does. In all our actions, we are completely transparent, even if the discussions leading up to them were not.
      </p>

      <p>
       Is your only objection that it's a separate sub, where the users can talk with each other "privately", as opposed to just being able to talk to one or more mods privately? I fail to see how that's substantively different than most other subs, or any other institution for that matter.

       We considered that, and while reddit can restrict posting, and automod can restrict commenting, there's no mechanism to prevent voting from non-contributors. That
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be a pretty cool feature for reddit, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not completely opposed to something more transparent, or even a publicly listed and promoted "meta" sub, where people could complain about shills or mods or shill mods or whatever else they wanted to complain about, without sliding discussions on the main sub.

       Then there should be no issue. The problem at hand is the lack of discourse, not really who supports what politics. When top comments are ones bashing the sub on thread after thread, you know you have a problem. Mods are getting downvoted non stop from these same toxic members. They're here for disruption. I have never seen a sub that eats it own in such a degree. It makes no sense unless outside influence is involved. This is straight up sabatoge.

       Why is there no room for the possibility of some of that to be occurring naturally from people in the sub? I disagree with a lot of the ways the mods have handled politically explosive issues, and having a secret society to direct the sub from the shadows (and that, from the outside, appears to be pretty limited in membership to one political ideology) certainly doesn't help matters.

       This sub is overran with blue dog D's, aka neoliberals. The most non conspiracy minded political block out there. Why would so many be interested to come here and shit over everything? When you go from a 20'ish average karma score on comments prior to the 2016 election to -20 to -40 now, and have the same political leanings, then obviously some drastic change occurred. The toxicity has become overwhelming and it's coming from these neoliberals.

       I was banned for discourse.  Also, listing "problem" users turns into a witch hunt.  Which is a favorite past time for many in this sub, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

       But are all the people in the conclave there for honest debate. Below you can see flytape, who is a member of the conclave, responding to an attempt at discussion where he just calls the user a TMOR shill to avoid talking with them. I know he specifically tends to have a more abrasive personality, but seeing as the members of the community is hidden from those outside who knows who else could be there that also wishes to call opposing opinions TMOR shills

       I cannot speak of the conclave. I know little of it. I do know drastic changes need to be made. They have tried having public discourse on attempting to make positive changes here, but it gets the same treatment as every other thread in this. Downvoted, insulted, and dismissed out of hand. I do not blame them for taking that route, they did try, but we have more dishonest users than honest ones.

        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        to create a "persona non grata" rule, and issue bans for users who only parrot MSM narratives - we are getting swamped.

       Get ready folks, soon talking about the Trump/Russia conspiracy will be a bannable offense.

       I'm on the list and there's no way I'm a brigader - I basically am only on Reddit for this sub. I don't think I come to this sub to push one particular viewpoint, though I do admit that the current political conspiracies are very intriguing to me and I post/read about them a lot.

       I came here to talk about conspiracy theories, both potentially ongoing political ones and more classic ones. How am I comparable to someone who goes on twoxchromosones to troll rape victims?

       If ‘that viewpoint’ is a conspiracy don’t they still belong here? Just because you can talk about Russia on politics doesn’t mean it doesn’t belong here too. It is definitely a conspiracy worthy of discussion, even if you don’t believe it, no matter where it is reported.

       If you're referring to his actual posts I just looked through and see nothing posted to politics, I have no idea regarding comments. However, dropping a blanket statement suggesting where someone posts makes their opinions illegitimate is a slippery slope because it leads you to ignoring any valid points others could make.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is better to be willing to judge the content of their post for what it entails rather than where they post.

       Yes, the whole sub is about purging this sub of people you don't like. Again, your actions and your words are completely fucking separate. Just because I call myself a 7 foot tall black man doesn't change that I'm white and not 7 feet tall. But, if lying about being a black man helped my racist viewpoints (
       <a href="/r/asablackman">
        /r/asablackman

       ), I might just do it on reddit. Just like a radical right winger might call themselves a "leftist" when solely attacking leftists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again you think Nazi facists were left because they did this exact tactic so maybe you're just extremely ignorant. Sad you fall for such simple, simple, simple, propaganda tactics.

       I can't help but think that with 20 mods that aren't bots (like publicmodlogs and rConBot), they should have enough varied opinions amongst themselves to be able to discuss what changes to make to this subreddit without having to involve the users. Making a private subreddit for only certain "chosen" users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn't.

       Bingo. If one of the cabal members posts a name no one questions it. No criteria is being discussed, anyone that doesn't buy into the Fox News right-wing mainstream media narrative is added to the purge list and labeled a shill.

       All the while talking about how any topics talked about in the MSM aren't valid. And by MSM they mean anything other than Fox news. Including actual outlets with real journalistic integrity that vet multiple sources for each story.

      <p>
       Funny how they point the finger at new accounts that have only been posting in here a few months as proof of brigading. They never make the connection that most of those accounts had their long time accounts here banned so had to use new ones to continue using the sub.

       The 'deep state' narrative is just as MSM as the Trump/Russia narrative. You can find it on Fox and Breitbart and all the other mainstream conservative news sources but that's okay, right? It's only left-wing MSM narratives that the censor nazis want to shut down.

       Actually, I can't take some issue with your recent "joke" because it ended up a circle jerk about me suggesting we include calling people "Russian trolls" and "Comrade" in our Rule 10 scope, and I think that is crappy of you.
      </p>

       I see no difference, functionally, to call someone "Comrade" than "shill" or "troll" in a discussion and I don't think there is anything funny about it.

       Thanks I appreciate it. I actually do try not to just be a conspiracy naysayer, and I try to be cool to people who are being hostile to me. And I apologize to people when I misquote something or mistake a fact etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the conspiracies I believe in aren't really discussed here. They're boring I guess, or dated, or aren't controversial enough anymore. And I'm admittedly pretty liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lurk in the posts I agree with, and comment on things when I see misinformation, which is most often in posts I don't agree with, which might make me seem more disagreeable than I actually am, but I'm polite about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't make me a shill. And having some inner-circle try to make me go away, or anyone like me, is troubling to me.

      <p>
       I'm 100% sure their are bad actors in this sub. And the moderators aren't wrong to be concerned and address the issues they see more visibly. But I think some of the wrong people are getting pulled into this, and some personal agendas are playing an unhealthy roll.

       I agree with you completely and I pretty much have the same viewing, browsing, and commenting habits. That is what is most alarming to me. I see users on that list who've done nothing more than I've done and now they are labelled as conspiratorially undesirables.

       What is most bothersome to me is that users like yourself now have to come into this thread to defend themselves in regards to how they fit in the r/conspiracy Mike. That is pretty fucked up.

       The entire existence of this thread is pretty fucking hilarious to me. There are many names on "the list" that I've never seen break rules. If the only rule they are breaking is commenting on the 2nd biggest conspiracy of our lifetime then er might as well close up shop on this sub.

       I do have, but it is used in the same decisive way as "shill" or "troll" and should be treated as such. As long as we have Rule 10, it should be implemented fairly.

       I'm not a robot and my sense if humor is not weighed down and tethered to an agenda like a "shill." If there are rules against acting like a natural human being then count me out. Go ahead and hold onto that cold, rigid, decisive humor of yours comrade.

       Look man if you took my comment to be an attack on the sub or someone in particular you are wildly misinterpreting what I said. Perhaps I should have been less on the nose, but at the time it had been several hours since hard confessions by the puppet masters of hundreds of elections around the world, including in the U.S., had been posted to the sub and yet it was still not the top post. Suspicious? Maybe. Lots of possible explanations? Sure. Worthy of a joke about the fact that anyone who checks this sub on an even semi regular basis can tell there is a tug of war going on? Definitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that reality of the state of the sub enough to warrant a rule 10 warning? I don't know if I would agree, but I also wouldn't disagree if a mod attached a decent explanation. Is that joke worthy of being included on a god damn list of users suspected of downvoting new posts, shaping the rhetoric on the sub and qualifying for Pesona Non Grata status outright? Absolutely fucking not.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, my apologies for causing an inadvertent circle jerk, but the people in the secret club listing off PNGs because their feelings got hurt or they just didn't like what someone said can take their user lists an shove them up their asses.

       I miss coming here and reading about ant people living in the grand canyon, all the suspicious shit about Antarctica and everything else. I'm just a regular dude. Fuck what this sub has become. Ban me. I'm done with

       You know what? I miss talking about Antarctica, too, but theories like that rarely get traction anymore because most of the users are too concerned about getting there version of the political clickbait of the day to the top so they can scrap and fight and call names.

       Then just add in a level headed explanation with a rule 10 warning. In the last 3 months I have made comments in this sub about the cover up of the pending disaster in Houston when the Barker and Addicks reservoir levies inevitably fail, Hillary mentioning UFO disclosure in her campaign, that weird lunar deal where we had a blue moon, new moon and something else all at the same time, and a little snark here and there.

       Nope, my username was derived from my days of playing Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (when I was in the Army) on the XBOX 360 and my real name. I would troll kids by team killing and loved to hear them scream out "Miguel, NO!!!!" it's a name that's stuck for my online persona since then.

       I was never stationed at Eglin AFB. I first went to basic at Fort Banning GA from June 2002 - August 2002, from there it was AIT at Fort Gordon from September 2002 - March 2003, then Camp Long South Korea until April 2004, after this I went to Camp Doha Kuwait until May 2005, then Back to Gordon until deployment to LSA Anaconda in October 2006 - January 2008, then I got the fuck out in April 2008 and burned up 2 months of leave time until I was finally done with the Military.

       No, I'm a Veteran. As stated I ended my service in 2008. You can snoopsnoo my account all you want,  you'll find that I pretty much post here. My highest rated comment is calling out HSBC for laundering money for drug cartels.

       I didn't have to shoot anyone, nor was I directly involved in the killing of innocents. Due to being in a support role I was indirectly involved more likely than not in the death of innocent people, which I deal with in my own manner. I'm no drunk either but have had substance abuse issues which I don't attribute to the Army but more my own upbringing.

       I'm no alcoholic, I do drink in moderation occasionally. You're misconstruing everything I've said previously and I can only assume it's deliberate at this point in order to get a rise out of me. I do and have faced my demons, I work with children hoping to better their lives so they don't have to see the Military as a means to uplift themselves from their social predicament.

       I can honestly say that I'm a good person. Can you? All you do is shitpost on reddit and probably 4chan as well. How many alts do you have to create to feel good about yourself? The more sockpuppets you create won't fill up the hole you have in your soul.

       That's because this user is an alt for one of the conclave users and they know and are okay with this. I assume that it's putin_loves_cats based on the way the user speaks, the hours that they are active,  and that they weren't activated until shillsonacid received a 7 day ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact this user is allowed to operate in such a manner tells me that the mods who are most vocal of a shill problem only care about one type of "shill".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I should have to report this either,  as you've said mods are all over thus thread and should interject without anyone needing to cry out for help.

       And what does it hurt? If the other poster responds great, they are talking about a conspiracy, in a conspiracy forum (although slightly off topic), and if they don’t respond that’s fine too. Maybe that person isn’t confident enough in their conspiracy to make a whole post about it so chose to comment here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure if I bring up Avatar in a Fast and Furious thread in the movies subreddit it may not be the most relevant thing to the topic. And sure, a couple of salty movies users may say, ‘Hey, Avatar is not relative in my thread about Dom and Family, please talk about that in an Avatar related thread’, but I’m not going to get told I’m being exhausting, find my name on a list of users who are Avatar fans (I didn’t make the list, but I do think the world design makes Avatar highly rewatchable) and have a private subreddit start talking about what do we do to get rid of these Avatar fans and their discussion of Avatar and it’s pending sequels, of which news and misinformation seems to come out daily from the producers and director.

       Can't it? Do other subs this size let all its members discuss and decide rules and moderation, or do they have smaller groups of vetted that discuss behind the scenes and then address the community? Because I think it is the latter.

       Can I say this seems fine? This sub is basically the only decent, consolidated source for non-mainstream views on things. I really don't have a problem if pointless pro-mainstream people get banned. The screenshots about there being a billion subs for the mainstream anti-Trump conspiracies but nowhere else for Nasa shit, etc bring up really good points.

       As one of the mods who had perhaps the most to do with the formation of the conclave in its present form, I thought I'd give you my take on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had two specific goals in pushing it to where it is: 1) to give the mods a better platform than the awful modmail tools we currently have to discuss ongoing issues and potential rules changes of the subs, and 2) to let more of our long time users take part in these discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For any of your critiques of the conclave as it is now, I can guarantee you it would be just as easy if not easier for the mod team to do anything you'd find censorious or otherwise malign
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       ever creating the conclave. The conclave, if anything, brought more voices into that discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for it being private instead of public, I don't think that critique is without merit, yet I do think there are potential benefits given the nature of online forums such as they are. The conclave operates under Chatham House rules, which means anyone can discuss publicly what was said, but not who said it. This allows for more honest and frank discussion which otherwise might not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That it is private also means we're less susceptible to outside agitation and manipulation. The very nature of pseudonymous forums like reddit means that any sufficiently motivated party can very easily manipulate conversation, as the CA revelations have shown just a tip of that iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll try to answer any other questions I can.

       What is the criteria being used to add people to your purge list? Who is responsible for applying that criteria? Are people voted onto the purge list by the entire secret cabal community or just by the inner circle of the inner circle? Or can any random member add anyone they want for any reason they want without full review of the entire secret cabal community?

      <p>
       As far as I understand it, it's meant to collect a list of users who regularly disrupt conversation rather than adding to it. Anyone can put anyone on this list, and only mods can ban people from it. Anyone banned is eligible for the same review process afforded to anyone banned by a mod for any other reason. (I'm not currently an active mod here, so I'm not sure if anyone from the list has been banned yet or not.)

       What proof is being provided that they're disrupting conversations?  Based on that screenshot it seems clear that there is no evidence or debate happening whatsoever to determine who gets added to the purge list, someone simply adds a name and no one blinks an eye.

       The way it seems to be working is that anyone can add a name, and the proof would be evident in the user's history, if indeed any given user is disruptive. I have no clue how old that screenshot is, but I've contested at least one name that I don't think should be banned, and others have contested others.

       You keep calling this a purge list, and that's your right to characterize it as you see fit, but it's not really accurate. You appear on that list, and you haven't been purged. All it is a place for other users to add and discuss users they find to be disruptive to conversation. As has always been the case on this sub, the mod team has the final say in any bans or other actions. And just so you know, we regularly get modmails from all types of users asking for others to be banned, and we've always made those decisions based on our own investigations, not just because another user told us to.

       I'd say it's less about that and more about the extent to which that topic has taken over this board, and specifically users who have come into this sub who talk about seemingly nothing other than that here. The topic of conspiracy is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       broader than this one specific set of allegations concerning Trump/Russia. I don't want to ban discussion of it here, but there are threads every day on nearly every other large and small political or news sub, in addition  to dozens or more subs set up specifically to document, analyze, or meme the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is specific users, not the topic itself, which correlate with drowning out other conversation. What should we make of a user who's had an account here for several years, posting mainly in r/politics, and then for a month and a half, decides to start posting here and makes 700 comments in this sub in that period?

       I see my username there listed. I think I would know if I am a shill or not and i am certianly not. What have I done that would lead you to make this judgement? Dare to hold both sides to the same standard? Dare to be critical of astroturfing? Dare to be critical of Trump? I get shit on by either ShareBlue or the Trump people depending on what i post. They both hate me because i post things that counter their narrative. And they are both part of the establishment.  And conversely some of my posts that are critical of one side are liked by the other and vice versa. I am about anti establishment as it gets.  And if you think being critical of CA makes one suspect it's you that are the problem. Just like anybody that thinks ShareBlue is okay is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what's going on here but it goes against the spirit of this sub and maybe there isn't a place for people willing to criticize both sides here anymore. And maybe this isn't a place for me anymore.  It damn sure feels that way.

       I didn't put your name on any list. I don't think you're a shill, because I don't really recognize your username, but you are green in my RES so I must have upvoted you at least a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how I even feel about that list in the first place, whether public or private. In general, I think there are users here which do more to distract and slide conversation, rather than seeing this as a sub to learn and share knowledge and ideas, but calling for names like that would inevitably lead to witch hunts and mischaracterizations. If a user's criteria for putting someone on that list was "often supports the MSM Trump/Russia narrative," then that's going to sweep up a lot of good users, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think the idea came from a good place, though. You even point out that you call out astroturfing, and it certainly exists on this sub and reddit more broadly. When it comes to calling out specific users as trolls and shills, it's going to get turned around as well, either by bad actors themselves, or by genuine users getting it wrong. Though I'm not sure how we can really identify shills, or even just disruptive users without listing usernames in some form or another. It truly is a wicked problem.

       I would be careful of, and watch out for, people in this "conclave" trying to ban real dissent under the guise of shills. Like you said it could sweep up well intentioned users but it can also be abused if people have agendas you are not aware of. For the record I have never pushed the Trump/Russia narrative because I don't believe it. I actually argue against it. This is clearly just a hit job on me because I have the audacity to criticize Trump (who should be shown no allegiance on this sub) and CA and the methods they use on this sub. Keep an eye out.

       I understood that. But it makes it even more telling that I got tagged and listed in the image linked because I don't fit that criteria and still get tagged as a shill. Why? Because I am critical of Trump and Cambridge? What kind of a sub do they want here then?

       i made my reddit account in 2010. this was one of the first subs i subscribed to. fuck everything about this. this sub has changed so much over the past two years, and its because of the huge influx of trump die hard loyalists. period. it's so insane to blame the understandable pushback to that change and suggest banning people because they dont subscribe to the white house narrative.

       Which is made up of the core members of this community. Are you sad you weren't invited? Are you wondering why we may not like you? It's because you clearly have an agenda. Over the past few days dozens of people have specifically mentioned your name when I went around asking who was a bad apple in conspiracy, why might people specifically name you?

       For guys so vehemently against secret societies,and deep state shills you seem to use their tactics with joy.

      <p>
       I tend to be on the side of scepticism and voice my opinion accordingly.Your secret little club is a thinly veiled threat to this subs integrity.
You may justify it by saying it's "to tackle the shills and TmoR problem",but what stops you guys from taking it to far?

       You have users in that group that were part of the attempted overthrow of this sub a couple of months ago,that tried to make it a right wing safe haven.
While this attempt was foiled,it now seems to have moved into the shadows with the same goal.

       The ultimate irony is, a massive amount of the sub is constantly attacking Trump conspiracies (and a large amount supporting) but then get upset when people attack, say, pizzagate or seth rich.

       So a bunch of invite-only elite users and mods, including disgraced former mods, are in a secret sub Rule 10ing people they don't like in order to sanction and perhaps mass ban them. And this discussion is being led by the most enthusiastic deployer of permanent bans in r/conspiracy. Wow. That's... pretty fucked.

       You reckon? I dunno. They've got mod power. They're pretty unified in purpose (and, let's face it, in political persuasion). They've begun identifying the undesirables. And they have veneers of reasons under which to enact their "reshaping" of the active subscriber base. So what's to stop them?

       well there are certainly a few names in that list that i actually agree with. i don't usually bother to even read names but there are a few extreme examples that ive run in to that are named there that have stood out as shills, or just trolls trying to stir up shit.

       I see my username there listed. I think I would know if I am a shill or not and i am certianly not. What have I done that would lead you to make this judgement? Dare to hold both sides to the same standard? Dare to be critical of astroturfing?  I get shit on by either ShareBlue or the Trump people depending on what i post They bother hatell me because i post thinges that counter their narrative..  And conversely some of my posts that are critical of one side are liked by the other and vice versa. I am about anti establishment as it gets.  And if you think being critical of CA makes one suspect it's you that are the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what's going on here but it goes against the spirit of this sub and maybe there isn't a place for people willing to criticize both sides here anymore. And maybe this isn't a place for me anymore.  It damn sure feels that way.

       This is essentially "ban the leftists and anyone that thinks trump is a scbag".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I talk about trump on here an awful lot, but it brought up a lot in this sub (and not by me either).  I've made some posts regarding trump, but not all of my posts have to do with trump.  And yeah, I think he's guilty of some shitty things, but have any of you assholes in that sub taken the time to ask me exactly what I think of it all?  Fuck no you haven't!   Instead you retreat to your little safespace and try to scheme ways to ban people without making it obvious you're targeting people because they disagree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cowardly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's outrageous.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's disheartening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a mod that's too deep in that subs bullshit, you should be removed.  If you're a mod who contributes to that sub, stop pretending that your concern is free speech, because it's not.  You just don't want anyone to disagree with you.  You're just as bad as those you pretend to hate.  You hate them so much you emulate their behavior?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at yourselves.  You've become what you hate.  You can't be trusted in the position you're in.  Do the right thing and remove yourselves from the mod team.

       I'm pretty sure anytime I hear someone say "left this, right that, democrat this, or republican that" they are newbies or on a pay roll. It's been common knowledge in the conspiracy community that this paradigm is designed to divide and control. It's one of the fist things I've learned. Every politician plays for the same team. Team fuck you.

       I understand that we'll never see eye to eye politically, especially on the Trump/Russia, but I guess I do want to try to explain how things feel around here as a lefty conspiracy junkie.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger, I wasted days on end reading all the 9/11 conspiracy stuff I could find. Everything from the Bush administration swapped the planes in air for drones/military aircraft and had all the passengers killed, to the lighter (and, imo far more plausible) Cheney and friends allowed it to happen for financial and geopolitical reasons.  I remember doing a presentation in a high school AP class about how the Bush admin was drumming up war in Iraq on flimsy reasoning. I've re-read John Titor's claims about the left-right divide and WW3 more times than I should probably admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal experiences with conspiracies have always had a left leaning to them. I know that's not what everyone thinks, and that frankly I'm probably in the minority among the conspiracy community. But, the comparison I'd make for today (with what I and others feel is supression of talk about Trump/Russia on this sub) is like if it were 2002 and the sub didn't allow any discussion of 9/11 conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's the President and he's under Federal investigation for possible conspiracy against the United States! How can people not want to talk about that? I want to hear your side and I want to talk about my side! Why can't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like must be ways to facilitate that kind of discussion without immediately devolving into shill accusations. More forceful moderation of shill accusations? Removing the downvote button so things don't get buried? I don't know, I'm not an expert on this shit, but I wish we could do better.

       I don't disagree the name calling happens form all sides and should be minimized. The extremes definitely make it difficult to want to participate, if you jump in you are likely to get slammed (from one or both sides) and that sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think timed mutes are better than bans. If someone is a repeat offender then maybe it goes to the next level. Everyone is guilty of getting heated and quick with the keyboard now and then. Banning folks should be a last resort and only if there is a real violation (threats, doxxing, etc.) - censorship is never the answer.

Coming up with rules to specifically silence posters who believe in the Trump/Russia conspiracy is pure, unadulterated censorship. Creating a secret sub to target people who believe in the Trump/Russia conspiracy is even more vile than censorship. You are the very thing you claim to hate.

       Trump opened 8 companies in Saudi Arabia like 1 month after he announced he was running for president. I think the Russia stuff is just a distraction from the real powers that be that got Trump elected.

        So, are you saying your stance is that, for the r/conspiracy sub to be working properly, it needs to be steered by some

        but influential organization of users?

       I feel like you're missing the word "covert." Obviously mods are necessary for every subreddit. Most subreddits don't have separate private subreddits that invite users to influence moderation policy secretly.

       That's because this user is an alt for one of the conclave users and they know and are okay with this. I assume that it's putin_loves_cats based on the way the user speaks, the hours that they are active,  and that they weren't activated until shillsonacid received a 7 day ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact this user is allowed to operate in such a manner tells me that the mods who are most vocal of a shill problem only care about one type of "shill".

      <p>
       I don't think I should have to report this either,  as you've said mods are all over thus thread and should interject without anyone needing to cry out for help.
