There are discussions about things that can be done to try to bring it back to it&#39;s roots pre-2016 election hysteria.</p>

Of course, this goes for all interested parties and not just the TMOR types because other groups have an interest in disrupting places like this to push their own agenda.  During the 2016 election I would periodically watch accounts that caught my interest and look at their comments for a couple days.  A few times I found people talking about heading to other sites to coordinate their memes and messages, and I&#39;m guessing it didn&#39;t stop after November of that year.  </p>

<p>Nope, just pointing out that it&#39;s not surprising that circlejerks being conducted in private echo chambers with internet pals would remain civil. </p>

<p>Odd, reads to me like a bunch of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods and their internet buddies creating a secret group to figure out ways to ban posters who have a different political background.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not the case. I was invited and have access to the sub and it&#39;s really no big conspiracy. It&#39;s simply a place where users discuss how to deal with the overarching problems that plague this sub.</p>

<p>Politically, there are plenty of people on both sides. I can absolutely assure you that it&#39;s not filled with &quot;Trunp-supporters&quot;, as I feel many are trying to imply. I myself am not a Trump supporter in the least, but to be fair I&#39;m not a supporter of either main political party.</p>

<p>There is definitely nohing sinister going on there, but I do agree that the name &quot;conclave&quot; may have an ominous ring to it. But nope, I haven&#39;t seen anything there that could be dubbed as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against this main sub, the opposite really, it&#39;s more like a place to help make the sub better and not more filled with crappy partisan politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would definitely not say the purge list is related to any political leanings. Heck, even the screenshot you posted implies that Trump is not the issue here.</p>

<p>It is simply the case that this sub has been overhwelmed with users that are parroting MSM talking points. Whether these points are left or right leaning. This sub should be a place to discuss alternative views to mainstream events, thus I see no point in having threads here that actively support mainstream views. Whether the alternative theories are true or not (depends on the case of course), this sub should be the place to discuss them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t supoort a &quot;purge list&quot; personally, but something should be done about the influx of users that are unable to entertain any thought that is not part of the mainstream narrative. We have plenty of other subs for that, conspiracy should remain a place for discussions on alternative viewpoints, both those that appear less and those that appear more fringe.</p>

<p>You&#39;re pretty much advocating for thought police, you understand that right? It&#39;s okay if people disagree, in fact disagreements are healthy provided they don&#39;t turn personal. Hiding from them or worse setting up a secret sub to create lists of people who don&#39;t subscribe to your chosen MSM narrative is pure intellectual cowardice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I ever say the deep state is out to get Trump? The deep state is its own law and is behind any president that is in charge. One way or another, the deep-state calls (or at least tries to) call the shots, regardless of who is president. It is up the people to wake up and see this, the change must fundamentally come from the bottom up, not the top down. Thus politics is not the answer in my opinion. That is my perspective on the issue.</p>

<p>No, I am not advocating thought police whatsoever. I think all viewpoints and opinions should be respected. That is why I said that a purge list is not the answer, if you re-read my post. However, I said that this sub has been swamped with people that parrot MSM talking points, whether they are related to Trump or not (I don&#39;t see why insistance on bringing up Trump anyway, he doesn&#39;t really have any power, a president is always mainly a figurehead). I don&#39;t think this actually helps discussion and I think that people with any viewpoint should be able to explain themselves better and listen to each-other&#39;s viewpoints in a well-mannered fashion, without ad-hominem attacks and sliding the conversation off topic, making a non political topic political....etc. all of which often happens on this sub.</p>

<p>I mean, I’m sure I’ve been a bit sassy at times, but I’m def not into the whole “you’re a shill!” “Nothingburger” culture that’s been spreading. I’m more into evidence sharing and clearly stating my opinions as opinions, rather than facts. </p>

Some regular seemed to agree with them, but obviously the screens don’t show much discussion about each individual, and of course don’t allow for us to respond or defend ourselves there. </p>

<p>My personal belief is that paid shills obviously exist, but that we have no way of knowing for sure or proving any one user is one. The best we can do, IMO, is raise the standards of discourse and track alts based on writing style and some other patterns. Thanks yo!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your opinion on the scope of the TMOR problem? I know often times I&#39;ll see the mods talking about them crosslinking and brigading when the posts have very few upvotes. Regardless of the low amount of upvotes, it seems that it is treated like they&#39;re influence is massive and I know it worries me that they could be used as a scapegoat to block out dissenting discussions.</p>

<p>Even in this thread I can see flytape responding to another user asking about the sub and saying they&#39;re not entitled to the happenings of the sub, and then telling them to go back to TMOR.</p>

<p>I just know from my perspective seeing TMOR being blamed for everything and suddenly having a secret group of conspiracy users to fight it and help change the direction of the sub just feels fishy. Especially when as I said above, we can see members of the community, flytape in particular, gatekeeping and talking down to those that are questioning the decision</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do you see a declaration of war? I just took a look over there and don&#39;t see anything regarding that. My concern is just that it looks like scapegoating that is leading to a community deciding how they want things to change in a non-transparent way. I know I hadn&#39;t heard of the conclave until the new mod announcements were made, and it seems that was the case for many others in here as well.</p>

<p>I just know from my perspective a conspiracy community should not have a shadow group working behind the scenes to think of how to push the community in the way they want. It may seem useful for countering shilling, but shouldn&#39;t one of the goals of this community be to act transparently? </p>

<p>As for being named (and accused of being another alt, which I am not btw) as a MSM shill is just crazy. I participate in political conspiracies because that is what I am passionate about. I read through just about everything posted in r/con but I refrain from commenting on those threads because I don&#39;t have enough information to feel comfortable adding to the discussions. If it has to do with flying or tech I may jump in as I was a military aviator and currently an program engineer that has worked developing consumer products for a long time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you also need to consider the fact that r/conspiracy still has a modicum of free speech that being &quot;a bunch of tinfoil hats on the lunatic fringe&quot;, as we are generally depicted to be elsewhere, would only give us even more attention and credibility if any serious efforts were ever made to try and limit or curtail that freedom of speech that still happens to exist here, but has been eliminated in increasingly more places throughout Reddit. </p>

<p>So we&#39;ve become something of a catch-all for people with something they think is important to say with no other place to say it, simply for the sake and relief of getting some others to see and acknowledge it. </p>

<p>They may not be conspiracy related in any obvious or direct way but we can&#39;t say that some of them aren&#39;t important or that there isn&#39;t some value in us being made aware of them, all the same. </p>

<p>There was certainly some kind of a conspiracy to close down many of the subs some of those posters used to use or suffered changes to their rules that now prevent them from speaking openly about certain controversial topics they never had any trouble doing before and I think we need to understand that.</p>

<p>Personally I think this sub actually has gained far more credibility and opened more minds than anyone appreciates. The amount of organised trolling and brigading on certain topics is a testament to that and that someone certainly thinks or is worried that we&#39;re getting too close to the truth for their own with enough eyes on what gets posted about it for them to need to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good to hear.  There would likely need to be some kind of consensus reached regarding what tags to use and there might be disagreements over what topics fit in which tags, but it could be workable.  Maybe if enough users start doing it on their own it will show whether or not it&#39;s effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not opposed, but I could see it getting overly contentious to the point of unworkable. If the end result is people being able to see the content they want here, and therefore spending more time contributing to what they&#39;re knowledgeable and passionate about, then I&#39;m all for ti. </p>

<p>But if the end result is just extra complaining about the wrong flair being added, and sliding away from the actual topic at hand, then I&#39;m not for it. It&#39;s certainly worth exploring.</p>

<p>On a more general point, as a mod I have no problem with people criticizing me or the mod team for decisions we make. Sometimes we get things wrong, and we do bring our own biases to the table that can be hard to fully separate from our mod duties. My issue in general is that excessive criticism of the mod team or the sub <em>in conversations about specific conspiracy theories</em> does often have the effect, if not the intent, or sliding discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that a private sub is private but a public sub should be public. Not only that it seems wrong for a group to just arbitrarily drop names accusing them of being shills without letting the person know what is up. At least let them defend themselves.</p>

<p>Beyond that I think that if a sub suppresses and bans posters that they do not agree with they just give Reddit more ammunition to do the same in kind with the various troublesome (from their pov) subs. If Reddit doesn&#39;t like r/con because they don&#39;t conform they can just ban the sub. Yes I know they do that under the T&amp;Cs when they want to but I am advocating that that is just as big a violation of free speech as it is for a mod to ban a &#39;dissenter&#39; and it&#39;s worth noting that a dissenting opinion is not bad and should be used to strengthen your argument if at all possible. </p>

You might have noticed a few of them around, they show up in every mod announcement or community outreach post to complain, they are never happy with anything, they rarely discuss conspiracies and always obsessively debunk them...

No one is allowed to be interested in just one conspiracy? Honestly I don&#39;t know how effective that would be with your planned stifling of all dissenting opinion. For instance, I also believe in aliens so you wouldn&#39;t be able to silence me with that rule.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that we&#39;ll never see eye to eye politically, especially on the Trump/Russia, but I guess I do want to try to explain how things feel around here as a lefty conspiracy junkie. </p>

<p>When I was younger, I wasted days on end reading all the 9/11 conspiracy stuff I could find. Everything from the Bush administration swapped the planes in air for drones/military aircraft and had all the passengers killed, to the lighter (and, imo far more plausible) Cheney and friends allowed it to happen for financial and geopolitical reasons.  I remember doing a presentation in a high school AP class about how the Bush admin was drumming up war in Iraq on flimsy reasoning. I&#39;ve re-read John Titor&#39;s claims about the left-right divide and WW3 more times than I should probably admit. </p>

<p>My personal experiences with conspiracies have always had a left leaning to them. I know that&#39;s not what everyone thinks, and that frankly I&#39;m probably in the minority among the conspiracy community. But, the comparison I&#39;d make for today (with what I and others feel is supression of talk about Trump/Russia on this sub) is like if it were 2002 and the sub didn&#39;t allow any discussion of 9/11 conspiracies. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s the President and he&#39;s under Federal investigation for possible conspiracy against the United States! How can people not want to talk about that? I want to hear your side and I want to talk about my side! Why can&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I feel like must be ways to facilitate that kind of discussion without immediately devolving into shill accusations. More forceful moderation of shill accusations? Removing the downvote button so things don&#39;t get buried? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not an expert on this shit, but I wish we could do better.</p>

<p>No offense but that is pure insanity!  The problem is that the sub has been taken over with NOTHING BUT! Trump/Russia talk.  That&#39;s why everyone is unhappy, that&#39;s why no other conspiracies can be talked about.  And it&#39;s not your fault for being a lefty Conspiracy theorist, you sound legitimate.  It&#39;s the anti-trump crowd who are lefties without being Conspiracy theorists, they shut everything else down and it&#39;s annoying as fuck.  So if they have to go to get shit back to normal than I&#39;m all for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do get what you&#39;re saying, as when a big thing happens re: Trump/Russia, the sub does get pretty flooded with stories. Where I&#39;m coming from is that (often, at least) the story that &quot;wins&quot; and reaches the top is often either deleted, thrown in contest mode, and sometimes the submitter is banned (as happened recently with the Channel 4/CA post). There&#39;s usually a half dozen near identical posts that remain, but the discussion gets diffused between them and is really hard to follow. </p>

<p>That&#39;s incredibly frustrating as someone who wants to talk about that stuff, and obviously that&#39;s frustrating for people that want to avoid that crap and talk about other things. I know I&#39;ve seen opposition to it in threads here recently, but I really think a stickied mega-thread for big current events isn&#39;t a bad idea. It prevents flooding and concentrates discussion. There&#39;s obviously downsides as well, and it requires a lot more active moderation, but I wish it would be tried as a tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, sure, let&#39;s assume that is happening on the scale that people claim. Doesn&#39;t a megathread kind of solve that issue? Up/Downvotes don&#39;t matter, the sub doesn&#39;t get flooded, and if you avoid the comment section you&#39;re not going to get nuked with downvotes. </p>

<p>Although, removing downvotes would also solve that last part, and may convince people to be more willing to wade in with contrary opinions if they know they won&#39;t get auto-buried for being negative karma.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My personal experiences with conspiracies have always had a left leaning to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to quote a comment I just wrote in worldnews:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neglecting the fact that &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; have come to mean such very different things than 100 or even 50 years ago, especially in the US, I think if anything can be said about conspiracy theorists as a whole it&#39;s that they distrust authority and concentration of power, especially when that power and authority are exercised opaquely. I think they always would choose more Liberty over more Authority.</p>

<p>I think the change you see in conspiracy theorists today is more about the politicization and partisan-izing of conspiracy theories, and even more an influx of people using conspiracy theories for their partisan political purposes, rather than the people who were conspiracy theorists for decades now being more &quot;conservative&quot; (in the modern US meaning).</p>

<p>And if you just want to take the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; at face value, the Trump-Russia collusion story is a conspiracy theory, and it&#39;s being pushed mostly by &quot;liberals.&quot; That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s untrue — that&#39;s not what conspiracy theory means — and when Mueller&#39;s investigation concludes and we can see the evidence, we&#39;ll be in a better place to judge that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it comes to left- or right-leaning conspiracy theorists, I want to work <em>with</em> them any time we can come together for the purpose of more transparency and more liberty, even if we may disagree on a host of other issues. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Just a few notes on some of your other suggestions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More forceful moderation of shill accusations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I came on as a mod, I went hard against this, and still believe it has no place in civil discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Removing the downvote button so things don&#39;t get buried?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can&#39;t actually be done. If you&#39;ve seen it on other subs, it&#39;s just  a CSS trick that can be easily circumvented, and with all the bad actors here, I think would lead to a worse situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not an expert on this shit, but I wish we could do better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is the purpose of the conclave sub to begin with. I get that the secrecy aspect can look bad, and it&#39;s not ideal to me either, yet I think it&#39;s better than nothing at this point. There&#39;ve been two public leaks of it so far that I&#39;ve seen, and I really think that&#39;s a misrepresentation of what goes on there. For the most part, it&#39;s a lot more dead than I&#39;d like, but what I&#39;m trying to use it for is to work out possible solutions that makes this place more conducive to civil discussion. I can&#39;t expect you to take my word for it, but I thought I&#39;d at least give you my perspective. </p>

<p><strong>Translation</strong>: It&#39;s time to ban anyone who believes in the Trump/Russia collusion.</p>

<p>Also, just because Trump/Russia is reported on by MSM, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39;. Pretty sure Watergate was widely covered by the MSM. Was that not a huge conspiracy?</p>

<p>This seems like an excuse to ban any of the vocal Anti-Trump users here....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that is not a feature moderators have control over. Even if we modify the CSS to remove the downvote button, this can be turned off at the user level in the site preferences.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, that&#39;s a good point. It might help a bit, though, as it would remove some of the &quot;herding&quot; ability of the manipulators. If the average user who doesn&#39;t turn it off in their settings can&#39;t downvote someone, you&#39;d limit the downvotes to mostly the manipulators at least. It might also give a bit more transparency to just how much or little manipulation is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be specific in what your asking, namely, do I think for r/conspiracy to work properly it needs mods? Because all the conclave is, in essence, is an advisory panel and discussion forum for mods and a select group of users. The conclave members have no power except to advise and persuade the mod team. And my answer would be yes, absolutely, and this is from someone who would identify as an anarchist if anything. </p>

<p>The first reason the sub needs mods is obvious and unavoidable. If we got rid of the mods, or the mods did not enforce site-wide rules, this sub would either be banned by the admins, or replaced by a mod team who would enforce their rules. Given that this sub would not exist but for Reddit, inc., at least a minimal mod team is necessary. </p>

<p>Yet I think your question also asks whether such a mod team should also implement and enforce their own rules, above and beyond what&#39;s required. To this, I would also say yes (given the platform of reddit as it exists). My reasoning for this is that without a mod team to limit the discussion to that of conspiracy theories, this sub would become a microcosm of the larger reddit demographic. Conspiracy theorists as such are a minority, and specifically a minority which other people and organizations do not want to have a voice. Without moderation that gives conspiracy theorists, and those skeptical of specific conspiracy theories, a place to voice their opinions and evidence, conspiracy theorists would not have any central place to congregate and exchange information on reddit. </p>

<p>As an anarchist and a voluntaryist, ultimately, I would like a place that looks nothing like reddit. I would much prefer a system of voluntary moderation, where users could subscribe to and even be their own moderators. Don&#39;t like a mod&#39;s decision? Don&#39;t subscribe to that mod. Want a more curated experience that censors vulgarity, opinions you don&#39;t like, topics you don&#39;t find interesting, etc.? Subscribe to mods that will give you that experience. </p>

<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t allow that structurally within a sub, but what reddit does do is gives you the free choice to go to any other sub, or to create your own, and run it as you see fit. r/worldpolitics is essentially unmoderated, other than site-wide rules. r/ConspiracyII and r/conspiracyundone have their own set of moderation practices. Or make your own and build it up if you don&#39;t like those. Besides site-wide rules, reddit essentially is anarchistic with the caveat of first come, first served for real estate (sub names). If you want to participate here, you have to abide by this mod team&#39;s decisions. </p>

<p>I feel like you&#39;re missing the word &quot;covert.&quot; Obviously mods are necessary for every subreddit. Most subreddits don&#39;t have separate private subreddits that invite users to influence moderation policy secretly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I feel like you&#39;re putting too much focus on that word. Let&#39;s say we didn&#39;t have the conclave, or we shut it down today. Do you really think users wouldn&#39;t message the mod team to tell us their ideas on how to fix the sub, or who they wanted to see banned? Do you think they wouldn&#39;t PM specific mods who they thought would be sympathetic to them? I can assure, both of these happened long before the conclave was a thing. </p>

<p>Regardless, our internal mod deliberations are also private — covert, if you will, just like every other sub on this site (barring maybe a few insignificant ones). Moreover, we <em>do</em> publish all our mod logs, and I&#39;m not sure if any sub as large as ours does. In all our actions, we are completely transparent, even if the discussions leading up to them were not. </p>

<p>Is your only objection that it&#39;s a separate sub, where the users can talk with each other &quot;privately&quot;, as opposed to just being able to talk to one or more mods privately? I fail to see how that&#39;s substantively different than most other subs, or any other institution for that matter. </p>

<p>Yes, the whole sub is about purging this sub of people you don&#39;t like. Again, your actions and your words are completely fucking separate. Just because I call myself a 7 foot tall black man doesn&#39;t change that I&#39;m white and not 7 feet tall. But, if lying about being a black man helped my racist viewpoints (<a href="/r/asablackman">/r/asablackman</a>), I might just do it on reddit. Just like a radical right winger might call themselves a &quot;leftist&quot; when solely attacking leftists. </p>

<p>But then again you think Nazi facists were left because they did this exact tactic so maybe you&#39;re just extremely ignorant. Sad you fall for such simple, simple, simple, propaganda tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I appreciate it. I actually do try not to just be a conspiracy naysayer, and I try to be cool to people who are being hostile to me. And I apologize to people when I misquote something or mistake a fact etc. </p>

<p>A lot of the conspiracies I believe in aren&#39;t really discussed here. They&#39;re boring I guess, or dated, or aren&#39;t controversial enough anymore. And I&#39;m admittedly pretty liberal. </p>

<p>And lurk in the posts I agree with, and comment on things when I see misinformation, which is most often in posts I don&#39;t agree with, which might make me seem more disagreeable than I actually am, but I&#39;m polite about it. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make me a shill. And having some inner-circle try to make me go away, or anyone like me, is troubling to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% sure their are bad actors in this sub. And the moderators aren&#39;t wrong to be concerned and address the issues they see more visibly. But I think some of the wrong people are getting pulled into this, and some personal agendas are playing an unhealthy roll. </p>

<p>This is a awful path to tread down, imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man if you took my comment to be an attack on the sub or someone in particular you are wildly misinterpreting what I said. Perhaps I should have been less on the nose, but at the time it had been several hours since hard confessions by the puppet masters of hundreds of elections around the world, including in the U.S., had been posted to the sub and yet it was still not the top post. Suspicious? Maybe. Lots of possible explanations? Sure. Worthy of a joke about the fact that anyone who checks this sub on an even semi regular basis can tell there is a tug of war going on? Definitely.  </p>

<p>Is that reality of the state of the sub enough to warrant a rule 10 warning? I don&#39;t know if I would agree, but I also wouldn&#39;t disagree if a mod attached a decent explanation. Is that joke worthy of being included on a god damn list of users suspected of downvoting new posts, shaping the rhetoric on the sub and qualifying for Pesona Non Grata status outright? Absolutely fucking not.  </p>

<p>So again, my apologies for causing an inadvertent circle jerk, but the people in the secret club listing off PNGs because their feelings got hurt or they just didn&#39;t like what someone said can take their user lists an shove them up their asses.  </p>

<p>I miss coming here and reading about ant people living in the grand canyon, all the suspicious shit about Antarctica and everything else. I&#39;m just a regular dude. Fuck what this sub has become. Ban me. I&#39;m done with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

I first went to basic at Fort Banning GA from June 2002 - August 2002, from there it was AIT at Fort Gordon from September 2002 - March 2003, then Camp Long South Korea until April 2004, after this I went to Camp Doha Kuwait until May 2005, then Back to Gordon until deployment to LSA Anaconda in October 2006 - January 2008, then I got the fuck out in April 2008 and burned up 2 months of leave time until I was finally done with the Military.</p>

<p>Anymore questions?</p>

<p>And what does it hurt? If the other poster responds great, they are talking about a conspiracy, in a conspiracy forum (although slightly off topic), and if they don’t respond that’s fine too. Maybe that person isn’t confident enough in their conspiracy to make a whole post about it so chose to comment here. </p>

<p>Sure if I bring up Avatar in a Fast and Furious thread in the movies subreddit it may not be the most relevant thing to the topic. And sure, a couple of salty movies users may say, ‘Hey, Avatar is not relative in my thread about Dom and Family, please talk about that in an Avatar related thread’, but I’m not going to get told I’m being exhausting, find my name on a list of users who are Avatar fans (I didn’t make the list, but I do think the world design makes Avatar highly rewatchable) and have a private subreddit start talking about what do we do to get rid of these Avatar fans and their discussion of Avatar and it’s pending sequels, of which news and misinformation seems to come out daily from the producers and director. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As one of the mods who had perhaps the most to do with the formation of the conclave in its present form, I thought I&#39;d give you my take on it. </p>

<p>I had two specific goals in pushing it to where it is: 1) to give the mods a better platform than the awful modmail tools we currently have to discuss ongoing issues and potential rules changes of the subs, and 2) to let more of our long time users take part in these discussions. </p>

<p>For any of your critiques of the conclave as it is now, I can guarantee you it would be just as easy if not easier for the mod team to do anything you&#39;d find censorious or otherwise malign <em>without</em> ever creating the conclave. The conclave, if anything, brought more voices into that discussion. </p>

<p>As for it being private instead of public, I don&#39;t think that critique is without merit, yet I do think there are potential benefits given the nature of online forums such as they are. The conclave operates under Chatham House rules, which means anyone can discuss publicly what was said, but not who said it. This allows for more honest and frank discussion which otherwise might not be possible. </p>

<p>That it is private also means we&#39;re less susceptible to outside agitation and manipulation. The very nature of pseudonymous forums like reddit means that any sufficiently motivated party can very easily manipulate conversation, as the CA revelations have shown just a tip of that iceberg. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to answer any other questions I can. </p>

Are people voted onto the purge list by the entire secret cabal community or just by the inner circle of the inner circle?

<p>As far as I understand it, it&#39;s meant to collect a list of users who regularly disrupt conversation rather than adding to it. Anyone can put anyone on this list, and only mods can ban people from it. Anyone banned is eligible for the same review process afforded to anyone banned by a mod for any other reason.

<p>You keep calling this a purge list, and that&#39;s your right to characterize it as you see fit, but it&#39;s not really accurate. You appear on that list, and you haven&#39;t been purged. All it is a place for other users to add and discuss users they find to be disruptive to conversation. As has always been the case on this sub, the mod team has the final say in any bans or other actions. And just so you know, we regularly get modmails from all types of users asking for others to be banned, and we&#39;ve always made those decisions based on our own investigations, not just because another user told us to. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s less about that and more about the extent to which that topic has taken over this board, and specifically users who have come into this sub who talk about seemingly nothing other than that here. The topic of conspiracy is <em>much</em> broader than this one specific set of allegations concerning Trump/Russia. I don&#39;t want to ban discussion of it here, but there are threads every day on nearly every other large and small political or news sub, in addition  to dozens or more subs set up specifically to document, analyze, or meme the topic. </p>

<p>And it is specific users, not the topic itself, which correlate with drowning out other conversation. What should we make of a user who&#39;s had an account here for several years, posting mainly in r/politics, and then for a month and a half, decides to start posting here and makes 700 comments in this sub in that period? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see my username there listed. I think I would know if I am a shill or not and i am certianly not. What have I done that would lead you to make this judgement? Dare to hold both sides to the same standard? Dare to be critical of astroturfing? Dare to be critical of Trump? I get shit on by either ShareBlue or the Trump people depending on what i post. They both hate me because i post things that counter their narrative. And they are both part of the establishment.  And conversely some of my posts that are critical of one side are liked by the other and vice versa. I am about anti establishment as it gets.  And if you think being critical of CA makes one suspect it&#39;s you that are the problem. Just like anybody that thinks ShareBlue is okay is the problem.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here but it goes against the spirit of this sub and maybe there isn&#39;t a place for people willing to criticize both sides here anymore. And maybe this isn&#39;t a place for me anymore.  It damn sure feels that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t put your name on any list. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a shill, because I don&#39;t really recognize your username, but you are green in my RES so I must have upvoted you at least a few times. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how I even feel about that list in the first place, whether public or private. In general, I think there are users here which do more to distract and slide conversation, rather than seeing this as a sub to learn and share knowledge and ideas, but calling for names like that would inevitably lead to witch hunts and mischaracterizations. If a user&#39;s criteria for putting someone on that list was &quot;often supports the MSM Trump/Russia narrative,&quot; then that&#39;s going to sweep up a lot of good users, too. </p>

<p>I do think the idea came from a good place, though. You even point out that you call out astroturfing, and it certainly exists on this sub and reddit more broadly. When it comes to calling out specific users as trolls and shills, it&#39;s going to get turned around as well, either by bad actors themselves, or by genuine users getting it wrong. Though I&#39;m not sure how we can really identify shills, or even just disruptive users without listing usernames in some form or another. It truly is a wicked problem. </p>

Like you said it could sweep up well intentioned users but it can also be abused if people have agendas you are not aware of. For the record I have never pushed the Trump/Russia narrative because I don&#39;t believe it. I actually argue against it. This is clearly just a hit job on me because I have the audacity to criticize Trump (who should be shown no allegiance on this sub) and CA and the methods they use on this sub. Keep an eye out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see my username there listed. I think I would know if I am a shill or not and i am certianly not. What have I done that would lead you to make this judgement? Dare to hold both sides to the same standard? Dare to be critical of astroturfing?  I get shit on by either ShareBlue or the Trump people depending on what i post They bother hatell me because i post thinges that counter their narrative..  And conversely some of my posts that are critical of one side are liked by the other and vice versa. I am about anti establishment as it gets.  And if you think being critical of CA makes one suspect it&#39;s you that are the problem.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here but it goes against the spirit of this sub and maybe there isn&#39;t a place for people willing to criticize both sides here anymore. And maybe this isn&#39;t a place for me anymore.  It damn sure feels that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is essentially &quot;ban the leftists and anyone that thinks trump is a scbag&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes I talk about trump on here an awful lot, but it brought up a lot in this sub (and not by me either).  I&#39;ve made some posts regarding trump, but not all of my posts have to do with trump.  And yeah, I think he&#39;s guilty of some shitty things, but have any of you assholes in that sub taken the time to ask me exactly what I think of it all?  Fuck no you haven&#39;t!   Instead you retreat to your little safespace and try to scheme ways to ban people without making it obvious you&#39;re targeting people because they disagree with you.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s cowardly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s outrageous.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disheartening. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a mod that&#39;s too deep in that subs bullshit, you should be removed.  If you&#39;re a mod who contributes to that sub, stop pretending that your concern is free speech, because it&#39;s not.  You just don&#39;t want anyone to disagree with you.  You&#39;re just as bad as those you pretend to hate.  You hate them so much you emulate their behavior?  </p>

<p>Look at yourselves.  You&#39;ve become what you hate.  You can&#39;t be trusted in the position you&#39;re in.  Do the right thing and remove yourselves from the mod team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that we&#39;ll never see eye to eye politically, especially on the Trump/Russia, but I guess I do want to try to explain how things feel around here as a lefty conspiracy junkie. </p>

<p>When I was younger, I wasted days on end reading all the 9/11 conspiracy stuff I could find. Everything from the Bush administration swapped the planes in air for drones/military aircraft and had all the passengers killed, to the lighter (and, imo far more plausible) Cheney and friends allowed it to happen for financial and geopolitical reasons.  I remember doing a presentation in a high school AP class about how the Bush admin was drumming up war in Iraq on flimsy reasoning. I&#39;ve re-read John Titor&#39;s claims about the left-right divide and WW3 more times than I should probably admit. </p>

<p>My personal experiences with conspiracies have always had a left leaning to them. I know that&#39;s not what everyone thinks, and that frankly I&#39;m probably in the minority among the conspiracy community. But, the comparison I&#39;d make for today (with what I and others feel is supression of talk about Trump/Russia on this sub) is like if it were 2002 and the sub didn&#39;t allow any discussion of 9/11 conspiracies. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s the President and he&#39;s under Federal investigation for possible conspiracy against the United States! How can people not want to talk about that? I want to hear your side and I want to talk about my side! Why can&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I feel like must be ways to facilitate that kind of discussion without immediately devolving into shill accusations. More forceful moderation of shill accusations? Removing the downvote button so things don&#39;t get buried? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not an expert on this shit, but I wish we could do better.</p>

<p>So, are you saying your stance is that, for the r/conspiracy sub to be working properly, it needs to be steered by some <strong>covert</strong> but influential organization of users?</p>

<p>I feel like you&#39;re missing the word &quot;covert.&quot; Obviously mods are necessary for every subreddit. Most subreddits don&#39;t have separate private subreddits that invite users to influence moderation policy secretly.</p>

<p>What&#39;s with secret cabals where non-mods get to add anyone they want to purge lists and then invent new rules to censor them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Banning accounts whose majority post history within this subreddit is just pushing mainstream media talking points and attacking free thinkers is actually a good thing.  </p>

<p>So you support censorship of unpopular opinions, do you? How deliciously ironic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because this user is an alt for one of the conclave users and they know and are okay with this. I assume that it&#39;s putin_loves_cats based on the way the user speaks, the hours that they are active,  and that they weren&#39;t activated until shillsonacid received a 7 day ban. </p>

<p>The fact this user is allowed to operate in such a manner tells me that the mods who are most vocal of a shill problem only care about one type of &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I should have to report this either,  as you&#39;ve said mods are all over thus thread and should interject without anyone needing to cry out for help.</p>
