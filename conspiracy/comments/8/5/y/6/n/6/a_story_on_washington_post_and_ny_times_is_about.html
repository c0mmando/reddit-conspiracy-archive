       I was convinced that there was something to the "paternity information" in the NDA but her lawyer said there is nothing related to that in what they are claiming.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are focusing on how Trump and his lawyer physically threatened her into signing it. The report in her lie detector is already out

       Not morally outraged, just absolutely shocked that people do not care about this news. I mean you must at least have some opinion on it, even if it is "good for him, does not disqualify him to serve as a president".

       If Trump has a type, it is Gold Digging Whore.

       He paid her to go away. He probably paid her to fuck him too. Cash and gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact is, they had a consensual relationship. She signed a confidentiality agreement. She signed it in exchange for $130k.

      <p>
       She’s been leaking everything to the press.

       Fair enough. So what would be enough for you on the personal side of the president, to care? What if it turned out that he was born female? What if he turned out to be a practicizing muslim?

       I know these are hypotheticals, I'm just genuinely interested.

       I’m an atheist so I’m not a big fan of religion in politics period.

       I didn’t care that Michelle Obama was born a man. 😉

       That does make sense why she specifically was asked, in the lie detector test, if she had
       <em>
        unprotected
       </em>
       sex with Trump. What's the point of asking otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I believe this will make absolutely no difference. The same men who shame women and girls who decide to have abortions for whatever personal reasons (including rape and molestation) will brush off whatever Trump does, up to and including abortion.

       If Trump has a type, it is Gold Digging Whore.
      </p>
      <p>
       He paid her to go away. He probably paid her to fuck him too. Cash and gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact is, they had a consensual relationship. She signed a confidentiality agreement. She signed it in exchange for $130k.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s been leaking everything to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       She should be sued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if Melania wanted to divorce him and take half for fucking this Gold Digging Whore, I wouldn’t have a problem with it.
