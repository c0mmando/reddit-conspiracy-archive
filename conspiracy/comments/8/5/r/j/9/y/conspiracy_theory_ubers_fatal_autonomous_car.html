        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Background</h1>

<p>For anyone who isn&#39;t in the loop, one of Uber&#39;s self-driving cars got into an accident yesterday, killing a pedestrian. You can read about the indecent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17139518/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-crash-tempe-arizona">here</a>.</p>

<p>For context, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/20/uber-volvo-suv-self-driving-future-business-ride-hailing-lyft-waymo">Uber announced last year that they planned to buy 24000 autonomous cars from Volvo</a>. </p>

<h1>Theory</h1>

<p>The tech behind autonomous cars is pretty decent so far, but still in its infancy. <a href="http://zbigatron.com/why-is-image-processing-so-hard/">Computer vision is hard</a>, and still has a long way to go. It will get there. But statistically speaking, rolling out this many autonomous cars at once is a recipe for disaster. I&#39;m not suggesting that Uber did anything malicious like sabotage the vehicle or neglect to ensure that it was properly maintained. But it seems more than likely to me that they must have been aware of the statistical probability of a fatality happening at the scale that they were operating at. Further, I believe this accident will actually benefit them, which only strengthens their motivation to adopt the technology on such a wide scale...</p>

<h1>Motive</h1>

<p>I think Uber&#39;s motive for adopting autonomous cars is pretty much crystal clear... But aside from the obvious first-mover advantage, and the fact that the liability for this accident will probably fall largely on the manufacturer and not on Uber, the <em>accident itself</em> is actually beneficial for Uber.</p>

<p>Obviously, the company is losing money in the short run off of this accident. They&#39;ve temporarily suspended all autonomous operations. And I&#39;m sure there will be lawsuits (even if they aren&#39;t found to be 100% liable), etc. But what about long term?</p>

<p>An accident like this demonstrates that autonomous cars are <em>dangerous</em>. And if they&#39;re dangerous, maybe we should <em>regulate</em> them. Why might Uber want regulations on the autonomous car? Because they know that autonomous cars are an inevitable part of our future, and they want to make it harder for you or I to buy one, or for entrepreneurs to start their own competing fleets, because they want us to use their service - Uber, the ones with the first-mover advantage. </p>

<p>In an ironic way, this recent accident will ultimately create barriers to entry for Uber&#39;s future competitors. Uber doesn&#39;t want just anyone to run their own fleet. Just like any other competitive company, they want to own a monopoly. And they&#39;ll get it, because they&#39;re already the biggest company doing ride sharing with the most lobbying power.</p>

<h1>Proof (Of Motive)</h1>

<p>I&#39;m glad you asked. Uber has signed onto a document called <a href="https://www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org/">&quot;Shared Mobility Principles for Sustainable Cities&quot;</a>. Most of the principals on the list seem benign... but then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>10. WE SUPPORT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (AVS) IN DENSE URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE OPERATED ONLY IN SHARED FLEETS.</strong>
Due to the transformational potential of autonomous vehicle technology, it is critical that all AVs are part of shared fleets, well-regulated, and zero emission. Shared fleets can provide more affordable access to all, maximize public safety and emissions benefits, ensure that maintenance and software upgrades are managed by professionals, and actualize the promise of reductions in vehicles, parking, and congestion, in line with broader policy trends to reduce the use of personal cars in dense urban areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So basically, they&#39;re coming for your cars.</strong> This cannot happen by itself. It requires a regulatory ban on non-fleet self-driving cars in cities. This requires public support. Uber benefits by people fearing autonomous cars, and demanding tight regulations in the name of safety. There are several benefits here:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will ultimately be forced to use a ride sharing program to get to work or live your life.</li>
<li>The resulting licensing infrastructure will inevitably make it extremely difficult and expensive for competitors to enter the market.</li>
<li>Having a monopoly on purchasing cars gives them an enormous amount of buying power that they can use to force manufactures to drop their prices as low as possible.</li>
<li>Having a monopoly on car sharing (and cars in general) gives them an enormous amount of selling power that they can use to price gouge consumers.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Closing Remarks</h1>

<p>I believe this is all inevitable. While the accident can be used as a data point to speed up the process of AVS monopolization, all of the economics for this line up perfectly. I could do a whole other post on this explaining step by step how governments will position themselves to revoke your right to own a car, but I won&#39;t because I don&#39;t want to spam the sub. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-qutvIqsg">Just check out this video if you have 20 minutes and an interest in economics</a>. </p>

<p>I want to be clear that I&#39;m not accusing Uber of negligence or homicide. The choice to use autonomous cars may ultimately save more lives long term, and could very well be safer than using human drivers. I respect Uber, and I like their business model. But don&#39;t make the mistake of assuming that their intentions are completely genuine. I believe full-heartedly that they have a vested interest in monopolizing the ride sharing industry.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TLDR Edit:</strong> Allows Uber to push for regulation on autonomous vehicles that would allow them to monopolize ride sharing and prevent consumers from operating their own car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I HATE bicyclists.  They commit moving violations every minute, and the have a nasty habit of teleporting into and out of existence with no warning. </p>

<p>My auto insurance went way up that one time when one dipshit biker decides to come barreling along the road at 25 miles per hour into incoming green light and gets bumped by me, writhing in pain while he&#39;s thinking to himself: &quot;jackpot&quot;.  </p>

<p>The problem with Bicyclists is that they&#39;re precisely the same people who had their drivers license taken away.  They raise my blood pressure just having them nearby, expect them to do the stupidest things at the stupidest times.  When a story comes around: &quot;Bicyclist gets mowed down by whatever&quot; I automatically think of the dipshit bicyclist who made my rates go up.</p>

<p>When driving, always ask yourself: &quot;Might a bicycle be incoming at 25mph the wrong way up a sidewalk and materializing from behind a 5 foot tall hedge?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the state I was in at the time, any injurious contact between a bicyclist and car is at fault of the driver regardless of how much law the bicyclist was breaking.  You think I exaggerate with the &quot;Automobile is always at fault&quot;, but I don&#39;t.  Bicyclists regularly plough into parked and stopped cars with people in them, and the bicyclist can say the car was inappropriately parked, and still the car&#39;s insurance applies.  Reason for this being that bicyclists are often uninsured people (people who&#39;ve lost their car licenses) and are in poverty, and the socialist government loves shifting costs and placing the burden of healing it&#39;s lower classes by cost shifting responsibility to the nearest entity who might have had something to do with it, even if they weren&#39;t at fault.</p>

<p>He tried to take me for the sun, moon and stars, but luckily I was a smart cookie and got pleanty of photographs of his undamaged bike, the fact that he was standing and walking after the event, and the picture of exactly where the bike and car made contact via skuffs.  </p>

<p>His lawyer tried to talk up the claim like he was tossed around like a rag doll and thrown 50 feet into oncoming traffic with a totaled bike. But I was able to get up in the business of the insurance agency and claim, and they were able to shut most of that shit right down.</p>

<p>If you stay on it and are diligent, you can at least quarantine the damage, but still.  I hate bicyclists on the road. You so much as breath on one and they fall down, and you get taken for all they can get away with that you can&#39;t unprove.  Guilty until proven innocent.  </p>

<p>Not America.  At least not recently.  Look at ISP&#39;s.  There&#39;s only 1 to choose from in any given area and the citizenry are practically rioting for it, yet the government is still pushing hard on consolidating the top 10 ISP&#39;s into one mega-corporation so they can absorb it into the government.</p>

<p>Then look at computers.  There is Apple and Microsoft.  </p>

<p>Cars is a rare exception, but that&#39;s because of dealerships who force regulate competition in that international market.  </p>

<p>The American government is going to want to absorb all smaller companies into one big super-corporation so that without even a stroke of a pen, the government can say: &quot;let us put a beam splitter in your office or else you&#39;re out of business&quot; and then boom.  That&#39;s a one shot one kill on free market capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine works at Lyft. Years ago, when Lifts announced its own self-driving car technology, I wrote her asking if they saw transportation becoming a utility and she responded &quot;Yes, exactly.&quot;</p>

<p>They want to become the new power company, only for transportation. Note that this will mean both that you are tracked everywhere you go, and that your access to transportation can be cut off at any time. Imagine wanting to control a mass protest in the future. In addition to cutting of internet, autocrats could cancel transportation as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing though, you will still be able to own your own autonomous car (i.e. Tesla) so you would be able to go where you would want.

You would still be able to secure your own autonomous vehicle but it would be more expensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber is actually lobbying to make it illegal to own a self driving car so no,if all goes according to plan you won&#39;t be able to have one. They literally want to lock us out of buying self driving cars. Next step is to prove (and they will be able to) its &quot;too dangerous&quot; to drive normal cars. I&#39;m sure the argument for us not being able to own one will be that the manufacturer need to make sure all sensors and shit are working fine and proper maintenance is done, etc. Proving normal cars are too dangerous vs self driving will be even easier. The whole concept of self driving car is built to remove us from owning the best private transportation method the average man can buy. Imagine the control they will have. There&#39;s a reason these businesses are worth as much as they do and it ain&#39;t because of their profit margins. </p>

<p>Well i can imagine some special license for those needing in the interest of a business. It already works like this for many different kinds of licenses and permits.

<li>WE SUPPORT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (AVS) IN DENSE URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE OPERATED ONLY IN SHARED FLEETS. </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the transformational potential of autonomous vehicle technology, it is critical that all AVs are part of shared fleets, well-regulated, and zero emission. Shared fleets can provide more affordable access to all, maximize public safety and emissions benefits, ensure that maintenance and software upgrades are managed by professionals, and actualize the promise of reductions in vehicles, parking, and congestion, in line with broader policy trends to reduce the use of personal cars in dense urban areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, and personally believe that kind of system works very well in the small scale. It&#39;s sort of the same problem with federal government having say over so many people, there is no way you can look after everyone and ensure people are being treated/paid fairly. At the same time the likelihood that a small company is bringing in the insane revenue that a company like WalMart is pretty slim. In your example you said you&#39;d pay someone $20 an hour to take out trash, that is much better then what a large corporation would pay (likely minimum wage depending on state requirements) in my own experiences large companies are (nicely put) <em>indifferent</em> because they know they can hire the next person at that same pay rate or lower.</p>

If an employee only does what the company trains them to do, and uses only their equipment, then yessir I would be more agreeable to a cap based on what other employees are making.

    <div class="md"><p>Those people do get fair recompense, its called a wage or contract. You get paid the market value of your labor. Skilled laborers make good money. Unskilled labor does not, but that is because it isn&#39;t worth much.</p>

<p>&quot;Social ramifications&quot; is a meaningless blanket statement for when you have no sturdy argument. People get paid to do a job, if they can&#39;t do it they are fired, and if they are displeased with the work they are free to leave and seek other employment. People only work marginally better with better pay, but the job ends up costing more than their labor is worth. </p>

<p>An employer is running a business, he is taking on massive stakes in stock or asset value and has the right to negotiate payment contracts. He owns the damn thing. </p>

<p>its already happening with housing and transportation. along with the examples in this post, hedge funds are buying up as many houses as they can and making it so normal people cant afford to purchase homes. also, condos and apartments are squeezing out single family residences in tons of large metropolitan-and-surrounding areas. </p>

<p>Elon musk has way more money than uber. So it&#39;s doubtful he&#39;d let them regulate away the autopilot for Teslas.</p>

<p>Overall though, you&#39;re also going to see the media being insanely sensationalist with autonomous vehicle accidents. There were 40,000 automobile deaths in the US in 2016. That&#39;s 110 people <em>every day</em>. How many of those deaths did you hear about on the news, though? None, because it&#39;s normal, and there&#39;s car ads in between TV &quot;news&quot; stories. So even though autonomous vehicles are far safer than human drivers, the media will prey on people&#39;s technological and statistical ignorance. </p>

<p>My question though--if a person runs into someone and kills them, sometimes they can be charged with vehicular manslaughter, etc...whats the deal when its self driving?  Like...who is held accountable?  Who does the jail-time?  I think the problem with autonomous cars will be responsibility.  The owner of the &#39;&#39;fleet&#39;&#39; has to pay all the fines, or do jailtime for the accident of the autonomous car?  </p>

<p>I have a hard time seeing how accountability plays into these cases...</p>

<p>But Tesla is starting the same sort of program. They benefit from this. This is what the Model 3 was ultimately built for.

    <div class="md"><p>a rich businessman i knew was the first importer of VéloSoleX in North America, that was back in the 60s. On his first shipment, his son was tasked to go drive around the local police station until he got arrested. When he did and got a ticket for not wearing a helmet (mandatory for motorcycles in canada), the guy brought a very well prepared case and a bunch of lawyers to the court to contest that helmet ticket. </p>

<p>The result was that he convinced them this isnt a motorbike but isnt a bike either. they created a new category based on the specs of HIS product, which he was the exclusive distributor of for a long while. Therefore it was an incredible barrier to entry for any other solex-like vehicle because they had to fit the specs of Solex, like engine size, where the motor was located, wheels, etc.</p>

<p>All this to say that you are very correct to think they have a lot to gain from this, even if it isn&#39;t premeditated.</p>

<p>This is classic powerful people strategy of molding laws to their advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have an up vote, but I still am having a problem with running the numbers on how autonomious ELECTRIC cars in huge fleets are supposed to pay for road maintenence like independant gas drivers do. Even if they get charged double the power cost and registration fees it still wont equal the same revenues currently generated. More taxes?  Yeah right. America is the highest taxed nation already, and in the highest populated areas (which are the target ones) registrations and fuel taxes are already pissing people off.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just gas, it&#39;s all the lost income tax of people who will be put out of work, car sales, lost revenues in traffic fines, etc. This is going to seriously threaten governments. And yea... taxes are one solution; the other is to allow someone like Uber to price gouge consumers, and tax Uber to cover the lost tax revenues. </p>

<p>Of course, at the end of the day that government spending still gets paid for by consumers in the form of higher prices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a lot of this makes no sense.</p>

<p>First, SDCs are already heavily regulated.</p>

<p>Second, the barrier to entry into the industry is already ridiculously high. This is why you don&#39;t see a bunch of small shops leading the technology on this, because you need to have large team that is willing to eat billions of dollars to develop it.</p>

<p>Third, we really haven&#39;t had a legal test yet as to who is liable for crashes. It seems like it &quot;likely&quot; being the manufacturer is just kind of thrown in there with no real support. It would be a real gamble for them to see how this plays out.</p>

<p>Fourth, where&#39;s the conspiracy? Of course there are going to be accidents, the technology isn&#39;t perfect and, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/03/19/uber-self-driving-car-crash/">it looks like this one likely wasn&#39;t even the car&#39;s fault.</a> So, sure, accidents are to be expected, but this doesn&#39;t even seem to be a case of &quot;SDCs are dangerous&quot; just something that happens all the time: a careless pedestrian getting hit by a car.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how to word this last part. You claim they aren&#39;t guilty of murder or negligence, but if they did something know full well someone would get killed, they did it anyway, and they did so for their own benefit, this would likely be first degree murder. But if they aren&#39;t guilty of murder, then there was no intent for this to happen, thus there was no &quot;motive&quot; because that is what is behind an intentional death.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just as likely that they want this tech to come sooner rather than later, and want to beat everyone else to it, which is their motive for getting the cars on the road as soon as possible.</p>

<p>So if there was no motive, they have no control over it, then where is the conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SDCs are regulated - but this post has nothing to do with manufacturing SDCs. The regulation on who can operate a SDC is almost universally accepted to become more lenient, as the technology progresses.</p>

<p>The barrier to entry is high now because it requires an enormous amount of R&amp;D. In the future, that will no longer be the case. You will hypothetically be able to buy a Tesla and when you&#39;re not using it, you can send it to be a taxi and earn you money. This is actually already a planned Tesla feature - look it up.

1. In the US we also call ourselves free. We are about as free as we are capitalist. That is to say we look like we&#39;re free but in reality there is a lot that isn&#39;t free about our country. Basically just because we all ourselves capitalist doesn&#39;t mean we are.
2. Not sure why you even said that. We both agree lol
3. Their support for regulations may be public, but the plot is to use the regulation to form a monopoly. I assure you they wouldn&#39;t tell anyone they hoped to become a monopoly. Thus the secrecy.</p>

<p>Well we can&#39;t have a discussion when words don&#39;t mean what they mean. All these definitions are complex social constructs. When we say that we are free, we never mean unbounded freedom, we mean that we are free but are also subjects to rules, laws, and regulations. </p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s not a plot. That&#39;s how markets work. Every corporation&#39;s wet dream is to become a monopoly. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a secret, its Economics 101.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no a secret that they will lobby government officials to these ends. AND ONLY when &quot;government&quot; secretly go along with that plan does it become a conspiracy. We&#39;ve seen nothing of the sort in this case yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m not saying capitalism means anything other than the definition I already told you. All I said is that just because the US calls itself capitalist doesn&#39;t mean they actually adhere to all the traits of capitalism. I also never said anything about anarcho-capitalism. You&#39;re right it&#39;s a different thing and nothing to do with what I said. You&#39;ll have to do a bit better arguing that it&#39;s not a plot lol. You can&#39;t just say &quot;no it&#39;s not&quot;. We all know companies would like to be monopolies of course. Companies know that consumers hate monopolies so it IS a secret that they are lobbying to that end. They are trying to imply that it is to protect consumers and pedestrians. You understand how this isn&#39;t a problem with capitalism though right? Capitalism would let the market decide how safe a product is, not the govt.</p>

<p>I said its a &quot;consequence of capitalism&quot; not a &quot;problem with capitalism&quot;. The word &quot;consequence&quot; is generally free of any subjective evaluations. </p>

<p>Simply put, if you have a political and economic system such as we have,  the companies will lobby to their advantage. &quot;Advantage&quot; in this case implies anything that will help them to maximize their profits (which is the point of capitalism). Corporations lobby because of capitalism. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re speaking past each other at this point though, so I&#39;l OK with letting this go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consequence/problem doesn&#39;t matter lol. My point (which I guess did just fly by you) was the our system isn&#39;t capitalist. So this lobbying for monopoly isn&#39;t a consequence or problem with capitalism. If America were capitalist, govt wouldn&#39;t get involved in regulating the market. What will the company&#39;s lobby for? Nothing. They won&#39;t. So &quot;Corporations lobby because of capitalism.&quot; Is wrong. I am fine with letting this go too though gg.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a word, but a word that encompasses a lot larger concepts than what is defined in any dictionary.</p>

<p>Let me quote you a wikipedia here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The degree of competition in markets, the role of intervention and regulation and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism.[9] The extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, are matters of politics and policy. Most existing capitalist economies are mixed economies, which combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning.[10]</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you&#39;re referencing specifically is something like laissez-faire capitalism or anarcho-capitalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the conspiracy depends on how they will play this out. Here&#39;s an example.</p>

<p>a rich businessman i knew was the first importer of VéloSoleX in North America, that was back in the 60s. On his first shipment, his son was tasked to go drive around the local police station until he got arrested. When he did and got a ticket for not wearing a helmet (mandatory for motorcycles in canada), the guy brought a very well prepared case and a bunch of lawyers to the court to contest that helmet ticket. </p>

<p>The result was that he convinced them this isnt a motorbike but isnt a bike either. they created a new category based on the specs of HIS product, which he was the exclusive distributor of for a long while. Therefore it was an incredible barrier to entry for any other solex-like vehicle because they had to fit the specs of Solex, like engine size, where the motor was located, wheels, etc.</p>

<p>This is classic powerful people strategy of molding laws to their advantage. Is Uber doing that? Since they are already lobbying for forcing autonomous cars as a rent-only model, you could say that yes, they do. Are they going to use this care to further their goals. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>OP levels some very serious allegations on the Uber executives then tries to back away from them by saying &quot;I want to be clear that I&#39;m not accusing Uber of negligence or homicide.&quot; when much of his post does exactly that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the old saying &quot;Don&#39;t pee on my feet and tell me it&#39;s raining&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting dynamic in conversation.

<p>Then his whole post boils down to &quot;Uber is going to be able to benefit from this accident and here&#39;s how.&quot; which isn&#39;t really a conspiracy.  There is a phrase that perfectly captures this mindset and that is &quot;There is no such thing as bad publicity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to disagree with you but you&#39;re right on a lot of things. I especially questioned your statement that Uber will be NOT at fault.  The Tempe police chief has already said that he believes that preliminarily. Sheesh. </p>

<p>I would have initially thought that it would be bad for self driving cars and that there would be calls to prohibit them but Nope. Not a peep. Crazy. They&#39;re already pointing the finger at the pedestrian. </p>

<p>OK: she crossed outside a crosswalk, which is stupid and illegal, but it should not be given a death sentence. The real question to me is: Would a human driver have seen and stopped in time? Was the safety driver paying attention?</p>

<p>I have read stories of Tesla drivers lounging in the back seat of their cars and using orange wedges on the wheels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Tempe and I actually blamed the pedestrian as well when I heard cross streets of the accident. Without even seeing the pedestrian’s photo, I assumed drug addict, strung out, or something walks in front of Uber. Now that I have seen her photo I think I was probably right. </p>

<p>I hope there is dash cam video we can see because I bet a human driver would have struck her as well. We have a lot of accidents like that around here, unfortunately. This is just the first one with a self driving car.</p>

<p>I feel badly for the pedestrian but I feel worse for the woman who was behind the wheel. Although technically she wasn’t driving, she still has to feel some kind of responsibility for this persons death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. You&#39;re asking all the right questions. The answer is quite long and complex. But this transition is inevitable. Autonomous cars are a cannibalistic product in that cars on the road directly compete with car sales.

They are on rails headed for a cliff at full speed, and the ground is crumbling behind them.</p>

Clearly that&#39;s a huge threat to Uber. Then there&#39;s the fact that half the reason people ride share in the city is to avoid the issue of parking, a problem autonomous vehicles will eliminate. It only makes sense that Uber would try to shape the conversation, but that document&#39;s on the level of prison unions lobbying against the legalization of pot. Autonomous cars will inevitably turn out to be much safer than manually operated ones. Fuck anybody who says we shouldn&#39;t be able to privately own them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would a pedestrian being hit have anything to do with all cars being autonomous or not?  The crash happened right across the street from me near the Marquee Theater in Tempe on Sunday night.  It sounds like the fatality was frankly the fault of the pedestrian who wasn&#39;t using the crosswalk properly nor crossing the street safely.  If Uber wants to speed up ALL cars becoming self-driving, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for the crash to include a non-self driving car, not a pedestrian?  I&#39;m not understanding your logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think lots of people will be able to produce in cottage industry, but the basic needs of society should be met without the profit motive in the most efficient manner possible for the benefit of all citizens.  If you want to go make super car in a shed after you spend your two hours a day filling potholes I don&#39;t think anyone would stop you. However you will have to figure out a way to get Workers to go along with you if you need them without the threat of starvation hanging over their head.  This may change the investor employer-employee relationship rather significantly, for the better.  I would also think that if you created a business that covered your own needs and your own taxes that you wouldn&#39;t need another job to receive the various levels of consumer goods and you could provide your own, without having to work at a nationalized industry.  If you wanted say an electric F-150 from Ford to go mudding then on the other hand there would be a certain amount of exponentially decreasing jobs which needed to be done by human hands that you could participate in in order to get yours quicker.</p>

<p>People will have spending money.  Odd jobs will occur.  Exploitation if the entire society by profit takers who do no work will end.</p>

<p>When the government and all of the American people have put so much into growing and developing a company such as Ford then that should the long to eat people and not to random investors.  People&#39;s retirement should be guaranteed and not require investment, People&#39;s Health Care and food and such should not be sending Prophets to faceless individuals who will then hide that money in offshore accounts where it can never again grow the economy.</p>

<p>Hopefully Uber can&#39;t keep real competition out forever, but this is definitely a big win for them in the long game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. You have convinced me that Uber wants us out of our own personal cars for our own personal trips. However Uber the company is pretty much the cheapest, risk averse company out there. Their whole model to date is putting all the liability and expense on to their drivers. It is hard to imagine them owning/ leasing, insuring, and maintaining their own fleet.</p>

<p>Maybe they will only &quot;hire&quot; &quot;drivers&quot; who have self driving cars. If you own a self driving car you could lease it to Uber. </p>

Fire up the willing engine, responding with a roar!<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand after reading several articles (and I live in a neighboring city so it&#39;s huge news here) it was a pedestrian who very suddenly jaywalked into the street late at night. I&#39;ve driven through Tempe and the surrounding areas late and night and have had a close call or two myself with pedestrians darting out into traffic regardless of the presence of a crosswalk or not. </p>

<p>However, you do have a point here. Unless the human was somehow distracted they should have reacted by immediately slamming on the brakes, or swerving, or doing SOMETHING. The whole thing seems a bit odd in a way. And as OP or someone in the comments said, a rollout of autonomous vehicles in an urban area like this was bound to cause problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m late to the party in this threat but personally I think taking cars away from private citizens is a necessary move toward safety.  Make note of how it specifically mentions dense, urban sectors.  This will only apply to city driving.  You will still be able to own your own vehicle (likely also autonomous) and take it outside the city for things like camping trips or long distance travel from city to city, among other examples.  People shouldn&#39;t be driving cars, because too many of them are too stupid to do it safely.</p>

For all we know the accident could&#39;ve been unavoidable for the driver when she stepped out into the road since she wasn&#39;t making use of a crosswalk (and as such didn&#39;t have the benefit of traffic signals). Autonomous or not, this situation probably would&#39;ve been avoided had the woman been paying attention to her surroundings and oncoming traffic before attempting to cross the road at night without using a crosswalk.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about safety, my argument would be that handing over more power to government is the least-safe thing you can do. Politicians can be bought and sold by corporations. My fear is that these regulations will be used to allow ride share monopolies to price gouge and increase the cost of living for millions of people. The people who this will hurt the most will be people sitting at or below the poverty line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She may have stepped out at a point where there would have been no time to prevent impact. The accident was at night meaning visibility was limited. If a person steps out into the path of your car and you can only see them when they get illuminated by the headlights it&#39;s pretty much game over for them, at that short distance there is practically zero time for a driver to react and avoid them. Hitting the brakes the instant they were seen wouldn&#39;t have even slowed it enough to make any discernible difference due to the laws of physics.</p>

<p>Ridesharing services will probably only be as prevalent as most of us dystopian cynics imagine them in our worst nightmares, in the most dense urban areas, and still mostly only for people that are actually living in and around those areas. Everywhere else they&#39;ll probably be used mostly for travelling to and from airports and to consume drugs at bars, clubs, lounges etc. without putting the lives of others in danger. Owning and operating a car will most likely be the same as it is now for a majority of people.</p>

<p>Look at Japan, for example. The cities accommodate a car-free lifestyle very well. People who live in the suburbs, however, experience a much higher cost-of-ownership. Higher taxes and registration fees, higher gas prices, higher insurance costs, stricter emissions regulations... And almost every highway is a toll highway. It costs more to drive from Tokyo to Osaka than to take a train.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100&amp;#37; agree. This is very similar to one of the guys who helped design the framework around bitcoin and digital currency regulation in NY and then once he left a public facing position he went corporate and was a consultant for tons of companies telling them how to exploit the loopholes that he designed. This is the reverse of that.</p>

<p>Step 1. Accident like yesterday happens.</p>

<p>Step 2. Uber says &quot;We are working when the government to assure this doesn&#39;t happen again&quot;</p>

<p>Step 3. Uber directly designs the legislation with the government to control how automated vehicles work.</p>

<p>Step 4. Uber shifts all the regulation to benefit them and the public is none the wiser.</p>

This seems like a way to carve out something that should have been a shared taxpayer funded resource (like public transportation) and instead give it to a large company for profit to be run in a manner that is harmful to the general public.

    <div class="md"><p>Expected: Yes.  Eventually an automated car would kill someone.</p>

<p>But it seems that the police have reviewed the video and she stepped right in front of the car out from the shadows.  Nobody could have stopped in time.</p>

<p>So yes, this is desirable for the company and industry as well.</p>

<p>As for the #10 portion... well yes, this makes sense too.  I suppose you could buy an autonomous car and let it sit idle most of the day... however, that&#39;s not ideal.  It&#39;s a resource taking up space and doing nothing.  If I owned one I would reserve it for certain hours of the day, but I would let a company utilize it to make money for me during the day giving other people rides.  Eventually most people won&#39;t own cars.  However, some individuals will likely own many.  This has been the vision of all autonomous vehicle makers because it just makes sense.  It has nothing to do with &#39;we should run all this shit&#39; it&#39;s more about how the technology will change the way we do things.  </p>

<p>If I had the option of paying for a ride sharing subscription that ended up being cheaper than my car payment, I&#39;d likely do that.  Most people would as well, so why bother with the expense of owning a car?  Though you could to make extra money, think of it like landlords and renters vs. everyone owning their own home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you own the car, you&#39;d get a profit from it, otherwise why would you let them use it in the first place?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t own a car but you are just paying to be able to use a vehicle, obviously you wouldn&#39;t get a profit.  But just like when you rent an apartment vs. buy a house, it&#39;s just a monthly fee instead of a heavy investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with having the computer do most of the easy work while the driver spaces out and relaxes is that when things get tough suddenly, the human driver hasn&#39;t been paying attention and doesn&#39;t have time (or eventually, the skills) to operate the vehicle.  This is most pilots&#39; argument against too much automation in aircraft.  Instead of leaving the easy stuff to the computer, and dumping the hardest tasks on the human, it should be the other way around.  The computer should assist a human driver when the situation is the most challenging (with night vision, with antiskid braking, with safety features).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the article:
On March 18, 2018 at approximately 10pm, Tempe PD responded to a traffic collision on Curry Road and Mill Avenue in Tempe, Arizona. </p>

<p>She was not on her bike, she was walking her bike across the road.</p>

<p>Yes it was dark. But look at the location in google maps. </p>

<p>There are no trees anywhere near the road. There&#39;s no parking allowed there (she could not have darted out from behind a parked car).  There are bike lanes on both side of the road. The bike lanes cross the intersection, but the road crossing is not marked like a crosswalk (with the cross hatching), the crossing is just two lines.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see how that is her fault. She was cycling at night on the roads the city provided for the purpose.  </p>

<p>The vehicle involved is one of the Uber’s self-driving vehicles. It was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a vehicle operator behind the wheel. The vehicle was traveling northbound just south of Curry Road when a female walking outside of the crosswalk crossed the road from west to east when she was struck by the Uber vehicle. The female was identified as 49 year old Elaine Herzberg. Herzberg was transported to a local area hospital where she passed away from her injuries. Uber is assisting and this is still an active investigation.</p>

<p>Look at the Euronews video on Liveleak.  It shows the area very well, along with the bicycle with the bent frame, hung with shopping bags. </p>

It is an interesting strategy but the losses the auto companies would have from not being able to sell to the general public would be astronomical and surely they would do everything in their power to stop that. Maybe I’m wrong and Uber is bigger than I realize. It’s not unlike them to do some shady shit that’s for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the failings of AI (other than dealing with weather or some failing sensor) is that they still lack some level of insight or prediction of intention. If you&#39;re any good at driving you try to think at least 10 moves ahead of anything going on down the route you plan on thinking. If somebody down the way looks screwy and like they&#39;re just going to waltz out into traffic, you tend to either slow down or change lanes away from the sidewalk before you even get up to where they are in order to better avoid them.</p>

<p>So this shows that particular shortcoming. Somebody just walked out in front of an AI car without paying any attention. And it was too close for braking or the avoidance programming to react. Sucks, but that&#39;s what the accident sounds like at the moment.</p>

<p>The main thing AI beats people on at the moment is attentiveness. Really that&#39;s all it has going for it. It doesn&#39;t get tired, think about what was said to so-and-so yesterday, or gets distracted by a phone, or some back seat passenger, etc. However a good driver still comes pretty close. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll find those with a clean MVR (at least no accidents of their own fault) and a long history in transportation work find their jobs to be taxing, despite sitting on what should be a comfy seat all day. They&#39;re PAYING ATTENTION to everything, and yeah that really can be tiring.</p>

<p>The seven-lane road (counting turn lanes) in Tempe, Arizona is wide open, with no bushes or parked cars for a person to jump out from behind. In the immediate vicinity are a large park, an office building, and a nightclub that’s closed on Sundays—few potential distractions for a driver negotiating the area.</p>

<p>Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman who was homeless, was pushing a bicycle laden with her belongings along this road when she was struck by a self-driving Uber vehicle around 10 p.m. Sunday.</p>

<p>..the location of the crash—and how it happened—raises red flags about Uber’s approach to road safety. Since Uber arrived in Tempe in March 2017, he’s often seen Uber vehicles testing in that exact spot, charting details of the roadways to perfect the company’s internal maps. This seemed like familiar territory for them. Based on what is known about Uber’s technology, King said, a pedestrian or other foreign object should have been readily detected by the AV.</p>

<p>“If there is any real-world scenario where it would be seemingly safe to operate in an automated mode, this should have been it,” he said. “Something went seriously wrong.”</p>

<p>The crash data must be made available so that the public and research communities can learn from it.</p>

<p>ONE death from an autonomous vehicle is news?  (I mean it sorta is, in a factual kinda way, but not really)</p>

<p>37,461 people died from motor vehicle accidents in 2016.  that makes about 102.6 per day.  </p>

<p>100 ppl die every day from cars.  one person dying from an autonomous vehicle car crash just means that as of right now statistically autonomous cars are incredibly safer than human driven ones.</p>

<p>of course we won&#39;t know exactly how much safer until there are more &quot;autos&quot; on the roads and we have more data.</p>

<p>no one ever said autonomous cars need to be PERFECT.  they just need to be better than people, which they already are.</p>

<p>Uber is a special kind of crooked company but they are only a symptom of a failing system.
A car driving itself could be good, but I think that cars themselves are a terrible form of transport when you look at it systematically.
Please read more about <a href="http://humantransit.org/basics">Human Transit Basics</a>, another great mind which if policymakers listened to, we&#39;d have significantly nicer cities.
Automotive companies are not nice at all, see the Volkswagen Scandal (it&#39;s all diesel and non-diesel cars tbh) for a modern version of the original &quot;jaywalking&quot; campaign.</p>

<p>You need to try to see the world from outside the US car is king viewpoint to realise how absurd it all is, just ask most drivers about cyclists if you want to see anger, this is the kind of emotion than marketing teams have worked on making you feel for a whole lifetime.</p>

<p>They come into schools to teach &quot;road safety&quot; which means where a yellow jacket and get out the way.
This &quot;road safety&quot; video is about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1SvS_l0iA">as terrifying as ISIS propaganda</a>, this is state-sanctioned mock-executions of pedestrians to scare them to death of not crossing at green when they see it is clear.
They create so much fear that you won&#39;t let your kids walk to school, so instead, you drive your children, which is the reason the roads are scary in the first place! The whole legal system favours drivers, the safer a car gets, the more dangerous it becomes for others.
Cars are one the biggest drivers of obesity, people used to cycle or walk a great deal more but now you can only walk 100 steps in a day.
It&#39;s a mass delusion held together by slick propaganda.</p>

It&#39;s just stupid for people to try and make up a conspiracy theory to claim Uber is coming for autonomous cars when the fact is that a human driver would&#39;ve had the same result in that exact same situation, because there have been numerous fatalities due to the exact same situation in the past without autonomous cars in the equation.</p>

<p>This was nothing more than a freak accident that could&#39;ve been prevented by the pedestrian not being too lazy to go to the nearest traffic light with a crosswalk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber has signed onto a document that explicitly states that they believe all cars in urban areas should be part of a fleet.</p>

<p>A human driver certainly would have been able to react. You have headlights, and you have eyes that can adjust to darkness. This was on a straight road with nothing blocking the vehicle&#39;s sight. If the sensors were not able to see the pedestrian, the choice for sensors in this vehicle may have been a negligent oversight on the part of the manufacturer.</p>

In pitch black darkness your night vision is actually reduced by the lights of your car. As such your visibility is limited to what is illuminated.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that&#39;s kind of a separate thing though. Obviously, it would have been better for Volvo if they had magically engineered software that never got into an accident. Now they&#39;re going to have to invest a ton of engineering capital to fix the problem which will make their cars better - but again, it would have been great if their cars were already better. </p>

<p>On the other hand, my thesis is that Uber would have actually been worse off had there never been an accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a rich businessman i knew was the first importer of VéloSoleX in North America, that was back in the 60s. On his first shipment, his son was tasked to go drive around the local police station until he got arrested. When he did and got a ticket for not wearing a helmet (mandatory for motorcycles in canada), the guy brought a very well prepared case and a bunch of lawyers to the court to contest that helmet ticket. </p>

<p>The result was that he convinced them this isnt a motorbike but isnt a bike either. they created a new category based on the specs of HIS product, which he was the exclusive distributor of for a long while. Therefore it was an incredible barrier to entry for any other solex-like vehicle because they had to fit the specs of Solex, like engine size, where the motor was located, wheels, etc.</p>

<p>All this to say that you are very correct to think they have a lot to gain from this, even if it isn&#39;t premeditated.</p>

<p>This is classic powerful people strategy of molding laws to their advantage.</p>

Uhh, I&#39;d say this definitely fits the bill for conspiracy. (Not unlawful, just harmful)
Capitalism- an economic and political system in which a country&#39;s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.
Do you see how this isn&#39;t a consequence of capitalism at all? It&#39;s a consequence of government intervention, which is not part of true capitalism.</p>

<p>Well we can&#39;t have a discussion when words don&#39;t mean what they mean. All these definitions are complex social constructs. When we say that we are free, we never mean unbounded freedom, we mean that we are free but are also subjects to rules, laws, and regulations. </p>

<p>When we say our economy is capitalist... we never mean anarcho-capitalist. That&#39;s a different thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the plot is to use the regulation to form a monopoly. I assure you they wouldn&#39;t tell anyone they hoped to become a monopoly.</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s not a plot. That&#39;s how markets work. Every corporation&#39;s wet dream is to become a monopoly. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a secret, its Economics 101.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no a secret that they will lobby government officials to these ends. AND ONLY when &quot;government&quot; secretly go along with that plan does it become a conspiracy. We&#39;ve seen nothing of the sort in this case yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, couldnt really agree more with this.</p>

<p>My question though--if a person runs into someone and kills them, sometimes they can be charged with vehicular manslaughter, etc...whats the deal when its self driving?  Like...who is held accountable?  Who does the jail-time?  I think the problem with autonomous cars will be responsibility.  The owner of the &#39;&#39;fleet&#39;&#39; has to pay all the fines, or do jailtime for the accident of the autonomous car?  </p>

<p>I have a hard time seeing how accountability plays into these cases...</p>
