       I keep seeing this talking point - tell me why you think she would have wanted to end the world. Do you understand the MAD doctrine? Do you think that Russia is suicidal; that it would rather destroy itself and the rest of the planet because of sanctions? To me these ideas reflect a very poor understanding of the motives at play.

       I would def not put it above her though I admit it would be unbelievable if it actually happened. We can certainly expect some form of corruption and what I could only define as

       Good to see a liberal person believe that, and for the record (I didn’t vote) I only supported Trump in my thoughts during the campaign; he put on quite a show. He said some things that have never been said from that podium before. He and Hillary are and have always been close friends. I knew that from the beginning but allowed myself to believe maybe something had changed.

       We, all of us, should learn from this. If we ever have another president (jury still out) we should, from both sides of the aisle and throughout the middle ground, surveil every single detail. Better to have no president then someone like Rubio or Bernie boy. I say this with reinforced emphasis;
       <em>
        there is one party
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And we’re not invited

       I don't love Clinton - found her smarmy and loathsome. However, I was hopeful that under Clinton my mixed-race grandchildren might have a chance at a normal life, and that we older adults might still see at least some limited Social Security and Medicare. Never mind the concerns about Neo-Nazi connections and other nastiness that's off the scale.

       I have seen that, actually.  Someone will have dope, sell some to someone else at a higher price, then use those profits to buy more from their dealer.  Or become a small-time dealer in service of a more connected dealer because it keeps them close to a reliable supply of drugs.

       Yes, but most real users fund their addiction and will scarf down any actual product they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are selling their heroin, they ain't addicted fully yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking selling other things like weed, Xanax, and etc to fund a heroin addiction I could believe it.
      </p>

       You don't just pick and choose heroin addiction though.

       Yeah but you can only consume so much of a drug in so much time off you intend on staying alive. If somebody had the money and connection to buy an ounce of whatever, why hang onto it all when you could use however much over a week or two, than sell the rest making the next time you re-up free. Rice and repeat and you have a self sustained addiction that pays for itself.

       You do see heroin users selling heroin to get heroin... Most drug dealers I know (and I know a lot due to growing up in a shitty neighbourhood) sell drugs in order to fund their own habits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug dealers will even specifically try and recruit workers who they know have a problem with substance A, knowing they can't be trusted to not dip into the product. When they do inevitably dip into the product it's a case of "you fucked up kid, you work for me now to pay back what you took." The debt is obviously never repaid though  and the poor sap just ends up working for that person until they end up in jail, or worse.

       Most of the people I knew who were hard on it started with opiods. They slowly moved up paying $30 a pop for roxy pills and eventually when the need became too much, where they were paying $200-300 plus a day to feed their tolerance and addiction they drifted to heroin. Or they sold off everything they have of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was nothing that could help them stave off the addiction long enough to sell, most of what they had on hand was used to fend off withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it happen a lot in my area.

       Drugs are all roped together in everyones mind in the real world. Opiates and Stimulants are the same as psychedelics and sometimes weed to most people. Trump is playing off of this image and wont care who hes going after in the end as long as he can point to it and say " I did this and it's working!" even if it isn't at all.

       I agree people are conflating "drugs" as anything that is body or mind altering which sure yeah that's the technical definition but I'm sure we can agree, weed and psychedelics are the least of our worries when it comes to drugs. Opiods and the likes are far more devastating than the others. While Trump might be using big word brushes like "drugs", people jumping to the conclusion that he,s going after weed users is simply wrong imo. The fight is centered in terms of actions around the opiod crisis. Sure there's some rumbles coming from Sessions on weed, but imo is only to make the laws move. His job is to enforce the laws on the book, and if we're not happy, we force congress to change them ya know

       That's not how most people see it. I think that what you're saying is mostly wishful thinking. At this point, I don't think we can take anything Trump says as even being serious because he throws things into the wind regardless of what they are to see if they flow with people. Next week he could be saying he wants drug dealers to live and put money into the economy.

       He's not too hard to understand if you can understand how he talks. Like he's very precise on the words he uses, even if the overall message might be vague. Because of that you really have to take what he says and what he does as 2 separate things. Perhaps it's wishful thinking but I do believe he's not going after weed, that'd be retarded

       Its kind of like "spreading the blame". Ic you have a murderer who says it was his addiction to drugs that caused him to commit the crime, then who do you punish? The criminal is not innocent, but how guilty is the person who sold/gave them the drugs? And if it was legally prescribed drugs of the criminal, then which medical doctor/pharmacy do you blame? Do you quit at second, third, or twentieth person by association here? Drug dealers need to die, this goes without argument, but doctors also? Is guilt by second person as in the murderer and a friend did drugs together applicable even if the friend had no part in it?  This is an extremely slippery and dark road to look down. Just simplyfy it more. Repeat offenders of illegal dealing get massive jail time/life sentences and doctors overprescribing get jail time, and their licences forever revoked in this country.

       Idk if it weren't for term limits I'm pretty sure a lot of our presidents would just become president for life. Defeating incumbents can be really hard.

       Yeah, I can sympathize with that view for sure, and maybe it's even correct. In Australia we don't have term limits though, and there does get an inevitable sense of 'enough's enough' or of 'you've had your turn' so people will vote against the incumbent. We also have a proper democracy though also... So maybe it's not a great comparison.

       I think Australia doesn't have this problem because the government has already completely taken over y'alls lives. It's illegal to protest in some areas. The government can decide that you are unfit to own a gun because of a traffic ticket and it is up to you to prove that you are innocent, assumed guilty by the state in this instance.

       It's actually largely because of coalitions and the fact that you vote for a party, not a PM, and the party can out the PM at pretty much any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here in NZ the party that got the most votes didn't get into power as three other parties managed to agree on terms to form a coalition. The three parties combined to get like 51% of the votes where the incumbents got 45% on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defeating an incumbent is really hard in a first past the post system as usually votes are too split between the other parties. In other systems it's a lot easier

       What in the world does this have to do with American drug policy? Without any context, you're just sharing CIA talking points attacking President Xi because he's trying to

       talking points:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This  is  also  a  geopolitical  and  diplomatic  offensive;  Xi 
Jinping  talked  first  of  a  “community  of  destiny”  among 
Asians,  and  our  sources  offer  reassurance  that  China  is 
seeking  to  “supplement”  the  existing  international  order
        <br/>
        rather than to revise it. But money also talks, and a strategy 
largely based on loans and aid is building China’s financial 
power, in addition to the trade power it already possesses.

       Don't forget in the Patriot Act, they can legally execute people summarily (without trial), because it's still a (perpetual) time of war, and they can label anybody committing any crime whatsoever an enemy combatant. That might not happen, but it could. Fun days.

       back in the 90s in the UK, one scumbag heroin users ODed his neighbor's teenage kid with an injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       then dumped his body in the nearby river, it was found later.
      </p>
      <p>
       they ONLY charged him with unlawful disposal of a body. a hygiene thing, got two years or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       he just so happened to be an informer for the local police.

       You act like the members of Congress care about the pittance they receive officially.  If we want to really get their attention we need to target their "supplemental" income. We could have a law that taxes ALL of their income at 100% during shutdowns.

       I know, right. I've been pretty surprised by the lack of outrage over this, especially by the groups you'd expect outrage from. I'm sitting over here, a trump voter, and I'm like WTF?? This is insane! He talking about killing people!
      </p>
      <p>
       And doctors/pharmacies overprescribing are not looking at the death penalty, they're looking at losing their license and jail time. And there's been no mention of going after the manufacturers at all. He's really just targeting poor people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some fucked up shit. Got a drug problem that's likely to kill you? Don't worry, we'll kill you first!
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about a wrong headed approach. When he talked about tackling the opioid crisis I thought he meant treatment centers and maybe legalizing weed. I didn't know he meant just killing off the problem.

       But I'm anti-drug for the same reason I'm against this policy-I'm not a fan of people dying.

       Then you should be pro-drug legalization and education. So people can be educated on drugs and realize there's more to life than most drugs. Education is how you change people, not throwing them in a cell for a problem of freewill.

       I am all for education. Unfortunately though, I think the legalizing of many of drugs is just the wrong approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I do struggle with this, because I don't want to impose my beliefs or my will, or morality, or whatever on other people. But I feel like a lot of people who start out using drugs don't realize the consequences of them. I mean, they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       they can ruin their life and end up in misery and despair, but
       <em>
        knowing
       </em>
       something and actually experiencing it aren't the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the movie looper is a good metaphor for drug use. Bruce Willis signs up for this job knowing he will be killed for it at a later date, but he doesn't care because his life sucks and he wants the money.  But when that later date comes, he doesn't want to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same way with drug use, people start using because they're in a place, for whatever reason, that they just don't care. But once they realize just how low their life goes when they're addicted to drugs, they care. But by that point it's too late. They're addicted to drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just as prohibition did reduce alcohol consumption, I think keeping drugs illegal does reduce their use as well.

       remember that alcohol prohibition melted the brains of countless people who drank 'bathtub gin'. similarly, today there are the synthetic cannabinoids ("spice" and such), that have potential side effects unlike anything caused by even the dankest plain old weed. for opioids, there's the recent spike in cutting heroin and fake pills with fentanyl (expected by economics alone, fentanyl is incredibly more potent and therefore easier, more economical, and safer to move around). for stims, there's the "bath salts", some of which are decently safe chems, others that are very harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       fentanyl has a reason for existing, it is better suited for some treatment of chronic pain than less potent opioids. but those pills need to be manufactured by some place with strict quality control and oversight, not some people pressing pills in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       the synthetic cannabinoids have a reason for existing, they can be used in research paradigms to figure out more about the functions of the cannabinoid receptors in cells. their useful place is in a lab, not for human consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       the bath salts are similar, byproducts of research programs targetting certain receptors, and pharm companies' efforts to develop new drugs. some are like 'traditional' stimulants but with a greater recreational value, others will form toxic metabolites in your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       the primary reason people eat/smoke/snort/shoot these 'suboptimal', often more harmful and dangerous drugs, is because they are legal, while the safer traditional alternative is not. chemists can always stay a step ahead of the dea, just slightly changing the molecule by adding or subtracting a sidegroup so it's a novel or unregulated chemical.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to even get into my opinions about people having only this one life to live, not everyone gets high off jesus, so who is the government to regulate what recreational substances i can enjoy during my short time on earth?

       This is the same argument that

      <p>
       conservatives have against gun control - Laws against guns endanger lives because then only criminals would have guns
      </p>
      <p>
       liberals have against abortions - Laws against abortions will endanger lives because women will have back alley abortions
      </p>
      <p>
       feminists have against the anti-sex trafficking bill - Laws against sex trafficking endangers free will sex workers because it pushes them further in to the shadows
      </p>
      <p>
       immigrants rights groups have against border enforcement - active border enforcement and deportation forces illegal immigrants to not report crimes against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People always claims that doing something to improve a shitty situation is actually doing harm. But what's a better solution - Keeping drugs illegal and risking a fewer lives to illegal drugs, or making drugs legal and risking many more lives to legal drugs?
      </p>
      <p>
       And lets not forget that most heroin users got hook via legal pain medication.

       Look, you and I will never see eye to eye on this.  You just said yourself that you should be able to use whatever drugs you want.  You will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       agree that drugs should be illegal, and you will look for any excuse to rationalize your argument.  But really, you are not arguing your position in good faith.  You are hiding behind community safely, which is almost as bad as hiding behind

       I don't think that making drugs illegal is doing something to improve a shitty situation, it only makes any potential problems worse. From the article I linked, your argument sounds like,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “If you make any attractive commodity available at lower cost, you will have more users," former Office of National Drug Control Policy deputy director Thomas McLellan once said of Portugal's policies. Joseph Califano, founder of the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, once warned that decriminalization would "increase illegal drug availability and use among our children."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       but according to actual data,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But in Portugal, the numbers paint a different story. The prevalence of past-year and past-month drug use among young adults has fallen since 2001, according to statistics compiled by the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which advocates on behalf of ending the war on drugs. Overall adult use is down slightly too. And new HIV cases among drug users are way down.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       in numbers, this,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Among Portuguese adults, there are 3 drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens. Comparable numbers in other countries range from 10.2 per million in the Netherlands to 44.6 per million in the U.K., all the way up to 126.8 per million in Estonia. The E.U. average is 17.3 per million.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For comparable data for the US, here's the government's own website with some
       <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">
        numbers
       </a>
       . it comes out to something like 197 drug overdose deaths per every million citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are nations like some in southeast asia, where incredibly oppressive and violent criminal penalties for drug related behavior probably do curb overall drug usage. But culturally, something like that would never be accepted by the US. Same reason why gun control policies like those used by the UK or Australia would likely never be accepted by the American public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not hiding behind community safety, public health, and harm reduction. I'm citing it's improvement as an all but certain result. If you can find anything backing the scenario you claim, I'd be happy to look at it. Because the subject is not black and white, not all drugs are 'equal', and the best answer is likely a complicated one.

       I couldn't read the article on my phone because it was behind a paywall, but I can read it on my computer, and I 100% agree with their approach.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Portugal decided to treat possession and use of small quantities of these drugs as a public health issue, not a criminal one. The drugs were still illegal, of course. But now getting caught with them meant a small fine and maybe a referral to a treatment program -- not jail time and a criminal record.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I will say, I think treatment should be mandatory, not a "maybe."
      </p>
      <p>
       But, yah, I have zero problem with that approach.  I just don't think we should legalize a bunch of highly addictive drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would actually prefer to deal with the root of the problem.  Why do we have so many people addicted to drugs, alcohol, on anti depressants, etc?  We seem to be having trouble dealing with living in our society, and we should be looking at why that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But absolutely not giving the death penalty to drug dealers.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, just for the record, even Jesus wasn't opposed to having a good time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Indeed, Jesus was accused of being “a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.” The phrase is found in Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:34 where Jesus contrasts himself to John the Baptist who was known for his asceticism in both diet and drink. Opponents of the two managed to find fault with both styles of living.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Certainly the Bible, especially Luke’s gospel, portrays Jesus as someone who sometimes feasted well and enjoyed a good party — think of the wedding at Cana. However, except for the above accusation, the gospels don’t give us any evidence of Jesus acting drunkenly or inappropriately. There are also examples of Jesus abstaining from eating and drinking (ex; the forty days in the desert). Perhaps it is best to look at Jesus as one who can both teach us how to celebrate with abundance when appropriate, but also how to show restraint over our physical cravings.

      <p>
       I absolutely agree with this perspective. Whatever is done regarding drug laws and harm prevention, the underlying causes of addiction and dependence will remain. Prior to decriminalization, I'm pretty sure that portugal's rates of overdose death were already something the USA would love to have. Something about the murky mess that's American society seems to amplify the harm drugs can cause, or creates a welcoming environment for them to manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry about the 'get high off jesus' thing, I could have been less inflammatory. I think religion and spiritualness can be a very good thing. Trying to keep a 'cosmic' or spiritual perspective in mind has helped me find peace in life.

       Legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing everything else will save many lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people can access to marijuana and supervised injection sites, and also be able to seek support and counseling without fear of prosecution, then you can easily eliminate most of the shady blackmarket activity. You can also help heal people when you have a clearer understanding of who needs and wants help.

       I voted for trump partially because both candidates were a total shit show and I figured he would at least only be president for four years but if Hillary was elected she would probably be there for eight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus he said he would fix Obamacare which I use. I cannot get subsidies because my income is too high, so I'm paying through the nose for terrible insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I also own a small business so I wanted lower taxes for pass through entities.

       The whole "free college" turned me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not against free college, I'm against free college in a system where some of the professors and administrators earn up to a million dollars a year.  The same way I'm against free medical where company's can charge $500,000 for a years worth of medicine a person needs to keep them alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish someone would run on actually socializing these things, instead of turning it in to a capitalist/socialist hybrid where we publicly share the cost but privatize the profits.  But no one will do it because most of the senators make their money from stocks and donations from big pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can remember how being a broke kid sucks, so I wouldn't mind helping to foot the bill for today's broke kids.  But no one has proposed a system that will actually work.  Well I Obama did with the public option (and I voted for him) but for some reason that didn't pan out like it was supposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think education and healthcare are the next big bubbles.  But instead of letting these bubbles burst and deal with the market correction, they're just going to put the taxpayers on the hook to keep the money coming in.  In a truly capitalist or socialists society these industries would be forced to charge a fair market value, but because we have this stupid hybrid they can charge whatever they want and it gets paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in short, unless someone who proposes free college actually wants to actually socialize it, I would have a hard time voting for them.  And honestly, even if they promised to socialize it I would have a hard time voting for them.  Obama burned me pretty bad.  I'm paying over $1,000 a month for insurance because I believed him and voted for him.

       This is never going to happen. The amount of time it takes for death penalty cases to get to the execution is usually years after appeals and all that jazz. Trump's not going to be in charge anymore before the first of these cases gets anywhere near close.

       Thats just ignorant. With free health care everybody wins. Rich or poor. The amount of money people pay per month for insurance is like half of what we pay and you get shit all. How much do you pay for a normal doctor visit mister? Cause i´m sure you pay wayyyyyyyy more than i do. That last paragraph just seal the deal. You are retarded and i´m pretty sure you are not an hard working american, you are just a cunt you got their money from daddy.Keep up that Capitalism vs Communism mentality, because by the way Free Health care has nothing to do with Communism. Its about you paying your country for a long life service. Its not Capitalism or Communism, its just the Goverment taking care of their people

       super simple stuff. we pay the most by far, get nowhere near the best. the system is broken. insurance companies fuck people like you on the regular. people who think theyre paying for insurance and that they are covered until the insurance company finds a way to fuck you. why do they find a way to fuck you? because it is literally their job to find a way, any way NOT TO PAY OUT.

       it costs the most by far and its not even close to the best. sounds like we're the consumers are getting the short end of the stick. you know whos winning this deal? the guys who own the guys who write the laws. the guys who have convinced americans that youre a libtard pussy if you think a car accident shouldnt make you bankrupt, and that you should trust the insurance industry. an industry whos incentive is to profit by taking in MORE MONEY THAN THEY PAY OUT. they succeed when they DO NOT PAY YOU

       WHAT DO YOU MEAN BROTHER??? YOU MEAN HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY WORKS IN NORMAL COUNTRIES AND ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY GREAT. YOU MEAN YOU CAN GO CHECK OUT THAT FLU, THAT HAS BEEN A PAIN IN THE ASS FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS, AND NOT PAY 150 DOLLARS? AND YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY LIKE 100 BUCKS EVERY MONTH? AND IT WORKS? AND ON A PRETTY MUCH CAPITALIST COUNTRY TOO? Liar. Reading that just made me sick...but don´t worry man, i too have health care, so its not going to cost me anything to have it check out.

       Pedophiles get barely any time at all and never ANYTHING CLOSE TO THIS. But sure kill drug dealers just make sure that there are NO EXCEPTIONS...CIA Pharma you are ALL INCLUDED IN THIS MANIC EPISODE OF AN IDEA. I have the feeling it will look more like an unfinished game of chess and the pawns go first. Can we use GWB's old sign at least and save on the "mission accomplished" bs narrative that will follow after the deaths of many mid level dealers?

       By increasing the penalties for carrying small amounts of drugs combined with selective enforcement, police began to constantly patrol black neighborhoods arresting black men for what used to be a minor drug offense. Same thing for anti-war rallies where there would be lots of "hippies" congregating together getting busted and thrown in jail for YEARS for possession of small amounts of marijuana (or having it be planted on them), effectively terrifying people that wished to protest the war. However police largely left white communities off the hook when it came to drug arrests and incarceration, despite data showing drug usage was nearly identical across racial lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The African American community was on the rise before the war on drugs began. They were organized and flexing their political muscle to fight for rights, then black men started being thrown away for years completely destroying their communities and directly leading to broken African American inner cities that we see today. This graph illustrates how the incarceration rate of African American's skyrocketed compared to other races RIGHT AFTER the war on drugs began.

       Oh wow what I shock! I must use all caps and excessive exclamation marks because something posted on a conspiracy subreddit isn't 100% CONCRETE VERIFIABLE!  Nevermind hope perfectly this lines up with things like Nixon's "southern strategy" that was meant to target southern racists for votes, or how Nixon claimed Blacks were "genetically inferior". It's not like there are okay office transcripts that have Nixon repeatedly using the N word. Surely somebody with those views would NEVER target a race they thought so poorly of work dramatic and sweeping drug policies.

       a. Your source is comprised of CNN quoting another journalist quoting a guy who's been dead for 19 years based on nothing other than his word about an interview from 22 years ago.

You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

       I imagine Trump has an idea of America. One where people aren't doing drugs to forget reality but live happily in a class under himself. Where everyone is a happy little worker bee where he stands above with all his genius. It was a genius idea to be born into money.

       So I think it's a baby boomer thing. I'm not sure if Hillary would have been tougher on drugs but I know either of them care about even legalizing marijuana. I doubt Hillary would change anything and I didn't expect Trump to get harder but he has.

       If you would have listened to Trump's speech instead of having it interpreted for you by the corporate media you would know that he said these drug dealers are killing a thousand people and essentially getting a slap on the wrist. He was talking about their actions literally resulting in deaths.

       I think the reason he is doing this is becuase, the last thing they suggested was jail time for drug dealers, and a compromise on that would be a fine. A compromise on his idea, would be jail time for drug dealers. You dont think theyre actually going to pass something that allows execution for a non-violent crime?

       I disagree with executing drug dealers, but for a different reason. While the top-level drug trafficking is in a very separate category from almost any other 'profession', it sets a dangerous precedent. What if they decided that there was a bridge-falling-down epidemic and they started executing engineers? Doctors accidentally kill people all the time. What about if an open source ai library is hooked up by some terrorists to a turret and set on top of a building to shoot a lot of people.  Should we round up the original programmers as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       The best president against this is that we don't give the death penalty for making or selling guns illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want to kill drug dealers, it's got to be on more direct charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are much better ways of solving society's drug problems, like regulating the legal manufacturers stronger and going after the illegal ones.

       Oh cool, it's just drug dealers. So just don't be a drug dealer and you should be all good.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was sarcasm, in case you couldn't tell. Many drug offenders are convicted with 'intent to distribute' charges regardless of the amount of drugs they are found with, in order to juke the stats in police departments and make the DA look tough on drugs for his constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       So someone might get caught with a quarter of weed, but also get intent to distribute because he had a weapon, or a wad of cash, or sandwich baggies for his kid's lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we thought of that in our ample consideration of all of the unintended consequences of our hasty sound-bite worthy proclamations that play to our base, right?

       If he was talking about purdue pharma execs I might be on board. I don't think he's talking about purdue pharma execa though. i feel like the punishment for trafficking is already deterring everyone you could deter. How many prominent drug dealers who could do 20-30 years and don't stop are gonna stop is the death penalty/life imprisonment?

       I know people that would love to give the death penalty to anyone that does drugs except for alcohol and marijuana, in law enforcement in particular. There are probably thousands of people working in LE that would love for Trump to do that. If Trump gets what he wants on this, I'm sure over time the combined efforts of these such LE people will result in the justice system giving death penalties for users.

       Hard to get to the Death penalty for me when something done does not deliberately kill People.
      </p>
      <p>
       Murder in the first degree gets the Death Penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selling copious amounts of drugs, swindling millions, creating faulty products (Ford Pinto). Not so much on the Death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy I see in the "Death to drug dealers" model is that it will filter down to any drug related crime. This will allow the police to kill with impunity.  I have issue with this.

       Prison is a cash cow, its the new "US Steel" if you will of dirtbags stealing cash hand over fist. Government &amp; CO. make more money of imprisonment than death penalty. Shittons more.

       Also think of the ramifications this would have on police. If a drug dealer is facing the death penalty, he will be much more likely to try to kill police to get away from an arrest.

       This is how totalitarianism happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       A controversial figure with many enemies and an axe to grind starts labelling political enemies as "drug dealers" or "communists" and starts rounding them up.

       If you think this might be you, go buy a rifle while you still can and learn how to use it.  Because if Trump does try this, I promise you that you will not be able to buy a rifle when you need it.

       If you already own a rifle, congratulations and thank for remembering that no government can be trusted indefinitely, not even our own.
