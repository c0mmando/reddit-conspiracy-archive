<p>They were bouncing signals off the moon before Apollo 11, and the Russians supposedly sent unmanned missions to put reflectors up there as well. Moon rocks have turned out to be petrified wood (yes as in from Earth). The LRO imagery is just as fake as the film footage. The international space programs and their rovers and imagery are just as fake as Apollo 11. If you think the footage of Apollo 11 is fake, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree with me. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  We went to the moon, ran into a shit ton of human and non-human extraterrestrials there, were told to GTFO and not come back, and we took off w/our tail between our legs and couldn’t actually go there again from that point on - so we faked the rest of the missions.</p>

<p>Earth is a prison planet.  We are all trapped here in a quarantine of sorts.  TPTB on this planet are not all Earth human, do not all belong to the same species, and they parasite upon the masses of humanity - “the 99%” as it were.  Part of their power comes from the massive, global lie they’ve been perpetrating for many generations that we are all alone in the universe.</p>

<p>The moment it’s shown to everyone that ETs are here and have always been here, TPTB will have a <em>very</em> tough time maintaining the authoritarian control they’ve had on this planet all this time.</p>

<p>So what would lead to the faking of the moon landings is the fact that A) the back/dark side of the moon has been said to be absolutely teeming w/ETs by various sources, and B) we’re a slave population on a prison planet.  TPTB don’t want their sequestered, purposefully quarantined cattle to find out that they’re sequestered, purposefully quarantined cattle.  The cattle might all band together and take over the farmer at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main thing with us not going to the moon is why did Russia or another nation never call us out? You&#39;d think our main opponent in the &quot;space race&quot; would say something if we didn&#39;t go. How were those laser range finders left there? What about the other things that should be there still like the moon cars, landing portion of the LEMs? I&#39;m not sure but I think those should be visible with a good telescope if you knew where to look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because geopolitics is just as fake as the Moon landing.  The &quot;nations&quot; as we are taught only exist for us plebs.  All the conflicts between them are also manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a hoax.  All of &quot;outer space&quot; is a hoax.  The moon landing was hoaxed so they could fake the pictures of the fake &quot;ball earth&quot; to push forward mystery Babylon&#39;s one world religion of &quot;we are all made of star stuff&quot; and the satanic lie of human evolution/apotheosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the moon landing was faked but the moon orbit was not.  Being able to launch a payload into lunar orbit meant we had the ability to launch a nuclear attack on Russia that would come in from directly overhead.  Instead of 15-20 minutes of warning, Moscow would have had 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, in case of escalating tensions, sending a crew to the moon with the authority to come back and release a nuke if the US National command Authority is taken out was a deterrent to a first strike, similar to submarine commanders having the same authority over their warheads.</p>

<p>Also gained by lunar orbit is the easiest method of putting a satellite in retrograde Earth orbit, travelling opposite the Earth&#39;s rotation, which is advantageous for taking out all the normal satellites.  Ordinarily, satellites are launched into an orbit that travels to the east, because that maintains the momentum they had when launched from the ground.  Direct launch to reverse orbit requires much more fuel than using a pass around the moon to make a u-turn and then return to earth in an orbit that travels to the east.</p>

<p>So the Apollo missions were intended to establish and demonstrate this capability, and the peaceful lunar landing part was a cover story for the missions.  It became irrelevant for a couple of reasons.  First Moscow responded by implementing the scary dangerous &quot;dead man&#39;s switch.&quot;  Second, submarine launched missile capability provided some of the same advantages (quick strike with no warning, ability to strike if US govt destroyed).</p>

<p>The missions were manned, and they did orbit the moon, but they did not land on it.  The travel through the van Allen belts wasn&#39;t as dangerous as some people make it out to be.  The photos supposedly from the moon appear to be faked and the lunar lander story is implausibly dangerous and unlikely to have been undertaken.</p>
