        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just commented on this in a thread about <a href="/r/sandersforpresident">/r/sandersforpresident</a> and I figured it could probably use its own post. This is just what I heard and no, I don’t have any proof, so take it with a grain of salt. That being said, the source of this information is in my opinion reliable.</p>

<p>My comment was as follows:</p>

<p><a href="/r/sandersforpresident">/r/sandersforpresident</a> was a hoax, actually part of Trump’s marketing, or so I’ve heard.</p>

<p>The plan was to create a “home” for sanders’ campaign on reddit and then to stifle it at key points in time. The main goal was to turn sanders supporters into trump supporters.</p>

<p>Did you notice the “night and day” change in politics? The way there were tons of Bernie posts and then suddenly tons of Hillary posts? The idea here was to convey the idea that politics was compromised and run by Hillary.</p>

<p>This was simple to accomplish. Flood politics with Bernie posts and then suddenly cut them off and replace them with Hillary posts.</p>

<p>Alongside these efforts on reddit, steps were taken in traditional msm outlets. A barrage of trump attack pieces were pushed to give the impression that MSM was viciously attacking him, which they were.</p>

<p>I don’t know for sure but I suspect Trump’s team knew about this and was playing their part, giving media plenty of mud to sling at him.</p>

<p>Then when he won the primaries, the idea was to cut off the attack pieces from conservative outlets and double down on the attacks from liberal outlets. The point of all of this was to get people to distrust the mainstream media and simultaneously rebrand fox as “not mainstream”.</p>

<p>And now here we are, no one trusts <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, or really any of the outfits whose stories are posted there. A bunch of Bernie supporters are now staunch trump supporters. And generally everyone hates Hillary.</p>

<p>The real question is, was this all part of Trump’s plan all along, was it Russia’s plan in which Trump was merely playing his part, or was he an unwitting participant who just happened to not really care about people hating him.</p>

<p>Believe it or don’t, but I think if you look back at the events which have transpired since he began his campaign, you’ll see that everything adds up.</p>

<p>Learning of this plan is what turned me off of Trump. </p>

<p>You can see the same strategy playing out here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where anyone questioning Trump has been deemed a shill. The goal is the same, to get people to distrust anyone asking questions, and ideally to bury those questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie was just a lazy commie, otherwise known as a  Socialist that won&#39;t use forced starvation and camps for their ideas. He got kicked out of a commune once for being lazy alledgedly.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe many Socialist Bernie supporters went Trump due to almost all positions being opposite on the spectrum. Maybe some voted Trump out of spite, or the Clinton machine scared them to a new political ethos. However, they more than likely stayed with Hillary or the Green Party (can&#39;t remember her name right now), but I can&#39;t speak for he trendy virtue signaling types. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the fact of the matter is that the majority of reddit going into 2016 was left wing anti-establishment: the exact demgraphic that would inevitably be rabid Bernie supporters. Pro-Sanders subs and vast amounts of pro-Sanders content were inevitable. </p>

<p>We do OTOH have a plethora of evidence from the Podesta leaks that the mainstream media was 100% compromised by their relationship to the Clinton campaign and/or cowed into fear of retribution for actual journalism by the Obama administration. These are simply facts. </p>

<p>We also know that the primary was a farce rigged by the Clintons, and that their were far more social media influencers employed by the Clinton campaign than there were by Trump, Sanders, Russia, and the rest of world combined. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bunch of Bernie supporters are now staunch trump supporters. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not met any. But plenty of us do still despise the Clintons and to an even greater degree, their advocates and apologists to a much greater degree. If these kinds of posts continue, I&#39;d not rule out voting for him next time though I&#39;ve never voted GOP before in my life. </p>

<p>Failure to prevent the disaster of allowing right wing neo-liberal war hawks like Hillary Clinton to control the party means that the Democratic party must be destroyed by any means necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>S4P was deliberate Clintonite astroturfing to try to get Bernie people to fall in line.  They expected Bernie would make a stink, get maybe 10-20% of the primary vote, and that would be the end of Bernie, so the job looked real easy.  It got out of hand to the point where the s4p mods closed down in a desperate attempt at &quot;unity&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about one thing: Hillary and her hangers-on are Republicans, so they sabotaged to make the Republicans look good.  It was monumental stupidity if someone wanted to win, but that&#39;s Clintonism for ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Clinton crap was, at least in part, coming from the Clinton campaign.  No once forced Peter Daou to act like a total toolbox except Peter Daou.  It&#39;s possible right-wingers realized Clinton was killing herself by doing that and joined in the fun, but the s4p thing was straightforward Clintonian politics.  That&#39;s how they roll, and that&#39;s how Bill rolled back in the 1990s - gaslighting and setting up fake &quot;progressives&quot; so he can triangulate and pass conservative policies.</p>

<p>Honestly though, there was nothing either campaign could have done to change the result.  The opinions of the public were fixed as soon as the candidates were selected.  If it proves anything, it&#39;s that Americans are gullible and ready for overt fascism instead of Reagan-style quasi-fascism.  (This is all assuming elections are not completely fake, which is a possibility; it is well known that, at the least, election results are nudged and manipulated by both parties whenever they can do it, like dead people voting for Kennedy.)</p>
