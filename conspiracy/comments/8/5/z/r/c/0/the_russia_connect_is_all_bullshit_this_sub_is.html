        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>God damn it. This sub used to be full of open minded individuals who questioned everything about the official narrative and were interested in each others opinion.</p>

<p>Now I see people vehemently defend things from MSN and mainstream media channels like Channel 4 UK, without questioning.
Wtf?</p>

<p>I would call this definite degeneration. Way back everyone knew that all mainstream media platforms are controlled by the money people.</p>

<p>Thing is even a year ago when they first started to push this &#39;Russia connection&#39;, anyone with knowledge of netsec and geopolitics knew that all the &#39;evidence&#39; was bollocks.</p>

<p>The IPs are the most pathetic. Come one any pentester knows they don&#39;t mean shit. I can explain in detail if you want me to but that is for another post.</p>

<p>There is no election in the western world.</p>

<p>This used to be a known fact as well.</p>

<p>The shadow government just changes puppets.</p>

<p>Trump is their puppet.</p>

<p>On the other hand the last thing standing between us and the NWO is Putin pretty much.</p>

<p>Why do you think he is interfering in Syria?
Since the Bush administration the agenda was in motion to subvert the middle eastern nations to their control like they did in South America.</p>

<p>Look at videos of Iraqi people protesting on the street, saying that the new USA backed government is much worse than Saddam was!</p>

<p>Wake up veterans of r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t follow the official MSN narrative please. Don&#39;t let your emotions that they implanted interfere with your judgement.</p>

<p>Be open minded like we used to. Contemplate what I just said. Find your own truth. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when you see who runs against Putin, and then you look at all of the people who just willingly line up behind him its not really surprising he wins by landslides.</p>

<p>i mean maybe hes scary and threatens them, or maybe just maybe they revere him for all of the things hes done to truly improve their lives. i mean how could you not look at the guy like some sort of messiah considering who came before him and how much of a shit hole most of the country became during the turmoil of the break up.</p>

<p>i mean go back 10 years and the west was more enamored with putin than chris evans is with RDJ. &quot;Putin the incorruptible&quot; is what they were calling him in the late 90&#39;s/early 00&#39;s</p>

<p>the election fucked this place massively, it brang the flood of shills but it also brought a whole wave of real people who are still completely fucking asleep just ended up visiting due to the crosslinking and brigades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he hasn&#39;t been in office long enough to decide, but things like the clip that someone posted below make me very suspicious.
He feeds the flames of the conflict and he made the anti-establishment ideology into a joke.
Plus if you think about it, the people were starting to wake up to how corrupt the regime was, and the existence of a &#39;deep state&#39; was seeping into the mainstream to some extent.</p>

<p>So what they did, what they always do is fake a change.
Trump was appealing to people because he seemed like a simple crude guy who says &#39;fuck you&#39; to the Washington suits.</p>

<p>They knew that more and more people grew distrusting towards mainstream media and we would think the opposite of whatever they would push.
So all media platforms started painting him in a bad light with moronic arguments.
So we thought he must really be on a different side....</p>

<p>Still, this is just my instinct. We will surely see in the future.
If he doubles down on defense budget and the Syrian conflict he is their puppet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a pretty interesting clip. Is that new? At the same time due to the fact that Trump constantly acts like he knows everyone and they all love him, who knows? I&#39;ve always thought the collusion angle was bullshit, but that some sort of money laundering deals would come out. Something along the lines of trump doing regular corrupt deals with the Russian mob, rather than actual state actors. There&#39;s a really interesting video from the Joe Rogan experience where Joey Diaz is basically saying it&#39;s common knowledge amongst rich people in New York that he&#39;s done business with Russian mobsters. </p>

<p>At this point, with the muddy waters. I&#39;m glad this snippet has lasted this long on youtube.</p>

<p>I fully expect it to be attacked and driven away. He openly admits they liked each other. </p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t want war with Russia. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think Russian&#39;s are evil... except if you want to talk about the U.S.S.R... it&#39;s a debate. Russian mob, yeah... it happens. I&#39;m not rich enough to be considered, but all of that is plausible since the Russian Fed is an aspiring capitalist nation. </p>

<p>So yeah, you&#39;d send a &quot;mob&quot; to do deals... yup. 
Now Americans are arguing whether it&#39;s treason or not... using how crony capitalism always is as a reason.</p>

He also made us the laughingstock of the world, we lost all respect as a world leader in EVERYTHING. Corruption in government may not have been created in his administration, but it sure as hell blossomed and spread like California wildfires during his tenure. Trump is not a politician, he is a businessman and a keen negotiator. He is fighting all the DC corruption practically solo while bringing America back to past greatness. Anyone who has not seen the turnaround is blind and not worth arguing with, they are zombies lost in their own dispair. Only been inoffice just over a year, and look at the accomplishments already. Imagine what its going to be in seven years. </p>
