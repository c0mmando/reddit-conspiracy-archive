        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This one got me thinking after playing GTA III (or Vice City) years ago. There was a radio station (I think Weasel News) fragment talking about a video game were traffic lights are controlled to control the traffic congestions and &quot;the game never ends&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember exactly how it goes, but got me thinking about how much traffic can be controlled or produced through traffic lights. There&#39;s more than traffic lights that can lead to traffic jams, like accidents, or poor driving. But there&#39;s been daily occasions where I&#39;m at red light and I see the next two green with no cars and I soon it turns green and it&#39;s time to go the lights turn red.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much traffic can affect (maybe more gas?), but it&#39;s something that I always think about. I&#39;m uneducated on the subject, just some thought.</p>

<p>When all this surveillance stuff (like in Britain for the Millenium) started happening it made me wonder why they don&#39;t have &quot;smart intersections&quot;?</p>

<p>Because they want us to be frustrated over minutia. Like traffic and Mondays and such. Just like why daylight savings time is a thing. Just to fuck with us that little bit constantly. </p>

<p>I have been using Google maps to get around and several times it tells me to turn when I figured it was fucked and sure enough there is an accident or something and the regular route is blocked. </p>

<p>If that were the case why have I personally seen someone run a red light and get flashed for a ticket, meanwhile the other light turns green leading someone into the potential for collision.

    <div class="md"><p>Where I live now we have something similar along one of the big main roads. A lot of traffic moves through it daily and it goes through several towns but the result is the same - if you hit a red light and can&#39;t book it to the next one once it turns green, you&#39;re hitting red almost every single light. Compared to the smaller town I used to live in, around midnight they changed all the lights on the main road to blinking yellow thus not disrupting traffic at all. It was so nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are wrong. </p>

<p>I was told this as a kid too. Here in Canada the only province that doesn&#39;t observe it is Saskatchewan a province covered in farms and filled with farmers. </p>

<p>It was proposed to &quot;save candle wax&quot; seriously. </p>

<p>Russia stopped doing it. There are many examples in the &quot;modern world&quot; if DST being abandoned and farms still work there. </p>

<p>Why not move the clock half an hour and leave it alone? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am happy to admit I&#39;m wrong when I&#39;m wrong; your assumption otherwise is, quite frankly, insulting. </p>

<p>The theory that it was proposed to save candle wax makes sense -- if society has more daylight overall, then less resources will be used in artificially lighting rooms/streets etc. It&#39;s energy efficient, even past the days of candles. </p>

<p>I would like to read more about the candle wax origins if you have any information, too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think DST is a conspiracy to annoy the general populace and there isn&#39;t any motive or evidence that says otherwise. If there is, please link it. </p>

<p>Thanks and I hope your day is going well, </p>

<p>There is a push to abandon this ridiculous notion. They have proven it doesn&#39;t save an energy and that throwing off our circadian rhythm may be it&#39;s only actual purpose.</p>

<p>Can you show me where this was proven? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still didn&#39;t admit you were wrong though did ya</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t admit I was wrong because so far, admitting I’m wrong means agreeing blindly with an Internet comment. That’s why I asked for origin/source, so I can vet the information and change my mind accordingly. </p>

<p>Furthermore, you say this: “As for sources, you can go and look up information yourself” and then go on to say, “If you can&#39;t find something then ask. Otherwise youre on your own” — this is contradictory. </p>

<p>here I am, explicitly asking for sources. Can you provide them or not? Because I can’t find them. And per your own words, I should ask, right? </p>

<p>I am happy to admit I’m wrong when you show me more than “actually you’re wrong” with an anecdote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK about that, there are enough factors that play into the creation of traffic. One thing I&#39;ve noticed is this hive mind. People love to drive cluttered among each other, there can be three lanes all going forward yet there is a cluster of car convoys just driving below the speed limit, from being able to maneuver out of that crowd and I&#39;m driving 65 with no one infront of me and all I see behind me a mile away is that cluster fuck of cars that just mind blankly drive at the speed limit the others around them are, even if it&#39;s not 45mph when the damn street itself calls for it. I&#39;ve definitely noticed that if there is a new moon, full moon or mercury in retrograde I see people infront of me do the most non-sensical stupid move that was not called for, it looks like a simulation glitch the way people act. 
At most I&#39;ve seen with the traffic lights are that some cars do not drive forward enough when at the red light and so the sensor cannot read their presence due to the vehicle&#39;s distance not being close enough and so that lane waiting to turn left, does not get the green arrow and must wait for the oncoming traffic to pass and then turn urgently on yellow, bs like that causes traffic. 
But what I have noticed practically daily is this mind numbing brain flatulence that people go through rendering them idiots behind a motorized vehicle, a lot of you MFs need to stick to supporting Uber and save the insurance and gas money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly doubt it. Cities/town contract civil engineers to design roadways traffic lights. There are simulations they use to determine the traffic light signal timing during parts of the day. The software used for this is pretty expected so for them to upgrade to &quot;smart&quot; intersections it would require upgrade to infrastructure and the development software the engineers use. If you think the government is gonna dump more money into something that already &quot;works&quot; your nuts lol.
I suppose if all the engineering firms were linked together they could all control and make traffic worse. But when the job goes to the lowest bidder cooperation between competing companies might be difficult </p>
