       I loved God emperor Dune. He basically has a speech or a couple lines about how the most effective form of ruling really is to give one person total power to make decisions. The takes so much sense to me. Now to me this would be someone who doesn't want the position of power or is somehow unable to be corrupted in that sense.

       the best form of government is a benevolent dictator. the problem is coming up with a system of succession that isnt an utter train wreck.
      </p>
      <p>
       because when you are lucky enough to get a benevolent dictator the problem is always who comes next, and this is where most of the shady shit and problems come from.

       Short: The desire to have power over others is fear based. Fear remains the dominant motivator. When our population began to explode we stopped evolving via natural selection, and human weakness has become more and more viable. Empathy is a higher function that we evolved well after we evolved fear, and requires strength.

       To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, ‘It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but might as well be.’ It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. 
No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: ‘if you’re so smart why ain’t you rich?’ There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

       Corporations only exist because Governments grant them 'Personhood' thus removing any liability a regular person would have. Government always facilitates this phenomenon because they are exempt from the rules we are all required to live by. Anarchy does not mean no rules; it just means no rulers OR nobody is exempt from morality. Moving toward a true free market will mitigate the influence of these sociopaths.

       Agree with all but the last part. Government is supposed to be a counter-balance to private interests. It's supposed to reflect and protect public interests. Remove all govt restrictions and you're on a fast-track to
       <em>
        Diamond Age

       dystopia where private armies and nanite swarms run amock, unchecked except by the next oligarch's private armies and nanite swarms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem we have today is that governments are largely illusory -- that is, they pretend to represent the people but they actually represent the oligarchs. But we still need that counter-balance.

       What? You seem conflicted. We the people are the counter balance. Without government we can still live by rules - difference is people would conform to them voluntarily as opposed to conforming due to violence or threatened use of violence.

       Governments create prop up these out of control corporate entities. The government itself is largely and unelected revolving door with the corporations. Bush propped up Haliburton soon after entering office. Would the free market have supported such a war? NO! But with gov you have no choice where your stolen money goes. Obama propped up the same banks that supported his campaign - again with our stolen money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remove all govt restrictions and you have a prosperous economy with alternatives to corps like Amazon who pay no taxes. Regulation raises the barrier to entry and protects monopolies.

       By removing government. Don't you see that government IS this entity that you are afraid of? It is the tool of the elite. Furthermore, they do control the media. Or at least with the NDAA it became legal to propagandize the american public.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because people are not trustworthy that we must  remove government. The Free Market mitigates the recognized shortcomings of individuals by decentralizing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will still protect ourselves with militaries and malitias. The big difference is, those entities become responsible to the people in the free market. If the police are unjustly arresting one minority group for instance, we can fire them. Free market introduces competition which drives down cost for us. Governments protect monopolies and are themselves a monopoly of force.

       What I am trying to say is that corporations can only exist because governments create them. Look into Corporate Personhood - the government creates a fictional person who is liable as opposed to the board/executives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that we're fucked either way, perhaps we should go with the method which facilitates and respects voluntary human interactions? I do believe in contract law and we can still enforce those laws with courts. The only difference is there are no central leaders with more power than the rest of us - unless we choose to give them that power through contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, in Ancapistan commie college students are free to voluntarily experiment with socialism (and i wish they would) but they are not free to enforce that system on us. You would be free to live under a system of like the USA has now.

       Understood on the corporate entity. But is it any better if a bunch of thugs paid by Joe Smith bust down your door vs thugs paid by Academi?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, yes, there would be courts, but that only works if the court has more power than whom it would bind --  say, billionaire oligarchs. And what if the billionaire declines to contract with the court to begin with? It's interesting to note that the thugs are responsible for their actions too, but what if they decline to contract as well? I mean
       <em>
        why would they?
       </em>
       Seems to me the courts would have to be non-optional. In which case, who enforces their decisions over non-consenting parties? And where do they get that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Power attracts those who crave power -- power over others. It's a spiritual problem. I sometimes wonder if the Golden Rule ("Do unto others...") was an actual thing, perhaps
       <em>
        the only law

       , from the last Golden Age.

       The gov already does this, no? So in the free market we would fire those who abuse their power. We have no real power to do that currently. Compare customer service at a place like Starbucks (semi-free market) with that of the local DMV. Those people at the DMV have no personal reason to go above and beyond. Private police forces must compete for public approval.

      <p>
       Nobody enforces policies on non-consenting parties unless their is an initiation of force. That includes theft or destruction of private property which is an extension of the fact that everyone has self-ownership.

       In practice the Amish basically live by this principle. They don't even incarcerate - they simply ostracize. Furthermore, they recognize that a person is not able to consent to their community contract so they wait until adulthood.

       I agree. So long as we recognize that their will always be evil it's better to decentralize power. This means taking on a lot of personal responsibility which is something the government has trained us NOT to do.

       But it would and this is the point you are missing - in part because your example is so nebulous. Image any real billionaire doing this and the backlash they would create. If Zuckerberg or Bezos or Gates went and started a war of aggression you know the backlash would be even greater than when the US did the same.

       I'm glad that you are an anarchist. I struggled myself with implementation until I applied my knowledge of smart contracts. I went to a Crypto meetup here in KC where the local government is trying to leverage smart contracts for the benefit of local residents. I see this phenomenon expanding until everyone in gov is replaced by smart contracts that execute without the intermediary of a human being (since we all agree that humans are corruptible). Then the free market may provide superior or supplemental contracts where individuals can be part of a non-localized government according to their needs and interests. Within 15 year I believe traditional gov with be irrelevant due to this evolution.

       I still struggle with implementation, but I definitely see the value of smart contracts. They can potentially replace the whole concept of a corporation, render it obsolete, even bypass the State entirely. (Indeed maybe that's part of the NWO plan -- I mean that in a good way.) I'm an IT/tech veteran/survivor, but I've not really dug into this yet. Can you kindly point me the right direction?

       I've only dipped my toe in the ocean that is decentralized platforms. I don't personally invest in any of them because I think it is too speculative at this time. Some of these platforms do not yet have any public dapps running on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are companies like Hashgraph that are completely centralized  providing a proprietary solution. Then you've got Enigma which is a completely private protocol. Ethereum is big in the West, has relatively low transaction speed and apps are written in Solidity. Neo has been discribed as the Eth of China and is supposed to achieve higher transaction speeds. Cardano has raised tons of money and has a built in funding mechanism to sponsor future development. EOS is ANOTHER one that may overtake Etherium as they make it easy for decentralized apps to move from ETH to EOS. This is probably too much information so I'll just stop there. Suffice to say the field is too nebulous for me to understand holistically.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: You can check out Ivan on Tech or Siraj Raval on YouTube. They have great tutorials and introductions.

       Psychopaths are as varied in their wants and desires as any of the rest of us are except they have no limits or any restraints on what those wants and desire are or they will do to satisfy them. So they look for ways to work their way into any position of authority that will allow them to satisfy any of those wants and desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophiles, for instance, are sexual psychopaths with no sense of guilt or remorse about what they do. It should come as no shock or surprise then when some of them they turn up as teachers, sports coaches, scout leaders, etc. Nor in agencies that are supposed to help runaway and wayward children. Fulfilling those desires is all they care about and they will do their utmost to work their way into any position that will allow them to indulge in and satisfy them. So it's any postion that gives them power or authority over others for a wide variety of personal ends of which money is simply one and in many instances will also come with some of those positions of authority without necessarily being the primary motive for it.
