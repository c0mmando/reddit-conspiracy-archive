<p>TL;DR Zuckerberg has been rubbing shoulders with wealthy Russians for almost a decade, many of which also have ties to the Trump campaign. </p>

<p>Russia is deeply embedded into Facebook.
In 2009, Russian social-media mogul Yuri Milner invested $200 million into Facebook at a valuation of $10 billion dollars without voting rights or a seat on the board. To understand this investment, at the time the world was going through a global recession and Facebook&#39;s general valuation had dropped from the $15 billion from the year prior to $4-$6 billion in 2009.
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-valuation-the-cheat-sheet/">https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-valuation-the-cheat-sheet/</a></p>

<p>One company did offer a valuation of $8 billion, but with a seat on the board, which Zuckerberg was strongly against. In other words, Yuri Milner invested in Facebook when they were strapped for cash and at an inflated price without voting rights or a seat on the board. That&#39;s an amazing deal for Zuckerberg!
Here&#39;s Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg hanging out for an interview: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/26/mark-zuckerberg-and-yuri-milner-talk-about-facebooks-new-investment-video/">https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/26/mark-zuckerberg-and-yuri-milner-talk-about-facebooks-new-investment-video/</a></p>

<p>The deal was coordinated by Alisher B. Usmanov, a Russian oligarch that earned his fortune managing steel mill subsidiaries for Gazprom.
Usmanov spent six years in prison for fraud and embezzlement in the 80&#39;s.
In 2008, Usmanov fired a publisher and editor at one of Russia&#39;s most respected news paper after it published detailed accounts of Russian election fraud.
It is said, &quot;His ties to the Kremlin and Facebook have stirred concerns that he might influence the company’s policies in subtle ways to appease governments in markets where Facebook is also an important tool of political dissent, such as Russia.&quot; This was in 2009.

<p>Usmanov is close friends with Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisher_Usmanov">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisher_Usmanov</a>
Ivanka Trump and Wendi Deng are good friends with Abramovich&#39;s then wife, Dasha Zhoukova. Here they are watching a tennis match.

<p>The leak of the Paradise Papers revealed the money Yuri Milner used to invest into Facebook came from Gazprom, a US sanctioned Russian oil and gas company, at one point owning 9% of the company.
<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-the-paradise-papers-leak-facebook-yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-the-paradise-papers-leak-facebook-yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia</a></p>

<p>Soon after, Zuckerberg and Milner became friends, meeting monthly:

And even spoke together in November 2015 at the 2016 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony.
<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-the-paradise-papers-leak-facebook-yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-the-paradise-papers-leak-facebook-yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia</a></p>

<p>In May 2012, Milner attended Zuckerberg&#39;s wedding. In 2014, Milner moved to California home he paid 100% above value on.
<a href="http://time.com/5011000/paradise-papers-tax-havens-leak/">http://time.com/5011000/paradise-papers-tax-havens-leak/</a></p>

<p>For those who aren&#39;t familiar with Gazprom, Gazprom financed the spy ring that in 2013 tried to recruit Trump Advisor Carter Page before being broken up by the FBI. One of the spies trying to recruit Page said of Page, &quot;He got hooked on Gazprom.&quot;
<a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/04/russian-spy-met-trump-adviser-carter-page-and-thought-he-was-an-idiot/">http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/04/russian-spy-met-trump-adviser-carter-page-and-thought-he-was-an-idiot/</a></p>

<p>Around the time Yuri Milner was investing in Facebook, they lost their CFO Gideon Yu. Reason given: Facebook wanted a CFO with public company experience, suggesting they were thinking of an IPO at the time of Milner&#39;s investment (the reason given was deemed nonsensical).
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/31/confirmed-facebook-loses-cfo-gideon-yu/">https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/31/confirmed-facebook-loses-cfo-gideon-yu/</a></p>

<p>Yuri Milner&#39;s DST was one of the big winners over Facebook&#39;s botched IPO.

<p>When Facebook was confronted about the fake news epidemic on Facebook and it&#39;s influence on the election, he said it was &quot;crazy.&quot;
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-zuckerberg-russians-20170929-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-zuckerberg-russians-20170929-story.html</a></p>

<p>When Facebook put out a report in April 2017, it conspicuously left out any mention of Russia:

<p>US political ads were at times paid for by rubles:
<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/358102-franken-blasts-facebook-for-accepting-rubles-for-us-election-ads">http://thehill.com/policy/technology/358102-franken-blasts-facebook-for-accepting-rubles-for-us-election-ads</a></p>

<p>Facebook had &quot;embeds&quot; into the Trump campaign working with Brad Parscale, Trumps digital director.
<a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/10/facebook-responds-embeds-trump-campaign-60-minutes/#BrZIcKnffGqw">https://mashable.com/2017/10/10/facebook-responds-embeds-trump-campaign-60-minutes/#BrZIcKnffGqw</a></p>

<p>Based on Kushner&#39;s quotes, these &quot;embeds&quot; may have worked closely with Cambridge Anayltica:
“We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. After the primary, we started ramping up because we knew that doing a national campaign is different than doing a primary campaign. That was when we formalized the system because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica. I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world. And I asked them how to scale this stuff.&quot;
Here&#39;s a video explaining just that: @2:37
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-40852227/the-digital-guru-who-helped-donald-trump-to-the-presidency">http://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-40852227/the-digital-guru-who-helped-donald-trump-to-the-presidency</a></p>

<p>Theresa Wong from the Trump campaign says that people from Facebook, Google, and Youtube &quot;...were helping us... They were basically our hands-on partners...&quot;
In the video above, Theresa Wong from the Trump campaign says, &quot;Without Facebook, we wouldn&#39;t have won.&quot; (@4:21)</p>

<p>For those who aren&#39;t familiar, Cambridge Analytica was communicating with Julian Assange about Hillary Clinton&#39;s and DNC&#39;s stolen emails. So was Don Jr. Michael Flynn, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI, also had an advisory role at Cambridge Analytica.

<p>Zuckerberg admitted there was overlap between Russia ads and the Trump Campaign.

<p>Facebook recommended Russian propaganda to users:

<p>Facebook helped Agata Burdonova, who was a manager at the IRA (Russian Troll Factory) that meddled in the US 2016 elections, and her husband, Dmitry Fyodorov, immigrate to Seattle Washington. Burdonova&#39;s husband has received a job offer from Facebook.

<p>Yuri Milner made these investments into Facebook with the help of Jared Kushner&#39;s friend and old classmate Ryan Williams. Yuri Milner also invested in Cadre, a company co-founded by Ryan Williams, Jared Kushner, and his brother Josh Kushner. However, Jared Kushner conveniently failed to disclose his ownership of the company. Milner&#39;s investment is likely through Gazprom as well.

<p>Guess who&#39;s friend&#39;s with both Mark Zuckerberg and Yuri Milner? Suspected Chinese agent and Vladimir Putin love interest Wendi Deng Murdoch.
Wendi Deng introduced her then husband Rupert Murdoch to Mark Zuckerberg:

<p>Yuri Milner and Wendi Deng attended a Time 100 Gala together in New York, April 2016.
<a href="http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Yuri+Milner/2016+Time+100+Gala+Time+Most+Influential+People/quud6cf3as-">http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Yuri+Milner/2016+Time+100+Gala+Time+Most+Influential+People/quud6cf3as-</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s Wendy Deng with Yuri Milner&#39;s wife and Karlie Kloss, who&#39;s dating Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner&#39;s brother.

<p>Wendi Deng also hosted a dinner that included Jared Kushner, Josh Kushner, and Ryan Williams, amongst others.
<a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/businesswoman-wendi-murdoch-career-profile">https://www.vogue.com/article/businesswoman-wendi-murdoch-career-profile</a>
Wendi Deng is know as a match-maker to her friends and actually helped reunite Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner after a break up, eventually leading to marriage. Wendi Deng may be the link between Yuri Milner with Zuckerberg, as well as with the Kushners, and Ryan Williams.</p>

<p>Wendi Deng was spotted on Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich&#39;s yacht several times.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3514484/Wendi-Deng-takes-break-St-Barts-billionaire-friend-Roman-Abramovich-s-yacht-three-weeks-ex-husband-Rupert-Murdoch-tied-knot-Jerry-Hall.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3514484/Wendi-Deng-takes-break-St-Barts-billionaire-friend-Roman-Abramovich-s-yacht-three-weeks-ex-husband-Rupert-Murdoch-tied-knot-Jerry-Hall.html</a></p>

<p>Wendi Deng introduced Ivanka Trump to Dasha Zhoukova, then wife of Roman Abramovich.
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner met at a business lucheon led by Abramovich associate Lev Leviev. At the time, Lev Leviev was hosting the bris for the grandson of Tamir Sapir, who&#39;s daughter Zina Sapir married Lev Leviev&#39;s Africa-Israel US CEO Roten Rosen. Trump, just months priors, hosted Zina Sapir and Roten Rosem&#39;s wedding at Mar-a-Lago.

<p>The Sapir Organization, in conjunction with Bayrock and the Trump Organization, put together the scandal-ridden Trump SoHo and were working together to replicate that with a Trump Tower Moscow.

<p>In 2000, Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska, along with others, made a deal that ended the &quot;Aluminum wars&quot; and turned the industry into a near monopoly.
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/jul/06/russia.football">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/jul/06/russia.football</a></p>

<p>Oleg Deripaska and Alisher Usmanov have been business ties together.

    <div class="md"><p>Decided in advance and achieved bc of the electoral college. Twice now in 2 decades the person with the most popular votes has lost. The electoral college and its antiquated practices, as well as how it varies state to state, is ultimately what haa caused these losses.

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to have a real head spin, compare the 1960 election cycle with the 2016 election cycle.  You&#39;ll see that Kennedy and Trump were getting hammered by the press and in the same format.  Hell, Kennedy couldn&#39;t get support or an endorsement from Truman, the last Democrat to be president before him.  Kennedy had everything the establishment could throw at him and won anyways, just like Trump.  Full blow military invasion was already set up and ready to go for Nixon and Kennedy canned it creating the bay of pigs.  Nixon was the pre-approved establishment candidate for the 1960 election and Clinton was the pre-approved candidate for the 2016.  Neither went according to plan.  Look at what happened to Kennedy&#39;s presidency and compare that to Trumps first two years.  Makes you wonder right?  The people can screw up the plan.  The thing about it is when the people exercise their power, the establishment finds a way to take it away.  Watch social media get heavily regulated.  They cannot control it right now.  I highly doubt fake news made that much of an impact.  Just an excuse to justify regulation.  Kind of like how 9/11 was used to bring in the patriot act.  Reightstag fire gave the Nazi&#39;s reason to eradicate communism and install absolute power.  History repeats itself.  Grab some popcorn and watch the meltdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the implications concerning the fact that Milner was employed in Washington DC by the World Bank during the early 90s</p>

<p>(and what are the implications for the r/politics poster who left explorations of that little detail out and instead focused half the info on tabloid level gossip)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Milner spent three years in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C. at the World Bank&#39;s financial sector branch. It was a time he calls his &quot;lost years.&quot; He traveled often to Moscow but was mostly watching from afar as Russia was privatizing mines, oil refineries and car factories. People with the right connections bought them on the cheap and established their status as oligarchs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Milner made plenty of connections in Russian banking circles and eventually met the now imprisoned oil baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who after a few meetings created a position for him in 1995 as head of his investment brokerage, Alliance-Menatep. If there was a proper route home, he finally found it. At Menatep Milner spearheaded the first hostile tender offer for a public company in post-Soviet times, a Russian candy giant called Red October. He also met Gregory Finger, who ran the Moscow office of U.S. hedge fund New Century Holdings, one of the biggest buyers of Russian securities at the time. &quot;We had chemistry,&quot; Milner says of the Russian national, who likewise had lived in the U.S. Their partnership deepened after Milner pitched Finger on starting a new venture fund.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This looks like a hodgepodge of relationships without any semblance of a narrative here.</p>

<p>It looks like Facebook had embeds in both campaigns, and I don’t see any issue with this</p>

<p>Facebook may have been used to as a marketing tool to target niche voters - again, nothing sinister or wrong with this</p>

<p>Some Russian billionaire who now lives in California has a stake in FaceBook - again, nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Internet Research bought a minuscule amount of ads, most of which had nothing to do with the campaign and promoted socialism causes like Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>It’s a long post of interesting facts, but no real narrative here</p>
