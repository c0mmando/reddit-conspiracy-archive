<p>Questioning Jewish control of anything, is not Anti-semitism. That whole phrase &quot;Anti-semitism&quot; is a psy op to stop anyone from questioning this group of people and is itself anti-goyimitic.</p>

<p>If I stay away from black neighborhoods in my city because I actually caught a stray bullet in my car when I did drive through them, does that make me racist? No it doesnt</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The phrase &quot;anti-semitism&quot; refers to hatred and suspicion of Jews based on false stereotypes and beliefs.  It is of course possible to criticize things done by Jewish people without that criticism being anti-semitic.  But when you start pulling out &quot;the banks are controlled by evil Jews!&quot; nonsense, that&#39;s anti-semitism.  I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re from, but I&#39;d encourage you to visit a Holocaust museum if you think that anti-semitism isn&#39;t real.  There are several in the U.S. and Europe.  The one in DC is quite good.</p>

<p>Finally...I would not blame you for staying away from high-crime neighborhoods.  Believe it or not, there are predominately black neighborhoods that are not high crime.  If you stayed away from those neighborhoods because of their black population, then yes, that would probably be racist.</p>

<p>I am not stopping you from research and questioning.  You are not doing a good job of research and questioning.  You are forming beliefs based off of spurious and unsourced internet blogs instead of actual historical record or scholarship.</p>

<p>Wait, so you you never went and did any additional research? And you think this kind of info will be available on CNN? And you didn&#39;t realize the countries that US invades are the ones that are not yet owned and controlled by the globalists?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;anti-semitism&quot; refers to hatred and suspicion of Jews based on false stereotypes and beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont hate jews though, dated one (who was so fucking hot) when I was 19, and even visited out there. In Israel, there are a lot of youth who want a revolution, but there are also Zionist/Globalist/Controllers as well.</p>

<p>Criticizing the disproportionate amount of Jews in Banking, Media, Hollywood, Academia, and Globalism is not antisemitic </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when you start pulling out &quot;the banks are controlled by evil Jews!&quot; nonsense, that&#39;s anti-semitism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No its not. There were evil jews and there were evil jews who controlled banks. See the Bolsheviks </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re from, but I&#39;d encourage you to visit a Holocaust museum if you think that anti-semitism isn&#39;t real. There are several in the U.S. and Europe. The one in DC is quite good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sad for all the deaths in WW2, not just the Jews:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Reminding someone about the Jews killed in WW2 is playing the victim card. Are you jewish? Because criticizing Zionism, the Palestinian policies, and global control of various aspects of media, academia, banking, etc usually brings out 2 things via goalpost moving: anti-semtisim label, and Victim Mentality.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not stopping you from research and questioning. You are not doing a good job of research and questioning. You are forming beliefs based off of spurious and unsourced internet blogs instead of actual historical record or scholarship.</p>

<p>History is written by the victors and controllers, and they don&#39;t tell you what&#39;s really going on behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More importantly though, why address it at all? Given the strong and obvious ties that WaPo has to both the CIA and the deep state at large, what&#39;s their ultimate goal in going out of their way to publicize and attack the legislator over a statement that they could clearly simply ignore and ridicule as tin-foil hattery? Playing the race card in some ways actually legitimizes the guy&#39;s accusations, at the very least more so than ridiculing it as absurd. Instead of saying &quot;your claims are nonsensical and absurd&quot; they argue &quot;that&#39;s racist, regardless of whether it&#39;s true&quot;. Such a strategy serves no purpose other than to confuse the public with regard to the mainstream narrative on weather modification and the globalist banking conspiracy. They must be really high on those adrenal glands...</p>

<p>Lol I think it&#39;s being treated as a given that the guy&#39;s claims are absurd.  The reaction has been that it&#39;s anti-semitic <em>on top</em> of being absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The focus  of the attention that&#39;s been thrown at this indicates the opposite. Plus, criticizing the Rothschilds isn&#39;t being antisemitic just as criticizing Hillary Clinton doesn&#39;t make some one anti-woman. When I say the House of Saud is filled with needle-dicked degenerate sociopathic death merchants, I&#39;m not attacking Islam either. There&#39;s an abundance of evidence concerning a centralized banking conspiracy, and the Rothschilds are arguably one of the biggest players.  And regardless, when the CIA&#39;s newspaper starts calling people racist based on statements made concerning powerful globalist families, it looks like bullshit. </p>
