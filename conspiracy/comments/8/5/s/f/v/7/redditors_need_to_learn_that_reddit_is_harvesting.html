<p>edit: To everyone jokingly wondering what reddit and 3rd parties can do with your porn interest, it is quite simple - sex sells, whether products or ideas. Data analysis can find correlations between political ideology and sexual interests, then companies can use stories about that sexual interest to attract your attention then hit you with a political message to sell you an idea to influence your political beliefs and votes. This is certainly what sites like Breitbart and Huffington Post do, just like old school advertisers just put a sexy woman or man on the ad to get you to look then burns the message into your brain while you&#39;re sexually aroused. Reddit&#39;s info on your &quot;dark secrets&quot;, especially your porn interests, the stuff that gets you aroused, may really be more valuable and effective than a lot of what Facebook has.</p>

<p>Nah, there are several ways to freely use the internet and be completely anonymous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we assume that we&#39;re not going the distance and try to modify browsing pattern, then you can still be uniquely identified as a single entity. As an example, I just pulled up stats for <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ifCuKeX.png">two reddit accounts</a> I suspect being the same person. I don&#39;t have access to their OS, IP or browser ID, but I can tell you they are likely they same person. </p>

<p>Imagine what the Government can do when they have access to every imaginable database and a general idea where things are physically coming from. One time accesses from an open wifi using a cantenna and moving around hotspots is effective, for awhile, but no one&#39;s doing that to use reddit. </p>

<p>For Joe Shmo on his cable modem, he really has no chance of staying anonymous for very long within the US if someone powerful wanted to find out who they were. </p>

<p>Eh, chances are you don&#39;t. The amount of work to keep ones data fingerprint clean is beyond most peoples ability. You have internet at home? Chances are your ISP is selling off your DNS data and any unencrypted traffic you send. Use a VPN, most of those services leak data, and they are really easy to misconfigure. Hopefully you&#39;re blocking ads, because Reddit is tracking you.</p>

<p>Im not saying dont do it but like you said it brings unwanted attention.

<p>Not shitty - realistic. There are various degrees of privacy controls one can engage to various degrees of success. But in the end, there is no such thing as <em>complete</em> privacy on the Internet. Telling the truth is not &quot;shitty&quot;. It is just hard to swallow.</p>

<p>If you use a VPN and then log in to any service, you might as well drop the VPN part. </p>

<p>Also most VPNs are leaky as hell, and it takes a lot of technical understanding to keep data from leaking one way or another.</p>

<p>Most people would be better off blocking ads, 3rd party cookies, and most scripts. And then avoiding posting &#39;too much&#39; personal info online. </p>

<p>It is simple marketing like everything else, my man. If they know a certain group with a certain political ideology likes Jennifer Lawrence nudes or transporn or furryporn, then they can use stories about that sort of thing to attract your attention, then feed you a political story to try and influence your vote.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly what these &#39;comprehensive&#39; news sites like Huffington Post and Breitbart do. Bannon&#39;s big insight was that &quot;Politics is downstream from culture.&quot; So they find out what culture you are interested in, get your interest with that story, then feed you the politics with that spoonful of sugar.</p>

<p>Remember, sex sales. Old school advertising just put a sexy lady in the ad to get you to look at it and then the product was stuck in your head. Same thing works with ideas. And this is already just a natural behavior on sites like 4chan where users post an unrelated sexy image alongside an post so more people will read the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there was a bit of a controversy in the <a href="/r/paragon">/r/paragon</a> sub where a mod white knighted constantly for the company, got a few visits to Epic headquarters to test out some big beta changes before they went public, and of course since the guy was brown nosing he (and others) sucked the devs off and told them all the big changes were amazing etc. Well the actual community hated the changes when they were publicly released but the mod continued to defend them and ended up earning himself a job at Epic, and the game itself ended up getting cancelled because the game just bled players after the changes.</p>

<p>It is a terribly shitty dynamic because mods know they can use their position of power to influence conversations, say nothing but positive things not giving the developers the feedback they need to hear but still providing value in white knighting making their PR propaganda seem more legit, and the mods are  rewarded with special priviliges and even job offers. It is a massive conflict of interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to reddit, where everyone literally believes something in the front page. Reddit is the perfect example of the bangwagoning effect. FB data has always been sold to companies and is used by millions and is pretty much where facebook gets its money. But just because someone admitted to farming it, everyone is freaking out. News flash, facebook listens to keywords in your mic, you alexa is likely spying, your &quot;smart&quot; tv is collecting data on what you watch, your phone is using your location to show traffic in cities and where people buy things.. If you think deleting facebook is going to solve this you are dead wrong. The only way to solve this is to never put anything out there, but because of how corrupt the world is, chances are FB and others are just buying data under the table from who knows, schools, gov agencies, or maybe even banks. Welcome to 2018. I don&#39;t care anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have my own beliefs and opinions, formed independent of outside influence, and nothing will change them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha, that&#39;s the mistake that way too many people think, that their opinion are their own. The wisest man in history was Socrates for knowing he knows nothing.</p>

<p>Just for a quick example: What company pops in your head when I ask you about fast food burgers? Not even your favorite, just fast food burgers in general? The first  thing that pops in your head is called <em>Brand Salience</em>. For a lot of people this is McDonalds. For stuff like smart phones for a lot of people it is Apple. And companies spend a ton of money on marketing just so that their brand will be  the first thing that pops in your head when you think of a certain category of product. And this is just a basic technique, getting you to think of one company as a brand leader. If your brand has more salience with more people you will increase sales.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t look at it from your subjective view thinking you&#39;re making your own opinions of nothing. &quot;Formed outside of outside influence&quot; - you weren&#39;t born with all the concepts in your head dude. You learned them from &quot;outside influence&quot; They were <em>produced</em> and given to you. </p>

<p>There are reasons why everything in your head is in your head. What you do with that info rationally IS up to you, assuming you can control your urges and desires and fears and stuff, but just getting that info into your head in the first place is a big deal.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s how these guys really mess with your head because they attach emotion to whatever facts or fakeness they present. That is why words like &quot;terrorist&quot; &quot;harvesting&quot; &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; are used, and info is framed in such a way  to make it sound scarier or sexier than it really is. </p>

<p>And if you think you&#39;re immune to all this or that psychology is silly, then you are really a prime target for this stuff. You have to know how it works to be able to fight it.</p>

<p>Those key words you mentioned do not affect my opinion at all. As I stated, I look into things myself (if I care about it) and decide

<p>This is a symptom of the internet as a whole. It&#39;s still seen as a very private activity so people are more open to exploring their deepest interests and that information is very valuable to a lot of companies for a lot of different reasons. It&#39;s not just about selling you a new toaster when you are looking at reviews of toasters, it&#39;s also about making predictions on new products and where brands should go to and they will invest heavily in that direction with enough information pointing them that way. </p>

<p>Its no different than real life. If you don&#39;t want other people to know personal things about you then don&#39;t express those ideas. The net is not a place that is free of malovent people, in fact its actually a far more dangerous environment than the real world.

    <div class="md"><p>haha sweet. Thank you for telling me about this reddit nuke thing. This is an amazing extension. I have always wondered how one would delete all their comments without doing in manually one by one. SWEET! I think I will do like you do and use this once a week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean, because these companies understand what you think and how you think they&#39;ll start to control what you see on these websites, therefore making you think the way they want you to.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty good theory, and it actually makes sense, but I believe the content I consume is still produced by real people and not faked or made by robots.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still a few years away from that level of technology imho as well, although that&#39;s basically what MSM and many college professors do on a daily basis.</p>
