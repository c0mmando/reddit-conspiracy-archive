        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think most of us can agree that there’s something more than what our senses tell us. The concept of god is very vague and diverse but a general theme emerges; god is good, or on the positive polarity, and there’s the existence of the negative polarity or “evil.” </p>

<p>I read a book once, about a British soldier, a medic, in World War I. After witnessing thousands of his countrymen die in his arms he came to a startling realization; god must be in immense pain, if he does really care about us like he says. </p>

<p><em>If</em> god can be quantified, and has any measure of awareness of self, how difficult it must be to cope with all of this. What kind of immeasurable virtue must reside in his heart, to empower him to not only stomach all suffering, but to allow him to continue to trust in his sons and daughters to endure despite complete isolation. </p>

<p>An unconditional, fatherly and motherly type of love. </p>

<p>And they’ll say “if he loved us he would bail us out.” Similar to a parent letting a child learn from their own mistakes, is God’s lack of presence in our awareness. For free will was the greatest gift that could be given. We all get to be “little gods,” for awhile. </p>

<p>Imagine that you believe in god or a higher, likely intelligent power than yourself. What is this really giving up? What are you really losing? The addiction to your own senses and assumptions. </p>

<p>Imagine you don’t believe in anything. Do you think (some people, a lot do) that god would punish you or hate you for that? Of course not! But faith doesn’t need to be expressed, simply possessed. Trusting in yourself, love, and your fellow man is it’s own reward. Getting to live on forever in paradise would just be icing. </p>

<p>Read Jesus’ parable of the prodigal son. The father gains <em>nothing</em> by allowing his son to return to his service; in fact his son has cost him 1/3 of his possessions. The father has <em>suffered.</em> he’s been worried, the son had forsaken him. This does not even register to the father, who is just excited to see his boy again. </p>

<p>I took my moment, I dwelled on how bizarre the idea of god is. </p>

<p>Take a moment and dwell on the nature of life; order, structure, complexity, birth and death, thought and emotion. Does the cycle of life not appear bizarrely, perfectly balanced to you? Is it not acceptable to at least theorize that the facts have yet to have been fully understood? </p>

<p>Even if there is no god, the belief in god kept us going and kept some of our most animalistic and violent ancestors at bay. Faith in something higher is absolutely warranted, even if it isn’t necessary. </p>

<p>Paying attention to our surroundings has made me believe in a creator, just like our ancestors. They believed because they could SEE.</p>

<p>If anything I say sounds mean and/or angry that isn&#39;t the intention. I am not trying to insult or demean at all. With that in mind...  </p>

<p>None of it makes sense. You are trying to tell me some bloke created a woman out of a rib of another bloke? You telling me that God flooded the world because he didn&#39;t like it? wtf. You cannot be a conspiracy theorist and not look at any religion and think <em>hmmm... something is fishy here</em>  </p>

<p>It is a lot easier to explain the world and our history and mythology if, when you can&#39;t explain something, to just say Oh well God did it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying God doesn&#39;t exist. It might do. And at the same time I do not care. If Almighty God exists, and I am not certain that She does, I&#39;d like to think that She gave me the ability to question Her wisdom. I can&#39;t be punished for free will, right? But to think that we can understand something like that? Nah mate, not having it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you&#39;ve said. That was the thought process that lead me to atheism, but it&#39;s only now that I see it was in error. The first problem is that you&#39;re basing your ideas of God on the Christian god as depicted in a book that was edited and censored by people who want to steer you away from the ideas it puts forth. If you wrote a book and then I took your book and added dragons and fairies and then everyone said your book was fake because dragons and fairies don&#39;t exist...you would understand that people were making their conclusions based upon a faulty premise. If people know that shit was manipulated, then they can learn what is manipulation and seek to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not basing this off just the Abrahamic religions. Well, I kind of am in a way since they are the only religions I have experienced. I just prefer the idea of the Old Gods like The Romans and The Greeks believed in. Why only have One Almighty? Why not have The God of War or The Goddess of Love? Fuck it, why not have The God of The On-Time Bus? I&#39;ve prayed harder than I ever have for a bus to arrive on time than I ever did at church. Of which I went a handful of times.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve struggled with the idea of God, its not that I don&#39;t believe, I just don&#39;t care. One person can be inspired to dedicate their life to helping the poor because of their devotion to God, another person might explode themselves because they think it is what God wants them to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would direct you to read the Bhagavad Gita. It is a book that references god but without the Christian concepts. If you&#39;re open to it, JewTube has a wonderful dramatic recitation of it. It introduced me to the God concept without all the contradictory baggage from the Bible. Personally, I believe they are describing the same phenomenon but I never really understood the Bible from an intellectual stand point. But that&#39;s only because a superficial reading at face value without historical context is a fruitless endeavor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of possibilities to consider:</p>

<p>Perhaps it is just a force, still a higher presence.</p>

<p>Perhaps it can be both; perhaps god is truly infinite and can manifest anyway god wants, which would make him the most personified “person” to have ever existed, having been the source of personhood him/her/itself. Maybe god literally lives <em>through us</em> learning new things from (technically) himself. Humanity is awfully perfect isn’t it? Two arms two legs, genitals, animals who question their own existence. Wonder if it was successful the first try, or maybe there were.. prototypes. </p>

<p>The thing about the Bible doesn’t hold water here, as I made no attempts to idolize it in the post. I simply appreciate the beauty of it. Yes, it’s confusing and makes little sense at times; but there are passages that are packed full of insight. Someone wrote that. There’s a history and a tradition there that shouldn’t just be forgotten. Why Jesus? Why Buddha? If we just simply reject these teachings without careful consideration as to <em>why</em> they are so prevalent, we relinquish our opportunity to know the truth altogether. If they were charlatans, the people should probably be made aware, if they were true prophets or even “divine” beings, than I say with full confidence that we need to change in order to survive. </p>

<p>Probably best to heed their warnings or at least keep them in the back of your mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised Christian but became heavily interested in Buddhism and Taoism as I got older. I have no problems at all with the teaching of Christ, it&#39;s a lovely message. Unfortunately it&#39;s been perverted. This is why I mentioned the god of the Bible, Yahweh.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also fascinated with the Sumerian creation story as a companion to the Bible. Lots of my questions have been answered and many other pieces of info have fallen into place for me. So I have an unconventional concept of our creator and of God. I believe they are separate things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s controversial but I believe our ancestors. They too the time to write their history down and I have no reason to believe it&#39;s totally fabricated. </p>

<p>To answer your question, I think the Enki, the Annunaki scientist created us by mixing his dna with a hominid that was around at the time, just as the tablets claim.</p>

<p>My belief got little more solid once I found out about the Aratta civilization. They are the oldest civilization we are aware of right now. They are a few thousand years older than the Sumerians. What makes it very interesting is that the Aratta mention the Annunaki in their stone carvings and artwork. So now we have two separate cultures claiming the Annunaki were real and they interacted with man at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, every culture in every corner of the planet has claimed this type of thing in one way or the other. But the Annunaki are not gods. They apparently like to play god though. </p>

<p>Only a few possibilities:</p>

<li><p>Annunaki are aliens or ancient humans from another planet or universe</p></li>

<p>There’s something definitely there, but in reality the Annunaki are probably long gone, and we’ll have to find out ourselves.  Based on the stories, I doubt we would want to meet them, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they were gods to me. Others consider them gods. I just that said Enki/Lucifer tweaked our DNA and made us into the modern version we are now. The council fiercely objected to making us, we were considered an abomination by Enlil/Yahweh. Eventually after a massive rebellion by other lower ranking Annunaki called the Igigi they decided to make us for slave labor. Enlil/ Yahweh hated us so much that he attempted to exterminate us several times (also mentioned in the Bible.)</p>

<p>It was Enki/Lucifer that repeatedly broke rank and orders to save man (build that boat, a flood is coming) because he felt that we were his children, we share DNA. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my humble opinion that they are alien beings and really seems like most don&#39;t give a shit about us. There&#39;s a few like Enki and his son Ningishzidda/Thoth that have repeatedly tried to help humans.</p>

<p>I could go on bit I&#39;ll leave it here. Again using the tablets along with the Bible it all begins to make sense, to me at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding there were 3 versions of man made. </p>

<p>1st one was too smart and rebelled, Yahweh ordered a famine to exterminate them but they fled to another land. </p>

<p>2nd try they dumbed us down but we couldn&#39;t breed. The 1st version of man came back to rescue them because they were related. They left also. Yahweh is livid. </p>

<p>3rd try was successful and were called Adamu,we were dumb and could breed. This dovetails with the Bible story of man receiving intelligence. Enlil/Yahweh wanted dumb slaves. His brother Enki/Lucifer wanted us to be thinkers. They ended up staying up late and being noisy and that pissed off Yahweh again, so he decided to create the flood to kill everything on the planet. Like I said before, he was a total psychopath with no regard for any life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this brings up memories from back when I was obsessed with aliens lol. The truth is we don’t know yet, might never know the specifics, and may not even be able to comprehend them yet. </p>

<p>A couple of random thoughts; if we know of three, given the estimated time of the Annunaki arrival as early as 400,000-1,000,000 years ago, I would assume there were many, many more forms of humanoids that existed, whether at the same time or different eras. </p>

<p>Also, I really despise the idea that some people have, that we were the result of a genetic brew of dozens of different races, like Greys and Reptilians and Arcturians etc; to me that theory (in my opinion probably purposefully) neglects the uniqueness and sacredness of humanity. I understand the idea of the reptile brain though. Our appearance just doesn’t add up, like you threw 15 species in a lab and this is what you came up with? </p>

<p>Hmm, very precise, Dr Enki. The overlords will be pleased. </p>

<p>No, I think the Annuanki are most likely just our ancestors, probably crash landed here and have been lost to time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your absolutely right, we may never know the truth.</p>

<p>Apparently, whites look just like the Annunaki. They were tall, white and had blue eyes.</p>

<p>Hopefully more of the tablets get translated and we can get more information. It&#39;s criminal that they are just collecting dust in a London museum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, likewise. </p>

<p>Personally, I let go of the whole prepper mindset; def good to be prepared, but I think we’re facing an event out of our control. The only ground we’ll have to stand on is the condition of our minds and/or souls. If the gov really wanted to fuck us up and <em>could</em> they woulda done it by now. I think we’re looking at a spiritual or cosmic shift. </p>

<p>If Earth is gonna get cooked by the suns rays, there really isn’t much I can do except sort of be thankful for having existed at all. </p>
