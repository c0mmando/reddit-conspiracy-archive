    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t thought about it that way but it’s an intriguing point. </p>

<p>Facebook has been around for over 15 years. MySpace was honestly cooler cause #music, yet lasted 5 years. </p>

<p>To me it feels like Facebook is <em>constantly</em> boosted on every corner of the net. It’s borderline ‘Black Mirror.’ </p>

<p>Edit: honorable mention for Snapchat, which is a different format, I think this will be the format of the next social media explosion; hourly updates on everything.. mind numbing stupidity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s already a huge issue.</p>

<p>Hourly updates on everything including nothing.</p>

<p>When UK vs Russia started getting steam May said we would get additional information at 19:00, which meant they wouldn&#39;t release anything for 7 hours.</p>

<p>Somehow certain news outlets found a way to release four updates during these 7 hours. About what? There was zero additional information available.</p>

<p>We&#39;re drowning in news without being informed.<br/>
1984? More like Brave New World.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmmmm. I disagree, I think while reddit has our ramblings neatly filed away. Unless you&#39;re into some weird subs, it doesn&#39;t make us special and they would have to dig a bit to find us in the real world. Facebook on the other, you are profiling yourself and your household, kids etc... on a database online. What you did, where you go, your personal chats are all archived. Everytime you chat on FB with your close loved ones you are capturing sensitive info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in today’s world they know that either way. Your phone is always tracking you. Your credit card is tracking wherever you buy. Cameras are always tracking you. Your family is “public” as in they know who they are. On Reddit it should be pretty easy to track you as long as Reddit allows them, which they probably would. We feel the anonymity on Reddit and may say/follow things we wouldn’t on our public side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caitlin Johnstone wrote a good article about this recently: <a href="https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2018/03/19/why-i-disagree-with-the-strategy-of-exiting-facebook-twitter-and-youtube/">Why I Disagree With The Strategy Of Exiting Facebook, Twitter And YouTube</a>. Except: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point with all this is that the few clear-eyed rebels are not going to kill Facebook, Youtube and Twitter by marginalizing themselves into the fragmented fringe of alternative social media outlets like Steemit, Dtube, Gab, Minds, MeWe, etc. That’s exactly what these bastards want. They want us far away from their mainstream livestock. They want us to exit into some fringe circle that they will then invent a name for and smear as the place where all the kooks go. All of a sudden you’ll see all the mass media outlets simultaneously start using that label (“fringe conspiracy sites”, “fringe media”, who knows) in a derogatory and dismissive way, and from then on their herd will be immunized from our influence.</p>

<p>We should absolutely be expanding into new social media platforms (MeWe is an especially pleasant and collaborative site right now due to the current absence of pro-establishment disruptors), but we need to be engaging the mainstream as well, because they will not follow us. If Facebook can absorb a 24 percent dip that it caused by its own actions, then it can absorb the far smaller group of anti-establishment activists who would exit it as well.</p>

<p>I know it’s intensely creepy that these Silicon Valley corporations are being used to gather information on us. I know it’s incredibly frustrating to watch them strangle our numbers further and further into marginalization. But the reason they are fighting so hard to wedge us out of their mainstream platforms is because they <em>want us out</em>. Saying “Okay, well if you don’t want us here, we’ll leave!” is not a punishment, it’s a reward.</p>
