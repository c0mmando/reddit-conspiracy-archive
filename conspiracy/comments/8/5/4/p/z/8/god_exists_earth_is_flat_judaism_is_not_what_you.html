       Please define "Jewish".
      </h1>
      <p>
       Rabbinical Judaism and Biblical Judaism are two different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rabbinical Judaism in short is not Jewish at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the synagogue of satan that masquerades as Judaism that is warned about in Revelation 3:9 and Revelation 2:9.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish people who follow actual Tanakh would come to the conclusion that Jesus is the messiah and "Christianity" is really Biblical Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who follow the Talmud are disobeying God by following the word of man, and not God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proverbs 30:4, Genesis 1, and the Isaiah 53 all point to the Holy Trinity - God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ, all written in Hebrew Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty more to back up this claim all throughout the Old Testament.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Earth IS flat.
      </h1>
      <p>
       The reason news stories are now covering this FACT is because it would cause more people to come to the realization of the truth if they did not, as people would question why the media totally ignored such a large movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way, newscasters can ridicule and inject false claims in to the minds of the masses in order to slow the spread of truth while the satanistic pedophiles figure out a way to get their cattle back in order, so they can rape our children and enslave our bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no conspiracy to discredit conspiracies, this is the conspiracy that ties all conspiracies together.
      </p>
      <p>
       God exists, the Earth is flat, and satan is the god of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N30/comments/7530hc/revelation_1318/">
        It is no coincidence that calculations for the globe Earth lie continually come to 666.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The globe lie is the grand delusion also spoken of in The Book of Revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don’t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God. 2 Corinthians 4:4
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. 1 John 2:15-17

       I have a story for you. Probably about 10 years ago I found myself in NYC for the weekend. Walking on that little parkway across from the beacon theater I looked up and saw the billboard. TONIGHT: Steely Dan rent party tour. I almost shit a brick when I called the ticket office and they told me they were sold out. I said there must be some tickets they hold, I’ll pay whatever. The woman said to try Amex or CITI if I had one of their cards as they sometimes reserve a few tickets for customers. I had a citi card and called them. Sure enough I was able to get two tickets and at a discount! The opening act was this awesome jazz trio, drums, Hammond and guitar. Sort of a modern bebop joey defrancesco meets jimmy smith type of deal. So cool. The Dan take the stage and they announce the winner for the internet poll they took for this show. Apparently, and I didn’t know this going in, they asked their fans to vote for what they should play that night. Overwhelmingly the fans asked for Aja, in its entirety, in the same order as the record. Of course, sprinkled with some other hits after. It was an amazing night with an amazing show that I almost didn’t get to experience. Oh, I was in NYC for my birthday that weekend ;)

       That is an amazing story!!  A night to remember.  Hopefully you had a sexy main squeeze to share it with.  I've gone to a lot of concerts, but once saw a band that I'd always wanted to see, The Doobie Brothers, because some of my earliest memories were of Black Water and a few others.  So, turns out it's in a big venue, but doesn't fill at all, we're only back about 8 rows on main floor.  The sound was amazing and this was about the mid 1990s.  My old bf was passed out on his chair as everyone is standing on theirs having the time of their lives.  He always could sleep through anything if he was tired enough, and no joke, he was only just tired and a little stoned.  It was hilarious.  Oh well.  Hr finally woke up once the concert was over.  He could sleep like the dead.

       You’ll have to a be a bit more specific. I have been listening to all their albums for decades and don’t remember songs about cruising the universe. Their subject matters are usually a lot more...mundane.

       Reality would disagree. Tell me something. Why is there a 90 degree difference in viewing angle between Polaris and any star on the celestial equator?

Surely you understand that for this to be true on a Flat Earth, stars must exist at multiple different altitudes... at the same time... including ground level?

       No, there isn't one god, there are no gods. Giving one a capital letter doesn't make it any more real than all the other imaginary ones.

       There was a guy here that said he was some dude from Sudan, another said he was a 20 year old from Florida (of all places, all sorts of Florida Man jokes in there). I knew Jesus when I was in my late teens. He was a homeless guy in my neighborhood that had attempted to get into the US twice, once inside a tomato container and the second trying to run to the wheel assembly on a commercial plane as it was on the runway. The first time he got caught in the US as they were unloading the tomato container from the boat. He was sent back promptly. The second time, he didn’t make it to the plane. I guess he took off too late to reach it before its speed was too fast for him. Last I heard he was arrested for male prostitution at a tourist beach. I gotta say, Jesus was hilarious and fun to hang out and shoot the shit with.

       Learn about the Michelson Morley experiment and Sagnac experiment and how does Einstein and his relativity fit in the picture. And don't just read the wiki for fuck sakes. Add the search term ether for better results. Use bing also, not just Google. Here is a website with lots of clues. That should keep your busy for a few months years.

       So you can't explain it yourself? Why should I trust those guys? Can I replicate their experiment or attain the same results through a different method? How does Einstein's theory of relativity fit in? Why must I use Bing? Is Google in league with Big Globe? Why must I start with some fringe site instead of publicly available, scientifically vetted papers? Why would Scientists lie about something as trivial as the shape of the Earth?

       So you can't explain how the Earth is flat and that is why I can not recognize your authority on the subject. I've seen others explain all sorts of scientific concepts on  the Internet before (obviously not to the same depth as a peer-reviewed paper  but they often have multiple vetted sources) Heck, we even have r/askscience. There aren't hints to be given. This isn't National Treasure. Either the information is accurate and verifiable or it isn't.

       I'm just asking questions. I thought r/conspiracy loves the curious? If you can't explain the science behind Flat Earth then you have no business trying to educate and should self-reflect on your position. Can you explain the concepts and achieve verifiable proof that the Earth is flat or not?

       You're not curious. Don't kid yourself. I have given you enough hints for you to pull on the thread. You rather not. You can't learn anything earth shattering from a reddit post. You can get hints and go down the rabbit hole. I'm not interested in spoon feeding you information when you act like a child getting force fed broccoli. Now fuck off. And I'm not a flat earther. I see problems with the globe and flat I just follow the truth.

       You haven't given any information! You said a bunch of vague stuff without sources and proceeded to call it science despite it not being science. Science involves replicatable results a documented method that illustrates how results were achieved. You haven't provided any of that and when I point that out you call me a child because I'm not going to believe you without proof?

       If it walks and talks like a Flat Earther...
 So what shape is the Earth if there are problems with a Globe and Flat Earth model? Is it a tesseract?

       I can. But it would take hours in person to someone who is smart, open minded and actually curious to understand the monumental illusion and lie he has been believing since before he could piss by himself. You on the other hand, is a half-witted imbecile on a message board who thinks he has it all figured out and  is not really looking to learn but is actualy trying to reenfoce his  ignorance on himself via trivial inquiries as a front for actual desire to find the truth.

       All I ask is for you to explain a bit provide some sources and evidence for the conclusion you've reached and demonstrate how these results are replicatable. Not once have you attempted to do so. Can you explain or not? Where is the proof? 
You are the one with the fringe belief, it is your responsibility to explain it. So explain it in simplest terms. Give it a shot. If I'm so deadset on my ignorance I wouldn't constantly and consistently ask you to try to explain. Don't give me vague terms and "clues" to search up on Bing. Either explain it or admit you can't. Once more: where is the evidence that the Earth is flat and the Moon Landing was faked?

       Start with the Michelson Morley experiment and Sagnac experiment. Learn everything you can about those experiments and their implications. Should take you a while. Then learn about Herbert Dingle. Read his books. Free pdf. Science at the cross roads. Im ven gaving you a tittle. 
Do your own research. Or don't. I don't care.

       It's your responsibility to teach if you want any chance of this being regarded as a serious contender against mainstream science and common sense. Why not just explain? How does the Sagnac experiment prove Flat Earth or how the Moon Landing was faked? Why should I trust this Doug Merret when I can't find any outside information about him? Why is this something on the website?:

Either link the relevant information, explain it or admit you can't. Where is the proof of Flat Earth?

       because that's what relativity wants you to believe. You're too stupid to even know how the current model that's being taught even works.  Do you know what special theory of relativity is even about? whats the difference between Special and General theory of relativity? of course you don't! quick. wiki it and read the first paragraph and tell yourself you grasp the idea.

       This is starting to become a bit more clear for me but it took years and years.  Here are some clues. Do you know who came up with the big bang theory? no. not hubble. No, not Einstein. that mother fucker has not a single original thought. then who? A little guy named George Lemaitre. don't mind him, he is just a humble jesuit priest.   HAHAHHAHAHAH fucking retards walking around poking fun of people who believe in a god and church, yet they themselves subscribe to an idea put forth by a jesuit. Can't make this shit up. Another thing you can make up! where did the first NASA administrator come from? Air force? Marines? was he a physicist? A rocket industry?  nope your boy T. Keith Glennan
came from Paramount pictures.  yes. the people who still make your movies.  now go back to lala land.

       The words Jew, Judean, and Judite are etymologically related to words and names such as Judge, Jude, Tudor, Tutor, and George. One of the greatest Sumerian kings was Lord Gudea. He was known as the judge or wise man of his people. Originally, a Jew or Judite was an initiate or adept, an astrologer and master of esoteric science. If we change the letter "J" to "D," instead of Jew we get Dew or, more correctly Deus, meaning "god" or "of god."

       There are a great many false ideas about the Jews. They are said, for instance, to belong to a Semitic race. There is, however, no such race: there are only Semitic-speaking people showing varying racial compositions

      <p>
       Hans Gunther

       The word Jew is, likewise, a Gaelic term. It did not refer to a racial group per se. It referred to any man or woman who rose up to study the great mysteries in order to attain spiritual perfection. It referred to those who shone like the sun, morally and spiritually, and to those who lived in harmony with nature. Its origin is the Gaelic Ibur, meaning "Yew Tree," or Iuh or Iudach (later Yudah or Judah) meaning "the "bright," or "the shining," or "the daylight." It referred to those awakened ones, the devotees of the stars. This is where we get the word "Judge." Thus, the original "Judites" were nothing less than the awakened ones who revered the twelve signs of the zodiac. They were the astrologers of Ireland and Egypt.

       Define "Jewish"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Because of the false but very common idea that the Jews of today are all that remain of the ancient Israel people, it becomes necessary here to point out that, with the exception of a very few individuals, none of the ten-tribed house of Israel and only a very small remnant of the two-tribed House of Judah ever returned to Palestine after their deportation to Assyria and Babylon. With the fall of the empires which held them captive the main body...the tribes...became a part of that great north-western migration of peoples into and across Europe which took place in the centuries just before the beginning of the Christian era"---- W.H.Bennett

       Wasn't the Talmud just the spoken word from God to the Levites, which was then written down. How is that different from the old testament? Men wrote the words god inspired them to write. Seems similar to me

       Agreed, scientific fundamentalism is as much a belief system (by literal definition, it is a set of chosen opinions about things which you know nothing) - any atheist who says they are SURE there is no god, is as full of shit as anyone who says their god is the one true God.

       They don't believe in science, which is a process. They just believe in the authority of the Chosen People who tell them what to believe. Many things atheists believe, like evolution, are defeated by the scientific method every time.

       It's not observable. Trans-species evolution has not been observed anywhere, at any time, whether in the laboratory or in nature or even in the fossil record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darwin himself admitted there's no evidence to support his hypothesis which means it should never have even been put forth in the first place:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life?
        <strong>
         We meet with no such evidence.
        </strong>
        And this is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections used against my theory.

       Evolution is just the change of allele frequencies within a population over time. We have seen this. We have many examples of it. It is very easily repeatable.

       No... no he freaking didn't. In case you didn't know, he wrote a whole book on this stuff. Read that book in it's entirety and tell he didn't put forward a single piece of evidence supporting his theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he gave only a smidgen of evidence when he initially wrote Origin of Species, the field of genetics (which by the way, wasn't even a thing at the time) very much supports the ideas he put forth.

       Another fantastically unscientific, irrational detail is that in the pursuit of scientific god-head, they find new things every day, which simply raises the bar for how much they have to conquer in order to get to that point.
