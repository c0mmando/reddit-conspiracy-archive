<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/movies/comments/84tsis/can_we_talk_about_disney_and_their_business/">/r/movies/comments/84tsis/can_we_talk_about_disney_and_their_business/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s what he/she wrote: </p>

<p><strong>Gotta be honest: Kinda hoping this doesnt get huge, cause I am not looking to get fired, but I need to get this out.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disney is just getting worse and worse for theaters.</strong></p>

<p><strong>They stopped letting theater employees get free tickets to see their movies. Any of them. Ever. Even a month in, none of us can go see Black Panther even if its at 10am in an empty theater. They are the ONLY studio who actively campaign against the people selling their movies actually being allowed to see them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And, yeah, whatever...no one gives a shit about minimum wage workers and dont care about their issues. I know; I should get a real job I guess.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But now they also wont allow teachers to get free tickets during teacher appreciation week, aka its Spring Break and you have a week off, you can see any free movie you want! Unless you want to see Black Panther or a Wrinkle in Time...then you gotta pay the mouse.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Its just getting worse and worse as Disney gobbles up more property. They wont let theaters cap their movie sales (aka: if you go to a theater/restaurant hybrid that has servers bringing you food and drinks to your seats; dont expect good service during a Disney film, because even if only one server is available the theater has to SELL OUT because Disney demands it: That one server is probably serving 60+ people besides you, even though the theater would usually stop selling at 30-40 to not overwork a minimum wage employee for any other movie by any other studio)</strong></p>

<p><strong>They demand their movies play in the biggest theaters for weeks or even months even if the theater would make better money playing something else. Otherwise: good luck keeping a theater going without access to Marvel/Star Wars/Pixar, because Disney will pull their business!</strong></p>

<p><strong>And as they buy up more and more movies, theaters get less and less access; do you enjoy going to special screenings of older cult movies now playing on a big screen? Too bad, because after Disney buys them they go straight into that coveted vault of theirs and are no longer allowed to be played. And they now own a LOT of movies that you really would not expect. Because not every buyout is as public as the Fox one.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disney is taking over and they are doing all these highly public good deeds in order to sweep their rather greedy business practices and media hoarding under the rug so no average person notices (they just blame the theater for not catering to their needs and wants, when really; its all Disney</strong></p>

<p>It was the top submission before it got removed and replaced by Disney&#39;s latest avengers movie. Hmmmm. </p>

<p>The OP (who&#39;s username I won&#39;t give away) hasn&#39;t posted since. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a jailbroken fire stick. It’s really not that good of quality. Some comes in very good and some does not it. And then with updates happen you have to go back and redo it and stuff like that. For $20 a month it’s just not worth it. 99% of the stuff that I pay this guy for is 1080 P. He even has a 4K section with several hundred movies and TV shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their selection is not great because the content producers limit what goes on Netflix. When Netflix first started out, they put everything they could on there. Then then studios sued.</p>

<p>The Netflix original content is one of the best things to happen ever. </p>

<p>It forced other production studios to rethink broadcast television and movies all together.</p>

<p>Satellite, cable and TV are way more expensive and way less user friendly when it comes to availability of content UNLESS you want to go the PPV route in which case Netflix again comes out ahead dude to the pricing.</p>

<p>Amazon prime charges for some content.</p>

<p>Same with Hulu.</p>

<p>I cut the cord and have all three of them plus plex. It&#39;s not ideal yet, but what is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was taken on a week-long all-expense paid trip to DisneyWorld in FL last year, and it was the most horrifying week of my life! I don&#39;t have any &quot;dirt&quot; per se, just a collection of observations; no one else in my party was phased by things that disturbed me, the brainwashing from that place is insane!  </p>

<p>One example is the &quot;meal-plan&quot; they sell. As I said, I didn&#39;t pay for this trip, but the gist is, one large fee per person with the ticket purchase, and you get an electronic wristband that you MUST wear at all times. You scan it at each food vendor/restaurant and get all your food &quot;free&quot;. The plan gives each person an OUTRAGEOUS amount of food- 3 full meals per day, plus 6 or 8 &quot;snacks&quot;, which is anything from a burrito or chili dog to a giant cookie or ice cream. And you are strongly encouraged to use all your credits each day, every cast member reminds you how many snacks you have left, because all of your info is itemized on every reciept. And it includes all-you-can-drink soda refills (Coca Cola). But only soda! If you want a bottled water, that&#39;ll be $3.00, please. Oh, and all they have  for water is Nestle.  </p>

<p>People in my party adopted the most gluttonous, wasteful attitude with this meal plan. &quot;Oh, just get 4 more snacks tonight. They&#39;re paid for; if you don&#39;t eat it, just throw it away.&quot; I got in an argument with a relative, because for lunch one day, I only wanted a salad and a Vitamin Water. Well, a salad is considered a snack, not a meal,  I was <em>supposed</em> to get a giant burger and fries or a small pizza. And I had to pay $3.50 for the Vitamin Water because it&#39;s not on the plan.  I felt like I was the only one in the entire place not letting WDW control what I chose to consume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay- so I worked at WDW for a year in quick service food, I just left the company last July, bottled Dasani water and bottled smart water can in fact count as your drink for your meal plan property wide. Also- almost every quick service place has a full sized salad that can count as your meal. Not sure what you experienced, but this is absolutely not how it works at the parks. &amp; the ‘all you can drink’ soda cups..... can only be refilled at your resort.... not throughout the parks. Side note: if you ask any quick service location throughout the property for a  free water cup, they legally have to give it to you. BUT YOU CAN GET BOTTLED WATER ON YOUR MEAL PLAN FOR THE DRINK FOR YOUR MEAL OR IT COUNTS AS A SNACK. {Rant Over} </p>

I dont know if it was added to the bill or what, it just showed up one morning and she said she thought I&#39;d appreciate it, instead of buying individuals.  I absolutely did appreciate it, but none of the vendors we went to allowed bottled water on our wristband. I was told &quot;You can get a fountain drink.&quot; Iced coffee was actually considered a snack, so I used quite a few of mine on that.</p>

If you booked during free dining promo absolutely take it, or if someone else paid for your trip they might have included it. But when you book a travel package they ask you what type of meal plan you want or you can decline. Husband and I decline every time because we bring our own breakfasts and snacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disney are money hungry assholes but I work at a theatre and am an assistant manager. They are getting better. They deserve the biggest theatres because they bring in the biggest crowds BUT the ticket thing is true. They wouldn’t allow employees free tickets or guests the use of guest passes at my place for the first 17 days and no rain checks either. But we have recently lowered them down. At our theatres, we can now see Disney movies the first Monday of its release so after first weekend but it can still be only weekdays. And they changed the guest pass/rain check for customers to first two weekends and then after that, it’s free game. Still a little ridiculous but much progress for employees. Especially someone like me who if I have the time and money, I’d pay for ticket but if I don’t have time or money, instantly all my most hyped movies, spoilers galore </p>

“The OP (who&#39;s username I won&#39;t give away) hasn&#39;t posted since.” Added a little creepiness, which was a nice effect. </p>

<p>With that said, none of it surprises me. Especially the part about it being removed. Disney is a fearsome corporate beast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate Disney for many reasons... but most of that post is just sour grapes... sorry.</p>

<p>aww diddums.... your employer does not give you free stuff, or discounts to those you deem should get discounts. Get over it. sure it&#39;s nice, but it is far from proof of being a horrible organisation. What is FAR more alarming is the OP likely deleted the post cause simply having an opinion puts their job at risk.... and that most certainly IS horrific</p>

<p>I am also sorry to say.. the practices described are standard for any large company.... if you want access to &quot;X&quot;, then we require you to do &quot;Y&quot;... it&#39;s a simple and expected contractual agreement, they should not be condemned for doing that!!!</p>

<p>sadly.... the OP only touches on the issues of them being a mega-monoploy who can threaten cinemas etc... and my previous paragraph goes from &#39;standard practice&#39; to unconscionable conduct when they are allowed to have excessive market power as they do...   The whole concept becomes a joke, when there is no competing and equivilant competitor for the cinema to move to... instead of the &#39;consumer&#39; (cinema) having a power of choice... the power has entirely shifted to Disney where they are in a position to dictate terms to the customer, rather than having them negotiated</p>

<p>a total failure of government to prevent monoplies forming which ALWAYS result in reduced value and competition to consumers.
and now.. in pullin gal their content from streaming services, they believe they have enough power and content for their own channel.  It won&#39;t be long and the actual cinemas will be &#39;disney cinema&#39;s&#39; with disney food and disney parking deducted automatically from your disney credit card, which will turn into a labour debt if you are ever in any position that makes you unable to pay... and that job will likely involve being paid 1/2 minimum wage to walk around in a character costume to pay off a debt greater than they pay you... ie indentured servitude</p>

<p>oh.. and your name will need to be changed to either have &#39;Walt&#39; or &#39;Disney&#39; hyphenated... as a mark that they own your ass</p>

<p>and for those in seriously deep debt to their Disney overlords (or caught downloading)... remember that mouse with an ear grafter to it&#39;s back?  It works the other way too... Mickey Mouse ears on humans.... for those that can never pay their debts, voice modifications and tail additions are also on the cards.... up to the point when you wakeup in the morning and  look in the mirror, you think it&#39;s actually Mickey Mouse staring back at you.  this is the step beyond bankruptcy... it is a Mickification... one step beyond indebted servitude</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty you can enjoy Netflix or YouTube red. As for going to the movies go to support good films the industry is rehashing classics and lacking a sense of authenticity the last time I&#39;ve went to any theater was to see Silent Hill and a few other interesting films. Lately there is a lack of decent films what makes it worker trailers give away the whole plot and ending. There seems to be a lackluster in Hollywood when it comes to a wholesome comedy or even a decent thriller. The dialogue used in action films are just profanity spilled like 12 year olds playing call of duty. A mature film doesn&#39;t always have to say the f word every 10 seconds or shoe breasts to get the attention of the audience I feel like these are plot devices and the structure is played out with the whole shock value films try to emulate. Yet when classics like &quot;one who flew over the cuckoo&#39;s nest&quot; were actually entertaining with deep character development in an actual emulated medical setting without actual dialogue with a range of emotional and human interactions that didn&#39;t feel forced or robotic. The lack of special effects gave it a genuine raw feel without being unprofessional. The storyline is an actual bitter testimony to the anti hero who becomes destructed while trying to save or shoe others they are truly free to be themselves and that they&#39;re aren&#39;t as crazy as they imagined. On a human level it goes to show everyone is a character in their own right with raw emotions that convey a degree of wanting interaction with fellow human beings. The need to be heard and wanting to fit in and be accepted for equal differences and the opening up to others on a human level. It is an organic character development concept. It is as if the directors wanted the genuine motions of the actors to be organic even if scripted but with a sense of quasi freeform direction. I believe in letting actors have a bit of freedom to explore the character and bring unscripted organic motions and notions into the script on the fly. Films nowadays lack the organic character development nature and feel synthetic and almost semi deadpan and robotic compared to classic films. Even black and white films seem somewhat organic despite being scripted and somewhat structured. I guess Quality over Quantity is lacking in today&#39;s films. However I&#39;ve came across films that allowed a quasi freedom for characters like &quot;American Beauty&quot; felt semi organic the experimental intimidate camera angles gave it an edge and the subliminal hints for each character being a prisoner of their ego lead the audience to either digest the film subconsciously or give it a rewatch and notice the fine details. It&#39;s almost like a fine tea that gets better as you go for extra steeps bringing out various flavor notes. Anyways I don&#39;t dislike classic Disney films I&#39;ve grown up watching the classics and so have my relatives. The Disney films of yesteryear were genuine and organic like despite having various archetypes and techniques that would be considered advance for the times the animations were created. The animated camera angles and effects were genius. The hard work that went into drawing and animation and voice acting and script writing is seen in each classic Disney film and of course there was some ethinic lines that seem almost crossed but to come off as offensive they were different times and of course they did have such diversity. There is subtle stereotyping back then but socially acceptable to today&#39;s standards. As they have introduced neurodiverse characters and various nationalities and even hired exotic voice actors and employed exotic ethinic people to show we are evolving with the times and created numerous ethinically diverse TV shows. Because we&#39;re all human. To day Disney is racist or exploiting is far fetched. I believe with the times and changing they are a mega international corporation that has stuck to their roots in providing entertainment to families of all ethinic backgrounds and even to all economic classes. After all the vision Walt Disney had was to create entertaining content for all ages and to create a theme park that is family friendly. I am not saying everything is perfect but sometimes dreams come true for some people and Walt Disney accomplished his dreams. I know there is plenty of rumors regarding the man and his company. But let&#39;s face it being a public figure people are going to make up for fetched things sometimes things are just simply what you see is what you get. It&#39;s like we want to believe some irrational things because it peaks interest. But we&#39;re just human beings I don&#39;t know much about the Disney family and if they&#39;re still around they are keeping Walt&#39;s dream alive and providing jobs for the working class folks. With some sustainablility while taking corporate responsibility like any company should have. Obviously they may have stockholders and investors because running an international.company wouldn&#39;t be easy since you have to pay people to work various jobs employ law offices to protect your content from thieves and of course accountants to manage funds properly and pay taxes that are due to local, state, Federal government. The complexity of business and creating a comfortable work environment isn&#39;t an easy task. Plus the need for good public relations and trying to appeal to the majority isn&#39;t an easy task. Given the fact long time star wars fans were upset with the introductions in the latest film.oened by Disney. I just believe things are good for a change to see something fresh within the fictional universe. I can see people get political in regards to the new films. I just see it evolving with the times. It&#39;s like old action films that depict Germans as Nazis. Maybe back then during world war tines but nowadays most German people aren&#39;t Nazi&#39;s and are just normal people who want to get along with others and the world. There is a past shame in regards to the war but a majority of those people who took part in that war and it&#39;s war crimes are long gone and it leaves a bad taste into the new generations that want to move on from that and move forward. It&#39;s easy to point blame on a new generation of people than it is to realize the new generation is different and isn&#39;t like the previous people evolve and learn from the past mistakes our ancestors have made. Not one group of peoples ancestors were perfect and obviously did something terrible centuries ago. It&#39;s time to embrace a change and move forward diversely in harmony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason &#39;One flew over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&#39; is such a raw and genuine movie is because it was filmed inside an active mental health facility.</p>

<p>From the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The producers decided to shoot the film in the Oregon State Hospital, an actual mental hospital, as this was also the setting of the novel.[9] The hospital’s director, Dean Brooks, was supportive of the filming and eventually ended up playing the character of Dr. John Spivey in the film. Brooks identified a patient for each of the actors to shadow, and some of the cast even slept on the wards at night. He also wanted to incorporate his patients into the crew, to which the producers agreed. Douglas recalls that it wasn&#39;t until later that he found out that many of them were criminally insane</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can refuse and incur Disneys wrath.....and Disney don&#39;t fuck about.  They sued a children&#39;s centre once because it had a painting of Mickey Mouse on the wall.  They were instrumental in setting up the McCarthy organization that ostensibly promoted American Ideals in Cinema thus contributing to one of the bleakest periods in recent USA history.  At their over priced theme parks, they treat their employees like dirt and and work hand in hand with other nefarious company&#39;s (Coca Cola, Nestlé).  All the time trying to convince families that they are full of benign happy magic when in fact they are a ruthless money grabbing outfit that resorts to snide, underhand tactics.</p>

Maybe they shouldn’t make the schedule with a single server working.
