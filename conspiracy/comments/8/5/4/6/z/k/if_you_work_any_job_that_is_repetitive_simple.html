    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying with that. My big thing is the push back from surgeon&#39;s on using the robots to preform surgery. Our cardiac docs ran a trial using them and it took twice as long and had to change out the arms so often that it&#39;s too expensive. I don&#39;t know what other operating rooms charge but ours is 600$ a minute just to be in there. But the apps they are coming out with will replace some people.</p>

<p>Sauce: I am an engineer in the robotics field. The ROI for repetitive assembly work is a very steep curve. Even expensive robotics fuck up doing basic tasks with expensive tooling. This is &#39;another&#39; elon musk bold/stupid claim - we are many lifetimes away from a robot that assembles like a $12.00/hr employee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its the jobs that involve human interaction that will go first in my opinion, just look at how quickly self checkouts and similar devices are being adapted into life. There is more than enough info on the internet of humans interacting for AI to adapt to doing these jobs and when you look at alot of the trolling and hate that humans use toward each other on the internet it is also my opinion that this is probably the scariest thing that could happen. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some jobs that involve human to human interactions that will still need humans,just as there are some repetitive, physical labor jobs that will still need humans. I totally agree though, that in the next 50 years we will see some major advancements that could either be good or bad, but either way the world as we know it to be now will be much different. </p>

<p>The real things we need to be focusing on as a species is going to be how are we going to implement this technology properly and put rules in place to stop it from being misused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a toss up, I see children in this age who have parents who could care less and are failing, but I also see parents who are &quot;woke&quot; that teach their children to think critically. I dont plan to have kids myself, but I would like to have the ability to help the younger generation have some insight that isn&#39;t propagandized. Luckily I&#39;m from a family where I have siblings and neices and nephews that are currently children so I have at least that ability to help them think for the future instead of just the &quot;pay check to pay check&quot; logic, and my mom and older siblings all understand that even if they disagree with my personal stances on events taking place, that I offer a point of view that is at least conducive of helping their children think critically and compassionately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw over the last decade a drive in companies to promote the idea that employees needed to “specialize” in a small microcosm of their industry, rather than be multifaceted. It definitely seemed to be an effort to limit the risk of having invaluable employees. If the specialization becomes small and repetitive enough to form an algorithm I could see something along those lines combined with simple cheap labor. </p>

<p>The answer is to fight that initiative by keeping your skill set broad. This will allow you the Know-how to offer a competitive service with a higher quality product and customer experience when they became a chop/sweat shop.</p>
