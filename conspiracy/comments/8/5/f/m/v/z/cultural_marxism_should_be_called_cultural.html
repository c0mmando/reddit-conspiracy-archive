       The phrase itself is misleading, so it's something the right talks about far more than the left, even though it's affecting everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's take seriously for a moment that it's actually happening, and society is changing in ways that make it unstable, and this is being done intentionally as part of a power grab. When people start labeling it as "cultural marxism" people on the left regard that as an silly overly-emotional McCarthy-era strawman argument. Which it is, in a way. Because the ideology that is being used to dissolve culture
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       changed, but the effect is still the same. Albeit marx intended this to happen in a good way, but it more often happens in a bad way, and those who want to grab power have made a clear note of this and use that accordingly. As it has been said, Marx was a great diagnostician to label the problem, but his ideas about how to fix it do not pan out in reality for various reasons, as all the various experiments of history have shown. It typically ends up being a consolidation tactic, so the government can be truly authoritarian as it wishes. And that's not to say that capitalism is immune from authoritarianism either, far from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if this idea is instead reframed (more accurately) as "cultural takeover" or "cultural dissolution" or something like this, then we might be able to generate a discussion on this issue that both sides can relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The origin of this cultural destruction relates to the same forces that helped destabilize society in Russia before and after the time of the 1917 Russian revolution. It got rid of the Tsars (who were legitimately bad rulers) and instead replaced them with Lenin, who used the ideology of Marxism/Communism (or at least his version of it, Leninism) to guide his rise to power in the hands of the public after the Tsars fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       When any old order falls, and the new one arrives, those grappling for power will always sell us a bill of goods that looks great, but they never deliver. It's almost always a power grab. This is why some people hate "populism" despite it being basically the intended outcome of true democracy. Because it's often just a label that is used to deceive people. 3 million people unnecessarily died under Lenin, and 10 million under Stalin, who came right after and had one of the most authoritarian governments in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lenin, and the rise of communism in Russia in the culture, was heavily backed by JP Morgan and the Rothschilds. This is a matter of public record, JP Morgan transferred $25 million to fund Lenin during his rise. Talk about foreign countries interfering in elections! "The people" didn't own the means of production, as in true socialism, instead the government owned it and vehemently shouted that it is "of the people, by the people, and for the people" but instead grabbed power and killed millions in the resulting starvation conditions created by the communist government that lasted for decades, and was very difficult to un-do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cultural invasion and dissolution is real. The label "cultural marxism" is a red herring designed to appeal to right-wingers and make left-wingers' brains shut down and refuse to entertain the argument, thus guaranteeing the topic itself is a "right wing" topic that can be split in a divide and conquer across the two parties. I think it is intentionally pushed in this manner, by ensuring "cultural marxism" is the only label under which this conversation can be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       This prevents the public from unifying to stop the cultural takeover that is taking place. Instead, the larger the right-wing group that realizes this grows, the larger the left-wing opposition to this idea arises as well, thus keeping the first group in check. If you had to control 300 million people in regard to one idea, this is how you'd do it. Polarize the idea so heavily through the language used to label it, that only one side will actually see the intent of what is being said. And the other side is emotionally spring-loaded to reject that idea just because of the label and its associations, even though it's accurate in some ways but not in others. So the two sides will fight each other, even though both sides are being screwed. Because they're not actually arguing with each other, they're generally arguing against what they
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       the other person believes, based on loaded phrases like "cultural marxism" which immediately paints me like some idiot hand-wringing 1950s conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's important to avoid triggering labels like "cultural marxism" and instead use phrases that convey the same meaning (or are perhaps even more accurate) like "cultural takeover". This helps both sides see ideas clearly and not get clouded by pre-programmed emotional trigger responses, which will help us unify and thus actually have a chance to fix the problem.

       Yeah the Bolsheviks are the Rothschilds' media-created cultural group that gave rise to Leninism. It's all tied together at the root, in a lot of ways. Big money trying to control big government.

        Bolshevism and Jewry are two words for the same thing. Just as the Jews are the string-pullers of Bolshevism uprisings, the leaders of Bolshevist criminality, so, too, are they the inventors of Marxism and Bolshevism, which flow from their character. He who wants to write the history of Marxism must write the history of Jewry in the world, since he will conclude that Marxism and Bolshevism are not only phenomena of our age, but rather the expression of Jewish rule over foreign peoples and states since time immemorial.

       Definitely do not agree with that. Half of jews reject modern day Zionism, so lumping all jews together with these doing cultural transformations for profit is doing a disservice to jews and it's also just plain inaccurate. It's a few individual hyper-wealthy families that are doing most of this.

       So because things change, it must obviously be the work of communists who have been hitherto marginalized and largely powerless?  You can see where a lot of what's happening is coming from, and it is largely coming from monied interests who are, if anything, aligned with capitalism or the aristocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you even have a coherent definition of "cultural Marxism"?  Conservitards can't even muster that, they just apply the Marxism bugaboo to whatever they don't like because it sways the ignorant.  As mentioned, the Nazis used basically the same concept, and the Nazis cribbed it from rumors spread by 19th century conservatives to discredit the liberals.  The principle is always the same and is older than dirt.

       This is exactly my point. A long time contributor put together a well thought theory for discussion purposes. Obviously wrongthink, accusations of anti-Semitic behavior followed, along with a wave of up and down votes.

       An effort to paint a user as anti-Semitic is an attempt to shut down discussion and that is a violation of Rule 10.

       They made the new label 'globalism' themselves. This isn't some Stormfront creation or anything like that. They're normalizing it themselves, same as they did every time before that. They say that globalism is here to say, they are the globalists and so on. Rising Marxism is just the social policy of these people.

       I'm a communist and "globalism" has little to do with communism in the context people mean it. While the goal of communism is global stateless, classless, moneyless socialism... that is not at all what "they" (whoever your token bad guy is) want.
      </p>

       Doesn't help that America has spearheaded a century-long war against socialism and communism and the social zeitgeist portrays an almost mythological interpretation.

       Don't you realize that the only reason that communist regimes fell was that the west existed and showed a better way? West is by no means perfect, usury-based economy is wrong, but at least people aren't starving. I would know. My country HAD communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ideal utopian vision of communism can't even exist. It interferes with human behavior which is present in all of us. Greed, self preservation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to admit that there are quite big overlapping goals between what communists tried to achieved and what globalists are trying to achieve now. Some of that stuff is too obvious.

       I agree. I would say that the left has a unconstrained view of society vs the right who has a constrained view. The unconstrained view tends to believe there is a solution to every issue and they know the solution. This tends to lead towards centralization of power and basically everything you described. These labels have been ingrained into us to have a natural disbelief to discredit them. I totally agree with you, but what I see as the biggest issue here is that the left wing generally does not put out a solid position on issues. For example, there are many people that want to repeal the 2nd amendment yet they only call for common sense gun control. Their positions are masked in rhetoric. There is also no accountability, for example Obama and the stimulus was credited with stoping the recession yet that infers that markets are not self correcting. I'm sorry if I was jumping around there but I see this as a major issue in our society that has corrupted peoples mindset. Hopefully our society can survive.

       When you say "the left" are you referring to liberal Americans, or the Democratic establishment? Because the two seem to be becoming more and more separate as the Democrats become neoliberals, which are just corporatists similar to neoconservatives, but they wear a gay-friendly sweater-vest.
      </p>

       But yes it seems like there's a lot of hand-wringing but few actual plans. Probably partly due to how effed up our political process is, and how hard it is to get anything to pass anymore, unless it's some pro-corporate or pro-military industrial complex drivel, then suddenly everyone in congress is bipartisan and finds common ground. It's disgusting, our government is thoroughly hijacked by big money.

       And the big money is completely hijacked by government.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say the "left" I was speaking about the general unconstrained mindset of liberals and Democrats. Yet liberals seem to be splitting from the typical Democrats. I would say that the Democratic party is essentially liberals now tho, if it wasn't for Hillarys corruption Bernie would have been the representative.

       The political process is extremely frustrating especially when any policy or law is passed it is extremely difficult to go back. I just don't understand why we continue failing policies with more of the failing policies. I was watching Milton Friedman debate back in the 80's and 90's and it was the exact same inequality and affirmative action being pushed and we have come nowhere since then.

       Because corporations have hijacked the government. The policies aren't failing for them, it's making them billions! We're stuck in a treadmill from the 90s, while they pull the money from our pockets and pretend like they don't know what's going on.

       For example, Frannie Mac and Freddie May was a GSE (government sponsored enterprise) which led to the support and bailout of this company. With the known GSE label there was inherently riskier business ventures. I guess I wasn't arguing that big business is taken over by the government but there are policies that force these companies to make decisions, like the lending of loans to riskier individuals. Having power to interfere in market decisions leads to corruption or decisions benefiting one while hurting others.

       You just have an absence of results, and a surplus of rhetoric. You can "warn" all you want against it, and the purity of pretend-land you speak of will get your your followers, so it'll work. But it's only just anti-tribalistic tribalism you're actually talking about.

       I don't know. I think marxism is still to blame, just because it seems to be Marxist-Leninism style revolutionary tactics being used. Read about the Russian revolution and you will see the parallels of today's cultural takeover.

       It's just an outdated term. Very few people call themselves "marxists" in 2018, and the ideas being used pertain more to the tactics during the russian revolution than the writings and ideology of marx himself. (or maybe I'm wrong, I haven't read everything he's written)

       I understand your position and was in agreement until I thought about it further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think the finger should be pointed in the most direct direction for those seeking answers by using the correct terms. The whole idea that society can misuse a term so badly that it becomes a trigger is not good. The term is a description of the concept that created Leninism and the millions of deaths. By self censoring the term we are also self censoring the concept it represents and thus the knowledge of the foundation that created the most authoritarian government is modern history. Stalin's government. And once this concept is lost we will just be doomed to repeat history all over again.

       Oh I totally agree. But resolving that is several orders of magnitude more difficult than renaming a term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trigger words are just a trait of the human brain. The problem is some agencies have realized this and now abuse that to high hell through the media as a means to control people.
      </p>
      <p>
       By changing the term, we control the conversation and de-program ourselves from the terminology used to control us.

       I do agree with you. I just don't like that terms need to be renamed out of fear it will obscure the pursuit of understanding. But just as terms like "Fascism".... have been misused until they no longer convey their original/true concept, it is no surprise that the term "marxist" will befall the same fate.

       The term marxist befell that fate 40 years ago toward the end of McCarthyism, that's why I'm so adamant about changing it!

       Cultural Marxism doesn't mean literal Marxism, it means behaving like a Marxist on the surface-level but for culture.

       Marxism = "Take over the means of production".

       Better not let people stand up for themselves too much, otherwise they might get crazy ideas about changing society, right?

       Seems to me you're onto the same backwards, hateful nationalism that the United States fought against a few major wars ago. Same as the Trump crowd. Being exploited and fooled and loving it.

       They are triggered because many people here are sympathetic to left-wing authoritarianism and socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think being opposed to big-oil, the Jews, and other boogeyman make them the rebels. When in fact they are supportive of the true players of the 21st century and their goals. The tech companies are far more powerful. They are increasingly in control of global free speech, communication, the news, commerce, and thought. They are almost unanimously in favor of globalism and supportive of authoritarian government tactics. The heads of this industry are smarter than anyone else and some of them likely have god complexes.

       There's so many. I would even go so far as to say
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       revolutions are now subject to having their momentum captured by these billionaires. This is a well-known game, and many billionaires play it. So you might have one billionaire trying to destabilize a country, while another one tries to stabilize it. This sort of back-and-forth happens a lot and it's played out through the news media and in the minds of the public, who then decide how they want the post-revolution government to be organized.

       Thank you. I appreciate the thoughts. It really feels bad to see that 65% when I tried so hard to present a reasonable opinion, not to mention the comments.

       If there is a goal to drive out any reasonable discussion and drive away reasonable people, these people are doing a bang-up job of it.

       For example, Frannie Mac and Freddie May was a GSE (government sponsored enterprise) which led to the support and bailout of this company. With the known GSE label there was inherently riskier business ventures. I guess I wasn't arguing that big business is taken over by the government but there are policies that force these companies to make decisions, like the lending of loans to riskier individuals. Having power to interfere in market decisions leads to corruption or decisions benefiting one while hurting others.
