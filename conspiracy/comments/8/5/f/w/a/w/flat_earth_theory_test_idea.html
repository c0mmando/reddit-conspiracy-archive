       As we all know, from time to time (seems to come in waves) flat earth theories pop up here every so often. There have been multiple attempts, using math and various other equations to both prove, or disprove the theory, all with rather...well mixed results.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I've thought about this particular theory, the more I think that there would be a somewhat easy (if costly) way to really settle the argument once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the test I propose, please tell me what your thoughts on the subject are.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you acquire (likely rent) a pair of identical airliners which have enough range to cross the Atlantic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you would need an airport with two parallel runways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, you would need a pair of crews and a control group (scientific meaning) of syncronized time pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
       Both planes are given a full load of fuel, and take off at the same time, or at the very least within minutes of each other.  One crew flies a straight path with minimal deviation from London to NY, or vice versa.  The second flight uses the usual curved path that cross atlantic flights use, again with minimal deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the payout, so to speak, for the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the world is round, then the flight taking the second path should take roughly 8 hours to transit the path (give or take 1 hour due to weather or deviations),  while the straight path should take roughly 14 hours (give or take an hour).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if the earth is flat,  then the flight times would be reversed; with the straight path plane arriving first, and the curved one being the later one.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the control group of time keeping, each plane carries syncronized clocks to verify that they did not overly deviate from their flight paths.  IE, the straight path doesn't circle somewhere over the ocean to make the flight take longer.
      </p>
      <p>

       I wouldn't say they prove the earth is flat, but rather that the round earth, or at least the view of earth from space, is hilariously faked for whatever reason.

       Yeah, when you watch the clip of the car floating through "space" you can see at one point that the earth glitches, as if the camera feed is fuzzy for a bit. The problem is that if it were a camera glitch, all objects in the frame would be affected, but no, it's just the earth. Secondly, you can see off in the distance what spacex alleges to be the moon. It's so effing tiny. It looks bigger from earth! There's no way that it's an actual representation. And of course the feed tends to cut out at the times where the deception is at most risk of being exposed.

       There’s no need to counter argue something as baseless and stupid as what you presented. You ignore real science while claiming a flicker of pixels on your screen prove the earth is flat.

       So if I see you claim that people don't present any evidence I'm gonna refer you back to this comment where I presented evidence and you childishly attacked me and then confidently asserted you were more intelligent than me. For someone so defensive of science, you sure are afraid to engage the scientific method. As Chef Ramsey would say, "you're just blowing smoke up your own ass."

       At 1:22 in this video you can see the "moon" pass from left to right, behind the car in the lower portion of the video. There's no way that's an accurate representation of the moon because the angular size of the moon from earth is much larger. This video's representation of the moon does not match our direct observation. Here's the link:

       What’s your background in education that you can for certain say that’s not an accurate representation of the moon? Cuz I bet you don’t have one. And I have no idea what caused the small black line to appear in the video, just as you don’t. To take the fact of the bars existence and stretch it to reach the conclusion the earth is flat is nonsensical. Simply gather data to prove the earth is flat, or yet do some basic measurements and arithmetic to realize we live on a spherically shaped planet

       If linking to a video and pointing out two anomalies counts as "zero evidence" then you're not arguing in good faith and any reasonable critical thinker should be able to see that.

       All you've done is berate my ability to make an argument and then dismiss my evidence without a proper effort to come to an understanding together. So if anyone lacks self awareness it is you. You keep claiming I'm making claims with no evidence. The claim being made is that the fucking car is floating in space around a ball earth. That's the claim that requires extraordinary evidence. Me saying "the video evidence of star man doesn't support the theory that it was launched into space" is telling you that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I'm not the original one making a claim. It's Spacex and they didn't provide the extraordinary evidence that even you mentioned is required. So the fact that you don't see that and you're just berating me means that you're either a troll who is doing it for laughs or just a stupid, confident asshole.

       I didn't jump to a flat earth conclusion based upon one video. The mountain of evidence suggests that NASA (and now Spacex) portrayal of space is deceptive. That's undeniable. After that conclusion, then you can make up theories for why they are lying.

       When you change latitude (which flying from Brazil to Paris entails) you experience the Coriolis effect because your initial eastward velocity near the equator is very large due to the Earth's rotation, but as you travel north the eastward velocity of the Earth beneath you gets smaller and smaller, effectively meaning that you will overshoot eastward of your destination.

Add to it the "fact" that our moon is 1/3 the size of its home planet, a ratio far bigger than any other moon to home planet in our solar system. The chances we observe both phenomena in a universe described by modern Science as chaotic, random, and without direction is so small as to be absurd that they think we should accept it all as coincidence.

       Ya, so what? Tidal locking is pretty common, at least in this solar system. Mercury is locked in a 3:2, all of the Galilean Moons are locked, Titan's locked, Titania and Miranda are locked, Triton's locked and Pluto is locked together with Charon. 100% I'm missing others, but the point is that it doesn't seem to be a rarity. Big Moons tend to get locked it seems.

       You're right about one thing: my argument is that it's improbable. If our solar system was created according to leading scientific theories, and if our moon was created according to the modern theory that a larger object hit the earth, then it's absolutely improbable to say all of that produced a moon that is both tidally locked AND larger than any other planet-moon system AND that it happens to be exactly 400 times smaller and closer than the sun. The probability of all these being true about our system is insanely low. Like almost 0.

      <p>
       Improbable, yes. Impossible? No. Again, this is an appeal to improbability. What you're basically saying is that because something is highly improbable, it is impossible. Regardless, saying "these things were unlikely to happen" is meaningless. It doesn't change the fact that they DID happen and things are the way they are. The moon IS tidally locked. It IS a certain size. We ARE a certain distance from the Sun.

       I'm saying that the modern day scientific theories that attempt to explain observable phenomenon are highly unlikely to be the correct explanation and you're saying they are correct because of what we observe? I'm not doubting that the moon appears to be the same size as the sun and I'm not doubting that the same face is constantly facing the earth. I'm doubting that all of these things could happen in conjunction with each other, given the premises of earth orbiting the sun and how our moon was formed.

       Science said "the earth is rotating about its own axis at 1,000 mph and is rotating about the sun at 6,660 million miles per hour....something hit the earth and now its moon is 1/3 the size of earth, is tidally locked, AND has the same apparent angular size as the sun, despite 90 million miles of distance between them"

       So you have no explanation other than "I think it's unlikely". Got it. Half of those things are easily measurable by average people anyway. Go out and verify for yourself if you want. Other than the formation of the moon thing, it's all pretty easy to do in the modern age.

       College kids have tied a gopro to a space balloon and you can see the balloon enter space and that the Earth is clearly round. Alsooooo the Greeks proved Earth is round thousands and thousands of years ago using math without any modern technology. It is amazing people believe earth is flat, and the actual "conspiracy" behind it about Satan and what not is hilariously retarded.

       The lenses without fisheye are part of a conspiracy to make you think earth is flat. You see the lizard ppl know that humans are aware of a round earth, and to undo this knowledge and keep us slaves they are pushing the flat earth narrative to suppress certain genes in our bodies that give us god-like powers.

       So you are admitting some bridges prove a flat Earth. What was the point in using one to try and prove curvature then? The fact that any bridge disproves curvature means that curvature does not exist.

       The fact that GoPro's create a false curvature means they cannot be used as proof the Earth is round.

       "That has a lot to do with the GoPro's wide-angle lens: The wide lens, while amazing for capturing different perspectives, can also be a crutch of the GoPro. The GoPro has a wide lens, and only a wide lens. This creates barrel distortion, better known as a fisheye effect."

       Nope, as there are many reasons a bridge could show curvature other than the shape of the Earth such as ocean depth as well as the swaying from high winds.

        Nope, as there are many reasons a bridge could show curvature other than the shape of the Earth such as ocean depth as well as the swaying from high winds.

       Whats your example of non curvature where there should be curvature?

        Thanks for conceding that your original comment trying to discredit mine does not hold up and that you needed to attempt to prove your horribly misinformed comment by adding bridges, NASA photos, and the Sun. Next time, stay on topic bud!

       So you have no response for the curvature in the images or for a reason why the sun only works in a helioecntric model?

       My comment was about GoPro which uses fisheye and how it creates artificial curvature therefore it should not be used as proof. You claimed I was lying. I provided evidence I was not. There are countless vids/images with non fisheye lenses showing zero curvature. GoPro should be automatically disqualified as evidence of curvature as it creates an artificial one. How about you understand the context of a conversation before jumping in and calling someone a liar bud.

       My comments with original poster was about GoPros. I dont care about images which are not GoPro as we can show images disproving each other left or right and it won't matter as that was not what my comment was about where you claimed I was lying. I stated GoPro's are not valid evidence. Are you claiming they are?

       We are discussing GoPro's. What are you unable to understand about this? Other lenses don't matter as OP was specifically talking about curvature with GoPro's which I pointed put are artificially distorted. We were not discussing other lenses so those are irrelevant to what my comment was about which you claimed I was lying.

       Holy crap look back at my original comment. It was about GoPros being unreliable proof. I did not say all lenses. I said GoPro. You keep trying to make my comment about something other than what it was. I am not debating all camera lenses and I can and have shown you many wide-angeled lenses showing no curvature but that is beyond the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment was about GoPro, which uses a fisheye lense that distorts and creates artificial curvature. Was I lying about that? If so, prove me wrong as you have yet to do anything but try to steer the conversation down multiple avenues you believe proves a spherical Earth yet that was never what my comment was about to begin with. It's put up or shut up time bud. Either disprove that GoPro's use fisheye lenses which create barrell distortion or move along.

       Those are newer cameras and the non fisheye is not the intended mode. There are also drawbacks to shooting that way as the images are cropped. This is not how the other vids, with obvious fisheye distortion, were shot.

       Well if all the planets in our solar system are round, then what in the world of logic would lead a person to contemplate the thought that the earth is flat.... here is another flipping question. Out of all the planets that have been documented outside of our system. How many of those planets are flat?? Then again far too few people use logic or even know what logic is... I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I have my moments.

       Honestly this was years back when the Niburu stuff first gained traction and the theory being it had crashed into and destoyed another planet which is what the asteroid belt really is. Ok well that incident also took out our Earth and that some higher being(s) has/have put a chunk of it back and domed it over giving us our present spaceship Earth.
I gather the possibility exists for it to be made whole again and that process may be ongoing kinda in limbo on/off.

       Eratosthenes did his math under the assumption that light rays are hitting the earth in a parallel fashion. Why would he make that assumption? Would it affect the conclusion if the sun was 94 miles away instead of 94 million? How would the conclusion be affected?

       Good thing for him they are!
      </p>
      <p>
       His math was further corroborated around 200 years ago once more data from surveyors and cartographers came in. The official measurements today are only a few percent off of Eratosthenes work.

       If the sun was Infact only the size of a quarter and only just past arms length away, I am pretty sure we would have figured that out by now.

       Better idea. 
* Go to the northern hemisphere. Find Polaris. 
* Choose a star on the celestial equator.
* Calculate viewing angle between Polaris and your chosen Star.
* Go to the southern hemisphere. 
* Find your chosen Star and Sigma Octantis. 
* Calculate viewing angle between them.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Realize that Polaris and Sigma Octantis have an angular difference of 180 degrees.
       </li>
       <li>
        Try to place that on this thing.

       Look for an empirical peer-reviewed study of earth curvature... realize there isn't one... earth if flat. If the earth was round there would be much. Enter evidence than these weak ass proof like Eratosthenes experiment based on axioms the earth is round in the first place.

       It lays out a very clear guide as to how to prove the Sun is not a close object and why debunking Eratosthenes experiment would only work from one location and one measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly a really simple thought experiemtn would be to ask yourself why the sun moves 15 degrees an hour every hour from any point on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that to happen the world would have to be a globe, there is no explanation as to how the sun does this in any system besides a heliocentric one.

       Please provide the link the the experiment actually being completed, as you said it's easy to do. Might as well just link an empirical peer reviewed study of earth curvature while your at it and just end this right?

       Eratosthenes did his math under the assumption that light rays are hitting the earth in a parallel fashion. Why would he make that assumption? Would it affect the conclusion if the sun was 94 miles away instead of 94 million? How would the conclusion be affected?

       Like the "fact" that the moon appears to be the same size as the sun because it is 400 times smaller, yet 400 times closer. Add to it the "fact" that our moon is 1/3 the size of its home planet, a ratio far bigger than any other moon to home planet in our solar system. The chances we observe both phenomena in a universe described by modern Science as chaotic, random, and without direction is so small as to be absurd that they think we should accept it all as coincidence.

       At 1:22 in this video you can see the "moon" pass from left to right, behind the car in the lower portion of the video. There's no way that's an accurate representation of the moon because the angular size of the moon from earth is much larger. This video's representation of the moon does not match our direct observation. Here's the link:
