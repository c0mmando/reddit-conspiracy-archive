       What do you think of this edit to the Wikipedia entry on Novichok?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/725314842">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/725314842
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Language to the effect that there was a lack of information on some of the compounds was removed. Also removed was a description of the precursors as being ordinary industrial chemicals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just prior to that edit, a "Richwales" made "a dummy edit to enable suppression of inappropriate material", on 12 June 2016. The next edit two days later is the one above.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last edit before the March 4th incident was in the middle of last month. Someone removed a large section about US military research into treatments of poisoning. Reason given was "patents are not reliable source".
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout the article's history there appear to be attempts to remove the formulation and then others putting it back into the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: This means it is not some spooky Russian secret. Even the US knows how to manufacture it and apparently has for the purpose of testing treatments for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I noticed all of this while looking over the wikipedia entry for novichok, after reading a comment on another thread asking if the nerve agent even exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't provide a source, but I believe that person was working from this article at the Global Research website:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-novichok-nerve-agent-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/5632217">
        https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-novichok-nerve-agent-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/5632217
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I mention that some of the article's content, about there being a lack of information, was also removed. Again, that removal was done June 2016 and appeared to be prompted by a moderator.

       I did think on that too. Drum up how interesting wow this all is.
      </p>
      <p>
       How easy this thing is to manufacture in your own basement, "right", "right"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hide all existence of it. Make it seem unachievable and arcane. Suppress any information about it existing while also letting on just enough so it's easy to learn to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will try it in their basement. Maybe it turns out to be a recipe for explosives and people blow themselves up in a way that leaves a specific residue on the walls and brain matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media latch onto it. "Russia is getting commoners in OUR countries to build THEIR chemical weapons and it's too complex so now people are dying."
      </p>
      <p>
       Good call bringing that up, I wasn't going to explore the angle openly because I thought nobody else will think like that.

       I myself am now a slow old man then. Since I only checked back because a green thing slid out mentioning that the article had been edited in the last fifteen minutes. It was bright green so I clicked it thinking maybe I was going to see something cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw all these edits going on since the 8th, and thinking back to how all articles pertinent to Ukraine have been policed by Ukro-Nazis since Maidan, and decided to see if anything funny might pop up prior to the incident.

       "What If"... US and UK and basically all national intelligencers already know that novichok was never successfully synthesized, and that it more or less doesn't exist, but they are using it now as a place-holder for something else they would prefer not to mention?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see. If a sample is never produced, then one could safely assume that that's because it doesn't exist, and something else was used instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see the benefit in intelligence agencies agreeing to use known-non-existent nerve agent names as swaps or covers to keep certain other agents secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may do this as a show of good faith toward the "enemy" intelligencers. Or they may do it to let others know that they have developed a new weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be possible that the nerve agent did not exist up to a certain point, and that a non-Russian intelligencer finally solved it, and now it has been used to demonstrate its effectiveness and to reveal the success to the world.
