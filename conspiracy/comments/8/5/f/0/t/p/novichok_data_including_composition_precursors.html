        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">56</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/theconceiver.html">theconceiver</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What do you think of this edit to the Wikipedia entry on Novichok?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/725314842">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/725314842</a></p>

<p>Language to the effect that there was a lack of information on some of the compounds was removed. Also removed was a description of the precursors as being ordinary industrial chemicals?</p>

<p>Just prior to that edit, a &quot;Richwales&quot; made &quot;a dummy edit to enable suppression of inappropriate material&quot;, on 12 June 2016. The next edit two days later is the one above.</p>

<p>The last edit before the March 4th incident was in the middle of last month. Someone removed a large section about US military research into treatments of poisoning. Reason given was &quot;patents are not reliable source&quot;.</p>

<p>Throughout the article&#39;s history there appear to be attempts to remove the formulation and then others putting it back into the article.</p>

<p>edit: This means it is not some spooky Russian secret. Even the US knows how to manufacture it and apparently has for the purpose of testing treatments for it.</p>

<p>edit: I noticed all of this while looking over the wikipedia entry for novichok, after reading a comment on another thread asking if the nerve agent even exists.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t provide a source, but I believe that person was working from this article at the Global Research website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-novichok-nerve-agent-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/5632217">https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-novichok-nerve-agent-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/5632217</a></p>

<p>This is why I mention that some of the article&#39;s content, about there being a lack of information, was also removed. Again, that removal was done June 2016 and appeared to be prompted by a moderator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did think on that too. Drum up how interesting wow this all is.</p>

<p>How easy this thing is to manufacture in your own basement, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;right&quot;?</p>

<p>Hide all existence of it. Make it seem unachievable and arcane. Suppress any information about it existing while also letting on just enough so it&#39;s easy to learn to make.</p>

<p>Some people will try it in their basement. Maybe it turns out to be a recipe for explosives and people blow themselves up in a way that leaves a specific residue on the walls and brain matter.</p>

<p>The media latch onto it. &quot;Russia is getting commoners in OUR countries to build THEIR chemical weapons and it&#39;s too complex so now people are dying.&quot;</p>

<p>Good call bringing that up, I wasn&#39;t going to explore the angle openly because I thought nobody else will think like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I myself am now a slow old man then. Since I only checked back because a green thing slid out mentioning that the article had been edited in the last fifteen minutes. It was bright green so I clicked it thinking maybe I was going to see something cool.</p>

<p>I saw all these edits going on since the 8th, and thinking back to how all articles pertinent to Ukraine have been policed by Ukro-Nazis since Maidan, and decided to see if anything funny might pop up prior to the incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What If&quot;... US and UK and basically all national intelligencers already know that novichok was never successfully synthesized, and that it more or less doesn&#39;t exist, but they are using it now as a place-holder for something else they would prefer not to mention?</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see. If a sample is never produced, then one could safely assume that that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t exist, and something else was used instead.</p>

<p>I could see the benefit in intelligence agencies agreeing to use known-non-existent nerve agent names as swaps or covers to keep certain other agents secret.</p>

<p>They may do this as a show of good faith toward the &quot;enemy&quot; intelligencers. Or they may do it to let others know that they have developed a new weapon.</p>

<p>It may be possible that the nerve agent did not exist up to a certain point, and that a non-Russian intelligencer finally solved it, and now it has been used to demonstrate its effectiveness and to reveal the success to the world.</p>
