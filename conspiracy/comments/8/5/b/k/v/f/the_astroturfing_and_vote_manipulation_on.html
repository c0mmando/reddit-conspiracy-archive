       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/855oa5/fox_news_incredible_obamatrump_hypocrisy_in_1/">
        Take this thread from yesterday
       </a>
       ...notice the disturbingly similar patterns between this and other brigaded threads:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The story is a cross-post or similar content to a trending topic on
         <a href="/r/politics">
          /r/politics
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="/r/news">
          /r/news
         </a>
         etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The top comments are complaining about why the content is getting downvoted on
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         , yet the thread has hundreds of upvotes and thousands of views. These top comments, which are generally entirely devoted to complaining about
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         , somehow manage to accrue hundreds of upvotes, despite adding nothing constructive to the conversation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The top commenters almost exclusively post in
         <a href="/r/politics">
          /r/politics
         </a>
         (etc), have youngish accounts, and often minimal history on
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Comments throughout are "marveling" at why certain content is getting upvoted/downvoted, questioning
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         's stability, and accusing T_D of brigading (judging by the votes in that thread, they sure seem to be doing a piss poor job).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Scroll down to the bottom of the thread...there will be a graveyard of at least a dozen comments, generally from regular
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         users, that have been buried. Many won't even have a single comment reply despite receiving dozens of downvotes.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       For example, the following comment is about as generic and "safe" a statement that can possibly be made on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is how all mainstream news media is, and I'm sure that anyone visiting this sub has been well aware of this for a long time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet this is sitting at
       <em>
        over
       </em>
       two dozen downvotes!
      </p>
      <p>
       This one is at -15:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fox has always been terrible, but that doesn't mean we can excuse other outlets like CNN, MSNBC, and ABC from criticism. I personally can't stand to watch any of them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our sub is being flooded with virtue signalling disruptors who constantly claim vote manipulation and decry the very existence of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , yet they are responsible for the most egregious forum sliding and brigading I've ever seen on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the honest
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users: what should we do about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their tired talking points is complaining about vote manipulation (while they received hundreds of upvotes)...perhaps if we hide the vote count for 24 hours (or longer?) so they can't manipulate the discussion that way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts or suggestions would be most welcome.

       Sorting by controversial can be switched off by the users. You can even set your settings to always sort threads by top. That experiment won't do anything unless they also hide the vote scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest mode is set by mods and can't be turned off by the users, which is why you see shills freaking out every time it happens.

       Yes, questioning the narrative and offering a different perspective is "pro Russia" now. AP is most definitely guilty of thought crimes and wrong think.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "stifle the discussion?" Comments like yours are the attempts to stifle discussion by labeling views you don't agree with as "pro Russia." Neo McCarthyist bullshit smear tactics. If you don't like opposing viewpoints, fuck off to r politics were you can OD on countless daily Russian boogeyman circle jerk threads.

       No. You're only allowed the benefit of the doubt when defending Russia or White Supremacists. If you're "offering a different perspective" that happens to not fit that narrative, you're a paid shill.

       I do find it odd that the most upvoted comments in a lot of posts recently have been allegations of Russian downvote squads in the thread. If those accusations are true someone is bad at their jobs. I'm not saying there isn't vote manipulation all over Reddit but it seems off.

       I think the narrative that Conspiracy is Donald 2.0 is wrong. But, I don't think it's manufactured, but there is a possibility it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people feel that way due to past moderation decisions and some of the regulars who defend Trump or attack the Russian conspiracy give people a false perception of that. Because I at least have felt that before, but you have changed my mind and I realize that vast majority are more liberal minded folks.

      </p>
      <p>
       Seems odd that the top comments of this post are calling out T_D for brigading, yet anything critical of T_D is upvoted while comments about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and their spam subs almost go negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odd how T_D and those "russian bots" are voting against their interests in these posts.

       They can remove the upvote/downvote icons on desktops, but you can still press Z to downvote a post even when the icons are removed. There is no way to stop people upvoting/downvoting.

       Yes, but there is a difference between the heavily brigaded threads and the "not-so-brigaded threads".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was actually worried about whether or not r/conspiracy had been "compromised" by the US extreme right. But then I went to some of their subs and found out that they do not normally behave this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with OP that r/conspiracy is being heavily brigaded by mainstream subs and it is very problematic.

       I agree that the media as a whole has consistently been called out in the sub and should continue to be.  Although I personally see was AP is talking about, and think it's the partisan aspect of it ass, which resides on both sides. Astroturfing isn't anything new,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ibr9r/new_subreddit_moderation/c22ia59/">
        it was even an issue years ago
       </a>
       in r/politics when they started moderating it and it's gotten a lot more sophisticated since then.  I think the issue we see here the intent and willingness to ignore the larger conspiracy for the pure intent of making it a partisan issue.  For instance, there was a thread yesterday calling out George Nader, who's an associate of the White House/Trump, as a pedo, which I think is an important topic.  The issue is, the same people who will brigade and argue in a post about Nade, aren't interested in discussing the larger issue with Pedo's in both the left &amp; right wings of our governments.  It's the same issue I see with Trump supporters who don't like to discuss Trumps connections to Jeff Epstein.  In the case that AP brought up, fox has always been a hypocrite, shit they even went to court to clarify that they can lie to the public.  This isn't anything new, but if you try to bring up the fact that most (I can't really think of one), who has intentionally lied or miss lead the public.  The MSM as a whole is just the propaganda arm of TPTB and designed to keep people from discussing the larger topics, by it a US vs Them mentality between the news outlets.  It's the same old divide and conquer technique.  With all that said, I really don't know if hiding votes will help anything, from what I've been watching since becoming a mod, these various groups are running a sophisticated attack and worry that in our attempt to resolve the issue, it only hurts the sub more.  I've been racking my brain trying to figure out a happy medium, and I'm not sure if there is one.

       From an honest r/conspiracy user:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me (us) call a shill a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am tired of seeing the same dumbass users show up like clockwork to threads pertaining to their
       <em>
        assigned topics,
       </em>
       knowing full well they are simply there to post their talking points from their script -- to obfuscate, distract, and discredit.
      </p>
      <p>
       These users have no "pro-conspiracy" posts or comments, it's clear that they don't believe in any conspiracy, and it's obvious they are receiving upvotes from mysterious sources since there's no way that so many real users would upvote comments that are sarcastic, devoid of information, and anti-conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet unlike any other sub I am aware of, here we are not simply allowed to say with confidence what everyone with eyes to see already knows: "shill, everyone."
      </p>
      <p>
       The best we can do is ask them why they are here. Don't get me wrong, this technique can work effectively, but whatever reason anyone can come up with to explain why we get censored and banned for leveling honest shill accusations is inadequate since this is a sub that unlike so many others is
       <em>
        actually under constant shill surveillance and attack.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than bullshitting us by considering shill accusations a personal attack, as though shills need their feelings protected, let us call them what they are. In fact, who gives a shit about personal attacks? I am personally attacked almost every time I make a pro-conspiracy statement here. If people want to use a logical fallacy known as ad hominem they are doing my work for me. But because they don't use a "no-no word" like faggot or shill, they are allowed to use these personal attacks, but I can't simply retort with "you are here on assignment to muddy the waters, shilling on the Internet."
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone calls someone else a shill, don't remove the comment. Compile these accusations. If enough "honest users" accuse someone of being a shill, if they have no pro-conspiracy theory post or comment history, if they show up almost every time a certain topic is brought up, if they have unexplained and disproportionate karma,
       <em>
        the shoe probably fits.
       </em>

       Won't pretty much any argument devolve into an infinite loop of shill accusations? No matter how objective someone thinks they're being, their understanding of who is and isn't a shill is largely informed by their ideology.

       If all parties participate in good faith, sure. I think that's asking too much of an anonymous forum ("Here be dragons"). Unless you believe we can root them out entirely, it's clear we must find a way to cohabitate with trolls and shills.

       But - and this is a big but - I don't see how some these could be applied objectively. One man's 'consensus crack' is another man's shitty argument, for example. Personal attacks, on the other hand, are obvious and I agree that it's a good place to start.

       Uh, not when they don't even see your comment because it has been vote brigaded. If a post hits a random user's front page they might open it out of curiosity. Guess what, they're not going to reliably weigh each comment with their own judgment. They're going to likely notice that someone like Rockran has 20 (artificial) upvotes and fall victim to the bandwagon fallacy.

       Are there other subs that have experienced this kind of manipulation, and if so, have they taken any steps to counter it? To what effect? It would be wise to try to learn from others if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, the manipulated threads are pretty obvious to regular users. If you use RES, up and down vote by quality not content, and have the dagger enabled, these threads stick out like a sore thumb. I find the manipulation itself quite revealing as to where resources are being placed to control narratives. That tell is important information for anyone questioning the propaganda.

       Every single subreddit on Reddit that is anti-establishment to the D's. The main objective is keeping content off /all. It's why you will see a pro-Sanders article get downvoted to 50% in a sub that is pro-Sanders. Where said article originated doesn;t matter.

       What you do you want to ban the commenters in those threads for?
       <code>
        thoughtcrime
       </code>
       ? And If you ask me, many of the downvoted comments are a perfect example of whataboutism, a propaganda technique.

       I've been around this sub for years, and an article highlights the problem with MSM is exactly the kind of content that has always been popular around here. The problem is that MSM is pro-administration. So it got Trump's champions like OP all upset.

       Nowhere has a specific poster who has no history in conspiracy but is broadly upvoted been pointed out, never mind multiple. If you are able to point me to it, that's great, but if you're unwilling or unable to do the work and find one, then don't downvote me when I call you out on it.

       So.... nowhere does OP mention any users who have only posted in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and come to this sub only to "brigade" that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, presumably, you didn't find any, per your own comment that the OP sums up exactly what you found.

       So.... maybe don't claim that's what's happening?

       Interesting to note that you're okay with "doing the work" to try to prove the claim about T_D wrong but don't want to back up your own work to try to prove the initial point you claimed.

       What are you talking about? I just went back five pages worth of comments of that user and they've never posted in Politics but have posted in conspiracy more than once.

       Just because people use their Reddit accounts to post on subs that are related to things other than conspiracies, doesn't mean they're brigading when they regularly post here.

       Less the fact they’re posting on r/politics and more so their complete absence in r/conspiracy- aside from a recent post mocking &amp; debunking conspiracies. “Coincidental”
      </p>
      <p>
       That coupled with the abnormal patterns observed on their comments, and their penchant for speaking in the collective -“I’m sure this sub agrees” - “let me get this straight you want everybody in this sub” 
“Invoke authority” and I dare say a hint of “malignant pseudoidentification”
I haven’t studied the comment history of the cheerleaders at the top of the thread to see if they correlate with Mr SpeaksforTheSubButNeverPostsHereAsideFromToDiscredit... but I’d wager some Bitcoin (a very small amount) that they do.
The fact they felt this post worthy of such heavy handed manipulation is testament to the truth in OPs statement I guess.

       You’ve seized on the one admittedly spurious aspect of my comment and ignored the easily verifiable evidence I’ve provided to corroborate it. Why I wonder ..?
I specifically said they post in r/conspiracy to discredit conspiracies and linked this with
       <a href="http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">
        known traits of those whod manipulate forums like this

With that being said, can you see how such behaviour appears suspicious?

       Our entire conversation was about whether people who posted regularly on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and did not post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       had come over and brigaded the sub. You pointed to a poster that had exactly zero of those qualities - they don't post on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and they do post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , you just don't like what they choose to post about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is called moving the goalposts. There's no point in continuing a conversation with you when clearly you are unable to follow on a conversational string and want to change it to whatever you mean/want it to be at that current moment.

       Trump supporters flock to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       during the election and basically turn it into a subreddit for alt right conspiracy theories about Clinton and the DNC. The vast majority of posts about Trump's misdeeds or Russian interference are downvoted and sent to the controversial queue. Then, if a post that shows Trump in a critical light somehow manages to escape the controversial queue, we get accusations of vote manipulation? What makes it even funnier is that the accusation comes from the

       The voting patterns on your comments are testament to OPs theory. The only time you’ve ever actually written a post here is to discredit conspiracies. You must realise how suspicious you appear? Why not go with a less obvious tactic? Chill with the vote bots, contribute more benign, inoffensive material from time to time.. you’ll be kosher ;)

       A conspiracy is no more or less a conspiracy because it is covered by the media. You can say the media’s coverage is it’s own conspiracy, but that doesn’t invalidate the conspiracy they are discussing.

       Because you’re not allowing (theoretically) it to be discussed here. I’d rather discuss things with the critical thinkers in this sub rather than in politics or news, are you not attempting to gatekeeper that from happening? You don’t have to engage in the thread. If I see a thread in movies about a Disney movie I don’t ask them to take that to the Disney subreddit because it’s a place to discuss movies of all kinds, big and small.

       Hmm kind of crazy how subs become that way. Shame r/politics doesn’t let pro-trump posts get anywhere, or r/td doesn’t allow pro-Clinton posts. Here, if cnn, the CIA, the FBI, our most untrusted politicians, and main stream sources are all pushing a single uniform story (one with unverifiable details and unlimited “just trust mes” or “unnamed officials claim”) that’s probably a story we would be highly skeptical of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s no honest discussion about it here anymore, everyone made up their mind a while ago. It’s a totally political debate at this point, and it just incites non-stop brigading from both sides defending their side in the battleground here. It’s just so stale. You really think the Russians “hacked” the elections? How? They spent a couple million on Facebook ads? Bots won the election? Bottom line is that if CNN and the traditional newsmakers like politicians are pushing a story like Russian collusion so hard, the conspiracy is: why are they doing that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not worth the trouble anymore, and I say that as a non-trump supporter, who thinks he’s a douchey clown face who lies and talks out of his ass without understanding half of the policies he represents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fact that I have to make that fuckin disclaimer every time is another reason why the discussion is no longer wanted.

       You can understand how difficult that is with all the astroturfing/shilling thats currently happening in this sub.  All the critical thinkers are getting drowned out in favor of the politics or news narratives. That's why I'm bringing it up.

       I’m asking you to define what a ‘politics narrative’ is or a ‘news narrative’. I didn’t use those phrases. Is Russian Influence a ‘news narrative’? Seems like you are using the word ‘narrative’ to dismiss conspiracies you don’t believe in, so I’m asking you to define those terms.

       We can discuss conspiracy topics that appear in the news and relate to politics, and I’d rather discuss them here than at those subs. Even if both subs are talking about Russian conspiracies that doesn’t make the topic a ‘political’ or ‘news’ narrative. So I’d rather discuss that topic with the members of this sub. Just because it is discussed there doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be discussed here and it doesn’t make it a ‘political narrative’ either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how I’m benefiting from brigading though. Especially with my controversial opinion that we shouldn’t stifle discussion here.

       r/news and r/politics are subs known to be astroturfed, and were seeing the same thing happening to this sub. Like you, I'm interested in critical discussions that are stifled by shilling

       Well I tried, if you’re going to go back to trolling I’m done here. In case you’re legitimately confused, and I don’t know why I would give you the benefit of the doubt since we’ve done this little song and dance before, I am willing to allow people who are interested in conspiracies here (even if they were brought in by wondering if the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, or Russia conspired to meddle in US politics) to discuss those conspiracies here. I realize by allowing new people from subs like news or politics we will have some less than critical thinkers invading this sub. I have zero problem with that. We all started somewhere and there are plenty of people here who will open their eyes to things like Operation Mockingbird and Gulf of Tonkin. As long as they are not organizing brigades, using multiple accounts, or acting in otherwise bad faith I am fine. Does that mean not everyone here is as much of a critical thinker as you or I, sure, does that make this place the echo chamber politics is, no. That is why I will both welcome new members acting in good faith and also still prefer the critical discussion found here rather than in the other subs.

       Yes, we agree. So what do we do about the politics-like brigades that are jeopardizing this sub and stifling free speech? r/politics used to be a much different place before it was astroturfed to death.

       What’s the point of politics users flooding this sub and having the same convos here that they could be having in r/politics. Probably with the goal of stifling free speech, which you said you were against. So what do we do?

       If the conversation is about conspiracies we don’t do shit other than welcome them.  Having the same conversation we could be having in a different sub is not brigading. Brigading is already against the rules and I don’t know enough about how to monitor that to suggest a solution other than banning those that are caught doing it.  You keep intentionally conflating the two things (people discussing the Russia Conspiracy and malicious users), intentionally trying to group people that come here to discuss Russian Meddling with people that are trying to stifle free speech (another new spin, and I don’t really get this one, downvotes are stifling your free speech? These users certainly aren’t deleting comments. Forum sliding? Again not free speech, but it is a pain I’ll grant you that). You’ve tried to spin it a couple different ways, but it comes down to you don’t want that topic discussed here.

       Yes, shareblue, CTR and other political organizations are great examples because they have public disclosure requirements and have a stated purpose to do exactly what you think doesn't exist.  Dark money and think tank orgs obviously do the same thing but don't have to disclose in most cases.

      <p>
       Thing is, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There is an entire reputation management industry that does the same damn thing.

      <p>
       If you are being real and want proof, google 'correct the record barrier breakers'.  That is just one example of one of these companies explaining what they do.  Then google the

       I’m not saying it doesn’t exist. Of course it does. I’m asking what your proof is of it happening on THIS sub, or is this a simple matter of “this exists so it’s happening here”?
      </p>

       To expand: I know that fuck over in NK is starving his people, clearly it’s happening. Yet I’ve gained 15lbs in the last year cause fast food is cheap and affordable to me, should I automatically assume that fuck is starving me because it’s happening somewhere? No, id need proof he’s doing it to me. So I’ll ask simply and plainly:
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you show me proof that it’s happening HERE on THIS sub? Or do you simply think that because some of your ideas aren’t as popular as you thought they’d be?

       There is an important distinction. When a conspiracy theory is being pushed by the mainstream media, the natural reaction in conspiracy communities is to try to understand what is their underlying motivation. What we are resisting here is the huge influx of users who want to do nothing other than take the mainstream media at face value rather than doing a deeper analysis of the underlying conspiracy of mainstream propaganda and media manipulation.

       We can have both, we can look at the motives of the media and still believe this administration is astoundingly corrupt and members of the campaign probably reached out to Russian assets for help. The problem I see is the distrust of the MSM, earned no doubt, is being used to defend, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes not, a corrupt administration.

       You say that, but the reality that I see every day is a massively disproportionate fraction of users who care about nothing more than a face value analysis and discussion of mainstream news topics. There is a compelling alternative narrative in which Donald Trump is vindicated as a shocking disruption to the mainstream propaganda control system and is being attacked and even framed by a war mongering Deep State. The very idea is met with nothing but criticism and derision by a large number of users. Only the mainstream narrative is considered a suitable topic for discussion for these people.

       I strongly disagree with your compelling narrative, Trump has no real policy positions of his own and no intellectual curiosity that I’ve seen to learn anything. He has filled his cabinet with bankers and is about to appoint part of the deep state to Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think anything I said was derisive, but I know others don’t always act that way here and that’s unfortunate. While it doesn’t excuse their behavior I can see why some laugh at the idea Trump being on the side of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said aren’t we here to criticize others ideas? If I said Obama was a great president with no major scandals I would expect the criticism that would follow.  Trump is simply subject to the same here. And given his track record I don’t see how he has earned anymore trust, but I’m still waiting on his tax returns. (Ok that might have been derisive)

       It doesn’t invalidate the conspiracy but anybody who has looked into conspiracy topics for a significant period of time has seen the mainstream media ignore and ridicule most subjects that have been submitted here. The perceived lack of enthusiasm for the Trump/Russia conspiracy is most likely the result of extreme scepticism regarding the truthfulness of the MSM. That definitely doesn’t mean it should be ignored because the messengers are suspect, but the fact that the MSM are discussing it means that it’s already reached popular culture already so there’s less incentive to discuss here.

       Less incentive for you maybe, I’m fascinated by how blatant and corrupt this administration has been especially in the meager efforts to cover up any and all interactions with Russia. Even more fascinating is the lack of enthusiasm this community has for it. Not to bring it to the obvious partisan conclusion, but I find it hard to believe that would’ve been the reaction of this sub if it was Obama who stood accused and not Trump. Hell FOX covers Hillary every day and no one is complaining her conspiracies are too mainstream (the may complain about the focus on her since she’s not In Power, but that’s a pretty big distinction).

       I don’t have much incentive to discuss it at all as I’m not from the US. I do wonder why the MSM is so willing to cover this conspiracy but ignore or ridicule others that  appear to have similar evidence that the official story isnt accurate
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d love to believe the media has turned over a new leaf but it seems doubtful. I think people here would’ve wanted to see Obama investigated, I’m also sure they would’ve wanted to see Bush investigated. Conspiracy forums before the last US election always knew that both sides were equally guilty of pushing policies of the money power and were corrupt on both sides. Both sides being equally likely to sell out the public was a commonly accepted and non-controversial viewpoint in years gone by. I don’t think it’s always the case people here are just so against the Democrats, more like the constant Trump bashing from almost all news sources is novel and lends some credibility to the idea of him as the establishment outsider who they want to remove from power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would either Bush or Obama have had almost the entire mainstream media against them though? From an outsiders perspective it seems the only news network to offer Trump some support is Fox.  Trump doesn’t appear to have any support from mainstream newspapers, magazines or online publications either. Most of his support seems to come from bloggers and via grassroots forums.  Bush still had more support than Trump in the media even after being shown as knowingly lied about Weapons of Mass Destruction. Obama was obviously a much better public speaker so I can see why the press took it easier on him, Bush was awful though so the fact that Trump has less support seems odd.

       Trump’s own rhetoric has caused 95% of his problems. While some of the things he’s been bashed for have been taken out of context, even in context he has said some reprehensible things. While Bush was a bumbling mumble mouth war criminal his rhetoric was nothing like Trump. Whether fairly or not that is a big part of what people expect in the US presidency. Not only that Trump has been openly antagonistic against the media from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why the media covers this conspiracy, it’s just like the Ken Starr investigation during the Clinton administration. That was all over the news as well. A special counselor investigation is a news worthy event. Plus the Trump administration literally cannot get its story straight from minute to minute. Other administrations have been much better about not contradicting themselves in their messaging, so this one stands out by virtue of its incompetence on a basic messaging level. Through in Trumps tweets and it’s not surprising there is an unprecedented level of coverage about the flaws of this administration. They make it easy.

       I think one of the reasons for that might be that you can find plenty of Trump hatred in other subs - for example r/politics.

       It might still be conspiracies, but the mainstream media is all over it. Personally I'm mostly interested in stuff that challenges the prevailing narrative.

       I agree, but who's narrative are we talking about?  There's one version being pushed by the White House and sympathetic media, while another is being pushed by different forces in the media and others.  If this isn't a place to question the media and also question the government, then what purpose does it serve?

       FYI, the top comment here is bullshit. This sub has always had posts negative of Trump, negative of the intelligence agencies, and negative of the media. There are a lot of people on this sub who want you to think that it's completely one-sided, and that's absolute horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exhibit A: The comment claiming that anti-Trump content gets buried is at +64 upvotes. How can that be possible if this sub is "The_Donald 2.0" or whatever bullshit version of the claim you see?
      </p>
      <p>
       In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. They usually respond by claiming it's because the thread made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren't even the top post in this sub. Notice you never see anyone claim "this sub is a T_D circlejerk" in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don't exist and continue with the anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few examples of anti-Trump submissions, of which there are many more if anyone decides to take a look:

       Do you just assume your perspective is the majority all of the time? Maybe the issue is that there’s more people that disagree with you than agree with you. Maybe a lot of people think your perspective makes no sense and contradicts the facts and that you’re being disingenuous?

       Here's the thing.. Trump is incredibly unpopular. His approval among the 18-29 demographic is 20-24%...
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the demographic that makes up the majority of reddit users. Is it any surprise that the content of the major subreddits would reflect their dislike of the president?

       I did answer the question. Partisans are people who vote along party lines but won't actually engage in discussion which puts their "side" in a bad light. That describes probably about 75-90% of the interactions I have in this subreddit. It's reasonable for me to say that the vast majority of people on this sub are partisans.

       You didn't answer the question. I never asked you to give your definition of partisan. It's hilarious you would call me a Democrat, I get called the opposite all the time on pretty much every other sub I peruse. The fact that you would give me that label though, implies to me you're the partisan one

       Just for clarification, if this subbis don 2.0, why would I get upvoted for saying Trump is a schemer who's been corrupt for decades... but get downvoted for speaking ill of Clinton?

       This is a perfect example of what the OP is talking about. This comment is a blatant lie, but it gets heavily upvoted anyway because it is "anti-Trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       The pattern is that "anti-Trump" users claim persecution, and claim that anti-Trump posts are buried, while at the same time, before our very eyes, they are scoring higher than "pro-Trump" users. Just look at the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/controversial/">
        controversial section of conspiracy
       </a>
       for yourself.

       Do those controversial (heavily downvoted) posts look like they portray Trump in a negative light?

      <p>
       So, in the top 10 most controversial conspiracy posts right now you have only 2 anti-Trump posts, with only 1 in the top 5. And you have 6 anti-Trump posts in the top 10 - that's more than half BTW.

       Agreed, I find it odd too that fewer people seem to say that both sides are corrupt. Unfortunately it’s not just Trump supporters here now there are clearly newer users here who think that it’s left vs right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of feel that people were combed into thinkkng Trump is antiestablishment, but the almost unanimous criticism of him from the mainstream media does lend credibility to that idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was supposedly a line said by Ghandi that people can only watch someone being beaten for so long before they start to wonder if they really deserve it. I really do think that’s the only thing giving Trump some credibility on conspiracy forums as his policies and picks for positions seems to be a case of meet the new boss same as the old boss.

       An obvious lie, but we'll move on.

      <p>
       So how do you feel about instinctively defending unelected government officials in the FBI and elsewhere? Even when the FBI's own ethics department (OPR) recommended that McCabe should be fired... what did your instinct tell you? It told you to defend this corrupt government official... "because Trump", right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not a rebel, and you're certainly not a rational thinker when you've admitted you will "downvote anything that portrays trump in a positive light" - that's just not rational. That's being stubborn. You're just defending a different kind of establishment here, a kind that is unelected and is only now just starting to be exposed for what it is. And there's more to come.

       So maybe you should take things on a case by case basis then, before letting your "downer" instinct take over any time you see something that's not anti-Trump. That's what a rational person would do, since you brought it up.

       It is at the point where I only enter the sub under the new Tab, and I really have no idea regarding voting, it isn't until later, 45 minutes or so,  in the life of a post that the shit gets to the level where I can smell it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just dropped in on Top and it is not what I expected.  Since I am on New anyway I don't care, but it definitely wouldn't bother me to have  24 hour delay in vote recording.  I read what I want, and really don't care what the vote totals are.  - 15 is ridiculous for that post.

       On a sort of every cloud has a silver lining point it is good to know that this sub is enough of a threat to people that they do this shit.

       I replied and had a conversation with teh person who wrote one of hte comments you use as an example, the -15 one that says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fox has always been terrible, but that doesn't mean we can excuse other outlets like CNN, MSNBC, and ABC from criticism. I personally can't stand to watch any of them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After just two comments where I explain that people are criticising Fox and not excusing CNN etc the person agreed with me. If the person writing the comment realizes they were not correct in their original comment, why is it surprising that the comment's sentiments are unpopular and downvoted? How is that not organic?

       If we're all here to have discussions of things that are serious or intriguing then we can do so in an orderly considerate manner. We can learn and share without fake Internet points, right? Folks that are only in here to disrupt and harass are obvious but if there's no reward in the game - would they bother?

       I've always seen an average online user base of 2-3k at any given time, now it's around double that. It seems to be a combo of politically driven people who think the conspiracy crowd is screwing with social ideology, and pro astroturf services. Though I will say I always thought the consistent  2-3k online was suspicious.

       They don't ban people for being shills. The shills, I can name a few, play by the rules. If the actual community had any say the interpretation of the rules against attacking the sub would be interpreted to include shilling and am overall attitude of "debunking". We must attack the debunkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell a shill some very simple traits.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They never give their opinion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They are always contrarian.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They demand multiple sources but use spurious ones in their effort to debunk.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shills defend authoritarian control structures and corporate monopolies. A real conspiracy theorist does not.

       I do agree that they try and avoid breaking the rules but they can be banned for using vote manipulation. The same group of shills always use vote bots to project their own talking points/ comments and bury anyone who disagrees/calls them out. That is breaking site wide rules not just r/conspiracy rules.

       What he's talking about does NOT go both ways. Fox News's advertising slogan is basically "don't trust the mainstream media". CNN and MSNBC don't do that. Fox tries to position itself as Anti-MSM to confuse people who don't like msm spin. Even though fox is simultaneously "the most watched".

       The conspiracy: Fox News is blindly defending Donald Trump.

      <p>
       A comment along the lines of, "well CNN sucks too!" isn't contributing to the conspiracy.  Neither does, "well, I already knew this" nor "I can't stand MSNBC."  If a commenter has a CNN related conspiracy, he/she should start a thread.  Not brigade a well-cited post on Fox News.

       Video documentation of a MSM outlet's reaction to the same event over two different administrations show vastly different narratives.  Why?  Of course it's a conspiracy.  You may brush it off as "who doesn't know that Fox is biased..." but that's a conspiracy!  Pointing out hypocrisy in the media to paint a narrative or prop up a government is a problem.  Do you not see that?

       So much this. A post or comment calling out MSM for not bashing Obama’s drone strike campaigns? Hundreds of upvotes, no claims of vote manipulation. A post showing the MSM doing a complete 180 in coverage reaction based solely on who the current administration is? Hundreds of upvotes, immediately claimed to be inorganic.

        Impact of mobilizations . Negative mobilizations have a long- term adverse impact on the involved users and communities. We find that negative mobilizations lead to a “colonization” effect, where defenders reduce their participation in the target community while attackers become more active. However, building off our analysis of user-level interactions, our results suggests a possible route for mitigating this adverse outcome: we show that a reduction in the echo-chamber effect—marked by an increased interaction between attackers and defenders—and an increase in defenders’ use of anger words towards attackers, are associated with decreased rates of colonization and increased future participation rates for the defenders. Thus, it appears that increased engagement and a more fierce defense may be a more effective mitigation strategy, compared to ignoring or isolating the attacking users.

       Is this because the brigaded comment got so many upvotes within a short amount of time after posting, compared to an organic comment in which the upvotes came in over a longer amount of time?

      </p>
      <p>
       The mod comment upon locking the thread said it was because the comments section was a shitshow. I don't disagree, but is this some new standard that is being enforced, because I don't think that thread was unique in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it just seems like it encourages people to be assholes in the comment section to any story they dislike and want to go away. You had guys like shillsonacid in there doing the same thing he always does. If he hadn't been previously banned for acting that way it's weird that it was enough to get a thread deleted.

       You gotta edit the link to put np version of the link man. But yeah I made a thread on this very thing. They're trying to take over the subreddit or get it shut down. That's what they're doing in YouTube to Conspiracy and now they're trying to do here. This sub wakes people up. And it's one of the only places to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dot your i's and cross your t's and make sure this subreddit follow reddit site rules and your own rules because that way it can survive this most surely, turbulent year.

       As an old subscriber to alt.conspiracy newsgroups back in the 1990s, the tone here is very different and its definitely not just the liberals (who make up a majority of Reddit in general so its not unusual really) who are the problem.

       I'm very much anti-war. Over the last week, i've been called a Russian shill or bot a bunch of times by people who apparently think anyone not sucking the mainstream narrative works for the Russians.

       You say Pro-Putin. I say pro-truth. The fact that this red scare has devolved down to where if you look at any evidence that questions the official narrative, then you're in support of Putin. Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

       I agree. I feel like reddit as a whole has gone the way of Myspace. It is no longer relevant to what it's original purpose was. In reddit's case a place to have thoughtful discourse online.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new platform is the real solution. Maybe it already exists, maybe it still needs to be created. But reddit is 100% compromised and it isn't going to get better.

       Flip the gauge.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say that up is down and down is up, on this little metaphorical control panel that is Reddit. Users can just push the buttons on the case, but you guys have access to some of the internals, including the gauges that display the ups they say are downs and vice versa. So, flip 'em. If they force you to live in opposite land, turn the gauges upside down so it's normal again. Just sort all threads by controversial; tell people that voting has been skewed to the point that upvotes became downvotes and downvotes became upvotes, so you flipped them around.

       I say anything pertaining to current events that could be used to further an agenda or sway opinions needs to be put into contest mode for at least 24 hours, if not permanent. I mean, the reason for the posts are awareness and discussions, no need to declare “winners and losers”.

       You have no evidence that a problem exists, other than your bias against liberal posters and anti-TD rhetoric.  I'm a follower of r/politics, who wants to discuss the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories, and you are saying I don't belong?  IMO if you want to do something, ban all political discussion, and only allow the classic conspiracy topics (aliens, supernatural, etc).  But you can't pick and choose what visitors to this sub want to discuss just because it doesn't jive with your political beliefs.

       You guys pay way too much attention to the #'s. You're not wrong, but it just doesn't even matter. You are letting the numbers divide those interested in conspiracys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read, debate, discuss and integrate the content. Keep moving forward. Stop putting fake internet points on a pedestal. This site is populated mainly by teenagers and bots. Really tink about that for a second. Your post or threads being upvote or downvoted has no decision on it's validity. It's a just a piss poor metic to determine right/wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly sad how many people filter their responses or vary their opinions in an attempt to pander for upvotes or downvotes. Honestly, it's pathetic. We've all read at least one post here that was absolutely brilliant and compelleing and 'out there' that was mass downvotes  becuase it took a sharp turn at the given narrative.

       There's a huge conspiracy story in the current news, meaning conspiracy subs like this one are going to be more interesting to the average Reddit user.  We've seen this happen whenever we've had a post hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ; a bunch of casual observers rush in and end up reading/voting on a bunch of posts both in the popular thread and in the sub in general.  I'm sure you've seen it yourself where we'll get abnormal voting patterns for a little bit afterwards when that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for those examples you posted, they might be downvoted because people saw them as a deflection and not a worthy contribution instead of being a valid and well thought out addition to the discussion presented in the post.  I'm guessing most of the downvotes weren't for that reason, but probably at least a few were.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there's no perfect solution to that if you consider the growth of the sub to be a problem.  You could set it to private but that just creates an echo chamber.  You could create more rules, but the manner in which rules are enforced around here aren't exactly consistent so that's not going to help much.  You could ban everyone who has ever posted to various subreddits, but that is just penalizing free speech and wrongthink.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub is growing, especially with all the news lately.  With an influx of new users there will always be a change in the culture of a sub, and the harder you try to hold on to what you consider the ideal conspiracy sub the more pushback you'll get.

       <em>

       If the mods took a heavy hand to users that are almost if not always antagonistic. There are many on this sub and they are rather annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving us more options when reporting would be rather useful as well. We have the rules on the sidebar, why these not all options when reporting comments/submissions?
      </p>
      <p>
       To help mitigate obvious brigades why is totesmessenger not allowed on all posts? The only time I see that bot approved is when OP makes a post and TMOR links it. This is not fair in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding comment Karma for 12-24 hours probably would be the best help, it would keep the most egregious users from crying fowl immediately. However, using contest mode on all posts would be the worst thing that could happen. Whenever contest mode is put into effect sockpuppets show up out of the woodwork and slide or derail the discussion.

       Honestly, I have no idea how to do it in a fair and effective manner.  I'm not smart enough to know what would both create a more cordial atmosphere while also holding true to the ideals of free speech that many here hold in very high regard.  Light moderation encourages it, heavy-handed moderation encourages even worse behavior through alts, and no moderation gets the sub banned from Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be on the community to self-police, but this sub isn't a closed system.  There's people from all over moving in and out, changing the sub ever so slightly with their passing, be it with voting behavior or commenting behavior.  This makes it impossible for any kind of consistent or lasting self improvement because the self keeps changing.  It's a result, I think, of internet communications and discussions in general these days.  People are just looking for what amounts to little rushes of pleasure, the dopamine hit, and the comment sections on many other websites really shows it.  Well, Reddit itself shows it and it's obvious when you see how much people actually care about the votes their comments get.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I had a great solution, or even a good one.  The current political climate makes a sub like this a lightning rod for conflicting narratives.  Removing political posts won't work because a lot of really good conspiracies are political.  Submission statements were a good idea to cut down on bot submissions, but I don't know where to go from there.  I wish I had something better to share.

       I agree Hamas is too obvious, I find it unlikely they would have attacked him in that circumstance (plus, as you said, if they
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       wanted to do that, he'd be gone). An inside job makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so frustrating how internal issues like this (purposefully exacerbated by Israel and played to their own advantages) keep the Palestinians from working together to move forward. I don't mean to dismiss the issues within and between Hamas and Fatah, but as an outside it's frustrating.

       I think Israel wants Hamdalla in the presidential position, wouldn't be surprised even if they had him on payroll. The remaining candidates however not so much. I wouldn't be surprised however if Shabak is playing both side on inside Fatah. For example, playing Rajoub against Dahlan and so on...

       Given the downward spiral of reddit and youtube, maybe it's time that we as users unite and establish a new platform? I mean we could easily crowd-fund it so that tech savvy members could establish the framework needed, and a firm set of standard rules for moderating, etc. could be established, with any amendments requiring a vote from members, etc. etc.
      </p>

       I mean I'm not super tech savvy but it seems a basic discussion forum should be easy to implement.

       I don't disagree that eliminating the general political stuff is a good idea…but it won't stop the brigades. It's not just the politics they want us to stop talking about. It's become about anything that disagrees with whatever the MSM takes a position on.

       I recommend changing the default method for discussion sorting to "new" instead of "best" or "top".
       <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">

       <a href="/r/politics">

       That and the constant stickies helps. WOTB is much smaller in size though and gets far fewer astroturfers. The community is also great at upvoting and jumping on trolls.

       I think literally every subreddit is starting to notice the manipulation that's going on, r/gaming and even r/gamingcirclejerk have had posts today pointing out how certain users always seem to dominate r/all, and they were even questioning how a year old profile manages to get 3.5 million karma just on links alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is the front page of the internet, so it makes sense to gain control of every aspect of it, if the votes are manipulated then they don't gain exposure, while certain users post things that fit in with the political narrative and always get onto the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is (and probably has been for a while) compromised and can no longer be trusted as a creditable source of information.

       It's interesting to me that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       was influential enough to burn to the ground... shit's weird these days. Almost all conversations that lead towards politics end up starting with anti-Trump rhetoric, but as soon as I provide a little bit of devil's advocate, everyone backs off really fast. I think people know we are living in a time of 'false truth', where what we say is not really what we believe, but we feel that 'big brother' stare boring down on us. It's just so crazy... it's never been clearer to see who is awake and who is still feeding on the pablum.

       Rule 10 clearly states that posts attacking this sub, users or mods will be removed. You, a mod, have essentially broken that rule by suggesting users who make comments or upvote posts/comments that you disagree with aren't organic.

       I think you guys often conflate "brigading" with users simply seeing a political post they strongly agree or disagree with and simply clicking that up or down arrow. It happens. We're divided. This is what happens.

       What about a 0 tolerance policy on content centered around Trump or Hillary? Or on political info that has no direct reference to a conspiracy? There's a whole sub for political conspiracies, and they can fight it out over there.

       Try the vote hiding thing for a month.  I don't think it will be as successful as SS's were, but its worth trying.

       Are there analytical tools besides what reddit provides that can sift thru data?  Any data that can show forum manipulation is probably going to be very welcome and valuable in the upcoming months.

       The content is so shilled it's bringing the sub down.  More aggressive approach needed.  Particularly with moderation. Aside from that,  if you can prove the source of any of the shilling, Sue them. Not kidding. Msg me and I can tell you where I am with the lawsuit plans for two companies that are actively violating my states antibullying laws with their shilling tactics.

       The comments are unbelievably salty. I got accused of being a nazi like 4 times. It's ridiculous, they don't even want people discussing this idea at all. It's so exhausting to deal with.

       I'm looking for solutions too. On saidit we're going to try and use the pyramid of debate as a basis to judge quality, and get rid of those who argue disingenuously. That's the best method we've come up with, and it seems to be working so far.

       We should compile more data and put teeth to your argument. Let's get analytical with this shit and create some easy-to-share graphics that summarize what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't think it would be that hard to track down suspected shareblue accounts... correlate the suspected sock-puppets across platforms. We have a lot of strings to pull.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've done an excellent job 'reverse engineering' shareblues reddit strategy. We have enough info from David Brock's memo to know what kind of content (they identify themes), the methods used on social media, and the likely sentiment of those posts, and various strategies they use (for instance, baiting + reporting).
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with a methodology similar to what @likingonline is doing... and it should be relatively easy to create a DB of suspected shareblue sock puppet accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take all of the above and create a detailed How-To guide on spotting shareblue sock-puppets.... and then unleash T_D in a crowd-sourced research effort.

       There is an important distinction. When a conspiracy theory is being pushed by the mainstream media, the natural reaction in conspiracy communities is to try to understand what is their underlying motivation. What we are resisting here is the huge influx of users who want to do nothing other than take the mainstream media at face value rather than doing a deeper analysis of the underlying conspiracy of mainstream propaganda and media manipulation.

       It doesn’t invalidate the conspiracy but anybody who has looked into conspiracy topics for a significant period of time has seen the mainstream media ignore and ridicule most subjects that have been submitted here. The perceived lack of enthusiasm for the Trump/Russia conspiracy is most likely the result of extreme scepticism regarding the truthfulness of the MSM. That definitely doesn’t mean it should be ignored because the messengers are suspect, but the fact that the MSM are discussing it means that it’s already reached popular culture already so there’s less incentive to discuss here.
