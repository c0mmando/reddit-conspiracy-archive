    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Russia never invaded Crimea, or Georgia. Just like they never tried to influence every election in the world, and never tried to destabilize every country in Europe. They also never gunned down the MH-17 and used polonium!!!! to murder a fucking journalist. Russia is a poor, innocent scapegoat, created by the american MSM, and there is no reason to fear them or their policies! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being told this by a 4 months old account, oh sweet irony. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just so sick of American people thinking this assassination has anything to do with the so called collusions case. I don&#39;t think collusion happend, however the Russian government has been assasinating journalists, political opponents and spies in the most brutal way imaginable for the last 100 years, so to say that they are being scapegoated for this murder is simply ridiculous. </p>

<p>You have to understand that I am Dutch, and I understand to the fullest why Russia does not get included in the investigation in this case, as I have seen with my own eyes what they did in the MH-17 case. They photoshopped satelite images, they literally send (proven without a doubt) crisis actors to testify that the Ukrainians did it, and have not made a single effort to find out who did it and to prosecute them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Implying that I don&#39;t belong in this sub without giving a single reason or argument I find at least a provocation and also, quite frankly, a bit insulting.

<p>I had already seen this post and it is indeed very well written. However I make a seperation between two questions. Can this attempted asassination be proven without reasonable doubt to be committed by the Kremlin? Highly questionable. Is there any doubt in my mind that this attempt was made by the Kremlin? Hell no. The history of brutal assasinations of opponents of the Kremlin is simply to expansive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with it being provocative. I&#39;ve think I should have paid more attention.</p>

<p>For the other part I&#39;ve seen the UK presenting very dubious evidence - that later turned out to be false - in support of US narratives one time to many.</p>

<p>Russia might be the kings of political assasinations, but the US is the kings of false flag attacks and fabricated reasons to start conflicts.</p>

<p>So where does that leave us? I simply don&#39;t know, but I feel we should tread carefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What OP is observing from inside the US media bubble is much more about the near term Russian support for Syria which has cockblocked a certain regional &#39;strategic ally&#39; of the US &amp; UK and is delaying their ambitions for reshaping the region and geographic expansion. This &#39;ally&#39; happens to have significant influence within the US media, the elected US government, and the unelected government at Langley. Russia is the enemy of our &#39;friend&#39; so now they are being demonized in the propagandist media&#39;s manufactured reality. This psyops campaign has now spanned an entire television &amp; movie programming cycle so the relevant plotlines are making it into primetime &amp; theaters all at once making the manipulation even more obvious. As we have all seen, Reddit and perhaps especially this sub is ground zero in this information war and it is these hidden motivations responsible for much of what makes this place suck more and more as time moves on. Most of the beneficial dialogue is drowned out by the limitless resources of the manipulators. Russia is undoubtedly a bad actor in the events you listed but all of the major governments involved have blood on their hands.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A reminder who started the Cold War, and why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To those whose adult lives and historical experience have been largely dominated by the Soviet-American rivalry, by the division of the world into the opposed military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and by the Cold War, the idea that the fundamental interests of the United States and Russia are necessarily in conflict may appear as self-evident, and the clash of these two powers may seem inevitable. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. The legitimate national interests of American and Russia are not in conflict. Russia supported the American Revolution through the anti-British League of Armed Neutrality, and Tsar Alexander II was Lincoln’s only ally during the US Civil War. America, in turn, was the only power friendly to Russia during the British onslaught of the Crimean War. </p>

<p>&quot;Up until the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 12, 1945, a Soviet-American clash would have been considered by most informed observers as less likely than other outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The coming of the Cold War was experienced by well-informed Americans as a stunning reversal, a breathtaking change of course, as the abrupt jettisoning of the principles which had guided FDR’s wartime planning for the postwar international scene. In the wake of the October 1995 summit of Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at FDR’s home in Hyde Park, New York, and in view of the manifest intent of the two presidents to return to the quality of cooperation that was within reach for Americans and Russians in 1945, it is highly instructive to review how half a century of needless and useless Cold War conflict was foisted onto the world.</p>

<p>The roots of the Cold War lie not in any irrepressible American-Russian antagonism, but far more in British geopolitics and British balance of power machinations. These impulses were expressed in 1945 by the British Establishment and especially by the clique around British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, including most notably Ambassador W. Averell Harriman and his henchmen. As a general rule, very little of that which happened after April 12, 1945 would have happened if Roosevelt had still been alive and in command. Roosevelt’s death in Warm Springs, Georgia was a golden opportunity for the British, and they seized it with both hands.&quot;</p>

<p>I like how it conveniently left out the part where the Bolsheviks had a violent revolution and murdered the Tsar and his family, the Russian nobility was abolished and hundreds of thousands of people were executed. Then the Soviet Union was established.</p>

<p>The Russian Empire helped us out in the American Revolution, Civil War, and WW1 sure, but then THE SOVIETS FUCKIN MURDERED THEM. You can&#39;t just completely leave out the Russian Revolution and pretend they&#39;re the same.</p>

<p>*Convenient time skip</p>

<p>This rather long article (I posted only excerpts, feel free to read it in its entirety) focuses on the reasons for the Cold War, that is post 1940s events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t just completely leave out the Russian Revolution and pretend the Soviets are the same as the Russian Empire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No problem, we can look at it too, if you&#39;re interested. </p>

<p>To understand this kind of long-term (and evil) plan in full, you need to dig much deeper and see how the &quot;Soviets&quot; came about, and know:</p>

<p><a href="https://postflaviana.org/wolfgang-waldner-marx/">Who were Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, really?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is actually a long history that can be touched only briefly: Russia was a threat to the British Empire. With its central location in Eurasia, the British feared that world trade from the Pacific to Europe could soon be settled on routes through Russia, rather than controlled by the British sea routes. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Empire began to mobilize opposing forces in response to the Russian threat to the control of the Bosphorus in Turkey, and the Russian expansion towards Iran, India and Siberia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of these enemies of Russia was David Urquhart, an agent of the British crown. Karl Marx became associated with Urquhart immediately after his arrival in England. British agents in the Caucasus organized the resistance of the Circassians and other peoples of the Caucasus against their subjugation by the Russians, and it was these British agents who brought “Marxism” to the area. Eventually, Stalin rose to power in Tbilisi and Baku by working with the network of British agents and fellow travelers originally constructed by David Urquhart and his successors, who were provided with the works of Marx and Engels, and appeared as Communists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marx and Engels’ theories were no threat to England or capitalism. On the contrary, Liberal ideas could have led to the rise of capitalism in Russia, which would have been a real threat to the Empire. A totalitarian party dictatorship of “Marxists” in the name of the proletariat would hold Russia backwards and isolated from Western Europe. Whereas, England feared nothing more than the prospect of  an alliance of France, or even Germany, with a Russian liberal capitalism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me most about this is the perception that Russia would be the enemy.  It isn&#39;t.  I got to know a lot of Russian citizens from work I was doing years ago and I think they are outstanding people.  They are more conspiracy minded than I am, and as critical as I was of the Bush family and Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI and the American military industrial complext my Russian friends made me look like a government stooge.  They hated these aspects of their government far more than I did, but the couldn&#39;t be as open in Russia about expressing their hatred. </p>

<p>The anti &quot;Russia&quot; narrative you speak of is bullshit and it is getting old.  Most people who watch the Americans are rooting for Philip and Elizabeth, the Russians.  The &quot;bad guys&quot; are the same in Russia as they are in America; arrogant wealthy oligarchs that don&#39;t give a half a fuck for the average person and kill, rape, and plunder at a whim to get what they want.  Russia isn&#39;t using a nerve agent to poison people, just as America isn&#39;t doing its best to do Israel&#39;s bidding in Iran.  Shitty untouchable factions within Russia and America are committing these crimes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are people in this sub who go on and on about the NWO super chill about the thought of Russia, China, and the USA being so chummy? I&#39;m not one for war, but seems like if you have all the superpowers on the same page (with a whole lot of wealth disparity in each country), you have the NWO?</p>
