       People don't need to believe eachother's version of the story - I only get upset when people refuse to discuss and become hostile over disagreement.  Such as people getting "offended" over discussing 9/11.

       When you interfere with people's world view you can get hostile reactions. It's one way of gauging how smart people are. If they lash out, they're dumb.

       This is partially true, but I think there is definitely a spectrum of close-mindedness to open-mindedness where people are less controlled by their own pre-established world views.  I also think there is some truth to the various quotes that say something like "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know", where people who are aware of how much they don't know are less likely to think that their way of thinking is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't necessarily say that smart people are less hostile, because there are clearly very smart people who are also hostile and overly sure of themselves, but I think it's a good barometer on whether you should avoid talking with people.  People who get defensive of their worldview are not going to be open to your alternative worldview.

       I've been in this predicament many times. It has become a don't ask, don't discuss topic. Idk why. I'd like to think all the Americans who died that day would WANT people to find the truth and find out what really happened. Jesse Ventura did a segment on Fox where he finished another book of his and was promoting it.  The book was regarding 911. One of Fox's Co-host stormed out of the segement when Jesse started asking questions regarding it. Why? Why couldn't he ask any questions? Why did the co-host storm out? It's unusual. It's odd. And most of all...suspicious!

       The Hermetica touches on this subject well. In humans, understanding can be quite painful, especially when it requires one to completely unbelieve what they thought was truth. This also requires admitting your own wrongness, which does not go well with somebody who has yet to come to control their ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are literally inflicting pain on somebody when you start trying to make them unbelieve and understand - some people can take it and others can't, but most will put up their natural ego defenses at least to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, philosophers must come to be able to discuss things while absorbing the anger coming from the other party. It is a skill I've yet to master, but it is essential.

       I saw some advice column and a writer asked “I’m dating a great guy, and I just found out he’s a 9/11 truther...should I be worried?”  The advice columnist said “don’t be worried, just run.  Life is hard enough without dating a psycho.”

       "Who, then, is Joker who wants to disclose the truth beneath the Mask, convinced that this disclosure will destroy the social order? He is not a man without mask, but, on the contrary, a man fully identified with his mask, a man who IS his mask."

       ButI never give up, especially when I know I'm right about something.

       Most of us will know the feeling. I've found solace in the glimmers of Truth that can be seen shining through the cracks in the pavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not entirely on the wrong path. We've been making great strides in the West in reducing systemic poverty, facilitating the development of the individual and in fostering potential, though much of this has been subverted, corrupted and even vilified in more recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I take solace in the fact that most people, no matter their race or political ideologies actually want the same things, by and large, if you boil it down to the basics. A stable environment, room to prosper for oneself and one's children, a reasonable degree of enjoyment and pleasure, a challenging task to fulfill in one's life, a reasonable degree of responsibility. You'll be hard pressed to find people who don't want these things, though you'll certainly find plenty who have given up on trying to acquire them because it's being made bloody difficult these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I empathize with the desire to burn it all down like the Joker, I think there's actually much to preserve. The only thing that nees to die, in my estimation, is our attachment to old ideas that do not work. Equity was proven not to work in every nation that tried to enforce it. Fascism was proven not to work in every sensible measure there is. Democracy was promising but quickly corrupted by the discovery and subsequent weaponization of mass psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an easy debate to find out where the problem's lie, of course, because, for instance, it seems that industry is obviously problematic. Though is it really industry that is the problem or is it the reckless implementation of an otherwise good idea? The same can be said about capitalism or social democracies. There isn't a good idea out there that cannot be corrupted, but there are many good ideas nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       How to reduce or eliminate the coruption of well-inentioned ideas, that seems to be the million dollar question...

       Yes, get used to it. If you find inconsistencies in the official narratives, and in good faith attempt to spread the word on your findings, you will be punished. Wear it as a badge of honor and keep moving ahead.

       Totally. I remember in 2013 being yelled at by my manager because I said the US FBI was involved with the '93 WTC bombing. He lierally yelled at me and said I was crazy. He was emphatic and almost crazy as he threw insult after insult at me.

       I gave up on trying to show the truth to people years ago. As Bill Cooper said,  they truly are sheeple. I just sit in the shadows now and watch it all go down. When the shit really hits the fan I'll just be like,  I tried telling you fuckers years ago but nobody wanted to listen.

       To others you are a sheeple as well, it's the people sticking their neck out with courage and expressing themselves that are the wind behind others backs to do the same. What if we all just sat in the shadows patiently playing the game, it would  actually perpetuate the Games existence. How many people credit bill cooper for red pilling them? 1 fucking man red pilled millions,  and you guys try and fail red pilling a couple hard skulls and descend into the shadows, stay there if that's your attitude,  but come into the light otherwise

       I hear you, the ones you care about and who are closest to you are the ones you often think will be most responsive, but in reality they are used to the person you were and people don't like change and if you all the sudden come out scalar 911 nuclear takedown blazing , yup...you will threaten their worldview and they'll take it harshly and reflect anger back at you that should be reserved for the ones who perpetuated the conspiracy. As someone whose near lost a few loved ones in heated debates about the truth of the world,  sometimes you do need to let it be but consider your seed of doubt planted in their mind and it is for them to do with as they will from that point on. Sometimes a seed will bloom and you will have someone fascinated with a topic, they'll come back at few months later and red pill YOU.

       I got pulled over the other night riding a bicycle at 2:00am. It wasn't the first time either. I got out of it by knowing how to placate the police. Was I being fake? Of course I was. I also don't want to be shot over something stupid. Don't tell me about the red pill dude. I will school you. Like I said, I worry about myself and my daughter. Fuck all the "sheeple" that don't want to listen. That's there problem not mine.

       Backing down in the face of police agression in the middle of the night is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the everyday conversations we have with people where everyone tows the line of whatever MSM is saying and we all sit back and shut the fuck up. Why not dig in your heels and speak some truth? I'm not saying to take this tact with everything, we all have careers and families and houses to maintain, but  at least allude to there being another side to the story, I play devils advocate all the time

       YES.   Like Vegas and Parkland both. They are screaming to kill this kid and yet are we sure the kid is really guilty? I am not saying he is innocent but I thing we need some actual real evidence, like the video footage and a sequence of events and explanation of why witness statements don't add up before we start killing kids.  Just saying...  To me taking someones life is a very big deal and requires very big evidence.

       It seems like for the older ones they went through a lot of effort to cover it up, back when some independent media voices still held sway - now they all get paid by bankers so not necessary to coverup - just get employees to gaslight the public.

       The term ‘conspiracy theory’ was hijacked by Bush, his cronies and the MSM as a way of making it seem like we’re a bunch of loons. Since then, whatever evidence we may have to prove our theories and discredit the official narrative doesn’t matter to the majority, as we’ve already been tagged as ‘conspiracy theorists’ or lunatics. Sad times when people can no longer think or look at the facts themselves.

       It's been particularly effective at creating a stereotype that allows anyone questioning anything into question. There's an entire human history of people in powerful positions using that power for interests that do not align with the good of the people they rule over and lying to them. Suddenly, if you think it's possible that is occurring now in some capacity, you're just nuts, when that would seem to be the exception rather than the rule.

       People like structure and safety. Government, by its very nature, is focused upon providing stability. Thus any narrative (even a true one) that creates mistrust in government, that destroys trust in societal frameworks, will be generally dismissed until the evidence is overwhelming. At that time, people will push to have it addressed in the fastest way possible so that they can go back to the status quo. It is the way of the world, no sense in getting frustrated by it.

       It is completely half ass backwards. Like when that DNC man was shot and murdered and he had underlying proof regarding hillary and a scandal. If you bring that up along with the overwhelming facts, your branded as a conspiracy nut. "Botched robbery...end of story" they say. Very unlikely once you look at who he was, the info he had and how it was done and the fact nothing was taken from him. People that believe it was just a random robbery that turned into a murder should be branded the conspiracy nuts. Its more farfetched and unrealistic.

       Julian Assange as much as said so, and Kimdotcom too, wikileaks offered 100k for info on the killer, plus 2 shots to the back and nothing stolen, also a DNC lady (cant remember who) said she was scared of being shot afterwards.

       The FBI, CIA and NSA say in that report that Russia hacked the DNC and engaged in a campaign to elect Trump. It also says Russia used Wikileaks to spread the emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Wikileaks or kimdotcom have evidence of this, why do they not release it? It would be result in a complete shift in the governmental paradigm. Yet they don't release any evidence. Julian doesn't even say it was Seth. He just mentioned him in a conversation about leaks.

       Disregard for a second Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI's integrity is questionable lately and I don't understand the tendency of people on Reddit in general to trust the CIA/NSA nowadays. 5 years ago we all were up in arms over its rampant spying and abuse of the American people's rights. They blatantly lied to our elected officials about their activities multiple times, and the one guy who tried to blow the whistle on them was demonized by them but hailed as a patriot on here. Yet, when those intelligence agencies start throwing out things people wanted to hear - that their preferred candidate lost because of Russian hacking - they are trustworthy now. Does it not seem like agencies so corrupted to the core would present misinformation to you in regards to areas beyond the ones we already know about, like the spying on every citizen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their assessments that Russian state actors gained access to the DNC is dubious at best. First, we know that not only do the CIA have the tools to fake cyberattacks to appear as different actors but they've never even presented that information. Second, no government agency ever analyzed any data from or the systems themselves, as even the FBI has stated they didn't and instead relied on a 3rd party contractor (CrowdStrike).
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask why they wouldn't release it. They have a long reputation of not leaking their sources. If they do start naming sources then it could deter future potential leakers. There's no concrete proof that he was the source but our intelligence agencies have likewise not released proof that Russia or anyone else was the source. We're very much in the dark as far as actual proof being presented to the public either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the report, I don't care to get into as that's beyond this thread and I don't think we should hijack it to be about the issue of overall Russian involvement.

       I don't know. It's possible any evidence would lead to him. It's possible too that he's not the source, objectively speaking. My intention is more to highlight that if you consider the credibility and recent actions of the people claiming that Russia is the source those aren't exactly the most believable sources either. They have the ability to lie about it, they have shown they do lie about things to the American public and the txts that have been released from the FBI show a strong bias towards one side. They've damaged their own credibility and when you do that it becomes harder for people to take you at your word, especially when they're not just white lies but lies covering up harm you're doing to the people you're lying to.

       That's what redaction is for. You've got to remember that Assange sees himself as an Australian being targeted by a foreign government. He's right about that but you can't trust his word without evidence. That's why he established Wikileaks. To share the evidence.

       You're going to invalidate the credibility of the FBI based on the text exchanges between two agents who were dating? That's illogical at best. You can't act like those two individuals are responsible for the direction of the entire agency. That's childish.

       This entire conclusion is sad and immature. You're acting like the entire FBI is at the mercy of the opinions of two agents. People have opinions and can still achieve objective results. We're not all evangelical pharmacists and bakers.

       Because I value the truth and I don't believe any of those agencies have told the truth to the American people in a very long time. In fact, that was the conventional wisdom on this very website since its inception until around the time of the primaries when this Russia bullshit started.
      </p>
      <p>
       I addressed multiple reasons throughout my posts on why they are of dubious credibility, only one of which was the published text messages. To act like my conclusions hinged primarily on the exchange of text messages between two agents not only deliberately misrepresents the contents of my posts but the weight of what was contained in those texts.
      </p>

       The left has absolutely despised all the CIA and NSA for at least a decade now and were never quiet about how evil and dishonest they are. Then, when suddenly they're saying things that the left wants to hear, they're all patriots and boy scouts. It never crosses your mind that maybe the boy who spent his entire life crying wolf is still crying wolf.

       Continue unabated doing things as they've done for years. The situation has drastically changed regarding our treatment of ISIS since Trump took over for one. It's fairly obvious Trump has scared the shit out of all of them for years, including every Mockingbird on tv. This was always written off by the anti-Trump crows as, "Well, obviously! Trump's a retard!" But after seeing his Presidency in a large enough sample it's hard to claim he's incompetent anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of those agencies had been engaging - at the very least - rampant cronyism for a long, long time. Under Hillary everyone knew their place as she was intimately familiar with the system and they with her. They all wanted her to win. It's hard to look back on Obama's Presidency and think that he is above using his intelligence agencies in an unscrupulous manner. He got away with quite a bit because of the cult of personality manufactured around him. Then he campaigns for her which is unprecedented.
      </p>

       I liked Obama at first but I don't put any of these actions past agencies ran by his appointments in order to maintain their grip on the power that took decades to consolidate.

       He is clearly incompetent. Openly lying to Justin Trudeau in public? Not reading security briefings? Tweeting contradictory policy statements? He's a bad diplomat and ignorant of policy. He can't keep his "best people" and is now hiring TV personalities. He's clearly incompetent.

       Against Trump. I firmly believe they would've backed some other Republican or stood mute if it weren't Trump. Remember, there were FISA warrants against Trump for foreign contact with Russian agents during the campaign. Even Steve Bannon thought that was a bad idea.

       This is hard to do on a phone and my wife has a monopoly on the computer right now so I'll just address a few points. You seem like a good dude so I don't want to just ignore the post even though I'm never been particularly interested in debating on the Russia thing. I'll just give you my perspective as a former Obama supporter whose actions were a part of why I left the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is pretty much dead in Syria and we avoided WW3 so far. While other candidates seemed to want to have a dick swinging contest with Russia in Syria he managed the situation without making us look weak or getting involved against Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can not like Trump if you want, it's fine, we can all think how we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I distrust Obama and his agencies for a number of reasons. Hasting's death, disposing of Gadaffi for no good reason and starting the refugee "crisis" which is bullshit because even according to Pew 42% of refugees are 18 to 34 males, weaponizing the IRS, drastically increasing the domestic spying on every American citizen and subsequently lying about it, Comey not indicting Hillary when anyone who has handled secret information knows exactly how fucked up that was. The FBI themselves have been aware of multiple mass shooters and terrorists and failed to stop them, including the Boston Bomber, Omar Mateen, Nicolas Cruz and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's really my entire point. For years the same people taking everything they say at face value because they also hate Trump hated these same agencies and same people for lying to us repeatedly, especially the spying aspect. But you seem to think these same dirty bastards would be above making shit up about the extent of the Russian involvement to cover their own asses. I think people are letting their own dislike of Trump allow these people to pretend to be acting in the people's best interests while really they are just trying to save themselves. They certainly haven't been acting on behalf of the American people in the past so I don't see it likely they are suddenly concerned with that now.

       American intelligence agencies have a long history of lying/getting things wrong. I’m it sure the same can be said if Assange.
      </p>
      <p>
       The report merely said it was their “assessment” that Russia hacked the DNC but they did not release any proof or solid evidence. If the intelligence agencies have proof then why don’t they release it?

       The only evidence that Seth was a leaker is coming from hints from JA and Kimdotcom. If they have the proof they should release it to end the DNC and Hillary once and for all, otherwise they're just using him as a  puppet.

       I think the problem people have is sometimes us conspiracy theorists mix known facts with unknown items. For example, we know he worked for the DNC, was murdered, nothing was taken, and the officials are saying it’s a botched robbery. We don’t know for certain (although in my opinion it seems highly likely) that he had proof regarding Hillary and a scandal. It’s seems highly likely he leaked info to Wikileaks.
There are lots of questions in this case and it is annoying when you ask questions, people starting saying it’s a conspiracy theory. Why kill someone and not take anything when there’s no witnesses to make it urgent to run off? Where is his laptop? Supposedly he was alive when the cops and ambulance were there so why won’t the police release the bodycam videos? And I seem to remember hearing shortly after it happened that a store nearby had video cameras so what happened with that?

       Well, DC is loaded with them. Surly he was seen on footage at some point along with the alleged shooter. Don't even get me started with the Vegas shooting. How many cameras are in that place and not one thing was caught on camera ?

       One of those morning shows like the Today Show did a thing where a guy walked 2 blocks in NYC and was captured on like 170 security cameras...i'm sure DC is pretty similar.   Speaking of which anyone seen those security cams of a plane hitting the Pentagon yet (besides the 3 frame piece of shit with no plane).

       And yet not a single photo of a plane exists, and all security cameras from private business within miles were confiscated and never released.  If a plane hit the Pentagon it would have been captured on over 100 security cameras from the Pentagon and outside.

       Well, because you are. Whenever there is a "mainstream" narrative (within a group) those which provide alternative narratives  are usually called "conspiracy theorists" - it is actually the proper use of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it goes both ways - within certain groups you are a conspiracy theorist if you stand against the narrative of false flag attacks or similar theories. Go to t_d and point out that well there are good indication that Donald Trump is not only unfit for teh office but also corrupt and you will be the

       there's nothing wrong with being a "conspiracy theorist" there is something wrong with the bias that people have of the term, and the fact that people don't even know what the word conspiracy means anymore. and yeah to adress your post otherwise, it does suck, alot. the truth is, it's very easy to brainwash millions and millions of people. if you look at everything right now, or throughout history, it's pretty clear. it's just a fact of life. but there is also hope, people like you and me, people who see through the tv, through the fake glass on the world, we have power. thruth tellers are people of passion, liars are not. they can't bring us down.

       It doesn't matter if you have 'proof' or what other people think of your 'proof'.
      </p>
      <p>
       What matters is that (1) your theory is disprovable, (2) that you know what evidence would disprove it,  and (3) you would accept it as disproven if presented with that evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't have 1, 2 &amp; 3 you would be arguing in bad faith and would be a conspiracy theorest.

       No. You might be interested in skimming through some of the books of Machiavelli. The Prince, The Art of War, Discourses. There are chapters on conspiracy in each which are keystone to the entirety of Machiavelli's work. Everybody who does not have their head up their ass is a conspiracy theorist, although some of them advertise a false front of not being one.

       There are real researchers finding and sharing real data — you won’t find many prevailing examples of that here, mostly speculation with no data beyond reactions to media propganda. Sometimes a real evidence based finding will appear here and actually be voted up, only to be washed away by one hundred unsourced claims on a different topic. For example the Russian spy post will last about a day before it retreats into the void.
