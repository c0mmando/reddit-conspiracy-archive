       I recently submitted a thread on the alleged poisoning by Putin assassins using Polonium. Due to a typo, I deleted the thread and resubmitted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original thread (with Plutonium in the title) had +8 points, 79% upvoted, and submission statement +6
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The resubmitted thread (which only differs in that it is Polonium in the title and was submitted 10 or so minutes later) has 0 points, 47% upvoted, submission statement -10 points. These stats were like this very early in the threads history.
      </p>

      <p>
       In other words, it got brigaded, and we have the proof in the form the of the original thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top post in the brigaded thread is an alleged quote from the victim, which is sourced from BBC (+14 points).
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti Russian comments:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'll take Scotland Yard over some hack who peddles for a pro Putin think tank.
       </p>
       <p>
        Source is an alt-right, neo-nazi propaganda front mostly if not entirely Russian in origin.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can't find any thread on r/topminds linking to the brigaded thread, which suggests it must've been organised by another subreddit, or maybe a propaganda organization (such as JIDF, CIA etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah I can't understand how genuine conspiracy theorists would somehow be cheering on nuclear war because "omg putin is a bad guy just like Saddam, the media told me so".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unbeknownst to many, Russia played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War. First and foremost, Catherine the Great's position as perhaps the foremost sponsor of ongoing mediations between the European powers and America, that transpired during the war years, ultimately served to as a means of legitimizing and rallying support for the American cause, amongst the other European powers.[30] Her political and military positions acted to further isolate the British within greater European politics, and in the final analysis, to help pave the way for the eventual victory of the young republic. "The proclamation of the Declaration of Armed Neutrality by Russia, which received the official approval of the Continental Congress of the United States in October, 1780, had great international significance."[31] If Catherine the Great had not politically maneuvered with other imperial powers and negotiated neutrality with other potentially belligerent states, and if instead she had chosen to support the British position, then perhaps the American Revolution may have been a somewhat different story.

       Appeasement didn't work for Hitler. The more you appease him the more powerful he thinks he is.

       Same thing with Putin. We should have stopped him in Ukraine and Syria. Now he's blatantly taunting the west. We need to make sure he knows he's vastly overstepped and put him back in his place.

       Those promulgating this Russia nonsense have gotten outright dangerous.   The US is being steered into dangerous waters and genuine damage is being caused by the McCarthy-era anti-Russia hysteria.  The constant hyperbolic wolf-crying is making it that much harder for the US public to accurately assess future genuine threats.

       I wrote an instantly down-voted yet factual comment about the surprising connection between Skirpal and Christopher Steele, the compiler of the notorious "dirty dossier" that adds a very unusual twist to things and raises the possibility of some other assailant with a very different motive for possibly wanting to silence Skirpal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that Steele was Skirpal's main contact in Moscow for a number of years after he's been recruited by another MI6 agent named Pablo Miller that the British government insists is only a diplomat, sometime around 1990. Steele on the other hand has admitted to being an MI6 agent even though he was posing as a diplomat at the British Embassy during his time in Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skirpal was still communicating with Steele after he was promoted to the Russian desk in London. All in all according to Skirpal's own confession at his trial in Russia he had been doing that for more than ten years before finally being caught and arrested for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Pablo Miller, the man who recruited Skirpal, isn't just a good friend of Skirpal's even now and who also lives in Salisbury and has often been seen out and about with him, but he's also listed as a consultant for Christopher Steele's investigative services company. So were all three of them involved in compiling that dossier? The closeness and confidential association that all three have had for so many years certainly points in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also one hell of coincidence that ties all three men to two very high profile and maybe not separate events at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all three men are very well known to each other and have worked in a close collaboration that goes back almost 30 years and that still seems to be in place even now.

       I dont believe what either of these says, however I give more credence to anything the FSB says about what is going on in the Middle East and what the U.S. is up to, if its something we dont hear in our own media/news/etc.

       U.S. is already controlled by Globalists, Bankster, Deep State + M.I.C. system. Russia, on the other hand, kicked out Soros and the Rothschilds Banking system:

       Honestly, the lengths you pro-Russia conservatives will go to are kind of scary.  What kind of thinking person suggests the theory that someone framed Russia by poisoning himself with Polonium?  It's asinine.

       The idea that anybody would poison themselves with Polonium is still asinine.  It's assuming the most ridiculously unlikely human behavior one could possibly imagine.  I don't really care why you are invested in such an outrageously stupid theory, but you're getting downvoted because that's asinine,  not because of the "liberals" strawman you supplied.

       Why? It's virtually impossible to transport radioactive material without shielding and not poison oneself (and others on the plane) etc.
