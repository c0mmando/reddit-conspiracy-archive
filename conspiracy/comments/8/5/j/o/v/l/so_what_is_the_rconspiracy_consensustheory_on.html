       One of two things I think happened. Either the Saudi prince who owns the Four Seasons is an ISIS supporter and planned the attack (Paddock just happened to be staying in the room they used, they murdered him) or it was an assassination attempt on that same prince.

       Or an assasination attempt on MBS that was in Vegas that night (VIP extracted by plane) by Bin Talal-Waleed the owner of the Four Seasons where Paddock is a gun runner for the deep state with ties with ISIS

       The only gut feeling that I'm getting from it all is that Paddock is somehow a patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure he's a completely innocent patsy though. Evidence does seem to point to him being involved in something nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that there's too much noise around the event to get a clear picture, for me at least.

       I've also been wondering what everyone thinks.  Since paddock was doing something in Arizona  believe he was probably with a government agency,  either on the books or an informant. Saudia Arabia has to tie into this somehow, right after the shooting shit got crazy in SA and alot of princes were arrested and at least one killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the guy that was killed actually died in Vegas. There's too many holes in the official narrative,  it's very suspicious.

       I believe Paddock was unstable. He apparently had experience in gun dealing and not just small time. His girlfriend took off in a hurry so either she was involved or she wasn't but wanted out. Seemed more out of fear, possibly from LEO and also from her now deceased boyfriend. She knows more than has been revealed and may have even helped carry the guns up to the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it have been a gun deal gone wrong? It's possible but he was there alone for days. Lost a lot of money recently and is likely mentally disturbed. I think enough that he carried it all out as big FU to the world. Totally nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the Saudi connection simply because it would have been way bigger. trump just got back from kissing saudi asshole and selling them billions in weapons. This didn't seem connected to that but if Saudi's were connected, it was a rogue group carrying out a terror act (not that Paddock's wasn't a terroristic act) unsanctioned by the crown. If that was the reason for the SA purge, so be it but you would have to first accept and connect Paddock to the Saudis.

       They definitely don't think it will help prove the official story or we would have gotten at least one image or even video of the shooter inside the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we have got a single image with his eyes closed. And another from before his hair went grey.

       Not true.  They lied to Pompeo and hid things from him.  There are different factions within the CIA and they believe they are above being ruled.

       so you think that the CIA did it while pompeo and others didn't know at all. None of them, not even the president? It's more difficult to believe that than Paddock was just a nutcase and it can't be proven. That's almost taken on faith since no amount of evidence can convince you that they had to know to make your theory believable.

       I am saying that the CIA does a lot without any oversight, so they could have.  That would explain the coverup and the lack of videos released to the public.  Same with Parkland.

       I am not sure how much you know about intelligence services, but things are compartmentalized.   The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.

       Why would the CIA people tell Trump?  They hate him.  The CIA people are loyal to the Cabal.

       Bush 1 and Bush 2 are both CIA.  They all sold their souls to the Cabal- Bush 1, Bush 2, Bill Clinton, Obama, Hillary Clinton, etc.    That is the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is "Did Trump sell his soul to the Cabal?"  If Trump sold his soul to the Cabal, then why is the CIA, FBI, and MSM working so hard against him?

       It's a common mantra of the deep state and an easy way to circumvent the power structure. The entire point of drug running and human trafficking by the deep state is to fund black ops without the knowledge of your superiors.

       I'd imagine most would rather not know if it absolves them of any wrong doing in the event your black op were to be uncovered by the public.

       I honestly think it was another 9/11 type event. Too many coincidences, IMO. Or at least they far exceed my tolerance for them. To be more exact, I believe it was a Mystery school ritual sacrifice, or execution, which could have served the secondary (or primary) function of motivating gun legislation. Paddock did have some strange connections.

       I don't know that there is a consensus, but as best I can make out:
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was a pedophile IA asset being used to deal arms to ISIS terrorist through the Saudis on behalf of the FBI.  Arms deal went south when the terrorists decided to shoot up the place.  FBI didn't want to be exposed, so they killed and framed Paddock, then kicked the whole thing out of the news cycle as quickly as they could.

       The MSM, LVPD, FBI, and others have done their job right. There is no consensus on what happened Oct. 1, because we still have no evidence of anything that happened. They may not have proof to back up their story, but they also have prevented any evidence to prove anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I believe happened:
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that Paddock was a gun runner. He would purchase guns and move them to drop locations or purchase locations, or he would provide them to those who had purchased them illegally for a cut of the money. There were a few major players in town that week, namely Saudi Royalty, who owned many of the hotels, specifically the Four Seasons in the Mandalay Bay, which was already busted before for underground dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was having to make a major move throughout this week, which is why he booked multiple hotel rooms in multiple hotels. Whoever he was working for had put in a major order or had set Vegas as the location for a major buy from multiple clients. He had spent the entire year buying very powerful, expensive, and specific weapons and ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the major twist comes in. Paddock was an informant for a major illegal arms/crime ring, which bought and transported guns internationally. Paddock had been the runner for some time before he was picked up as an informant, likely running guns back in Texas. Once he became an informant he was able to greatly expand his operation using government funding and connections. As time went on he became a greater asset to the ring, and therefor the government. He was benefiting at both ends of the deal, getting military technology to expand his operation, therefor making more money for/from the ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without getting into too much detail (although I believe I could) Vegas was meant to be a major sting on the ring, which backfired. They had caught on that Paddock was an informant, and that the government had been attempting to catch them red handed. Not to be outdone, the ring had its own shooter(s) take care of the crowd below as a message that they were truly in control, and should not be messed with, and left Paddock as the patsy. In return, FBI and LVPD were told to back off of the investigation, lest the ring do something far worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF this theory is correct, then that should terrify us greatly that such an organization exists.

       To answer your first question, the answer is yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To comment on your second point: Yes...ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would mean that the certain members of the DOJ, DOD, FBI, CIA, USDOT, HLS, Secret Service, NSA, and others are aware of such an organization. However, there are likely many who have not been given information on the organization simply for the sake of plausible deniability. Not saying Trump/Obama don't know about them, just that it is entirely possible and practical to believe they do not.

       I'm so done with the Right v. Left paradigm. If there is a deep state, we can pretty well assume that both sides are compromised. They put on the appearance of opposition on what are realistically meaningless issues while both fulfilling policies which help the deep state

       One cannot be done with the 'left vs right paradigm' while still supporting or providing cover for trump. Maybe you don't but many do and still claim the left/right paradigm while doing so.

       I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary because I know they are both awful people with a long history of corruption. I do have a problem with using the clear corrpution of one to support the other, so I have bashed on both sides for this (admittedly more on the left than the right, but only because the left is much louder than the right)

       thats just it. I get the consensus here is that it's the 'deep state' but it is obamas deep state, never ever trump, nor bush but always obama. 9/11 is the biggest conspiracy on here yet they also don't blame W or his admin, but some deep state, Obama's deep state, not actual terrorists who flew planes into a building witness by millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's jjust too much sometimes to watch the fetal position, breathless statements of deep state but only if it's the obama 'deep state'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, every conspiracy theory involving the deep state claims that obama and hillary knew about ALL of their actions and even planned them in some lair. trump? No, no knowledge. not even his. must be someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's just unnerving.

       1st nobody blames Obama for 911 and it's defiantly not his deep state , Obama Clinton etc are rentals/puppets for the deep state LMAO u think that derp could run a deep state with his foreign policy and Obama hasn't been on the scene very long. Deep state accusations have been around since the Reagan era, importing crack etc , probably even earlier. People blame the terrorists and government for 911 it's unique because AS U SAID "flew planes into a building witnessed by millions" but on the other hand the amount of money made, the stories changed, documents implicating bankers withheld and just the sheer amount of 1 offs and coincidences making peoplw point fingers at a deep state. (Ring of power is a great series on 911 and the power structure of elite.) LMAO TRUMP ISN'T A CAREER POLITICIAN and is is only in his second year of pres of course he won't be balled in with deep state scum. Since you feel so strongly about Trump can you show me any proof hes deep state or corrupt like we know hrc and O are ?

       Yes I agree 100% ISH should release info asap way to many cameras and heat detectors heart/blood rate monitors etc to not habe footage and all of this went down in the Vegas whixh is notorious for security cameeas.

       Thanks for keeping this alive. The Vegas shooting is what brought me to this sub
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a sticky case and I honestly don’t know what to believe. To sleep at night, I’ve just gone with Occam’s razor:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- Paddock was a madman
2- FBI/LVPD did a piss poor job investigating and handing the PR
3- MGM has done everything in their power to silence the truth (whatever that may be) in order to avoid negligence suits and keep tourist money coming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never bought into the gun runner theory because it makes no sense that the buyer or seller would shoot up the crowd. Being discrete is everything. But then again, stranger things have happened so who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope one day we learn the truth about what happened.

       This is the opposite of what you're asking for and I apologize about that, but any time the Vegas shooting is mentioned I can't help but mention a fringe theory that I've found to be very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was staged and there were no deaths and no injuries. The guns were firing blanks. The reasoning behind the forgery of this event is beyond me at the moment but there is one thing that I can attest to. There is no pictures or videos of blood at the site. The only picture that can be found of someone bleeding is a very propaganda oriented picture of blood dripping down a white woman's leg as she lay sideways on the ground. Other than that I haven't been able to find ANYTHING in terms of blood at the scene. Fifty people died and apparently 500 were injured and there is NO blood that can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory seems so insane that I don't want to believe it, so if someone could find some pictures and post them I would love it because I feel all but alone on this one. Seriously I would like to be proven wrong.

       Here's the biggest conspiracy theory about Paddock which nobody here is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Al Furqan Media, the only official voice of ISIS, claim Paddock as a "soldier
of the Caliphate", and give him the name Abu Abd al-Bir al-Amriki?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2wel.jpg">
        http://i.magaimg.net/img/2wel.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And not just once, ISIS claimed Paddock as one of their own again
in their Naba magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2017/10/08/islamic-state-newsletter-adds-to-claim-of-las-vegas-massacre/#more-4506">
        https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2017/10/08/islamic-state-newsletter-adds-to-claim-of-las-vegas-massacre/#more-4506
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS has a pretty flawless track record of only claiming attacks done by their
own members. There have been several Islamic attacks where ISIS did not claim
them, including the recent attack in Minnesota where the attacker even had an
ISIS flag in his car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock indeed pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr Baghdadi and his attack was done for
ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the conspiracy theories, "he was an ATF gun dealer", "he was a DoD arms
dealer", "he was a Pizzagate ring leader"--that's all a smoke screen. The cover
ups, the lack of video surveillance footage, the total black out in the press,
the silence from the FBI and DOJ, it's all to distract everyone away from
realizing the horrible truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The horrible truth that ISIS has committed the biggest mass shooting in American
history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now the FBI is
       <em>
        helping
       </em>
       ISIS, and so is Trump too, by covering up what they
know about Paddock being an ISIS member.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would FBI and Trump do this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cover Your Ass. They don't want to admit it was ISIS because that would give
ISIS a win, and also enrage the American public about how could the FBI let
ISIS attack 500 people and kill over 50?

       With that amount of guns, his personal wealth and the very odd interactions between LVPD and the FBI afterwards, some kind of gunrunner/informer plot is plausible. But the mass shooting element just doesn’t make sense. why not just kill the guy? why shoot all those people and bring so much public and law enforcement attention on the whole thing? Makes me lean towards a crazy old dude who had enough or everything going out with a bang.
