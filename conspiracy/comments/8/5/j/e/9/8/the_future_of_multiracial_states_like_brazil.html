       I watched a lot of these videos talking about the kalergi plan and how the ethnic groups are all part of meshes in the same environment would inevitably clash. Living in a multiracial nation like Australia I can’t help but ponder on about how exactly people actually cognitively receive those not of their ethnicity, beyond just verbal greetings, occasional meet ups and small daily exchanges like buying goods or participating in group work at the office/University. Could the different ethnicities be in fact highly balkanised and not actually mesh well together due their mutual detachment of each other’s heritage?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example a group of Croatian Australians may find it easier to enter the circle of a English/Greek group due to having some correlation to each other’s western heritage. The same for a group of Cantonese into a circle of Vietnamese but it’d be much harder for the Cantonese to mesh into the established circles of croatians/English, perhaps smaller numbers potentially could but a larger mass would have less likelihood for ease of exchange. Eventually the bigger populations would need to be permananetly segregated in order to prevent large scales clashes from occurring, the corullna riots are a key example of such ethnic tensions reaching boiling point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would this mean a eventual break up would occur in a diverse nation like Australia or Canada? If things get ugly a civil war may occur but only if most of the population becomes politically incensed. Maybe a escalation like Syria could be avoided if people recognises the futilties of maintaining a diverse country, and peacefully resolve how the populations will disperse. Or could such countries just begin to more and more resemble the slum ridden cities in brazil with the different ethnicities all vouching for seperate regions in order to avoid having too many altercations with one another?

       You seem to have a very subtle eurocentric view. The real issue is the class system and the treatment of the people and not diversity in itself.

       I don’t post about this all the time, nobody on Facebook is gonna have a debate like this with me without throwing accusations of being a literal Nazi thrown at me. You could go look at this channel called ‘alternative hypothesis’ and see the kind of data he’s compiles about how the races behave differently in the same environment and evidence of how America was originally planned to be an ethnostate for Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the same for Australia which is primarily of anglo Saxon foundation like Canada, most of the people have a clear British lineage and identifies with those values. Yes the class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever being to Sydney you’d see what I’m talking about, huge ethnic ghettoes forming where people are generally rather distrustful of one another and crime rates are high. Australia is supposed to be fairly egalitarian and have rather small class gaps that doesn’t seriously alienate each other. But clearly different ethnicities have a lot of issues trying on mingle together as one people when their racial identity are clearly very different. Call me a racist but I’m rather pessimistic about the future and could see a huge ugly chain reaction spurning from a lot of the Anglo population who’d feel they are being replaced.

       " races behave differently in the same environment"
Shit is kinda propaganda. You're viewing from the present without acknowledging the past. The division of todays society goes over peoples heads.

       Race is Darwinian propaganda

       This is true and its the reason the natives were wiped out and not enslaved. actually all of the america's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia which is primarily of anglo Saxon
      </p>
      <p>
       Anglo saxon's are part of the nwo. They wiped destroy all non-conforming european culture

       "class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races."
      </p>
      <p>
       You should research more about these people and "races" These issues are manufactured. Also most spent a lot of time under european revisionism. A lot of those places and had their culture and past wiped off the face of the planet to be reinvented by europeans.

       You should tell that to the new right sympathisers on YouTube, look at the debates going on Andy warski’s channel and see how many people firmly believe races are biological fact and complete separation is only moral and just. You could say that but they’ll accuse you of rooting for the lefty globalist elites who are attempting to make everyone ignore race and national identity so they become easy sheep to rule over.

       Right wings are literal tools of the nwo, same for the left but they're like the proxy children of the nwo. Well they both are but they both have their own jobs to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race and nationality is garbage especially when the ones of gave it to you are the nwo. People fail to realize a vast majority of the race's and nationality are entirely dependent on colonization and the destruction of culture and generations to be reinvented by the nwo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly if you look at the way "blacks" culture was destroyed and reinvented you'll start to see how it changed the world. Especially when you realize more europeans are closer to being black than being white.
      </p>

       I've been called all sorts of names especially on facebook considering I don't use fake accounts. I'm mixed. "White" people don't like the truth, "black" people don't like the truth.

       The alt right and those controversial speakers for white ethnostates are nwo shills? As far as I can see the ones in power are doing everything they can to smear their reputations and accuse them of nazism. They could be just ambitious greenhorn politicians trying to incense the Whites into establishing a pan European empire, trying to create what the third Reich started but never finished.

       Those enclaves are primarily 1st generation migrants who haven't fully integrated into Australian society. Language barrier is the primary issue. you don't think that 2nd or 3rd generation migrants are generally  integrated into Aussie society? You kinda sound like a Caucasian that doesn't have many or any ethnic friends...

       Its multiculturalism, not multiracialism. People who look the same can find tons of reasons to kill each other, see the middle east, russia, europe in the medieval ages etc etc. People who look different can find tons of reasons to fight together, American civil war etc . The problem is when no one is connected, or together, in your community, state, or country. Culture creates society.

       As far as I can see a lot of right wing channels gain pretty good momentum stacking Trudeau for being a globalist attempting to force down leftist ideals onto the entire population, as well as pardoning Isis insurgents and giving muslims a lot of privileges. The whole kalergi plan of the western world being ‘systematically replaced’ is also starting to gain recognition on YouTube. There’s heavy fire laid down on the entire idea of a multiracial society even being possible without eventual decline, not many are really throwing any good counter arguments besides the general fluffy ideas of ‘don’t judge by race but character’. This very well can be a sign of the collapse of ‘we are all one’ and back to the old imperial days of nation vs nation and tribe vs tribe.

       Well, I live here, in a city that's about 30% immigrants, and it's generally fine.  I manage a landscaping company, and at any given time I would say that 50+% of my workforce is immigrants.  They're no different than anybody else.  Somewhat different cultural values, but Canadians are generally pretty accepting as long as it doesn't cause problems.  Our immigration policies are pretty strict, and most if not all of the undesirables get filtered out.  We certainly don't have anything like the problems in Europe and Scandinavia caused by mass unregulated immigration.

       Isn’t Vancouver becoming a Chinese city slowly? There’s tons of talks about how the institutions in Canada is trying to force down the idea ‘whites cannot have a identity because it’s racist’. Basically any sort of pro white ideas are shunned upon like a great evil. It’s not much different to what the left is propagating in the US.

       What exactly is 'white' identity?  I'm about as white as possible, and my grandparents were Polish, Danish, English, and American.  I don't identify with any of those cultures, I'm just a Canadian.

       The white identity
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       inherently racist if you actually examine its rules and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, a white woman can have a black baby, right? But a black woman cannot have a white baby, huh? Purity is built into the concept of whiteness, it follows a rule whereby producing offspring with
       <em>
        any other ethnicity
       </em>
       automatically "downgrades" the child to that ethnicity. That is supremacy, and it was white people's idea, they came up with it.

       America is declining according to a lot of sources due off shoring of jobs and the current political schism that’s going on. You shouldn’t underestimate the alt right because they have being very successful in gaining support online, identity politics is a powerful force because it uses tribalism to band people towards a common cause. America was at its peak 80-90% white so that clearly says something.

       My parents came here legally after filing for immigration, the process took 6 years. I came here when I was 10. My father is an engineer and has designed and worked on several oil and gas projects in Canada, helping develop the infrastructure of this country. My mother runs a day-care and takes care of the neighborhood's children, helping the community. I am a security guard and work to protect your assets from thieves. I grew up here and consider this my country just as you consider it yours. We all work and pay taxes like everyone else.

       The majority of the drug addicts and criminals I come in contact with on a daily basis are natives or whites in this province,  you don't see me making generalizations.

      <p>
       If I came here on a boat, or hopped a fence, you might have an argument, but my family saw an opportunity, followed the legal process, and followed their Canadian dream as you call it. If you have a problem with that, take it up with parliament, don't blame immigrants for wanting to improve their lives and doing so by the books.

       Perhaps it would if affordable housing were being built. There's been nothing built in 30 years!  Why should the most vulnerable people in Canada have to pay insane rent and housing costs just so immigrants from the developing world can escape their homelands?  I don't agree with Canada's immigration policy.  The economic fallout is making me racist against them.  And I don't want to feel this way. But I do.

       I wouldn't have such a problem with immigrants if affordable housing is being built.  I don't believe our federal government has the social licence to bring in so many people every year without housing.  In most cities in Canada, a shitty infested one bedroom apartment is about $1000/month.  In Toronto and in most of BC it's much more.  These apartments should only be about $600 a month -- for students, seniors, pensioners, people on disability or social assistance, people working low wage jobs under $20 a hour, etc.  Immigration is absolutely skyrocketing rents for even crappy starter apartments.  Not to mention starter homes.  It's so hard to get on the property ladder to build equity without being in a couple, dual income.  This never used to be the case.  Our standard of living in Canada is plummeting due to our ill thought out immigration policies!

       I believe it will have some sort of effect moving forward. I am canadian and very accepting of any culture that comes here. However today we are having issues with people coming over here and trying to change our way of life thats not done in their culture. For example we can’t say Merry Christmas anymore as other cultures who came here don’t celebrate it and they complained about it so now we have to say Happy Holidays. It’s a stupid change I know but it is progressively getting worse and more and more stuff will be demanded to change to please them. If I moved to another country I would have 0 expectations for an entire nation to change just for my beliefs so I am not sure why they can choose to come here but refuse to conform and demand change.

       I’m very pessimistic and think this would lead to a bloody reaction from the British Canadians to overthrow the establishment and attempt to forcibly homogenise the population, leading to a civil war and the eventual disintegration of the nation. People could be forming mobs and provincial militias to round up and punish minorities for whatever ills they could be blamed for. I’m not even discussing culture but the racial lineage of people in such countries, the alt right argues people act as they are genetically programmed by their ethnicity and ‘race is culture’.

       Not really, more like 75% white because there are a lot of non whites in every populated major city, melbourne is something like 20-30% Asian. That 75 precentage is probably sliding because of the number of immigrants coming in. While Sydney is basically clash of the races like a tiny Brazil.

       that’s not going to be a reality as the non European immigration already overtook in numbers, every city would soon more or less have whites in something like the 60 or 70% quartile and if whites don’t raise the birth rate non whites will begin to displace them.

       Interesting subject. I’ve always thought about how the average white person in the United States is essentially a genetic mix when compared to the average white European. I feel like there is a British ‘look’, a German ‘look’, a Spanish ‘look’, etc... in terms of bone structure, skin tone, eye shape, etc.  But when it comes to white Americans, you can see a huge range in bone structure and facial features. In Minnesota and Wisconsin the average white person is almost completely Scandinavian genetically, while the average white person in Long Island has a good chance of being almost fully Italian. And yet they are both ‘white’ people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m biracial, and I know that mixed mixed-race people in the US have almost double the rate of mental illness as monoracial people. What if this same phenomenon fractals out into White America, the mathematical bulk of America’s population? At the genetic level, they literally do not look like each other to the same degree that an Englishman or Frenchman would. This could be the driving force behind why America is a neurotic nation obsessed with competition- it’s a nation of genetic strangers with zero ancestral identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my theory.

       true but the zero ancestral identity is part of the greater plan. It's literally one of the leg the nwo stands on because no one knows their lineage. Our ancestors are flipping in their graves

       I think it's also because of their insane obsession with race and race politics and racial identity. If u don't fit a certain mold you're get scrutinised more by everyone.

       Indeed. Americans take it for granted that "white" is a singular, obvious category that existed since time immemorial. They forget that "white America"
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a multi-ethnic or even post-ethnic community that, when it began, everyone said would collapse into ethnic in-fighting and distrust.

       I think mixed white is generally accepted by most white Americans and no one would throw smack at you for looking slightly Spanish or Norwegian. Being visibly Hispanic, asian, Black, or middle eastern is what gets you a lot of flack from general people and seen with hostility. But I guess some regions are simply more friendly than others when it comes to this kind of thing.

       This is true.

      <p>
       Tbh I'm like the epitome of mixed b/w  light skin with blue eyes. I have white friends that are "darker" than me with black facial features.
      </p>
      <p>
       The the undertone of both whites and blacks in the way they treat me is obvious. The spectrum of "racism" from both sides, various flavors of hate and jealousy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly they're soft conditioning and turning it into a fetish.

       The nwo bastardize everything they touch. Corrupting...

       They create issues to hide from the truth that they're wiping our cultures off the face of the planet. They're phasing us out. Soon people wont question these things.

       Right now the government where I live is very big into social engineering and it is becoming dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration and refugees top the diversity agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Public schools where I live are teaching the children of these immigrants and all the kids the Post Modernist theory of "White  Privilege".
      </p>
      <p>
       As a "cis white exemplar of the patriarchy" it seems there is already a contingency of bitter malfunctioning people who want me punished for selective scenes from history, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are active in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward decades from now when all of these once visible minorities come of age and confront me that aged, weak, Privileged Cis White oppressor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will their social contract with me be deliberately revoked?

       The situation is being primed and if certain operators require chaos it is so much easier to trigger.

       It's going to happen.  It's just a matter of the right conditions triggering it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want it to happen but I think it is inevitable.  I just don't see it as a complete US vs Them situation at first.  In the US for example.  If 5-10% of the population started fighting that is still 15-35 million people.  With innocents who would prefer to live in peace getting caught in the middle of it.  People would eventually have to take sides thinking it is the only way to survive.  Think of it like prison.  Many people go in not being racist...but end up joining racial gangs as a way to protect themselves.  That will all lead to retaliation from original non participants etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right conditions would have to be an almost complete collapse of govt though

       facebook is a terrible place to "debate"

       " races behave differently in the same environment"
Shit is kinda propaganda. You're viewing from the present without acknowledging the past. The division of todays society goes over peoples heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race is Darwinian propaganda
      </p>
      <p>
       America was originally planned to be an ethnostate for Europeans
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true and its the reason the natives were wiped out and not enslaved. actually all of the america's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia which is primarily of anglo Saxon
      </p>
      <p>
       Anglo saxon's are part of the nwo. They wiped destroy all non-conforming european culture
      </p>
      <p>
       "class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races."
      </p>
      <p>
       You should research more about these people and "races" These issues are manufactured. Also most spent a lot of time under european revisionism. A lot of those places and had their culture and past wiped off the face of the planet to be reinvented by europeans.

       Right wings are literal tools of the nwo, same for the left but they're like the proxy children of the nwo. Well they both are but they both have their own jobs to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race and nationality is garbage especially when the ones of gave it to you are the nwo. People fail to realize a vast majority of the race's and nationality are entirely dependent on colonization and the destruction of culture and generations to be reinvented by the nwo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly if you look at the way "blacks" culture was destroyed and reinvented you'll start to see how it changed the world. Especially when you realize more europeans are closer to being black than being white.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been called all sorts of names especially on facebook considering I don't use fake accounts. I'm mixed. "White" people don't like the truth, "black" people don't like the truth.

       Those enclaves are primarily 1st generation migrants who haven't fully integrated into Australian society. Language barrier is the primary issue. you don't think that 2nd or 3rd generation migrants are generally  integrated into Aussie society? You kinda sound like a Caucasian that doesn't have many or any ethnic friends...
