       I wanted to show my parents the dangers of GM foods, after looking all over the web I found this
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ug0rw/serious_would_it_be_smart_to_avoid_gmo/">
        thread

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What I got out of that thread was that GMO's aren't necessarily bad for you, but rather most of them have a lot of herbicides sprayed on them (
       <em>
        cough
       </em>
       Roundup
       <em>
        cough

       probably yes, round up ready crops incentivize the abuse of herbicide (eg resistance).

       though there is still horizontal gene transfer. Honestly it should impact humans directly, but may impose risks to local ecosystems

       HGT would likely only happen if bacterial DNA inserted into GMOs transfers to human microbiome bacteria. That could be extremely detrimental to the human microbiota.

       Exactly. Aside from the fact that we don't have any reliable studies on the potential long term effects of ingesting GMO crops, it is undeniable that perhaps the main reason GMO crops are produced is because of their ability to withstand high doses of pesticides, many of which leave toxic/carcinogenic, body chemistry changing byproducts (E.G. - Glyphosate) which linger on the finished fruits/vegetables/grains well after being processed and eventually find their way into our bodies in high doses.

       Well considering GMO's don't make anything dangerous, yes. If something
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       making food dangerous, it would be something that isn't the food itself.

       GMO is not one alteration. It most definitely can make food dangerous through novel protein expression which can cause disease. I suspect in a few more years the corruption surrounding GMO health effects will be uncovered.

       You're right, GMO
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       one alteration...it is "genetically modified organism."
      </p>
      <p>
       Diseases aren't linked to the protein expression in other organisms. You can't get Parkinson's by eating an animal with it. That's not how that works.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been consuming GMO's for thousands of years. Corn, wheat, goats, bananas, pigs, cows, almonds, and coffee beans are all organisms whose genetic modification began thousands of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refrain from preaching about the ill effects of GMO's until you actually know what constitutes a GMO.

       GMO food has only been around since the 1990s. Selectively bred plants and animals can not CROSS KINGDOMS, which is how most GMOs are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are purposefully conflating GMO and selectively bred at this point, or you lack even the most basic knowledge of genetics. Take your pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the novel protein expression i am referring to is the result of disrupting the microbiome, which has the downstream effect of altering the proteome.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while you might not get Parkinson's from a cow, you certainly can get prion spongiform encephalopathies from them.

       No GMO in history has been produced by a plant or animal crossing kingdoms, and selective breeding is a form of artificial genetic modification. Most GMO's were produced by artificial selection. Only recently have we made GMO's with gene splicing.

       I didnt think i had to do an ELI5 with the "cross kingdom" part... obviously i didnt mean that organisms changed kingdoms. I mean you cannot get specific genes from a fungus to cross with a plant with selective breeding because they cant breed,as i said about 50 times in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it does relate to the safety. Novel gene combinations that cannot occur in nature can give rise to novel protein expression, which can function as allergens or cause other issues for the organisms that eat them. Like the lab rats fed GMO potatoes getting filled with tumors for example.

       This but it's logical so it's gonna get downvoted unfortunately, nothing wrong with GM good just because you don't understand it folks. Pesticides are in fact more dangerous by a long shot and they're not even that dangerous when used properly.

       I think almost all food grown in the USA (plants) are genetically modified to some extent and definitely most of it is sprayed with some kind of pesticides. But even common foods we have today like bananas and wheat have been selectively bred for thousands of years and never existed in the same form they are in today thousands of years ago. So GM is simply just a hyper speed version of selective breeding. IMO, negative chemicals that directly affect our own cells when consumed or even touched like pesticides are much more dangerous than GM foods; but it is rare you will ever find a GM food that isn’t sprayed with a pesticide or herbicide lol.

       This is wrong and repeated time and time again. Hybridization and GMO are not even in the same world. The type of gene modification done by biotech would never in a million years happen in nature. We don't know what the long term effects of consuming these are... but you are right in the fact that the pesticides are without a doubt super dangerous and used to the tune of + 1 billion pounds annually.

       There is a big difference between
       <em>
        selective breeding
       </em>
       and GMO. You cant insert genes between fungi, bacteria and animals with plants or vice versa in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the difference between GMO and selective BREEDING. One involves BREEDING interfertile species. The other can cross DNA between entire kingdoms at will.

       They are in no fucking way similar and anyone who thinks they are clearly never passed high school biology.

       Maybe it seems you don’t understand, and maybe marketing schemes have altered a public view on what it means. Why should we assume since it doesn’t have “non-gmo” label it is GMO ? I honestly don’t know, by pure definition of genetics, breeding hybrid plants.. or taking plants that produce larger juicier fruits and vegetables and putting them near other similar plants to cross pollinate etc.. seems genetically altering them.  Idk what any of it means.. not from biology.. or botany point of view.. but by what we have socially set as a definition of what gmo is. Thanks for your answer, even though you seem as if you know it all and gave up zero insight to me asking what I did.

       So plant breeding is the foundation for what we see today as GMO.. thanks , doesn’t necessarily mean people are altering plants using a laboratory.. I am sure that happens, but I think it’s more for other reasons.. and if you read FDA regulations.. tons of GMO fruits and vegetables aren’t accepted as use for commercial sale. Please learn. None of this makes sense.

       It is not the same KIND of modification. When you make a new variety of lemon tree by cross pollinating two different lemons, that is not the same as extracting isolated genes from a bacterium or animal and inserting them into a plant(for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Selective breeding is just breeding two things that can
       <em>
        breed in nature
       </em>
       . If thats all that was required to get the desired result, why spend billions on labs to cut DNA and insert it into another organism?
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be no reason to if thats how it worked, but in point of fact it doesnt work that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need their big labs to do things that
       <em>
        cant happen in nature
       </em>
       like taking a gene from bacteria found in pools of toxic waste and inserting it into the genome of plants, which is how Round Up Ready crops were made.

       I know exactly what you are saying..  what I am saying is where is this going on and read up on usda rules and prove where it’s happening so much it’s affecting anything. And to say again.. botanist people who study plants.. say we’ve been genetically modifying organisms forever by selective breeding.. so how easy is it to blame anyone for it. When the definition is controversial to say the least. I think you are arguing a very small percentage of what is wrapped up into GMO.  Just think about it, you seem passionate, just try and understand there is no way monetarily that this is such a rampant problem it’s affecting everything. It’s happening on small scales like I’ve mentioned. I’m not arguing it’s good.. it’s terrible. But to group anyone who uses anything into a group with people who take genes here and there to Frankenstein a plant is uncalled for. No regular farmer is taking his/her hard earned money and time to make GMO.  How could you even begin to replicate it on such a large scale.. makes little sense to me.

       Except that it is not the same AT ALL. The results of selective breeding are not the same, and neither are the techniques or capabilities of selective breeding.

      <p>
       To take what a botanist said
       <em>
        completely out of context
       </em>
       (or maybe they dont know how GMOs are made) doesnt mean that people have been inserting bacterial DNA into plants or animals for centuries. That wasnt possible until late in the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMOs exist because they are
       <em>
        patentable lifeforms
       </em>
       which can be exploited as Monsanto exploits them, by making farmers dependent on them for seeds and pesticides, and not even allowing the replanting of their own seeds without huge fines. They have armies of spies and lawyers to enforce their patents. GMO companies do not benefit anyone except the people who get rich off of them.

       Why are you arguing the same point ? You are arguing semantics of definition. I agree it’s bad.. I am
Saying depends on who you talk to
Where we accept what the definition means strictly. You want me to believe a green giant brand can of corn has gmo ? Because it doesn’t say non gmo.. I am saying it’s more of a marketing scheme versus people actually in a lab GMO.. make sense ? I think we are thinking two completely things here.

       What? I email companies all the time to find out where thier ingredients are sourced and if  theyre GMO. They usually dont have a problem answering.
