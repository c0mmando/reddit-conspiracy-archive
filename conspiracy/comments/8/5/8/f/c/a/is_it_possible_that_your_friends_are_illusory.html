       my friends don’t exist I am convinced of it and I can prove it think about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I visit “them” supposedly each tkme and then typical “friend” stuff happens, but then when I leave I have no contact with them, despite these “friends” knowing my info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that may sounds like oh you have shitty friends or they don’t like you lol but you would think they WOULD at least once contact me like literally “hey is this
       <a href="/r/thelastseeder">
        /r/thelastseeder
       </a>
       ” not once.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I ask them in person hey what happened I thought you were gonna text me and they say ohh that’s right I must have forgot and then they Text me right away and I receive it. Later on in the night I blacked out and I wake up it’s gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve always been hearing noises too chirps and sticks and clicks around my house and room my parents and my “friends” don’t hear it I don’t know what’s going on or what’s wrong with me orntjem

       I don’t know either man I don’t know what to think or what. To believe but I do know that maybe they were right about the simulations . About us just being players and everyone an npc. Maybe I’m not real to you and you’re not real to me but friends are not real you cannot trust anyone the sole purpose of the outside world is to extract information out of what they gabe you, out of what your parents gave you. Idk if I can even trust my parents?? Maybe your parents didn’t really birth you. I’m not sure, but the world is trying. To extract information from us and that is it’s sole purpose . We cant trust anything

       Before I depart I will do my best to articulate myself,
      </p>
      <p>
       For years and Years, ever since my upbringing I’ve always tried to do what my “parents” told me and what I thought was right. I thought I was being nice and I thought I was people “” generally liked me elementary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not want to get into it but middle school was terrible I made some dumb mistakes etc. nothing crazy like raping anyone or assault but like creepy stalking through their Instagram and such, and then I realized how fucking dumb that was in 8th grade and I made amends and it seemed like everything was going to go great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope, no one reached out to me I tried but got ignored and I didn’t want to bother anyone so I just let them be. From then on I vowed to not approach anyone and let them approach me because I don’t want to be a bother and interfere in anyone’s life well the good news is I didn’t interfere because no one bothered asking me to do anything f ever. I mustered yo courage to ask some people out, nope, didn’t work. Mustered up courage to get some new friends didn’t work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started working out but no one noticed, people started to notice a decline in my mental health but they would just say how are you and I would say not the best or not good and they say “”oh...””
      </p>
      <p>
       My own cousin man, I loved her so much. We always played on those auto rover vehicles when we were young. She comes and visits portland and says we should hang sometime cuz she’s in the area, guess what. Never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Friends hanging out? I’m not there
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking a joint? Didn’t even ask me if I wanted to come which is alrigjt I guess I can’t beg to be part of everything without trying but I’ve tried so hard my whole life and I’ve struggled with anxiety and bipolar and just about every disadvantage you can think of that destroys relationships and distances people from Me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I realized, if these people actually “cared” wouldn’t they try a little harder? Then I thought oh these are just shitty friends and what not but then I would not even recollect being with them in the first place. Like so many times just gone. They all just left.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s when it all makes sense, maybe it’s not my fault OR theirs, because they don’t exist. Maybe I don’t exist either. But for the sake of my sanity I need it to end somehow so

       They exist.  These people, etc.  It’s just that life on this planet
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       - and is hard.  That’s what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of this planet like a shitty middle school.  That’s what it is.  Even if that middle school is shitty, though, it would be even worse if you dropped out or flunked out of that school, right?  Basically, what you want to do is just GET THROUGH that shitty school and those shitty classes and be done with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s how the life we live on this planet is like.  It’s like a shitty middle school here.  It’s like a shitty middle school, but - just like school in general - it doesn’t matter how shitty it is, it’s better to simply get through it and get it over with and graduate and move on…and NOT drop out.  It’s better to finish it and learn as much as you can from it rather than say “fuck it” and stop going to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as it’s better to finish school and not drop out, it’s better to finish this life and not, for example, end it prematurely by, say, killing yourself or doing something else like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just learn as much as you can while you’re here.  Realize that part of the lesson of this life is that it’s actually NOT SUPPOSED to be good or fun or pleasant.  This life is actually not SUPPOSED to be good or fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grit down, learn as much as you can from it, and after you’re done with this life, you
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be better off afterward/in the next life.  You
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       have learned more.

      <p>
       Na, man.  I had that reaction not because you’re a “failure” necessarily.  I don’t know that one way or the other, and I wouldn’t say that about you outright, as I don’t know you well enough or have enough information about you to make that assessment one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s just that a lot of the manners in which you phrased your thoughts seemed a bit…disjointed and confused to me; like I wasn’t sure whether you were/are thinking in an entirely clear-headed manner.  If you’re
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       thinking in an entirely clear-headed manner, then it would make it a lot more difficult to be able to coherently communicate with you - especially over such a limited venue as textual/word communication here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it’s ok I’ve come to terms with it it’s not real it’s not real it’s not real
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the thing, man.  The “realness” or “not realness” of things really depends on what way you’re looking at it all from.  In an “ultimate, cosmic” sense?  Yeah.  There aren’t too many things that are what they actually look like or seem to be.  Everything is energy.  In that sense, again, not too many things actually
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       what they appear to be or are “real”.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, within the context
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       that illusory physicality and three-dimensionality, things definitely appear to be and can be said to be very much real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it all depends on which way you want to look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is though that I’m not sure you understand the dynamic in this manner.  That’s why I was uncertain as to whether to move forward with an attempt at communicating this or not.

      <p>
       Well, I certainly
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to be one of the “good ones”, but I’m not sure that trying to communicate with you and get some questions out of you necessarily means that someone
       <em>
        isn’t
       </em>
       “one of the good ones” either.  Just because someone’s trying to have a conversation with you, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not a “good one”.

       I know you've already dismissed the "bad friend" explanation but like...that's seriously the answer. Either on their part or, perhaps, on yours. I have a small circle of very good friends and one friend I would consider my "best" friend in that circle. We are constantly in communication via text or phone call, despite being several hundred miles apart.

       they aren’t real, someone just pmd me telling me I’m a troll just is this is exactly what I’m talking about. See u talk out and speak and they start coming towards you, first ok you’re troll mean whatever then they say sorry they want to be friends then they start asking you questions oh where are you born where were you from oh cool you speak this you sEE?? after all the depictions we have of friends “” like in the 70s playing on GameCube and going outside to such a drastic change, how is that possiblue? One thing; they don’t exist, they never existed. Maybe something changed after y2k when the computers changed times I don’t know but it’s not richt something isn’t right in this world

       You're right that something isn't right in this world but your own perceptions are incredibly skewed. You think no one has real friends, just because you are unlucky enough to have a bunch of shitty ones? That people asking you about your past IRL are somehow "out to get you"? How else are people supposed to become your friends, without getting to know you and your hobbies and interests?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are falling down a deep, dark hole my friend...and you desperately need people IRL who can help pull you out of it. If friends aren't real then people aren't real, then families aren't real, in essence nothing is real. And I don't believe that, and I don't think you believe that either.

       You can believe that if you want man...but I strongly urge you not to. You sound like you are on the verge of a serious psychotic break, and you need to realize this and step back from the edge.

       You are lost in the existentialism of life, but you fail to see what is important right in front of your face. So what if you are nothing but star dust? The Iron in your blood was baked in a goddamn star billions of years ago-
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are the Universe experiencing itself, so am I, so is everyone here on this board and all humans who have ever existed and ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't ask to be born, but you
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       . You are experiencing this very point in time with your billions of human brothers and sisters. Against all odds
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , as an individual, were born, and exist as a conscious being. And you are experiencing this Universe with your fellow Conscious human brothers and sisters. If there really is nothing after death then what matters are each other, in the here and now, as we live together on this tiny spec of dust flying through the Universe. What also matters is tomorrow- the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to take a step back my friend, away from the ledge and the pit of self-loathing doom. You aren't a robot, and I'm sorry to say, but you aren't so special that this whole universe was made for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       alone, and the rest of us are all fake. You are just another part of the great mass of Humanity- and that's a great and beautiful thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to see the beauty in life- find out how you fit into your community and work outwards from there. No snowflake thinks it is responsible for the avalanche but they
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       are...this goes for the good things in life too. We're all in this together, and if life really is meaningless, then that means
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       assign it meaning. I know that's a lot to take in, but it's something you need to internalize if you are going to get over this and move on with us into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong friend. I don't know who you are but I am with you in spirit. I know you don't believe it, but you are

        not

       alone.

       is fine, he’s fine he’s just imitating nothings wrong with him, or there is kemtnkng wrong with him and ‘’people’’ acknowledge it but don’t do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let’s say we are real. All of us, let’s say all of it is true. Everyone has a support group. A sister or brother, relatable parents, cousins, and even if you have absolutely none of those things everyone has a friend
      </p>
      <p>
       I have none
      </p>
      <p>
       So may be I am special, may I was chosen to have none for some purpose I don’t know yet. Maybe this is all just an insane drug trip and I’ll be fine when I die, the point is I have nothing, everyone has something. I don’t want pity, I want to know the truth. If thisnreally is the sad truth, (and yes I’m sympathetic to those in “Africa” and “SOutheast Asia” who truly have nothing) but if you can be born in this so called great land of everything and have absolutely no one to share your troubles, no one to rely on, no advantage whatsoever, I mean what is the point? Either way why not just end it

       I probably look like a little bitch, but that is ok. If that is the price I must pay not to be a bother to anyone’s life, I will take it, hence why I’ve chosen to do what I have to do, and the reason I isolates mself in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always wanted people to like me, that’s all I’ve ever wanted. When I started realizing I wasn’t making much success, I thought, hey, it’s that guy who doesn’t get into anyone’s personal business I bet he’s cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly I have misinterpreted things, and it is far too late to change my personality now.

       Anyway, we will all be in a better place soon I hope , assuming you are real. I can’t believe I’m talking to myself right now

       I can recollect every single this I have done this morning ,
      </p>
      <p>
       DONT u see there’s some crazy shir going on and it goes way deeper than my “friends” not being real, or imaginary, but perhaps the first sign of life outside earth. Like experiments and seeing which ones continue to the norms of “ ok hi bye wow” and the “ is the world around me really the way it should be” crowd except that doesn’t matter anyone because whatever we are experiencing isn’t real it’s FAKE at least for me literally I can recall my friends being there and then other people sayig wtf are you talking about??!
But how do I know those other people are real
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant trust anyone that’s my point there’s too much to go into there’s too much to study the fact is the undeniable fact is you cannot trust anyone

       How is it I am born to a “ middle class house” with “a healthy body” and “good genetics” and all that bullshit they keep feeding us if they were not trying to get something out of us. When was the last time you said “how are you?” And actually meant it besides saying “I’m good” what if someone REALLY told you what they felt.

       Don't fucking bully a schizophrenic person having a psychosis. People are suicidal at this state. You're basically talking to a sleepwalking person that's highly susceptable to suggestion and extremely paranoid and unable to get a grip on reality, feeling foggy. He/she clearly smoked too much weed and it caused their schizophrenia to blossom. One of the most common causes for schizophrenia is smoking weed while you're 15-18 years old, if you're already prone to it since it runs in the family.

       I find younger people aren't so much "visitors" as older people, they'd rather text then have physical conversation. anyways maybe you need some more mature friends or to try planning stuff out with your friends so it's not so random and depressing when people don't get ahold of you, don't expect people to contact you out of the blue, people are reclusive so you need to prod them out of their boxes now and again ahhaa

      <p>
       BUT Then I realized, I actually have little memory with them. Like they are FORGED memories, but no real connection, no real bond. Like you say ok hey your friend just died I’d be like damn... so sad... then move on but your parents or your dog you’re like CRUSHED YOU CANT MOVE,
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’ve known my friends and my dog the same amount of time, shared the same amount of experiences, so why do I care more
About one than the other??
The fact is they cannot be real one of them isn’t and that’s my friends.

       Hey man, cannabis is known to cause short term memory loss, meaning your memories are being blocked out by the herb because they are memories that cause you sadness and you don't want to think about them, one of those memories is how you are being treated by people who you believe care about you, you don't want to think about them or even believe they exist, because it's almost like they do not exist in your world, but they are real people, they just aren't living very compassionate and caring lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe you are experiencing is a world that greatly lacks love, and is very selfish in their motives. Everyone is trying to become successful and rich and get lots of possession, they don't care about what is happening to poor kids in Africa for example, as long as they are happy. It's the world we currently live in. I experience something similar to you, I am feeling really down sometimes and sad, and I have told this to some people who I think of as close friends, that I am struggling, I am having a hard time, and they talk about it with me for a few minutes through text message, and then they never talk to me again for a month, meanwhile I am feeling lonely and no one ever texts or calls me just to see how I am doing, even if they know that I am feeling lonely and sad, it's like they care only 1% about me, not enough to just be there for me. It makes me sad, but it's the world we live in right now, it's full of darkness, but there is still light out there, so just keep holding on and pushing forward, because you do have value, you are a human being and we are both lovable and loved by God. If you don't believe that, well then at least I hope you believe that I love you, and I hope you try to stay positive and try not to overthink everything, try to get out into nature and experience the life that is all around you, try to be mindful of your existence and try to use the herb in moderation, don't use it every day, because it will create its own world for you to live in while you deal with things like depression, don't just stay in that world, try to become better every day, even if it's just by doing little things like eating something healthy and going for a walk in nature.

       This may very well be the case. I have decided to hold off on my plans based on this message and a gracious pm I have received. I hope you can all find it in your heart to forgive me for any potential worry I may have caused.

       This brings me great joy that I feel like crying. Thank you, and I believe that I would like you too :) I hope that we can both find peace and rest in this life.
