<p>First, we all know the deep state, British intelligence, and CIA armed, trained, funded and aided Syrian rebels. They staged several false flag chemical weapon attacks in the past as their &quot;new 9/11&quot; plan for intervention.</p>

<p>Why? Because of Europe&#39;s dependence on Russian oil and gas, a pipeline running from the gulf through Turkey would allow for Saudi oil to flow freely and cheaply into Europe.</p>

<p>Russia stepped in and used military force to effectively stop the total overthrow of Assad and turning Syria into a failed state akin to Libya. 
Now the Russian elections are tomorrow.

<li>The U.S is assembling forces in the crisis region. Massive naval presence in Med, Read Sea and Persian Gulf including aircraft carriers</li>
<li>Russia as well has boosted its naval resources there including nuclear submarines</li>
<li>Trump and Macron (and possibly May as well now) are pissed off big time with what is going down in Goutha and have lost patience</li>
<li>There is chatter that French journalists have been urged to STOP all travel in Syria while UN officials have been advised to leave Damascus urgently within 48 hours
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-france/frances-foreign-ministry-tells-reporters-to-stop-all-travel-to-syria-idUSKCN1GS1DN">Reuter&#39;s source confirming this claim</a></li>
<li>Also there seems to be dramatic conversations taking place between U.S and Russian military officials: U.S has informed them on the planned strikes but Gerasimov has threatend to take out the U.S warships if Assad or Russian troops hit</li>
<li>Keep in mind that resolute military action which could target Assad and the regime himself will give Trump a lot more credibility when meeting with North Korea&#39;s KIM</li>
<li>Also, with Tillerson silenced there is effectively a diplomatic vacuum from the U.S in communicating with world powers which opens a window for military action</li>
<li>And of course, NATO has enough with Putin. Now, another 4 years? Many will like the idea to give him a bloody nose for to deter him at the beginning of his 4th term</li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct, but it is ultimately unfortunate, because it&#39;s the <em>present</em> that belongs to the proles as well, and that&#39;s the mindset we need to have (but unfortunately don&#39;t yet have) in order to really make the real change.  The moment we proles really and truly understand, imbue, and internalize this fact - the fact that we have literally <em>always</em> had the power to change things for the better and could change things if we came together and did the right thing <em>today RIGHT NOW</em>...not in some abstract future we keep waiting for while the present keeps having its way with us - will be the moment that things actually change.  We would come together NOW and change things NOW.</p>

<p>Until we realize that, we&#39;ll continue not doing enough, and the future will <em>continue</em> being &quot;the future&quot; - i.e. it&#39;ll be just like the proverbial carrot in front of the donkey&#39;s nose...always &quot;almost&quot; right there, but never actually in our hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What on Earth is ever so wrong with you?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not patting myself on the back <em>at all</em>.  What is it with you and this misguided effort you continue to make to be unnecessarily antagonistic? and why?  What is it that&#39;s not quite ticking right in your head?  What is it that&#39;s causing you to think that you have any idea what in fact is actually going on in terms of the deeper meaning of human social motivations and interactions?  What is it with you and this childish desire you persist in having in attempting to unsolicitedly antagonize a dynamic that shows you to be more and more closed-minded the more you continue down this particular path?</p>

<p>It&#39;s odd really.</p>

<p>Are you...17, by chance?  You can&#39;t be much older.  There seems to be far too much wannabe &quot;edge-lord&quot; projection going on here for too much else to be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much about things being boring one way or the other.  It&#39;s about things being torturous.  This planet to a great extent is pure hell for many - and for even those that it isn&#39;t &quot;pure hell&quot; for, it is still significantly undermining and debilitating in terms of helping the humans here realize their/our greatest potential.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much about whether a thing is boring or not so much as it&#39;s about whether it helps one evolve or not - and a great portion of what is happening on this planet, what is being pushed on the masses by covert influences, is not conducive to helping us evolve.</p>

<p>THAT needs to be done away with.</p>

<p>Also, we absolutely will get another chance to do this.  Chances keep coming.  We&#39;ll get chances over and over.  Existence is cyclical.  What goes around comes around.  This isn&#39;t to say that one should sit on their laurels and do nothing, however.  Far from it.  It is to say, however, that we shouldn&#39;t go too crazy if things don&#39;t happen exactly like we want them to because existence gives constant chances to improve and evolve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that alot of people will never understand is that when it finally happens, who&#39;ll know?  Not us.  If we&#39;re lucky enough to survive after everything goes crazy then have a plan. But if you&#39;re within a nuke zone, you&#39;re dependent on someone or something saving you from the missile etc.  It&#39;ll just happen or not.  There probably wont be an announcement. We have no real control of the initial situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bankers control both the &quot;west&quot; and the &quot;east&quot; .. They will not launch of world ending war without their new world order set in place.. Remember they already basically control all countries in that they control the banking systems of all countries besides maybe north korea and Iran... Russia and China are just positioning themselves to be put on the &quot;favorite&quot; list of the people that control the banking system. If the bankers favor Russia and China then all of us in the USA will eventually be forgotten and our Economy will be left to crash and burn while the bankers that prop up our fake economy abandon us... who knows I am just guessing? </p>

<p>And of course, NATO has enough with Putin. Now, another 4 years? Many will like the idea to give him a bloody nose for to deter him at the beginning of his 4th term</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A &quot;bloody nose&quot;?</p>

<p>What kind of psychopath talks about mass slaughter that way?</p>

<p>Americans who speak as though their illegal occupation and Terrorist proxy armies working to overthrow and balkanize Syria are somehow the good actors in all this sound insane.</p>

<p>The United States and Israel are the rogue nation villains taking the world to war. </p>

<p>No sane person can dispute this.</p>

<p>The United States supports international terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m just going to go through most of the more obviously debunkable ones 1 by 1 for the time being.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the subject of the potential Carrier Strike Groups.  The US has exactly 1 Carrier stationed in the Arab area, the USS Theodore Roosevelt.  That carrier has been stationed in the Persian Gulf for over 6 months now.  There has been no other tracking of any of the US&#39; aircraft carriers making their way to any positions referenced.</p></li>
<li><p>On the comments regarding Ghouta.  If the US and such were so upset about Ghouta, why the hell would they wait until the pocket is almost gone before acting?  If you actually follow it, you&#39;d see that East Ghouta basically crumbled in days, and the US did nothing, despite having the capabilities they do here.</p></li>
<li><p>I have seen absolutely no statements by any credible sources that say that UN officials have been told to leave urgently.  People severely underestimate movement of information in this day and age.  If UN officials were leaving en masse, people would be commenting on it.  As for the reporters...I don&#39;t even think I&#39;ve seen a French Reporter in Syria, or read about it, so yeah, not sure if it&#39;s more a symbolic gesture more than anything.</p></li>
<li><p>On the subject of the US giving Russia notice of attacks.  Well this is just straight up one of the worst sources I&#39;ve found.  Besides Twitter (which let&#39;s face it...it&#39;s Twitter), the only place I have found that cites this idea is a single, Greek Website, that is nigh unreadable, and isn&#39;t even a proper newspaper.  So...a Greek blog essentially is the only one that has access to a discussion of this magnitude?  Yeah, I don&#39;t buy it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The thing is, I can find only one person that is citing all this stuff, and it seems most people are responding and quoting him back.  And that man is Hal Turner.  Look, I understand that this is a conspiracy subreddit, but Hal has been debunked so many times at this point I don&#39;t even want to consider it.  I don&#39;t see him as a credible source in the least.  The guy seems like the type that would cry out about the end of the world at will if it meant garnering him attention.  Beyond that, the only people I&#39;ve seen quoting this supposed interaction are random, no name, unverified Twitter accounts.  I can&#39;t really comment on the movement of naval ships, because I can&#39;t keep track of all of them, but I feel that if the US was actually intending something, they&#39;d have more than one Carrier strike group in the area.</p>
