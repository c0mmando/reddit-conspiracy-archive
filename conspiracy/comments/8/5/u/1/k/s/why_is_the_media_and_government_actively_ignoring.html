       We all know about the grooming gangs in Europe, mass rapes, unwillingness to protect women, the police coverups, the government's complete unwillingness to acknowledge the problem of mass 'Asia' migration into Europe. Everybody knows what's going on, no one is happy about it, but if anyone decides to give their public opinion in a rational way they are automatically labeled a Nazi and the internet brigade comes and destroys their life (good luck finding a job). Internet shaming works because it it public, and it will ruin your reputation in a matter of minutes for the rest of your life. This may be the biggest conspiracy of all time.

      <p>
       Edit: we all know what 'Asia' means

       Heh. No there are quite a few migrant communities. Having traveled to Germany, not quite what this post says, but there are people who talk about it. US military is very aware of it. The German Police know about it. But. Doesn't get much attention. Like you'd think it would.

       I was born in Germany and travel there here and there - most recently in March 2016 when I visited Munich.  Sure, there are migrant communities, but I don't see any mass raping or crime like is being suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest here - the true reason people are upset is that they don't want to see white countries become brown.  These "no go zones" and etc. are just a distraction from their true aim - a whiter Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, I think Germany (at least Bavaria) is one of the least diverse places in Europe.  At least of where I have been.

       I'll leave Europe to the Europeans.  I am just saying that the stark picture painted by those who want to keep Europe white are not in line with reality.  Just fear mongering.

       I consider the USA to be a different story though.  We are a nation of immigrants.  I have no problem with immigrants coming to the USA.  I know quite a few engineers who were not born here.  They contribute more to the USA than the average trailer park white guy in Mississippi.

       Europeans WILL become a minority in their own lands by 2050. The math is clear on this happening. This will result in more anger, chaos, market disruption and ultimate societal breakdown. People self segregate in big cities for a reason (Chinatown, Koreatown, etc). No go zones will become more common. It's better to do something about it now rather than later, when shit really starts to hit the fan.

       I have no idea how anyone could look at the situation and think we are just dandy right now. 99% of the US will never be able to afford nor own property in SF, LA, NYC, PHI, BOS and other major cities. If you aren't making at least $50k, you can forget affording kids on your own. Entry level jobs require bachelors degrees plus experience.

       lol I've been to Europe. You have no idea how pissed people are at the EU. Italy just voted in a right-coalition to protect their culture. Most EU countries are going to see their native European population become a minority in their own lands. You don't think this pisses people off? Gran a brain. People are livid. They aren't asking for this, the EU leaders are forcing this shit down everyone's throats.

       No, its true. What do you gain out of denying facts? For example, ethnic Germans are on track to become a minority in Germany in one generation. If you can't handle mature conversations like this, I suggest staying in r/politics.

       stfu even in Switzerland everywhere i go there are Eritreans. Parasites sucking our tax money, they get their housing paid, their food, clothes, high end samsung phones, everything. They sometimes stab eachother, and are involved in drug trafficking. Maybe my eyes and the local media are lying.

       OP I am certain that is not your intention, but If I wanted to write some cultural fear and hate mongering to scare people into irrational thinking and behavior.  The result would look like your post.
       <br/>
       But we know that isn't true.

      <p>
       So, I want to ask. Why you believe that, and what is your goal with this post?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the conspiracy involved?
