Everybody knows what&#39;s going on, no one is happy about it, but if anyone decides to give their public opinion in a rational way they are automatically labeled a Nazi and the internet brigade comes and destroys their life (good luck finding a job). Internet shaming works because it it public, and it will ruin your reputation in a matter of minutes for the rest of your life. This may be the biggest conspiracy of all time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born in Germany and travel there here and there - most recently in March 2016 when I visited Munich.  Sure, there are migrant communities, but I don&#39;t see any mass raping or crime like is being suggested.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest here - the true reason people are upset is that they don&#39;t want to see white countries become brown.  These &quot;no go zones&quot; and etc. are just a distraction from their true aim - a whiter Europe.  </p>

<p>And for the record, I think Germany (at least Bavaria) is one of the least diverse places in Europe.  At least of where I have been.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europeans WILL become a minority in their own lands by 2050. The math is clear on this happening. This will result in more anger, chaos, market disruption and ultimate societal breakdown. People self segregate in big cities for a reason (Chinatown, Koreatown, etc). No go zones will become more common. It&#39;s better to do something about it now rather than later, when shit really starts to hit the fan. </p>

<p>No, we aren&#39;t. The melting pot thing was a <a href="https://wilsonquarterly.com/stories/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-melting-pot/">tagline from a British playwriter named Israel Zangwill.</a>. I&#39;m sure there were many Americans who weren&#39;t thrilled then with the immigrations, but like now, they were also shut up, eventually outbred and outvoted just like the Native Americans were, the Native Hawaiians were and the Black Americans and White Americans will be.</p>

<p>Until they take your job, your money and your head, but it&#39;ll be long too late by then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know quite a few engineers who were not born here. </p>

<p>Cheating on tests and in school is quite common in China and India as is corruption and nepotism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not everyone is cut out to be an engineer. Even if you can do it, you may not want to go into that field.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I have no idea how anyone could look at the situation and think we are just dandy right now. 99% of the US will never be able to afford nor own property in SF, LA, NYC, PHI, BOS and other major cities. If you aren&#39;t making at least $50k, you can forget affording kids on your own. Entry level jobs require bachelors degrees plus experience.</p>
