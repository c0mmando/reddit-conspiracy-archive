        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/GodPoopsToo.html">GodPoopsToo</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I watched the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305ryPvU6A8">Apple Homepod Ad</a> and it instantly set off alarms.  It took me a couple of times watching it to see what they were getting at, but the summary is clear:</p>

<p><strong>We are so distanced from each other that the only option left for interaction is a virtual surrogate.  The Surrogate Digital Self is what&#39;s distancing us in the first place.  That surrogate is a reflection of ourselves that will lead us into the darkness where it will eventually leave us behind.</strong></p>

<p>The video <a href="https://imgur.com/gAGDhdO">begins with FKA twigs in isolation while surrounded by people</a>.  We instantly get the impression of bleak, dark, cold paletted city life.  Even in the <a href="https://imgur.com/3GebZO5">elevator, she isn&#39;t heard and is isolated</a>.  Once she finally gets home, exhausted and depressed she asks Siri, the only &quot;person&quot; who will listen to her, to &quot;play a song I&#39;ll like.&quot;</p>

<p>Now is when it gets interesting.  Ms Twigs sits on the couch and begins <a href="https://imgur.com/Lx6pKw6">slowly stirring the ice in her glass along to the beat</a>.  Hypnotism often relies on a totem, or tool, like a swaying clock, to put a person in a suggestible state.  The audio is slightly distorted and then suddenly the <a href="https://imgur.com/iDeWb3s">table &quot;breaks&quot; and reality is distorted</a>.  She then <a href="https://imgur.com/qxsmSYn">learns to control it somewhat</a>, and eventually <a href="https://imgur.com/5Fb3O6y">breaks a hole through the wall</a> of reality.  At the <a href="https://imgur.com/BgJhNSI">end of the tunnel</a> she meets a reflection of herself.  She tries to <a href="https://imgur.com/RoOIXfW">brush it off</a> but the mirror comes back and opens up to <a href="https://imgur.com/ER1vmWV">reveal a double of her that has a life of its own</a>.  The original FKA Twigs is hesitant and nervous about stepping over to &quot;the other side.&quot;  What are the motivations of this other, duplicate self?</p>

<p>In MK Ultra type programming, the use of split personalities, dichotomy, black and white, mirrors, reflections, are all ways to manipulate the individual.  From now on I&#39;ll call the reflected FKA Twigs, Twigs B, and the original Twigs A.  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/VNj4quj">Twigs B quickly takes the lead</a> and aggressively <a href="https://imgur.com/Is8xKTR">approaches Twigs A who&#39;s initially off put by the display</a>.  <a href="https://imgur.com/zycB6Wr">Twigs B goes on to lead the dance,</a> eventually leading <a href="https://imgur.com/2CHB4Cx">to a scene of obvious self love</a> which could be meant to <a href="https://imgur.com/gwaoDkF">entertain &quot;us&quot; in a glorification of some alter ego self?</a>.  (Note that the pyramid shape on Twigs B was intentionally sewn in that shape, considering <a href="https://imgur.com/UbSNHCJ">Twigs A does not have that symbol on her own &quot;matching&quot; outfit</a>).  Twigs A <a href="https://imgur.com/Y1hRU8w">makes an attempt to lead the dance,</a> but Twigs B <a href="https://imgur.com/UnUDJRV">grabs Twigs A and begins spinning them through the darkness</a>.  Twigs B uses Twigs A to catapult herself, <a href="https://imgur.com/PVcSlUS">leaving Twigs A alone in the dark</a>, while Twigs B dances <a href="https://imgur.com/f5le8Bx">on back to reality</a> where she assumes the  role as Twigs A.</p>

<p>Now, obviously I have no idea what Spike Jonze intended with this ad, but from my understanding, it seems a lot like propaganda pushing us away from each other and ourselves and instead pushes us towards a digital world in which we lose our sense of Self for something else entirely.  The message I&#39;m getting is that we <em>need</em> these virtual companions because we have no one left.  Funny enough, the Technocratic Mafia Racket doesn&#39;t break your windows only to fix them the next day, they kill our friends, and then present their own products as our new friends.</p>

<p>I want to hear all of your thoughts about this kind of marketing in general and specifically this piece.  Is it all that I claim it to be, or just a creative use of practical effects to sell a product?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1984 has come and gone (literally and figuratively). If we were to parallel the book’s title with actual years, it’d be like we’re in 2084. Use your imagination. Think back to the Manhattan project, for example, or MKULTRA, and how a thing so massive was completely unknown to the world. What machinations might those at high levels of science, military and government be up to? </p>

<p>When the reflection leaves her behind in the darkness only to take her place, that truly shook me to the bone.  It felt as though TPTB sprinkled some forewarning about their long cons...</p>

<p>and one of the prop guys has a sense of humor about luciferianism. advertising only works if you pay attention. if your life is about observing all the evil negative things in this world, you will quickly spiral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think it&#39;s the opposite.  I think the advertising works best on a dull mind that picks up flash, but not the reason.  Someone who believes female, black, progressive values would instantly love this video regardless of what it&#39;s actually about because, like you said, the boxes are ticked off, but with no substance.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re the ones this video is targeted to, so that people simply have a brief, black, female, smiling and dancing face to make them feel connected to the company.  I watched some reaction videos, which in itself is silly, to see reactions, and everyone just sees it from a surface level, superficial perspective, they&#39;re not diving into anything that it&#39;s actually about, just enjoying the pretty display.  Those people retain that positive brand image and become loyal customers.  </p>

<p>While yes, looking into things this deeply could quickly spiral, I think it also is freeing in a way, knowing what&#39;s going on.  Knowledge is power.  If I knew shady shit was going on, but I didn&#39;t know what the shady shit was, I&#39;d be scared. If I knew it was a wolf roaming the streets, I could prepare and feel secure.  But, if I began to think EVERYTHING was shady, and even those close to me were out to get me, then it&#39;s definitely detrimental. It goes both ways as do all things.  </p>

<p>Only if they have no awareness they are being pandered to.</p>

<p>I resist things because I know things are often hyped  to sell instead of enrich. I&#39;m sure other people are the same.</p>

<p>It works I believe with people who were raised with little sense of self &amp; they often try to define themselves thru stuff/consumerism/contrasting points of view for the sake of contrast etc... in a quest for love/recognition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely.  I felt that about my ex girlfriend honestly.  She was very... I don&#39;t want to say brainwashed, but involved in the social media/pop culture, and it very clearly affected the way she thinks.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!  I have plenty more theories about pop culture.  Including the Kardashian diamond scandal and its reference in a Taylor Swift song.  The whole controversy with Taylor Swift and Kanye stealing lyrics is connected to the Kardashian diamond scandal, going all the way back to the Grammys in 2015 with the whole &quot;I&#39;m gonna let you finish&quot; thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Taylor Swift paid some cronies to jack Kim&#39;s diamonds in France?</p>

<p>I sort of always figured the robbery was a warning to Kanye to shut his mouth</p>
</div>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is basically that they were just staged events in the first place. Taylor didn&#39;t deal the diamonds, the three of them, including others obviously, were all in on it from the beginning. I don&#39;t think any diamonds were ever stolen.  </p>

<p>Further, since the merging of the West/Kardashian brands, any same for one of them is fame for the other as well.  </p>

<p>This ties into Kanye and Taylor in Taylor&#39;s video &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; in which there are, again, two Taylor&#39;s. An evil Taylor who literally buries a cute Taylor in a grave that says &quot;HERE LIES TAYLOR SWIFT&#39;S REPUTATION.&quot;. In the next scene, the dead Taylor match cuts to be laying in a bath of diamonds.  This is a direct reference to the diamond scandal and a reference to the Taylor/Kanye lyric stealing thing.  </p>

<p>I believe that they&#39;re willingly setting themselves up for theatrics, like petty shit about stealing lyrics, so that they can just use that publicity to boost not only their own brand, but their friend&#39;s as well.  They&#39;re all friends in Hollywood, just like in politics. Hating each other is mostly just a game for fame.</p>
