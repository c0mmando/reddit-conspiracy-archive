       ‘Mackenzie, who'd just left the psychology class to use an upstairs bathroom, saw a man with a gun at the other end of the second-floor hallway. Mackenzie said she recognized him.’
"I immediately knew it was him," she said.

       First responders focused on cutting off traffic and setting up a perimeter rather than rush the building like they are trained they were ordered to not enter the building . Scot Peterson demanded everyone stay 500ft away.

       The FBI got a tip from someone close to Cruz saying he owns guns, has a desire to kill people, and may shoot up a school. This had to have been deliberately shoved under the rug because it was not their first tip. We all know about the YouTube comment where Cruz directly states he will be a school shooter. Also the Broward County Sheriff’s office displayed disgraceful criminal negligence with the handling of this kid. One caller told the sheriff's office Cruz is collecting guns and is a “school shooter in the making”
One of his peers reported he was drinking gasoline, cutting himself, and wished to purchase guns
On November 1st Cruz’s aunt called the sheriff's office “pleading” them to come recover his rifles
The Florida department of Children and Families labeled him a “vulnerable adult due to mental illness” and wants to buy a gun 
A family friend reported that Cruz has put a gun to his brothers and mothers head before which should have gotten him arrested

       Any video that contradicts the official narrative is quickly being censored by YouTube. This is unprecedented. Hour long videos and conspiracy documentaries were all over YouTube the months following sandy hook now their deleted. YouTube is in mass censorship mode after this even real student interviews have been deleted If they talk about multiple shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s these interviews where kids talk about seeing their teachers and peers shot in the head, dead, or bleeding out. They talk about it like it’s nothing. A kid in my school killed himself this year and his freshman girlfriend had to be sent to a rehab facility in cali and is diagnosed with PTSD she cuts herself and is majorly depressed.  All of his friends still sometimes have to leave school randomly in the middle of the day because they mentally break down and have to see a therapist. All the pictures of David Hogg and them smiling having a good time, knowing that their teenage friends as young as 14  were murdered. The weight something like this has on you dosnt let you eat or think of anything outside the fact that people are dead
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this propped up the most organized well articulated anti gun propaganda movement in the days following. We’re seeing nationwide protests of school, this was very well done

      <p>
       You can't make a bold claim like that and get defensive and pissy when people ask for something to back that up. It's not healthy to just believe things without evidence so asking for it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, as long as you're doing so politely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's not fair to assume that just because people don't believe you means they are close-minded.

       I get the message, but you don't explain how it's possible for fear alone to cause something to manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you mean this in the literal sense? Like if I'm afraid of being robbed that would cause someone to rob me? Or in the sense of a self-fulfilling prophesy, like if I'm afraid of failing a test I will probably be nervous and botch it up?
      </p>

       If the first, then by what mechanism does that work?

       Calling something absolute horse fuck is being dismissive. Not asking questions. That's different. You don't approach me calling something absolute horse fuck then get to demand I answer and play a victim when I don't respond to emotional retorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are afraid of being robbed and think about it often I would say you have opened yourself up to being robbed, no? If you can see so clearly that it's going to happen and are afraid and do nothing to prevent it from happening will it not happen eventually?

       Shit like magic and ghosts feel like they always fail to take certain massive, deadly, events into account: War.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's spirits and magical forces affected by massed death or (negative) emotional expression, the battlefield would be a completely different place. Sheer desperation alone would invariably weaponize any
       <em>
        actually effective
       </em>
       magic, and there's a LOT of "dying-before-their-time" going down; which according to the popular narrative results in haunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet history has no commissars sacrificing conscripts to demons/whatever for a last-ditch upper hand in the fight and the streets of Saint Petersburg (Leningrad then) aren't jam-packed with nightly congregations of the screaming dead even though some 4 million people died terribly over the course of 2.5 years...

       "manifestation" as well so it goes beyond will a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So will is "expressing the future tense" and someone/something that can see, feel, or, dare I say manifest that has incredible knowledge of things most people don't possess. Or better yet see clearly. Sorry that was for myself.

       As am I, but I don't think it matters as much in this case. Here we have an actual living suspect (unlike Sandy Hook) who we can assume is a patsy of some kind. There are more than enough, seemingly credible, witness interviews (unlike Sandy Hook) that give credence to the theory that Cruz was either not the shooter or one of many. I'm not completely dismissing the drill theory but I think following the leads in these interviews is a much easier and conclusive road to the truth.

       I do a lot of mind control research. Through the FOIA researchers obtained documents about MKUltra that the CIA thought they had destroyed. It's how the whole thing came to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       They illustrated that only two top CIA guys knew the extent of the mind control experiments because they knew
       <em>
        even the vast majority of CIA agents couldn't be trusted not to blow the whistle on treasonous acts.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't reconcile in my mind that they knew they couldn't trust other CIA agents with secrets like this, but, for reasons I don't understand, they would be comfortable trusting

       CIA doesn't value human life. Why not use real bombs, not risk getting caught and have people taking to the street demanding their heads on pikes, and keep everything (as is their M.O.) on a need-to-know basis?

       Maybe because this is the first conspiracy post relevant to me that I felt was worth commenting on? You know I'd make a whole thread proving where I live and my connection to people that know those who actually died (yes real people died, this happened) but there's crazy nuts like you that would probably track me down and threaten me or my family for being "shils) or  some shit....Im not saying the circumstances of the shooting arent sketchy but some of you on this subreddit need to get your heads out of your asses

       There's a disproportionate amount of r/conspiracy Redditors who know personally or know somebody that knows personally people killed in most of the major shootings across the country. It's really weird and I think it's a phenomenon that should be studied because statistically and intuitively almost nobody on this sub should be that close to people killed in random mass shootings all over the country. And yet 10 or more people pop up every time saying "Fuck you, my mom's cousin's former roommate knows someone who died at &lt;x shooting&gt;!"

        psyop
IDK - Even with the Sandy Hook claims that it's all actors.  If you also think this event is a staged and planned event with actors how in the hell can they contain these lies?  Let's say 100-200 people (actors) are required to maintain the lie, don't you think one person by now would have come forward and told the truth?  I personally don't know what happened but never will buy into the staged event with actors as the actual reason.  People can't keep a lie.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To take it further, lets say a couple of people who were "in" on the Sandy Hook event were told to keep quiet.  They agreed for whatever reason.  They now see this event in Florida and immediately think, oh another staged event with actors.  Don't you think they would be concerned enough to come forward and tell the wold that this is out of hand and it's all part of a lie??
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that something fishy happened in Parkland - I just don't think actors nor a staged event is the hidden reason.

       I had a realization I haven't seen anyone discuss.  I even made a post on it with no real traction.  It was confirmed all the shooter had was 10 round mags. Yet in the video you can hear shooting there were clearly more than 10 consecutive shots fired.  No reload.   I'd like to see that asked in the media

       I haven't seen anything that said he had anything other than the rifle.  Regardless, if you listen to the shots...no way he switched between weapons. There wasn't enough time.  He was someone who was mediocre at best.  Not a special forces with multiple weapons slung.  Do you know the video I'm talking of? Look at my post history.  Link is in it.  No way that was only 10 rd mags

       I never really bought that take away the guns theory. They would just declare martial law and mow over anyone who tries to resist, no matter if they would carry a bloody gun or not.

       Taking away rights is another story, though.

       It’s not taking away guns right away. It’s chipping away at our rights. And no they wouldn’t declare martial law and mow people down, it would have to be more subtle as to not start a revolution. There’s a bill trying to be passed in Minnesota now that would allow cops to enter your home and take your guns without a warrant, a “tip” is all that’s needed. They’re coming for guns and rights. It’ll just take years.

       All you have to do in the purposed bill is call the cops on your neighbor basically. I don’t think it will be passed. People talk about it around here though. The point is stuff like this is making progress and a bill like this would have been laughed out of the room a decade ago and now it has serious backers. It’s all an op that will only lead to our rights being taken away. Perhaps guns go the way of airports before the patriot act or something. Nobody wants kids being shot, however, our rights are something we need to protect. It’s all we have in a divide and conquer system. 17 dead kids from a school shooting sucks but you never hear about the 4,000 kids a year that die from texting a driving. They’re using this as a stepping stone. Don’t let them.

       I hear you man.  I was being sarcastic before but it’s ridiculous that this is even being considered. Do the people that think that such a thing can’t be used against them too?  I’m reminded of the guy that was commissioned to create the brazen bull. After he finished it and presented it to the king, the king had him put in it and the fire was lit so the builder was the first subject to be killed inside of it.

       It’s ridiculous indeed. The people who are on the side of taking away rights think that by doing this they’ll be protecting their kids. They don’t understand the underlying tones because the mainstream media is all they listen too and the “discussion on guns” is all they hear. I like your analogy.

       Not just that. Another odd thing I've noticed in the 'Let's ban guns with handles' rhetoric on fb and the MSM is that it has
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       become about school shootings. Even though there are lots of mass shootings elsewhere. It seems like when most people think "mass shooting" now, they are envisioning it happening at a school.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a little weird to me because I don't think schools are even the majority of mass shootings, and while terrible because it's mainly kids at a school, shootings elsewhere are just as terrible. But it's like people have subconsciously drawn a mental line where regular shootings are ok but school shootings are unacceptable.

       Copying and pasting a comment talking about this since you brought up Martial law, it was in response to someone talking about how the military has tanks and other highpower weaponry, and asking something along the lines "how would that play out against your semi-auto AR-15?"

       Quite badly for the US military. Illiterate goat herders with Kyber Pass AK's and HME have been playing havoc with the most technologically advanced and powerful military force in the known world. Proportionally, they have killed and maimed FAR more than any reasonable student of military power would estimate them to be capable of. I know, because I spent 3.5 years fighting them. And the average "gun nut" here in the US has far better tactical small arms than they did/do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tank and drones, you say? Sure, no AR can stand against that. But tanks can't go door to door, taking firearms. You need warm bodies with weapons to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I garuntee you 99% of the military/LEO won't do this. And the ones that do will face random and unpredictable sniper attacks, or IED's. There are thousands of Iraq/A-stan veterans like myself that have immense knowledge of IED's. Hell, I could make them now in my garage(I won't cause I don't want to go to the pen)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming the US gov't could get enough men to do this, they're going to cover the hundreds of thousands of square miles of wilderness, hills and mountain hollers? Doing what, exactly? Against some guys that have been waiting for this day there entire lives, and know the terrain like the back of their hand? That's a nightmare in the making, I saw that in A-stan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say they go the "total war" route, and just lay waste, A-10 gun-runs all up and Maple Street USA. They certainly could. Hard to stop that or Apache gunships with small arms. But they wont. Cause who wants to rule and irradiated wasteland? Cockroaches can't pay taxes. Even then, that's not a guaranteed win. The Russians tried it in the 80's in A-stan, send Hind gunships to lay waste to whole villages. Guess who won that dance? Not Ivan, that's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the true power of private ownership of weapons doesn't really lay in the power of the weapons, but the inability to bloodlessly separate the civilians from their arms. It will devolve into a bloody, endless quagmire that'll make the American Civil War of the 1860's look like a walk in the park.

       Wish the video was still on YT of the fbi or cia or people dressed like them dropping bags of stuff at the scene out of the back of a white unmarked pickup truck. I really wonder what that could have been and since when is the fbi or cia at a crime scene as the shooter is walking out talking to a blonde haired girl who said there was still shooting while she was walking ...with the shooter...?

       What is the stuff that is thrown from the truck onto the grass?  It is possible that it's a medic kit since the one office does retrieve it from the grass - but if the bag has a body it certainly looks dead and they don't seem to give a ton of attention to the contents of the bag, just more urgency to load it into the truck.

       I've seen people mention that a few times and I don't think it's suspicious for a few reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) The vest was probably given to the kid as a "just in case" measure. Call it an overprotective parent or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) If the father knew a shooting was going to happen he wouldn't have allowed the kid to go to school in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Assuming it was a kevlar vest it wouldn't do anything to protect the kid from an AR-15. He would've needed a plate carrier with at least level III+ armor plates which would be impractical to carry around at school every day.

       I think if every child has a glock, the worst that can happen is 5 dead, the rest would have whipped out their gats and popped the original instigator, where in your world, the person with the glock could just pistol whip a person with a bullet, and then everyone else has at least an 8 second delay to get their bullets.

       Yes, but it encourages collaboration. These kids aren't there in the first place to act as security guards. They are there to act as security guards AND learn important life skills. I'm just advocating making lemons from lemonade.

       I think the idea the dad gave the kid Kevlar vest is very suspicious, helping to ad credibility there was a shooting.

       How much of a burden would it be to carry around a "bulletproof"/Kevlar vest without plates? If it is something that a kid could just fold up and throw in his backpack and still have room for books and stuff, I would lean towards "just in case" measure by overprotective parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is something that is seriously bulky and a hassle to carry around on the daily, I would think something is fishy. At the very least, if it is a hassle to carry around I would expect someone to have seen it before if this kid innocently carries it around on a daily basis.

       They're two different things. A kevlar vest only protects against things like buckshot and most pistol calibers. It's light and flexible, the same thing cops wear.
      </p>
      <p>
       A plate carrier is basically a vest where you insert armored steel or ceramic plates design to stop rifle rounds. They're bulky and weigh around 20-30 pounds. If this kid came to school with one of these it would be very suspicious.

       I think we can clearly say that this was well planned and carried out . Why are they hiding this info because we are asking the right questions. Deep state at it again. Sacrifice of our children is nothing to them. They want your guns and will do anything to get the.

       "First responders focused on cutting off traffic and setting up a perimeter rather than rush the building like they are trained..."
      </p>
      <p>
       this is simply not true. at least in the case of EMTs.
      </p>
      <p>
       the first rule of first response for us is BSI scene safety. if the scene is not safe you do not leave you truck. period. otherwise you risk injury to yourself and your partner. its been a couple years since i was in the field and this may be different in the case of a mass casualty situation, but i highly doubt emts/paramedics would be following police into an unsafe situation
      </p>
      <p>
       as for other first responders such as firemen and police I cannot say. i would imagine firemen have the same rule as us.
      </p>
      <p>
       but you would think police would be storming the building.

       Did any smoke grenades go off? Why is he confessing to the shooting?  Gunshots are discombobulating and people were terrified.... if this was staged, he would be dead.

       I'm just wondering, if smoke grenades went off in the building, do you know if there would be some kind of chemical evidence, like a residue or something? Not that investigators are really all that interested in collecting that sort of evidence... and not that we would get to see the evidence even if they were interested in collecting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I think about it, there should be several pieces of evidence at the eventual trial that we should see:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The body armor he supposedly ditched somewhere
       </li>
       <li>
        The weapon he supposedly ditched somewhere
       </li>
       <li>
        Chemical residue report from smoke grenades OR undetonated smoke grenades if these were even present.
       </li>
       <li>
        Testimony from above mentioned witnesses mentioning multiple shooters and describing shooter and body armor.
       </li>
       <li>
        50-100 empty bullet casings
       </li>
       <li>
        Documentation of bullet holes from shots that missed or passed through bodies.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Something tells me, even if we get to see the trial, we won't see any of this evidence. And nobody will question it. And this comment will be voted down for even mentioning it.

       Don't think there's gonna be a trial. One of the reasons for him copping out instantly to guilty may be so that none of the evidence even needs to be presented. I don't know. Not sure.

       That raises an interesting point that I had not thought of before though. Suppose Cruz
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       some kind of agent or employee of the government... He pulls off the shooting or depending on what you believe he just gets picked up for the shooting afterwards... Then he instantly pleads guilty and disappears into the criminal justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operative word being 'disappears'. As in: how do we really know if he is rotting away in a cell somewhere or just back to work at Langley the Monday after the trial? We don't really, I guess we just have to trust the media to follow up...

       Clearly it’s important to this guy though and he’s intrigued by it so I see no harm in at least listening to what he has to say. Yeah Vegas definitely needs more attention as there’s bigger holes in the story but I don’t buy the ‘you can only focus on one thing at a time’ that people preach round here. It’s the same when people post about Clinton haha.

       you're right about the not focusing on one thing at a time thing. i just tried to look at all the parkland evidence and i couldnt come to a solid conclusion but if more evidence comes out then it will be worth looking into again. i still have loads to go through regarding vegas.

       This is actually a HUUUGGGE problem with Reddit in general. You say something "controversial" in the top subs and you will either be downvoted to hell, comment removed, or worse completely banned. It's happened to me a few times. Comment removal is the biggest problem with larger subreddits.

       It was here I got banned... But I get it, the admins of thew site contacted the mods directly so I cant even be mad, plus they did eventually unban me. I should of asked before posting the kids reddit's account but he did have a top post in r/videos last year where he doxxed himself so I thought it was ok.

       Well, the problem is no subreddit is safe. As long as there is mods there will be bias and all manners hiding the truth, even r/conspiracy. I believe there should be NO mods. Let the chips fall where they may. but that will never happen

       Because it's a false flag. There are shills out the ass here preventing it from being discussed/debunking it/making anyone who tries to bring it up look stupid/look like "children haters", "people mourn differently", "you can't believe something actually happened", etc etc etc. Same as usual.

       I think the idea the dad gave the kid Kevlar vest is very suspicious, helping to ad credibility there was a shooting.

       And yes, it’s possible someone knew Nikolas Cruz was being hired as a professional ‘fake school shooting shooter’ and decided to show up with some real ammo.

       How much of a burden would it be to carry around a "bulletproof"/Kevlar vest without plates? If it is something that a kid could just fold up and throw in his backpack and still have room for books and stuff, I would lean towards "just in case" measure by overprotective parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is something that is seriously bulky and a hassle to carry around on the daily, I would think something is fishy. At the very least, if it is a hassle to carry around I would expect someone to have seen it before if this kid innocently carries it around on a daily basis.
