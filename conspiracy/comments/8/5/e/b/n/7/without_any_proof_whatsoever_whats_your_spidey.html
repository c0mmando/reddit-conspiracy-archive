I&#39;ve always loved reading conspiracy theories even though 90% I thought were batshit.... but it seems a lot is lining up lately in various ways.....  and I just have an uneasy feeling something is coming.

I was almost 100% sure we were going to have a total financial collapse first, but upon further reflection it could happen later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under either Bush or Obama an unethical clandestine spying operation was implemented. Under Obama this lead to the creation of leading small groups for each branch of the american intelligence apparatus. These leading small groups were given priority access to all intelligence and then disseminated this information as they saw fit.</p>

<p>This would ensure that any other clandestine operations perpetrated by there leading small groups could maintain total anonymity. People like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page could operate with impunity when performing less than legal activities. My guess would be that the burner phones they used to facilitate their romance were not filtered by the leading small groups by accident, which lead to the outing of more elite black hats like Andrew McCabe.</p>

<p>On Friday at the end of the news hour he fired McCabe, giving the media just enough time to report the story without spin. Since Friday Trump has made the following claims:</p>

<p>1) McCabe was James Comey&#39;s stooge, stating that McCabe &quot;knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI&quot;.</p>

<p>2) The Mueller investigation is not only a &quot;fake news story&quot; but a legitimate distraction as &quot;there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice &amp; State.&quot;</p>

<p>3) That James Comey lied under oath, and that McCabe was being bought out through his wife.</p>

<p>Remember, you can&#39;t spell TREASON without REASON.</p>
