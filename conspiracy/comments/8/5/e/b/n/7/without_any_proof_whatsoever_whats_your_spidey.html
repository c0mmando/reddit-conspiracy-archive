       I agree.  I've always loved reading conspiracy theories even though 90% I thought were batshit.... but it seems a lot is lining up lately in various ways.....  and I just have an uneasy feeling something is coming.  What it is I don't know, but it just feels it will be a game changer in some way.

       The sixth seal includes a massive caldera eruption (Yellowstone?) and the wind being stopped (to prevent the sky clearing from the sooty aftermath), so that looks like it. I was almost 100% sure we were going to have a total financial collapse first, but upon further reflection it could happen later.

       Under either Bush or Obama an unethical clandestine spying operation was implemented. Under Obama this lead to the creation of leading small groups for each branch of the american intelligence apparatus. These leading small groups were given priority access to all intelligence and then disseminated this information as they saw fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would ensure that any other clandestine operations perpetrated by there leading small groups could maintain total anonymity. People like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page could operate with impunity when performing less than legal activities. My guess would be that the burner phones they used to facilitate their romance were not filtered by the leading small groups by accident, which lead to the outing of more elite black hats like Andrew McCabe.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Friday at the end of the news hour he fired McCabe, giving the media just enough time to report the story without spin. Since Friday Trump has made the following claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) McCabe was James Comey's stooge, stating that McCabe "knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI".
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Mueller investigation is not only a "fake news story" but a legitimate distraction as "there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice &amp; State."
      </p>
      <p>
       3) That James Comey lied under oath, and that McCabe was being bought out through his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, you can't spell TREASON without REASON.

       Trump, Obama &amp; Clintons are just puppets while the unelected deep state pushes for profitable war/occupations on the backs of taxpayers.

       All our media channels are feeding us propaganda promoting horizontal hostility to keep us from forming closer unified bonds which would lead to leaders that organically rise as challengers to the current direction someone or something is leading us in.

       Let me start off by saying that I think Trump is an awful president and terrible human being. Honestly you will probably never hear me say anything positive about this scumbag. But think we might be in to deep with Twitler now. If we remove him I think it might actually cause a war with Russia. But I also kinda think that there are enough congressman and senators that are compromised that Trump might be safe. That's just my impression.

       Hillary or whoever was backing her wanted a war with Russia. All this 'Russia hacked our election' and spy stuff along with a lot of other things in the coming years will be used as justification for war when Trump is out of office. Whether it will be a proxy war in Syria and Ukraine or an all-out war I don't know.

       Those that created us have been overthrown by those who were assigned to watch us.  Now it is a complete circle-jerk and nobody knows very much of anything - not for the past several hundreds years or so.  One thing is certain:  those that created us will be back, and it is not a good thing for those that were assigned to watch us.  They know this, but cannot stop the in-fighting.
