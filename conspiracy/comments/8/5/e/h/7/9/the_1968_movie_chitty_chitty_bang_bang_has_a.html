       This is one of the only movies I've seen that blatantly shows elites desire to kidnap children. Was the movie trying to tell us something? Movie reviews of the period were not that positive.  Interesting the fictional country was Bavarian, is there any local legends of an evil ruling class kidnapping kids?

       The child catcher wasn't in the book, he was added for the film. So Fleming had nothing to do with it.

       Because it's a movie. You can put fucked up stuff in books/movies. You just can't be explicit with it. Snozzberries for example was a dick joke, but it was obscure British slang used by gay men so not a lot of people got it until years later.

       After reading his autobiography it seems he was victim of abuse, implied sexually, at boarding schools in England and that he really prized the innocence of childhood and disdained the corrupt abusive systems / people who rose to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's trying his best to get a warning out to children about how monsters are real.

       Dahl wasn't spying against the Germany, If I remember correctly he was part of the British MI6 effort based in Canada that infiltrated news corporations in NYC and lobbied US politicians.  His job was to propagandize Americans to support a war against Germany.  Some of my family are Germans, why the hell should they fight Germany?

       I highly doubt that he was aware of any of these conspiracies that are still mostly conjecture. Large industries funded both sides of the war. Steel, petrol, and bankers. That doesn't mean Britain created the Nazis.

        's banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen; who was a financial backer of the Nazi party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917)[4] classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman's operations in New York City.

       So an insider allowed Wallstreet to profit off of German companies up until 3 years before America joined the war so therefore Britain created the Nazis?

       Like the Bavarian illuminati? Started by Adam Weishaupt who was educated by the Jesuits...
Years ago when i started to learn about the satanic elite, i remembered "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"  and the kids in cages.  I didn't realize they were stealing them for a King in Bavaria!!!

       I mean read the book or watch the film, all the kids but Charlie die essentially, it's also sort of implied he adds them to the candy and eats them in the book. I could probably come up with some more though, haven't watched or read them in a while, the snozzberries always stuck with me though.

       I also haven't seen the film in years, but have probably seen it 50 times at least. Btw, all the
       <em>
        shitty
       </em>
       kids die, and the bad parents are sent on their way in a flippant manner - which I love. Not sure if he adds the dead kids to the candy, but I supposed it could be implied in spots more if I watched it again.

       The Slugworth angle is great too, vetting each ticket winner by tempting them to sell the everlasting gobstopper recipe, testing for loyalty, or are they a cheap sellout. All in all, a pretty wholesome message in the end, and a fierce one at that.

       The book. You are remembering it too dark; not that it wasn't dark for a childs tale.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even a (black and white) picture in the book of the different kids. Veronica the Blueberry girl stays blue for example; they juice her but can't remove the color.

       Also.....the two movies and the book put together .....all three have some weird variations as to how they end. None of the three end exactly the same way.

       I like the one i saw as a kid best with gene wilder. The johnny depp version was much darker and less fun. Cant remember the book as good but it was also dark.

       I just got finished reading "Boy" his sorta autobiography to my kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talks about being stuck in these boarding schools and how much the head masters LOVED to paddle their bare bottoms. Some of the scenes are described with blatant sexual imagery about filling his pipe over and over again as he paddled a boy until he bled. It's really kinda gruesome. Then towards the end he mentions that this real person who was obsessed with paddling young boys rose high in the Vatican and was close to the pope at some point and how he felt it was "very strange that someone like him could rise to such power" with such a nasty side to him and how hypocritical it is, and it even seems he implies that he knows something more about how the abuse might be why...
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find much of it online I'd have to find the chapters in the book itself.

       It's pretty whimsical and the only dark parts are really to do with those few scenes where they get unnecessarily paddled. There's only one scene towards the end that's mentioned as a side note of something "he heard" that happened. It was a good read for a kid since it has a lot of incredible accounts of life in the early 1900s and how different things were and how highly motivated he and his family were for great things. Pretty inspiring.

       As far as the Vulgarians/Bavarian choice I think that was due to English dislike of those countries oust world war 2 leading into the Cold War since the film was all English written and the timeline fits. They frequently depicted foreigners and monarchs especially as murderers and child predators during wartime propaganda and it's likely leftover from that.

       What's interesting is supposedly the child snatcher character wasn't in the book, but was added to the movie. Inside hollywood symbolism, adding the child catcher angle to their family movie?

       For some reason I loved that movie as a kid but I always looked away during the child catcher scenes. Something about it is so fucked up. Made me so uncomfortable and even now as an adult just thinking about him is making me super uneasy. Probably gonna go watch that one scene on YouTube now though.

       or another angle... it's like in the 30s, how spinning stories about "great train robberies", Dillinger, ma barker, etc effectively slides the focus off the real robbers of that era, aka bankers who fiance those kinds of silly bat-man capers.   Maybe look into who's pushed stories about "lone" pedofile deviants, the Hannibal lector type fictions that appropriately slide the narrative in parallel angle.

        's banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen; who was a financial backer of the Nazi party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917)[4] classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman's operations in New York City.
