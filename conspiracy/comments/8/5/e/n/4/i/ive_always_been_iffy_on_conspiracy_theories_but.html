       Tells me that a lot of information presented in this sub is factual. Anyone who has been on this sub longer than 6 months knows there is a conscious effort being made on this sub to suppress specific info. Specific (Hillary) posts immediately get downvoted which seems suspicious in a sub called conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Update: 36% downvote on this Conspiracy in the subreddit "Conspiracy"... seems unusual.

       Because conspiracies about Hillary are immediately dismissed, which was never the case. This sub used to discuss every CONSPIRACY with a open mind. but now people try super hard to discredit certain posts.

       The emphasis is on the word skeptical. By definition, a true skeptic cannot have a bias at all. Discussing every conspiracy with an open mind is literally being skeptical.

       This specific statement I'm about to make is very difficult to express here because of the apparent paradox that I don't understand: I simultaneously dislike HRC and have no desire to ever see another thing about her. So I downvote them. I don't think there's massive brigade happening, it's just that a lot of people can't understand anyone who has these simultaneous beliefs.

       I think a lot of people push back on the HRC narratives because thy got sick of how conspiracies were being weaponized politically. To me this is really the start of the abuse of this sub. Sure there are a lot of legitimate things to discuss about her but for two years it was more than that. Mean while we weren't allowed to talk about Trump or Roger Stone's shadiness with out being called an shill. This sub became a disinformation hub for the Trump campaign. Now like the boy who cried wolf (and usually with sketchy evidence) nobody wants to listen anymore.

       You were allowed to talk about it and anybody can call you out for that if they like. It's different than insta-banning people based on web-analytics. HRC is essential because of the global connections she has and because there never has been a better chance to strike corruption worldwide then today when they are all implicated by one another in one way or the other. People are really superficial and unimaginative sadly.

       Anything criticizing Trump until recently was immediately downvoted to oblivion and anyone challenging his narrative was labeled a shareblue shill. I never saw insta-banning here?? It's so ironic that you and everyone else were so afraid of HRC's ability to bot and control the internet when there is heaping piles of evidence that Russian, Kushner and Cambridge Analytics were and probably are doing much more sophisticated stuff. I suspect like almost all Trumpian conspiracy narratives that it's and intentional form of gas lighting.

       What was unimaginative was how so many people on this sub were so blind to how what a corrupt grifting militaristic piece of shit Trump was.

       Yes Reddit has Instabans which don't require you to actually post anything. I  also get site-wide ten-minute cooldowns between comments in less controversial subs. But fwiw I can still see vote-manipulation going on here so I really don't know why you're talking about it like it's a thing of the past. I also don't know why you bring Cambridge Analytics into it because they were just datamining for the election. It's not like they run social media, they only had read-access to databases. If you are looking at changed content, Spez' editing spree of conservative viewpoints may be a culprit.

       Also everyone gets cooldowns. It's precisely to stop bots. I've never heard of instabans. Do you have proof?

       One comment that they could prove. Why do you think he broke the law in the first place?
       <br/>
       I get it that new contributors get certain limits - but what was new even for me is that they started instituting site-wide bans where you don't just get a cooldown for one sub but for several - but not all.
       <br/>
       And XXChromosomes instabans new contributors based on prior subscriptions most likely.

       Do you know the implications of Reddit post no longer being provable as unaltered means?  Think of Stonetear and what was posted.  Now any reddit post can no longer be considered trustworthy because of the implications of admin changing posts.  I think that is the real story.

       The above are examples of possible collusion between the Trump campaign team and Russia. Here's a good overview of the dossier, which illustrates the connection between it and the above link:

       r/TopMindsOfReddit, a 70k subscriber sub, are responsible for most, perhaps all of the manipulation over on r/conspiracyundone and are very present here.  These people have harassed my good friend polkadotgirl into deleting her account.  They are systematic and coordinated.  They all pretty much say the same stuff and exhibit similar behaviors.  They will label you alt-right or a Nazi when it is completely untrue.

       She was sold as in perfect health by the media.
       <br/>
       She now has had 4 major falls:
       <br/>
       1. 2012 when she hit her head.
       <br/>
       2. The 911 fall.
       <br/>
       3.  6 months ago she broke her toe
4. This week she nearly falls down stairs, then falls in the shower and breaks her wrist.

       Doesn't need to be discussed here, but it could be argued that it was a conspiracy to keep her deteriorating health secret from the public.  She was to be president and was passing out in public.  I love when Joe Rogan talks about that, and how it was like his 70 year old grandma wanting to run for office..."grandma, you can't even stand up on a hot day...you can't be president"

       The downvotes for the Clinton stuff is because she has no damn power anymore. Why would you worry about a no power ex politician when the shitbag in the Whitehouse is running the biggest con game in history. Yes they are both corrupt as hell but only one has his finger on the nuke button at the moment. I would suggest that matter is a little more pressing.

       Also what Hillary posts get buried? There's post about her on the front page all the fucking time. How's she's a Satanist, pedophile, deep state god. I don't see any conspiracy about her that's downvoted right away. Hell her slipping down some steps made the front page the other day. Like this old ass lady falling is news any more.

       There's probably some brigading, but I would also say that the thrice-daily low effort meta complaint posts are also becoming tiresome to a large proportion of the user base, myself included. Except for the ones that present an evidenced package of research on, say, weird user accounts or abnormal patterns. Those are genuinely interesting.

       I think a conspiracy theorist's default mode should be skepticism.  There's a lot of crazy out there.  The evidence should be able to carry the story on its own.  Back before the internet you needed pictures, declassified documents, eyewitness testimony or something tangible to underpin the claims.  Now people are making shit up out of thin air with nothing backing up their claims.

       How about....maybe...nobody but partisan Trump hacks even gives a fuck about her anymore?

       Only posters from The_Donald make anti-Hillary submissions now, everyone else has moved on, or just does not give a fuck about a 2-time loser of a Presidential candidate anymore because she's irrelevant to the vast majority.
