<blockquote>
<p>Trump signaled the use of “Crosscheck” when he claimed the election is “rigged” because “people are voting many, many times.”  His operative Kobach, who also advised Trump on building a wall on the southern border, devised a list of 7.2 million “potential” double voters—1.1 million of which were removed from the voter rolls by Tuesday. The list is loaded overwhelmingly with voters of color and the poor. Here&#39;s a sample of the list . . .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Federal Court made it clear that the DNC hadn&#39;t been conducting themselves appropriately.  The case was dismissed because the Judge concluded that it was outside the scope of the court, but it was made clear that their methods were less than honorable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Court continued, “For their part, the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have characterized the DNC charter’s promise of ‘impartiality and evenhandedness’ as a mere political promise—political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts. <strong>The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.</strong>”</p>

<p>The order reaffirmed that regardless of whether the primaries were tipped in Hilary Clinton’s favor, the Court’s authority to intervene based on the allegations of the kind set forth in the plaintiff’s complaint is limited at best.</p>

<p>“This Order therefore concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>Jared Beck, one of the leading attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit told The Observer, “The standard governing the motion to dismiss requires the Court to accept all well-pled allegations as true for purposes of deciding the motion. Thus, the Court recited the allegations of the Complaint that it was required to accept as true, and in so doing, acknowledged that the allegations were well pled. Indeed, if you look at the if you look at the Complaint, you will see that all of these allegations accepted by the Court specifically rely on cite materials that are readily available in the public record, and they support the inference that the DNC and the DWS rigged the primaries.”</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of this.  I never said anything about a trial.  Saying it never went to trial  over and over again when I never said it did is a strawman argument.   You&#39;re  arguing against an argument I never made.  Over and over.   It&#39;s hilarious.   Worst attorney ever. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here - the DNC&#39;s attorney&#39;s made a very aggressive argument on standing. They argued that the DNC could select their own candidate if they wanted to (no candidate has any legal right to sue). The Judge found that argument to be too aggressive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.   The Judge heard plenty. ON STANDING,  but he still heard it,  from the DNC themselves.</p>

<p>He had to dismiss the case, (with no trial... had to say that so you wouldn&#39;t start saying it endlessly as if I didn&#39;t understand) because it wasn&#39;t under his jurisdiction.  But,  before he did,  <strong>he had this to say about everything he had heard, from the DNC themselves, over the several previous months</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For their part, the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have characterized the DNC charter’s promise of ‘impartiality and evenhandedness’ as a mere political promise—political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts. The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To that,  you respond, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what happened. That doesn&#39;t mean the Judge heard evidence and decided that&#39;s what the DNC actually did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re  correct. The funny thing is that you want his statement completely ignored. He said plainly,  </p>

<p>&quot;The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles&quot;.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t preside over a trial,  but he can certainly come to his own opinion,  which is that despite his inability to do anything about it,  the DNC violated their charter. </p>

<p>So,  it isn&#39;t a &quot;finding under a court of law&quot; due to the dismissal due to jurisdiction,  but the judge said what he said, and did indeed make certain it was known that he wasn&#39;t pleased with the actions of the DNC.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a deplorable mess and the lack of continuance doesn&#39;t mean it magically never occurred, it just means that it wasn&#39;t established in a court of law. </p>

<p>Actual Reality isn&#39;t determined by what a court of law ascertains. Saying, &quot;it didn&#39;t happen because a court of law didn&#39;t find that to be the case&quot; only works in the Universe of Law and is hilariously narrow minded.</p>

<p>Out here in the real world,  folks don&#39;t need an obvious theft to be declared one formally by a court in order to recognize that a theft has occurred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re dedicated for being so uninformed. And fyi, that statement isn&#39;t the judges &quot;closing Statements,&quot; it&#39;s from the order and accompanying written opinion dismissing the case. So not only is this distinction you&#39;re trying to draw irrelevant, but it&#39;s to something that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>What happens when a judge dismisses a case? What&#39;s the burden of proof? Does a judge evaluate any of the merits of the claim?</p>

<p>I think what you&#39;ll find if you spend any time investigating that question is that, for the purposes of a motion to dismiss:</p>

<p>1) All allegations are assumed to be true for the basis of evaluating the legal basis for the claim.
2) No evidence is presented.
3) The only &quot;standard of proof&quot; is Twombal, which requires just enough information to make out the skeleton of a complaint when that information is assumed to be true (see #1)</p>

<p>The complaint was dismissed, meaning there was no discovery or evidence available when the order was written. Therefore, that statement is one of two things:</p>

<p>1) An unevidenced, and theferefore purely political, opinion. No better than that of a CNN talking head or a random person on the train.</p>

<p>2) A rote acknowledgement of allegations in the claim as true <em>as is required for all motions to dismiss</em> while dismissing them for not forming the basis of any legal claim (#3 above). </p>

<p>Neither option is in any way an acknowledgement that the allegations are true in reality. </p>

<p>This is either Judge Zloch giving an opinion in the most literal sense of that word, or Zloch saying something along the lines of &quot;<em>even if</em> the DNC broke it&#39;s charter&quot; or [insert talking point here] and everything in the complaint is true, there is insufficient legal basis for those claims (FYI, option two in some variation is pretty common in these orders). Personally, I&#39;d wager it&#39;s a combination of both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, You&#39;re intentionally gaslighting readers here. </p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about this:
&quot;In evaluating Plaintiffs’ claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are true&quot;</p>

<p>Everything you say about THAT statement is true,  but you&#39;re  intentionally conflating it with what I&#39;m discussing,  which are the words of the judge himself :</p>

<pre><code>&gt;The Court **does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles**. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.
</code></pre>

<p>He&#39;s making it clear that they were rigging the primaries, despite his legal inability to do anything about it.</p>

Why did they cancel exit polls halfway through the primary. Why did Sanders win 12 out of 15 caucuses? Because caucuses are harder to rig, though they did a nice job suppressing the vote in Nevada.
