He ran, and didn't get enough votes.

       Also, as Greg Palast says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump signaled the use of “Crosscheck” when he claimed the election is “rigged” because “people are voting many, many times.”  His operative Kobach, who also advised Trump on building a wall on the southern border, devised a list of 7.2 million “potential” double voters—1.1 million of which were removed from the voter rolls by Tuesday. The list is loaded overwhelmingly with voters of color and the poor. Here's a sample of the list . . .

      <p>
       Anyone who thinks that MSM is simply 'against Trump' ought to ask why this story doesn't make MSM.
      </p>

       This proves with absolute certainty that getting Donald Trump out is not the highest priority of MSM.

       A Federal Court made it clear that the DNC hadn't been conducting themselves appropriately.  The case was dismissed because the Judge concluded that it was outside the scope of the court, but it was made clear that their methods were less than honorable.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Court continued, “For their part, the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have characterized the DNC charter’s promise of ‘impartiality and evenhandedness’ as a mere political promise—political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts.
        <strong>
         The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.
        </strong>
        ”
       </p>
       <p>
        The order reaffirmed that regardless of whether the primaries were tipped in Hilary Clinton’s favor, the Court’s authority to intervene based on the allegations of the kind set forth in the plaintiff’s complaint is limited at best.
       </p>
       <p>
        “This Order therefore concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Jared Beck, one of the leading attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit told The Observer, “The standard governing the motion to dismiss requires the Court to accept all well-pled allegations as true for purposes of deciding the motion. Thus, the Court recited the allegations of the Complaint that it was required to accept as true, and in so doing, acknowledged that the allegations were well pled. Indeed, if you look at the if you look at the Complaint, you will see that all of these allegations accepted by the Court specifically rely on cite materials that are readily available in the public record, and they support the inference that the DNC and the DWS rigged the primaries.”

      <p>
       This quote is from Federal Judge William Zloch's CLOSING STATEMENTS. He was dismissing the case only because the case didn't fall underneath the Court's Jurisdiction.  This was at the END of the proceedings.   **He was acknowledging  that the DNC violated their charter, and that he wasn't  pleased about it, despite his inability  to do anything about it due to the case not bring under their jurisdiction.

        Here - the DNC's attorney's made a very aggressive argument on standing. They argued that the DNC could select their own candidate if they wanted to (no candidate has any legal right to sue). The Judge found that argument to be too aggressive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly.   The Judge heard plenty. ON STANDING,  but he still heard it,  from the DNC themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had to dismiss the case, (with no trial... had to say that so you wouldn't start saying it endlessly as if I didn't understand) because it wasn't under his jurisdiction.  But,  before he did,
       <strong>
        he had this to say about everything he had heard, from the DNC themselves, over the several previous months
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For their part, the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have characterized the DNC charter’s promise of ‘impartiality and evenhandedness’ as a mere political promise—political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts. The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To that,  you respond,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That doesn't mean that's what happened. That doesn't mean the Judge heard evidence and decided that's what the DNC actually did.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're  correct. The funny thing is that you want his statement completely ignored. He said plainly,
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles".
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't preside over a trial,  but he can certainly come to his own opinion,  which is that despite his inability to do anything about it,  the DNC violated their charter.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  it isn't a "finding under a court of law" due to the dismissal due to jurisdiction,  but the judge said what he said, and did indeed make certain it was known that he wasn't pleased with the actions of the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a deplorable mess and the lack of continuance doesn't mean it magically never occurred, it just means that it wasn't established in a court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual Reality isn't determined by what a court of law ascertains. Saying, "it didn't happen because a court of law didn't find that to be the case" only works in the Universe of Law and is hilariously narrow minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out here in the real world,  folks don't need an obvious theft to be declared one formally by a court in order to recognize that a theft has occurred.

       The quote is from Federal Judge William Zloch's CLOSING STATEMENTS. He was dismissing the case only because the case didn't fall underneath the Court's Jurisdiction.  This was at the END of the proceedings.   He was acknowledging  that the DNC violated their charter, despite his inability  to do anything about it due to the case not bring under their jurisdiction.

       Do you have any idea what information is actually in a complaint? Here's a hint, it's almost never "evidence" in a way that you'd normally understand that word. Nah, just bare allegations, however well pled to survive routine motions to dismiss (which, this one didn't)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what you're saying then is that "Federal Judge William Zloch" is expressing his opinion, based on allegations lacking any evidence, and that therefore his credentials render that opinion into well-evidenced fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) That's absurd.
2) A cursory Google search shows that Zloch seems to be well-known for his judicial activism. I think that makes his personal opinion all the more irrelevant.

       You're dedicated for being so uninformed. And fyi, that statement isn't the judges "closing Statements," it's from the order and accompanying written opinion dismissing the case. So not only is this distinction you're trying to draw irrelevant, but it's to something that doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when a judge dismisses a case? What's the burden of proof? Does a judge evaluate any of the merits of the claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you'll find if you spend any time investigating that question is that, for the purposes of a motion to dismiss:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) All allegations are assumed to be true for the basis of evaluating the legal basis for the claim.
2) No evidence is presented.
3) The only "standard of proof" is Twombal, which requires just enough information to make out the skeleton of a complaint when that information is assumed to be true (see #1)
      </p>
      <p>
       The complaint was dismissed, meaning there was no discovery or evidence available when the order was written. Therefore, that statement is one of two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) An unevidenced, and theferefore purely political, opinion. No better than that of a CNN talking head or a random person on the train.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) A rote acknowledgement of allegations in the claim as true
       <em>
        as is required for all motions to dismiss
       </em>
       while dismissing them for not forming the basis of any legal claim (#3 above).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither option is in any way an acknowledgement that the allegations are true in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is either Judge Zloch giving an opinion in the most literal sense of that word, or Zloch saying something along the lines of "
       <em>
        even if
       </em>
       the DNC broke it's charter" or [insert talking point here] and everything in the complaint is true, there is insufficient legal basis for those claims (FYI, option two in some variation is pretty common in these orders). Personally, I'd wager it's a combination of both.

       I admire your effort, but it’s futile trying to say Bernie got shafted on this sub. You’re going against a bunch of trump lovers and people that evidently think the dnc can do no wrong. There’s practically no room for Bernie love here anymore. Doesn’t matter Clinton completely bankrolled the dnc and they showed preferential treatment to her from the very beginning. I know this place is a t_d haven, but when there’s also people adamantly defending the dnc and their actions during the election it just reminds me that this place is filled with r/politics people too. Guys like Bernie and Rob Paul used to be what this sub was all about, especially when putting them up against a Clinton.

       Bernie--the 5-minute Democrat--shafted himself by ignoring Black voters. Then people cry conspiracy when he lost. Not that hard to figure out.

       Sanders votes were either thrown out on provisional ballots or wiped away through hacked election machines through fractional vote thieving. Why did they cancel exit polls halfway through the primary. Why did Sanders win 12 out of 15 caucuses? Because caucuses are harder to rig, though they did a nice job suppressing the vote in Nevada.  Have you done any research on this or are you just believing what CNN and NBC and BBC tell you? Clearly you are spouting uninformed crap.

       Voter fraud has existed forever. I remember the 90s when states were claiming that dead people registered and voted in local and national elections. This is nothing new and Trump was just playing the usual games of the past. He doesn’t realize we are light years ahead of those games now and are playing games he couldn’t comprehend.

       I think when using a situation to build grounds on hiw people should feel is smart. Its called precedent in law. Since no one cares America rigged the primary and defrauded people, why should we care Russia did it. You can't beat your wife then get mad when your neighbor beats his wife.
