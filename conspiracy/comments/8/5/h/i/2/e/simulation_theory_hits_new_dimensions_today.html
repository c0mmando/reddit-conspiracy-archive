       The AskReddit sub can be considered a barometer for surveys of interest to get a pulse on widespread experience on the reddit going population set. The submissions there are often of the mundane 'expose all your deepest secrets in semi-anonymous fashion'. The usual dossier-building topics used to augment social media for marketing or intel purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can often be used in reverse to gain insight on what topics are suddenly of interest to corporate research projects. For example, "Oh, hey! This week they really want to know about wide mix of economy and foreign relations topics. Must be a political year."

         We're in a wild period of history at the moment where technology breakthroughs are at an ever escalating pace on the way to the singularity, if one were to prescribe to Ray Kurzweil futurology theory.

         Research developments in technology are by practice kept hidden in locked vaults for many fields. It's more profitable to treat than cure. Nuclear weapons put in reach of government the power to destroy all life, future advances puts power to destroy all life at reach of the individual. What is the dumbest thing you've ever seen an individual do?

       The conditions are right for those with the all-access-pass to boundaries of human knowledge to play the high-stakes Manhattan Project cards. They probed a damn dimension. Insert you favorite installment of Doom, Seven Monkies, or other movies playing off alternate realities.

       An old abandoned house appeared out of nowhere on my property in rural TN and then disappeared without a trace the next day when I went back to photograph. This is way back in the woods, no roads... and somewhere I knew like the back of my hand. One of the weirdest experiences of my life.

       I was living in city A for 3 years of my life. Working at city B. The distance between these cities is a 2 hour drive (one way). And so I'd drive a total of four hours every day back and forth. Now, I've struggled with sleep pattern issues my entire life. Which is the reason I now work from home and at my own hours. However back then I wasn't so fortunate, and very heavily depended on the job. So I'd force myself to go to work every day. Countless times however I'd be so brutally, incomprehensibly tired, that I'd fall asleep behind the wheel. Countless, innumerable times this happened. And yet always, without exception I'd manage to wake up just in time to pull my car back into the lane. It still baffles me that I did that. But I did. The fear of losing my job was greater than that of losing my own life or becoming quadraplegic. However I believe I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       i n fact die or get heavily injured. Countless times. But my consciousness propagated down the timeline where I just barely manage. This is quantum immortality at play. It's not luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion from this is, we are each as conscious observers the center of our universe. Nobody is 'real' in the same sense that you are real. Why are you here then? I don't know the answer to that but I think there's something for me to learn. This together with flat earth reality really makes you realise why atheism was completely out of the question for any peoples and cultures throughout the ages until jesuit conspirators came along with their materialist bullshit science and freemasonic lies designed to mold the profane into a subservient slave class that does nothing but fuck, work and consume.

       Interesting perspective on the quantum immortality hypothesis. I had something similar happen back in 2015. The events that happened then don't add up. It would sound crazy to most people but I don't think it's impossible that I died in that other reality and carried on in this one. Maybe it is crazy but I'm willing to consider it.

       Dumb as fuck post. IMO. Takes space up on the front page, and while we could debate real shit, we talk about things we have no business speaking on because it's all theory. Not only is it all hypothesis, its like all the Steven Hawking quotes, while inspirational, they do nothing to expand true knowledge of the universe. Oh, and that video of the plane at a dead stop? Wow a 94 Sony hand held took a shitty grainy video and you found a way to perfectly edit it cuz its fucking 2018 and you can do that now? Yea Im sure thats real..... Am I being a buzz kill? No? ok good.

       I dont know about a singular event, where ''one'' thing happened...but  for me (because this has happened so many times throughout my life, to not only me, but other people around me that have been there when it happened) the weirdest ''glitch'' i can think of would have to be when you drop something, and it dissapears.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lost things by dropping them on the ground countless times. I can think of 10 times throughout my life where something was dropped, and me or someone else literally moved everything out of the room, and spent over an hour looking, even upon moving out of the space, it was still never found.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had this happen with things that i put somewhere also, but i feel dropping them and them disappearing is a far more certain glitch that almost everyone has had happen to them, because it disappears right in front of you after you drop it.  With the times i've lost stuff by placing it somewhere, theres no 100% guarantee that nobody picked it up and did something with it--that you can prove at least.

       Hah. Had this happen with part of the top of a water filter. It dropped off and instinctively moved to catch it with a foot, missing slightly and having it scatter across the room. The flap clipped into it was gone. No place under a counter for it to go. Not under or around the fridge. Not to be found in any of the cabinets or cupboards. Just gone. Very interested to find out if it shows back up when moving.
