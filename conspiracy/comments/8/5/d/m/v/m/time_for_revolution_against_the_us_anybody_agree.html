       Cleaning the DOJ is prereq.  Intel and FBI agencies clearly rogue of justice.  Shedding sycophants.  IG report comng. More will be purged.  Ongoing action.  More than just "complaining going on".

       idk. stalin did purges all the time, but his system and its 'values' remained untouched even after his death. changing nameplates on office doors is not exactly whats needed. americas problems are often not even rooted in america, but international, cosmopolitan business interests.

       I agree it is time for a revolution but not a violent revolution. We must have individual revolutions making the old systems of control obsolete.

       There was a chatter in the waves a couple months ago about Trump being the last president, and I want it to be true. The main reason, I don't think the job of president should exist anymore. It seems like that kind of position, even with checks and balances is too much consolidated power and presence.

       Media-approved, astroturfed protest movements are not meaningful revolution, resistance, or anything worth thinking about.  Even something as mild as Bernie's social-democratic reformist agenda was suppressed and kept from going too far or asking too much, and that was known to be a sheepdogging operation.

       Weinstein stopped making enough money to silence women.  Everyone in Hollywood knew what was happening, and the whole business is full of Harvey Weinsteins from top to bottom.  You'd have to be crazy to think that something suddenly changed in 2017, or that TPTB are going to seriously give up that kind of power.

       Oh, you're talking about the pussyhat march?  What actual thing changed from that?  I laughed when I saw that hot garbage, as did many women on the left who saw it for what it was - an attempt to build a Clintonite echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will just repeat - if something is about actually changing anything, the media won't cover it.  The media loved covering Trumpism and coddling his fashy supporters, which is why they kept shoving Trump's senile face on the television screen.  Trumpism doesn't change anything, but he sure put together rallies of fucking morons.  Clinton was so awful, she couldn't even do that, so the media had to work extra hard to pretend anyone actually wanted her aside from rich people and party cronies.  Meanwhile, half of the country rightly sees the election as a farce and refuses to participate, and most who do at least know they're not getting anything out of it.

       You just demonstrated the point of my original comment, while also showing a lot about yourself.  All of the below info will be completely wasted on you (a lot like facts, I bet) - but I share it for anyone who may
       <em>

       be interested:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since the 2016 election, more than 26,000 women have contacted Emily’s List, a national organization that supports pro-choice Democratic women, to say they were considering running for office. (The previous election cycle brought only 920.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Cambridge saw a record number of women run for City Council; the second highest vote-getter was 29-year-old Sumbul Siddiqui, whose family emigrated from Pakistan when she was 2, and who became the first Muslim woman elected in the city. Turnout leapt 26 percent, and many more younger voters than usual showed up at the polls.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Framingham, which changed its form of government from a town to a city, voters rejected as their first mayor a white man who had long operated the levers of Beacon Hill politics. Instead, they chose Yvonne Spicer, a black woman executive for the Boston Museum of Science who had previously run only for town meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the start of the new year, when a group of celebrities announced a new initiative aimed at fighting sexual harassment, pay disparity, and discrimination, they didn’t confine their work to Hollywood. They started a legal defense fund for individual women to wage legal claims and invited farm workers, housekeepers, and other women to tap into it. The fund has already raised more than $16 million.

       Yes we need a reworking of the government an the statement you made is true. Going about it would mean civil war or somehow unite the masses into making It happen. I'm not isis btw but completely agree our government needs overthrown/remodeled.

       People, always remember your voting history is logged. If you dig into your user page on here, you can find all the posts you up or downvoted. That means this data is 100% available to anyone with permission to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       My pet theory is that is the data reddit makes its money on. Any which way, posts like these will certainly flag you, if you upvote them. I actually upvote every single thing i see to keep from making patterns.

       Media-approved, astroturfed protest movements are not meaningful revolution, resistance, or anything worth thinking about.  Even something as mild as Bernie's social-democratic reformist agenda was suppressed and kept from going too far or asking too much, and that was known to be a sheepdogging operation.
