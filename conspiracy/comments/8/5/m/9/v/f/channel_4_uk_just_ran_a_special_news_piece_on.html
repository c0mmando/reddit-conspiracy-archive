<p>I think there will be a lot of discussion on Twitter about this if you search Cambridge Analytica. It was a pretty interesting programme. Whether this is all a smokescreen for something bigger, who knows. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see if anything comes to fruition because I watched enough House of cards to know nothing changes at the end. </p>

<p>I highly doubt anyone in their right mind is going to come forward they been getting blackmailed by CA...since they might sink their reputation or worse get killed :(</p>

<p>This was early on during the campaign/first year. This was when there was the infinity_engine account was steady chugging and accounts like that. It was literally non stop cross posts and things alike.</p>

<p>RecoveringGrace is a new mod, so I’m really not like pointing any fingers at them. Just was asking .</p>

<p>It’s just sort of funny that nothing was ever said about what was going on, but when big stuff drops pertaining to a certain side. That same side is quick to call brigades.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that this was the work of communists... Russia hasn&#39;t been communist for a while. Instead they are currently being led by an oligopoly of some of the wealthiest people the world has ever seen. If you want to say that ascribing actions in the world as being due to the influence of a wealthy elite cabal is ridiculous, then you&#39;re going to have to write of just about every single post in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try not to be too hard on people for buying the story. People are busy and never seem to read past the headlines. In theory - they SHOULD be able to trust the news to report the truth on something like this but I think between the repetitive onslaught of Russia! stories over the past year (longer really.. but especially the past year) + the fact that they&#39;ve (brilliantly) managed to tie people&#39;s hatred of Trump to this stuff makes it much more convenient for people to accept it willingly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty frustrating whenever the topic comes up but if you can atleast make people pause and think about it, I consider it somewhat of a win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do everything. I recommend people watch the whole video but here&#39;s some of the takeaways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They&#39;ve manipulated elections all over the world: US, Europe, Brasil, Australia, Kenya, and now China.</p></li>
<li><p>They use former spies from the UK and Israel to dig up dirt on opponents.</p></li>
<li><p>They create propaganda and spread it with false accounts and other methods (Astroturfing).</p></li>
<li><p>They talk about using different methods to entrap political opponents, like offering bribes or Ukrainian prostitutes. Whether entrapment was successful doesn&#39;t matter, because &quot;these things don&#39;t need to be true, as long as they&#39;re believed&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>They collect and use your private data to build profiles which they then can use to manipulate you without even knowing:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;The two fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information onboard effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn&#39;t know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you. And, our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It&#39;s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it&#39;s all about emotion.&quot;</p>

The availability of data in China is huge compared to places like the US where the expectation of privacy is way higher.  If they say they didn&#39;t act politically, I&#39;ll believe it only because there would be no need for them to act politically in China.

<blockquote>
<p>In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “super predator” line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see — and no one else sees “I’m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, so for example if you like posts on pro-2A content, that would go into your profile they kept on you. They then run all your data and try to classify where you land on the political spectrum. If they determine you are a swing voter in a swing state, they then take any hyper targeted ads and make sure it was tailored to your particular political leanings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is key on understanding how mass propaganda works. You need to think on a very macro level and on an extended period of time. the method is the exact same as it was in the 30-40s, only the message change and is more tailored to individuals rather than masses, which is even better for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, although they claim it&#39;s not there&#39;s, the ad is a good example of how they (or orgs like them) use fear and emotion to manipulate people - which of course is even easier to do when you&#39;ve stolen people&#39;s data so you know exactly what they fear and have strong emotions about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess would be something like, using Facebook&#39;s data they know you just had a daughter and you lean right on immigration issues. They fill your feed with fake articles on stories about illegal immigrants raping young women, or how (candidate they are working against) protected an immigrant from being deported after he killed a young girl. </p>

<p>With Facebook&#39;s data they can create extremely targeted ads that are crafted specifically to push YOUR buttons. Not just ads to a demographic, but ads and articles specifically to sway your opinion. They might not even frame it in terms of an election, they just need you to get afraid or get angry and make sure you&#39;re going in the direction they want afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take your homer friend that believes the Browns are going to win the super bowl EVERY year, that draft pic IS going to be an HOFr... He’s a main target group. <em>Believers</em> The objective doesn’t have to be for or against. It can be any data set they want to sway for a bigger objective. Controlling (conditioning) emotions, morals, opinions etc related to any topic. </p>

<p>It appears there are several psych targets, each has a specific objective. Sways views, spreads info, BELIEVER, meme monster etc People that believe JR Ewing got shot, WWE, Birthers, Fanatical Christians etc Are the main targets and anyone in their circles irl or social media. </p>

<p>There are a plethora of psychological hacks to induce a better outcome percentile.  It’s not black and white, like just an add. Its micro data manipulation. It’s Jedi.</p>

<p>Given how close most elections are, they only need to sway believers, and ppl in their fringe circles are a bonus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use psychometrics.</p>

<p>You fill out some stupid fb survey on which targayan you are or share some meme from news4UNOW on some subject you actually are interested in, and all those sources collect your data. Enough data, they can tell who you are and target you with more crap to alter your thinking. Now, here&#39;s the rub....their psychometrics dept is using an algorithm that is so well honed, it can accurately &quot;know you exactly&quot; in as little as 10 interactions. (10 meme shares if you will). Then they can target you psychologically to alter your belief system. The guy who wrote the original big data algorithm they are using included a disclaimer in his work - that this type of manipulation is dangerous to society and should never be used. About a year or so ago he equated his work the creation of the atom bomb when he saw how it was being used. </p>

<p>I think motherboard vice did an article on this a year or so ago. </p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>Make America Number 1 (MAN1) is a political action committee that sought to achieve a meaningful impact on the 2016 Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton presidential election.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica (CA) delivered data modeling, television targeting and placement, digital ad targeting and delivery, list building, and polling to Make America Number One’s (MAN1) project “Defeat Crooked Hillary” (DCH) with the goal of running a cost-efficient and effective nationwide operation.  </p>

<hr/>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>In order for MAN1 to be successful and impact the results of the 2016 presidential election they needed to locate the key voters that could swing the election and establish creative ways to reach and interact with this audience to move them to action. </p>

<p>Through utilizing their vast troves of existing data on individual voters, constructing highly advanced data models, and prioritizing voters by their likelihood to vote and feelings of favorability towards each candidate, Cambridge Analytica created a unique “principal audience” of voters to target. This allowed MAN1 to focus efforts and funding on the truly undecided voters in key regions of the electoral map that would ultimately decide the race.  </p>

<p>Partnering data with creative, CA’s creative team worked with MAN1 to compose messaging that distinctly imparted relevant content to the individual voter. Continuous combinations of language and imagery were tested through all platforms to ensure that the most cost-efficient and successful ads surfaced.</p>

<p>Promoted accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube were started from scratch and maintained to create an organic presence that allowed MAN1 to stay connected, interact with voters where they spend their own time and relay pertinent news as it happened.</p>

<p>CA also used digital ads, nearly 1000 organic social media posts and television ads to strategically counteract the news and happenings of the campaign to strongly influence the narrative their principal audience was being exposed to.</p>

<p>The ability to swiftly react in real-time, draft focused creative, place ads in front of the right voters, and measure the impact of the ads made MAN1 an elite and influential political action committee. </p>

<hr/>

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>CA executed a highly targeted, data driven, innovative, and financially transparent effort that ultimately led to a significant influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The success of the campaign garnered recognition from many national news outlets and received several awards, including taking gold in the Advertising Research Foundation’s 2017 David Ogilvy Awards in the “Big Data” category.</p>

<p>The results of this campaign are staggering, with CA reaching 50 million Facebook users, creating 1.5 million impressions on Twitter, 3.3 million on Snapchat, accruing over 28 million views on their digital videos and millions more on ads expertly placed on the televisions of undecided voters across the country.</p>

<p>While others followed outsider polling and the mainstream media narrative that Hillary Clinton would comfortably win the presidency, CA followed its own data that more accurately portrayed the electorate and enabled them to execute an enormously efficient, multi-million dollar ad spend.</p>

In another video where a whistleblower did an interview with the Guardian, he claimed that the company often exaggerated their abilities/size/affiliations to investors. It&#39;s clear they&#39;ve done some of this stuff, just not the extent of it.</p>

<p>Satan / God..? The jury&#39;s out but it&#39;s not looking good for true believers. But the occult is definitely a real thing - the study of it, the practice of it. </p>

<p>As much as I&#39;d like to think people in power are into it, the more prosaic truth is they most likely just worship profit and privilege. </p>

<p>But claiming &#39;person in power&#39; is into occult rituals is a quick  tactic to mobilize the Christian right into outrage and opposition, as people who believe in the Bible as fact tend not to critically think about the information they&#39;re presented with, if it&#39;s from a trusted source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re-posting this because the mods removed the last thread ( I think that was a really bad decision. Censorship is a really bad response to almost anything especially in a sub like this. We should expect better.)</p>

<p>This is a really good piece.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think they have been and are currently active on this sub you are likely sadly mistaken. I have been hollering in the wind about this for some time here and few people take it seriously or understand the threat. This is sophisticated propaganda and this sub is a battleground for what they are trying to do. And it is destroying this sub. There is likely an Internet force designed to reelect Trump that is complete astroturf that has gone undetected. Its likely this sub is a prime target of that force and is being aggressively targeted. If you know what to look for it becomes very obvious to see. Everything that is posted is looked at from a view of how it effects trump and then either tried to be discredited or derailed by bringing up something unrelated or slided like this may be.</p>

<p>CTR does a similar thing. But CA is better at it. Together these shill tanks are destroying discourse on the Internet especially on places like Reddit and even more specifically in subs like this one. People here are aware of CTR but I don&#39;t think they are aware about the other side and how ubiquitous it is here.</p>

<p>&quot;It has to happen without anyone thinking it&#39;s propaganda. Because the moment people realize it&#39;s propaganda they ask who put it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no point fighting a campaign on facts because really it&#39;s all about emotion.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I started lurking here first originally because while I&#39;m not <em>into</em> conspiracies I like seeing other perspectives on an issue and am willing to change my views given credible evidence and a good argument. But over time lurking here I got dissolutioned  by the lack of evidence and logical thought that went into a lot of what I was reading. And then when others tried to discuss those ideas with good opposing evidence they often got called shills or some other nonsense or their credible sources were disregarded out of hand as MSM in favour of unsourced blog posts/ incoherent hour long YouTube videos with unverifiable assertions. </p>

<p>After a while I realised that a lot here are not looking for conspiracies but instead things that confirm their preconceived perception of how things work or justify their hate of a certain group. They often mock people who follow the &quot;mainstream&quot; without thought, but will happily jump on any random shit posted here with even less thought as long as it flows the other way. </p>

<p>A big example of that is how they went on and on about the Pizzagate thing even though there was plenty of evidence out there that this specific conspiracy was bullshit. Something that specifically pissed me off because there are genuinely cases of high ranking pedo rings and nonsense like that discredits the possibility of those being believed in the future. But then when it became painfully obvious they then moved on to start pretending that Pizzagate revered to pedo activities In general when it was clearly originally about some random Pizza place and the allegations around that. They moved the goalposts because they refuse to be wrong even when they are.</p>

<p>So In the end I stated lurking both here and TMOR because I can get look at the conspiracies here and go to the TMOR posts about them for a critical look at those same conspiracies to test their veracity when they hit reality. </p>

<p>You observe to learn to better manipulate. Doesn&#39;t mean there is someone reading post and taking notes, but it can be automated and  results quantified. I mean that&#39;s basically what social media managers do in their jobs if they know what theyre doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s disingenuous to compare CA directly to CRT.  They kinda do the same thing, but CTR is a tiny, tiny entity compared to CA--they spent only $1 million in 2016, which is why the idea that CTR was &quot;everywhere&quot; was always pretty absurd to me.  CA appears to on a completely different, much larger scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not convinced of that.  CTR changed into ShareBlue after the election and they raised over 40 million dolars. That is a lot.  You can disrupt a lot of discourse with that amount of money. If you post in this sub and definitely in other places on Reddit you likely know that or have come in to contact with them.  They probably  aren&#39;t as sophisticated as CA thiugh.    </p>

<p>But in any case we should all be pushing back against both of these groups as they are destroying discourse in the internet.  I think it&#39;s really mportant we do something about groups like this before all meaningful discussion n the Internet becomes astroturfed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my opinion. Its based on what I have seen here and I have been saying it for the last couple months on this sub.  The same tactics and deflection are used over and over.  Anytime somebody is in quarrel with Trump miraculously that person will get a thread the next day (not about the their quarrel with Trump, but about some loose passed action that tries to smear their credibility.  Anytime a corporation or party comes into quarrel with trump the same tactic is used and the narrative pushed.  Right now it&#39;s trying to show Obama worked with tech leaders as if that somehow mears we should be okay with CA astroturfing social media and comment sections.  Anytime Trump is attacked, there is an organized effort to discredit the person or entity that is criticizing trump politically.  If you look for it its easy to see.</p>

<p>I believe Reddit and in particular this sub is a prime target for this kind of manipulation because people from all sides of the spectrum come here with their grievances.  From here that astroturfing can circulate into numerous school chambers. That is why ShareBlue is active here too and this place has become a battleground for politics astroturfing and it&#39;s destroying this sub.  And the organic users who post here sincerely are the victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think CA and other Trump shills have just done a better job with their propaganda. They are more sophisticated, better researched, smarter.  It took me a while to spot it but once you see how they work its easy to spot. </p>

<p>&quot;It has to happen without anyone thinking it&#39;s propaganda. Because the moment people realize it&#39;s propaganda they ask who put it out.&quot;</p>

<p>That is a quote from the CH4 documentary by a Cambridge exec who is talking to a presumed client. </p>

<p>If you look at how advanced these guys are and how deep they dig you realize they take this very seriously and are at the cutting edge of social media astroturf. Its fascinating in a dark disturbing kind of way. And they are in now ay concerned with the truth which is what bothers me the most. I have seen so much blatantly untrue stuff being echo chambered around on social media that it just defies all logic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to make it sound like ShareBlue and the other side isn&#39;t prevalent here too. They definitely are and they try and hammer everybody on the head with their views that are very out of place here. I think Politics sub is infested with them. But most people here know about ShareBlue and are aware of it. There is a lack of awareness of the other side manipulating here and on other platforms. It may not be just CA or it could be some other company. But its only logical to assume that there is a organized internet astroturf group which manipulates social media in order to help Trump get elected and then re-elected. With how much they have relied on social media I think it would be naive to think otherwise. </p>

<p>In that case, if its so subtle, how do you know its CA and not just normal people who are supportive of most of what Trump is doing, like me? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m just wondering how you&#39;re reaching your conclusion. Like you said, CTR/ShareBlue are pretty obvious, and yet there are still plenty of people who deny their existence. So if CA is that much better, how do you even know they are here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like you said it would be foolish for a campaign not to.  I can only give you a few of the tactics that I see and believe are going on here and why I think that.  </p>

<p>I said in my post above how they try to smear any entity that has recently been in quarrel with trump like clockwork. Their aim is to discredit and weaken those that are critical of trump and plant that seed. This happens pretty much every single time somebody criticizes trump in the public sphere or some negative news comes out. There is then a post on the front page about that person or entity, that has nothing to do with their quarrel with trump, but something in that entity&#39;s history to try and discredit them. This has been going on since the campaign about a million times here and a lot of times these posts have nothing substantial to say. When the same pattern happens every single time its hard to dismiss as organic trump supporters.  Its subtle propaganda. </p>

<p>There are also the passive aggressive retorts to the comments that are critical of trump that are repeated like talking points. Its like they have a list of talking point rebuttals and you look up and down the comments section and that talking point is repeated in rebuttal to every comment critical of trump. That takes coordination and organization. Those talking points are usually repeated deflections and logical fallacies used when trump is being criticized about legitimate topics. Things you would never believe people to be defending on r/conspiracy. They give these canned passive aggressive responses or justifications. They bring up some irrelevant point like Obama did something similar (i always have to say yes and we shit on obama when he did those things too and trump is taking it to the next level) or &quot;what if trump is trapping them by doing xyz&quot;...IE he is playing some 19D interdimensional chess game.  They want to plant that seed of doubt to weaken the damage. It defies belief to see the same rebuttal repeated up and down the comment sections especially on a conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>And then there are the people asking &quot;what is the conspiracy&quot; in posts that are critical of trump and get the mods to remove them.</p>

<p>There have also been little blips in their propaganda that have been uncovered. There was a post about how they are in an organized way infiltrating the subs of big cities that are important in the local elections and astroturfing them so as to help with elections. 
There is a person here who posts about how different recently created usernames are posting copied and pasted versions of different comments all recently created here and in the donald and there is a pattern. I don&#39;t remember the details of those posts but somebody else probably does. </p>

<p>An undercover sting by Channel 4 News has revealed that executives from Cambridge Analytica boasted that they could entrap politicians with Ukrainian sex workers, offer bribes to public officials, and use former spies to dig dirt on political opponents.</p>

<p>The report reveals CEO Alexander Nix and other Cambridge Analytica executives admitting to using a range of underhanded tactics <strong>in order to sway the outcome of more than 200 elections around the globe</strong>, secretly campaigning through a web of shadowy front companies and sub-contractors.</p>

<p>Channel 4’s reporter posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka, meeting the company’s executives five times over the course of three months.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the same thing the Obama campaign did in 2012 with the help of Facebag and the media was singing exactly the opposite tune?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data Obama&#39;s team collected came from an app that was clearly labeled as being associated with his political campaign. The people who downloaded the app gave them express permission to harvest the data they used.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica hired a third party to create an app that said it was a personality test and any information collected would strictly be used for academic purposes, then they transferred that data to Cambridge Analytica which broke Facebook&#39;s TOS <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5516015/Massachusetts-attorney-general-investigate-Cambridge-Analytica.html">and could have potentially been illegal</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because if you go on MSN or any other major media outlets you will be flooded by Russophobia. 
My dad was born in Russia before he came to spain. Half my family still lives in Russia so I think I possess a broader perspective.</p>

<p>Thing is, Putin is not the enemy. </p>

<p>As far as my research goes and I have been at it for 3 years now, the western &quot;democratic&quot; states are controlled by a small group of people who have had many names here in r/conspiracy but I think the Elders of Zion fits them best. </p>

<p>They are on top of all the freemason lodges, and while they keep the sheep atheist they are in fact deeply religious and practice occult rituals. Their religion comes from old hermetic cults back in the antic greek states who got their knowledge from the Egyptians... Anyways.
They have been orchestrating world conflicts to keep us in check and fund their secret programs. There are trillions of dollars missing from DoD funds.</p>

<p>Hitler was actually fighting against them. When he came to power he started mass printing three important documents that revealed that there is a world conspiracy of &quot;jews&quot; (yes in fact they are jews but not like your average jew. If you look online you will find Jews against Zionism and Israel so even jewish people are starting to realize who the enemy is.) They don&#39;t follow modern Judaism, they follow the Cabal, an ancient, pagan version of judaism. (Very crude description)
They are doing coups in many middle eastern countries to set up puppet governments. 
However Putin is not controlled by them and that is why he is interfering in Syria. If you look at Putin speeches and interviews you will see he is a intelligent leader who doesn&#39;t rely on pre-written statements and acts very genuinely and he believes in this conspiracy as well albeit only touching up on it lightly.
Their end goal is to set up a New World Order where in they are controlling the globe. USA and Israel and the UK have been infiltrated by them a long time ago. Brussels and the EU as well. South america was their previous target before the middle east and they managed to place communist puppet governments there. They invented bolshevism. Karl Marx was a freemason. However the cold war was genuine because they never calculated with Stalin. If you look at the pre-stalin communist party almost everyone is a Zionist jew. When Stalin came to power his first act was to wipe out the party members particularly the jews. In fact after the fall of the soviet union they published some state secrets in the chaos and my dad vividly remembers one particularly disturbing article where they discussed that Lenin was in fact paid millions to do the Red revolution. He was a fraud not for the people.
All of what I said can be verified with some research on the web and in your local library. 
Russophobia is very dangerous because WW3 will be blaimed on russia when it is the other way around, and the people will support their future-enslavers because they were mislead.
If you got this far thank you for your time. May the force be with us, because god knows we are living the fucking end times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as anti-semitism. It was made up by the victors after ww2 to blame the holocaust on Hitler and to sabotage any further discussions on the topic. 
Just think about it. I never said anything racist yet just by mentioning the word &quot;jew&quot; you closed up rationally, did not contemplate anything I said and had an emotionally charged response that makes no sense. It is the perfect technique to withhold the truth. No one can talk about the one thing we all should be talking about. That ww2 was in fact a spiritual war for the consciousness of humanity and the good sadly lost. That you are not a biological machine but the whole universe. That there is a group of people or entities who want you to think that you have something to lose by dying and thus you became susceptible to threatening and control.  </p>

<p>I said that I&#39;m not talking about jews as you think about them. In fact I found most orthodox jews to be very intelligent and some of them even agrees that there is in fact a small group of jews (in an ethnic sense not religious) who worship a dark entity. You may call it Lucifer, Yehova, Javeh, The one god, the same entity that the whole bible is based on. That is why the christian and jewish god is jealous and vengeful. The real absolute creator is inside all of us and not a petty creature who wants you to worship him or else you end up in hell. No, it nurtures all life without wanting anything in return. Laotzu and confutzu talked about the same thing. All religions talk about the same thing more or less.
Quantum mechanics talk about the same thing in a scientific way. Everything is interconnected, and if for one second you would put away your preconceptions and hatred and all the lies spoon-fed to you through education, you would find that there is a logical line of reasoning in what I just said.
You can&#39;t accept what I am saying because of your ego, the grand illusion that they wrapped you in, that you are a poor little me in a skin bag. Yet deep down there is something eating at you. That is the truth. We all know it deep down. That is why you feel sad or depressed for no reason, why you feel like you have a whole in your chest right where your heart is supposed to be. That is why you have conflict in your life with other people, with your partner. It is the ego. The ego is the little shit telling you that I&#39;m an anti-semite lunatic and thus everything I say is inherently false. But just try to follow the line of thought. Why do you think this? Is it really your own thought?
I understand if you are not ready for the truth, just know that I have no hate or negative judgement towards you. Once I was in the same boat as you are. And one day, maybe not in this life, you will also know the real you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I meant was that Anti-semitism was made up by the zionists after the war to muddy the water.  Too many people were exposed to the truth to some extent. So what they did was muddy the truth with lies to confuse you. That is how the devil operates. Through deception and lies. Hitler didn&#39;t hate jews. In fact many high ranking SS and Wehrmacht members were jews. Hitler wanted to stop zionism and bolshevism, behind both of which was the freemasons. On top of all freemason lodges there stands the elders of zion. 
If you believe in a shadow government, you can see the same thing. Deep state, illuminati, freemasons, luciferians, NWO. The same thing.
It is illogical to hate a group of people just based on race! It is wrong to hate anybody. I believe in love over hate.
That is why the whole second world war doesn&#39;t make any sense according to the history textbooks.
But hating a group of people who want to enslave the world and keep the truth from the people is much more understandable, albeit still wrong because hatred only harms you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using it in my own context.</p>

<p>I think it fits well with the newfound fear mongering that all major media outlets and astroturfers seem to be pushing. </p>

<p>Putin is the devil and Russia the evil empire who fiddled with the US election. 
What a joke. 
There is no election in the western world. The deep state just changes puppets.</p>

<p>I suggest you go take a look at some videos of Putin talking and make up your own mind. Does he seem like the devil to you? 
I see a genuine leader of his people, very scarce to find in the west cause they all sell out to the money people. 
Just by looking at US politicians talk about the &#39;russia connection&#39; you can see that they know nothing of netsec or geopolitics.</p>

<p>They just keep saying the same senseless things while you can feel the hatred and ego radiate from them. 
On the other hand Putin seems like a very intelligent person who actually has his own opinion deduced from facts not from MSN. Plus it is NATO who keeps installing ever more advanced ballistic &#39;defense&#39; systems while cornering Russia.
Why would you spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money on missiles if you don&#39;t want to use them and why do you want to install them at the door of your neighbor?
That is what happened in Ukraine.
That whole proxy conflict was because they wanted to install further &#39;defense missiles&#39;.
So who is the aggressor here?
The Warsaw pact is no more, the cold war ended. So why is NATO still operational?
I tell you why.
Because it is the military front of the Deep state and they need the influence here in Europe to put pressure on Russia, which is the last thing standing between us and the NWO.
How ironic. 
Russian soldiers are giving their lives right now in Syria essentially for your security so you don&#39;t end up in an Orwellian human farm and you keep hating them and eating up the official story.
What happened to this sub? What are you doing on a conspiracy subreddit if you are going to defend the MSN official narrative? Hmm I wonder.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really. The Trump-CA-Russia triangle was mentioned previously. The fact that you can create &quot;what cat do you like best&quot; &quot;apps&quot; to gather user information and behavior is obvious. Correlating user behavior with profile &quot;likes&quot; - whether legal or not - is possible and easy. Those polls on a webpage where the ad usually is? That&#39;s information gathering. With the proper information, you can target a single person for a Facebook ad. To think that this amount of data gathering and information <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be used for malaise is... frankly it&#39;s naïve.</p>

<p>The only thing that I find interesting is that they were caught using the CA name, and not some quasi-connected-but-legally-different-for-liability-reasons entity.</p>

Theres quite a huge political tied to Nambla paying for a lot of the stories and &quot;research&quot; we see. It&#39;s to lower our guard in the respect of pedophilia.

    <div class="md"><p>This is another big nothing burger. It is just targeted marketing, which has already been around for a long time.  There is no evidence that the CA data had any impact on anything.  Basically, we know the Internet can follow you around -- so if you do a search for cat toilets, cat toilets are popping at every site you visit.  Actually, I think Wylie exaggerates how important the impact of this might have been.  Psychological profiling (of groups) has always been a  part of marketing.  This is just a new method for selecting out people you can potentially influence with a given ad.  It does not mean people were even influenced.  If you are an old guy, do you buy little blue pills everytime you see an click-bate float across your screen?  Or maybe through Facebook we know you are a skinny dude.  Muscle building ads are targeted at you.  Nothing guarantees that they will work.  I have seen much more sinister strategies used in politics.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not convinced of that.  CTR changed into ShareBlue after the election and they raised over 40 million dolars. That is a lot.  You can disrupt a lot of discourse with that amount of money. If you post in this sub and definitely in other places on Reddit you likely know that or have come in to contact with them.  They probably  aren&#39;t as sophisticated as CA thiugh.    </p>

<p>But in any case we should all be pushing back against both of these groups as they are destroying discourse in the internet.  I think it&#39;s really mportant we do something about groups like this before all meaningful discussion n the Internet becomes astroturfed.</p>

<p>In that case, if its so subtle, how do you know its CA and not just normal people who are supportive of most of what Trump is doing, like me? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m just wondering how you&#39;re reaching your conclusion. Like you said, CTR/ShareBlue are pretty obvious, and yet there are still plenty of people who deny their existence. So if CA is that much better, how do you even know they are here?</p>

<p>That said, I think Trump definitely had social media people doing what they could. In this day and age, anyone with a serious campaign would be foolish not to.</p>
