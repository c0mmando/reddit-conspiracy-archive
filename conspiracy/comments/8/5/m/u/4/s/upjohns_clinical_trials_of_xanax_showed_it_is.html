      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An earlier memo (8/6/90) to Dr. Leber from Thomas Temple felt XANAX's effectiveness was "clearly shown", the potential for drug withdrawal phenomena was "clearly the area of main concern for two principal reasons. First, there is the matter of seizures... In addition, there is the issue of lifelong dependence, i.e., inability to discontinue therapy."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FDA has approved a drug in high dosages (up to 10 mg per day) for the treatment of panic disorder without evidence that it is safe for long-term prescription.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's examine the three trials, which were used by quoting a few written comments of FDA consultant Hillary Lee, Ph.D. (Statistical Review and Evaluation of 12/21/88). Keep in mind that, as is the custom, the manufacturer Upjohn sponsored these surveys. The FDA merely reviews their reports: "The trials, studies 4404, 4412, and 4432, were conducted sequentially from April, 1983 to May 1985." Follow-up was ten weeks or less. An initial question you might ask is
        <strong>
         what happened to the subjects since 1985? - There is no data on this.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Study 4404: A 10-week flexible dose, single-centered, double blind, parallel, placebo controlled multicenter clinical 8-week trial. One comment was,
        <strong>
         "it is disconcerting to note that the Dupont center, which had the largest sample size (19% of the total sample) and one of the lowest placebo dropout rates, showed a larger decrease in number of panic attacks of the placebo group than for the alprazolam group." In other words, in this center treatment with XANAX was worse than no treatment at all!
        </strong>
        As to the panic attack effect, the reviewer noted, "only one center showed significant difference..." between alprazolam and placebo. However at the dose of approximately 5 mg alprazolam was judged to be more effective than no treatment at all in the treatment of phobias.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The criterion by which XANAX effectiveness was judged was mean reduction of panic episodes per week. By that measure, one may reasonably suggest general anesthesia as a method of treatment (e.g., panic attacks would be reduced to zero and the procedure is FDA approved as generally safe). There are many other qualitative and quantitative indicators of reduction of panic attacks over the short term that these studies were conducted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a memo (8/11/89) to the FDA Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC), Drs. Leber and Laughren indicated, "the single most significant concern associated with the use of XANAX in the treatment of panic and phobia behaviors is an increased (compared to current recommended uses) risk of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...Information gathered during the eight years of XANAX's domestic marketing for the management of anxiety disorders documents that the use of XANAX is consistently associated with reports of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...
        <strong>
         we are especially concerned that a recommendation for higher doses...will lead to an increased incidence of these untoward phenomena.

         no "systematic data to support the effectiveness of alprazolam for such use." The doctor noted, "data on discontinuation from alprazolam in the Upjohn sponsored clinical trials were quite varied...even for controlled trials, seems to me that the design wasn't quite correct to answer the questions of interest." (i.e., withdrawal).
        </strong>
        He observed that even in the short-term treated patients,
        <strong>
         "most experienced relapse (a recurrence of their symptoms) and a smaller fraction experienced rebound (a worsening relative to baseline of symptoms already present) or withdrawal (the development of new symptoms)."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In conclusion, Dr. Laughren indicated that there was strong support for the use of alprazolam "in the short-term treatment of panic disorder. However, there are deficiencies in this application with regard to how best to use XANAX in treating panic disorder; in particular, there was not an adequate exploration of the dose/response relationship or for the duration of effect...
        <strong>
         there was no systematic attempt by the sponsor to address the issue of maintaining patients who had responded during short-term treatment...There was no systematic attempt to look at withdrawal schedules."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On April 20, 1990, Dr. Leber wrote a memo to the Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation which said,
        <strong>
         "...it seems likely that the use of XANAX at the doses needed to achieve an anti-panic effect will incidence untoward events substantially greater than that so far observed among patients treated for anxiety."

       <p>
        In discussing the issue of safety of XANAX, Dr. Leber wrote, "The case is, in some ways, a close one...Also contributing to the difficulty of the judgment is the relative sparseness of the evidence...
        <strong>
         it could be argued that the sponsor has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that XANAX will be 'safe in use' under the conditions of use recommended."

In the end, the long benzodiazepine tranquilizer voyage is a journey into the darkest side of the twilight zone - another world's timeless hell for those that are lured there seeking calm. And yet finding - unrelenting heightened anxiety and abject misery.

       This is a perfect example of them putting profits over people. This drug should never have been allowed on the market. This drug will destroy your brains ability to function properly thus creating the necessity for the drug. It creates more anxiety than it relieves.

       Yep. People that have been on it for years will never have a fully functioning brain again. It suppresses the ability to make the chemicals needed to maintain. And I’m still trying to pinpoint what exactly causes the seizures upon quitting. Like, what exactly happens in the brain to cause a seizure?

       That explains exactly what I was looking for. It stops gaba production and gaba is what regulates the neurons firing. Overload of neurons firings causes the seizures. Thank you so much for that bit of knowledge!

       You are 100% correct, it has become a

The aggressive marketing of these drugs is nothing short of propaganda, it will take alot to unwind this lie and many more will suffer, but we had to start somewhere.

       Having Ben on them for 7 years, and now approaching 3 years off, I sincerely think it might be the greatest threat to our way of life. I know what they do. It's still be on them if my doctor didn't get closed down because she was also abusing them. I went through a year of hell. The first 6 weeks were worse than hell.

       The people who would find themselves in a position to regulate these things would also have unfettered access to them. I feel like Western culture as a whole is benzo'd out and not coming back. It's the worse than the opiate epidemic.

       Yes, Yes, Yes! The numbers are shocking. Over 6% of Americans are estimated to have a benzodiazepine addiction and 3% unrecoverable. This is worse than the opioid crisis, and has been overshadowed by it as well. My friend who is an ER trauma doc at Emory tells me it's so out of control that he may go into private practice b/c he can't handle another benzo seizure, and he has seen enough opioid overdoses than most (Atlanta...)

       Not close, -OH works on GABAb, Benzodiazepines GABAa. Very differnt. Drink a 1/5 th of vodka everyday for 6 months, then stop. Take 2mg of alprazolam everyday for 6 months, then stop. You will see the difference.

       <a href="https://drugwiki.org/index.php?title=Benzodiazepine_Equivalency_Chart">
        Compare it
       </a>
       to diazepam, the traditional benzo:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Xanax goes to work in 15-30 minutes, diazepam takes an hour. This means that Xanax has a perceivable effect very quickly after taking a pill. This reinforces psychological addiction.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Xanax lasts only 3-4 hours, diazepam lasts 6, and the effects wear off less abruptly. More frequent administration means more psychological reinforcement and habit forming behavior.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For daily users, this means that Xanax is taken more often and the individual is more aware of the effects as they take place, in comparison to diazepam or clonazepam. This is a trait highly addictive drugs have: alcohol has an effect within half an hour and wears off relatively quickly, cocaine and heroin start working in under a minute and wear off after 30-60 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benzos will be the next opiate crisis.

       Someone close to me who was subscribed xanax acted stranger than most of the people I've known who abused other drugs. Genuinely terrible stuff that fueled an addiction and made her unbearable,  and she used to randomly offer it to me to try to hook me on it like some kind of zombie. I really don't understand how it can be legal to sell this.

       However, this does bring me to a funny story. Ratdog or The other ones I thought they were called - the dead sans JG... I was at their concert in LA - I have a small bowl with some weed but security is patrolling looking for offenders - i turn my back and duck to hit my bowl hiding from security- my shoulder length hair swings around and arrives at my lighter as I strike it - big spot of my hair goes up because of the shit I put in it - about 30 seconds later (if that) I hear someone a few rows back say “hey man! someones smokin hair!” (Read in a Cheech and Chong stoner voice)

       LMAO. I got one too. After a show in Atlanta, My buddies and I were walking to the car and I said hold on so I could releave myself around the corner. While doing that a spotlight comes on me and I'm arrested for it. Friends never knew what happened! So this old lady cop drives around all night with me in the back of the patrol car! 8 hours! Friends were about to file a missing persons report.

       Very true! I had a friend who took Ativan for a year after a family tragedy...quit cold turkey. No issues at all?! His wife took his Ativan for 7 weeks, ended up in Arizona for 3 months rehab.

       You are definitely correct. Some can drink occasionally at a party or occasion and some cannot stop. It's not a question of will power, it's b/c we are all wired differently. Thx God for that, life would be boring otherwise!
