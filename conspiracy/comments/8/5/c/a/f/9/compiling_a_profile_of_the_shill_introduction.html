       I have been thinking of a project for sometime dedicated to identifying and dealing with shills that falls with the current rules of reddit and larger subs like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods don't ban people for being shills. The shills, I can name a few, play by the rules. If the actual community had any say the interpretation of the rules against attacking the sub would be interpreted to include shilling and an overall attitude of "debunking", off example they will use a snarky comment in place of an argument. We must attack the debunkers strategy of attacking with no argument. A link is not an argument. If someone can't explain their position very simply and plainly they either are lying or don't know what they are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell a shill some very simple traits.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shills never give their opinion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shills are always contrarian.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A shill will demand multiple sources but use spurious ones in their effort to debunk.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shills defend authoritarian control structures and corporate monopolies. A real conspiracy theorist does not.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Any and all observations on the behavior of the shill is greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Notice the voting already. The shills seek to silence any topic that draws attention to their behavior.

       For the most part I see them attacking anyone that shows the slightest bit of skepticism or critical thinking skills. See skeptics are like kryptonite to shills. The last thing a shill wants is someone questioning their narrative and posting credible sources that debunk their false claims. This is terrifying to your garden variety shill because it makes their jobs much harder if not impossible.

       What I'm getting at is is that not a relative perspective? I.e. one man's freedom fighters is anothers terrorist.

       The only thing you've done is show your ability to knee jerk without having all the facts (typical). Now that I spoon fed you the information you can clearly see that I was more than happy to present an argument and back up my statement.

       So you whatabout from one bad example of skepticism to another more decent attempt as if it completely defers from the former and then act like me directly answering your question with the former as an example is not adequate. I'm just not buying these mental gymnastics.

       The fact that you seem to comfortably be able to pretend this is the case is enough to cease further engagement. You have not listened, ran on your own presumptive tangents, tried to subvert the conversation by adding in ninja comments that made my response seem out-of-place, and then accuse the person you are talking to of doing exactly what you are doing. I look forward to how you spin this as another classic example of how people are unwilling to converse with "skeptics."

       I'm sorry but I've seen shills (people i identified as such) doing the exact opposite of your identification criterias and non-shills abusing these criterias simply by stupidity.

       Never forget that shills are fighting the same war as us: the information war. And like any war tactics must and do evolve. Hell have you ever seen a shill calling out someone a shill?

       Yes I have seen them call people shills all the time. But they do so in a way that goes around breaking the rules. For example they will say; "ohh this again. You keep pushing the same agenda." like a topic becomes not worth talking about if a post had ever previously been mad on the subject.

       Shilling is not obsolete. That is why there is a concerted effort to ban any users with real opinions from any larger subs. The shills bait people into breaking rule ten, in several different antagonistic ways, and elimemate real users one by one.

       My wording was exagerated. I believe shilling is about to become obsolete, at least in environments where everyone knows what a shill is and how to identify one. Newer tactics rely on derailing by baiting people in juicier information that leads nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that you could include derailing in the big umbrella that is the art of shilling, in which case my initial premise becomes false.

       The point isn't about proving who is or isn't a shill, it's about trusting whatever information someone brings. Obviously you wouldn't trust what a shill says to you, hence why you want to discover one quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       This concept leads to shills rising tensions in a converation (or thread for that matter) in such a way that actual people call eachother shills so that no one can trust any information shared within the thread.

       You are not being downvoted because you aggravated the shills, you are being downvoted because you are suggesting that debunking is a faux pas in and out of itself.

       Of course they are. The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, that's one of the most fundamental laws of logic around. If someone is making an outrageous claim without providing outrageous evidence, which happens all too often on this sub, people are perfectly justified in pointing that out.

       You are implying that every shill knows he is a shill; whereas, many are just conformists to the mainstream narrative who are virtue signalling and who have limited depth because they can go 24/7 without being confronted by a compelling counter argument, so their confidence is off the charts--even though they are usually wrong. Also, they instinctively know that they would lose their friends and possibly their jobs if they questioned the mainstream narrative, so they conform. Such conformists may be hiding their opinion only to minimize loss of Karma rather than for more nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best first step is to use that handful of facts that take away their undeserved confidence--such as WTC 7.

       One behavior I have noticed is that a shill will say something disreputable (e.g. something racist) in response to a post or comment and imply that the op (or even most of the sub) agrees, then the op has to respond or else appear to have agreed.

       The goals of shills seem to fall into these categories: 1) make people dislike and distrust each other, 2) disrupt conversation that might spread or uncover the truth, and 3) smear poo on those who do not conform, 4) promote the mainstream narrative.
      </p>

       Some shills are so good that they actually contradict some parts of the mainstream narrative to gain enough credibility to protect the most important part, which is the

       The most effective shill technique I have seen is how
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       men's advocates are very good at explaining how the system screws men so badly, but then they misdirect men about the cause and solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They act like it is a new thing because, otherwise, they would have to explain the conspiracy that no mainstream or alternative pundits were mentioning it much before 2016.
       </li>
       <li>
        They say the cause is that this is what society wants because society places no value on the welfare of men, but this obviously not true because everyone is shocked when they learn the truth about how how badly the system abuses men.
       </li>
       <li>
        They act like the solution is more social service for men--like women have. This is wrong. men do not need social services. The solution to government is not more government.
       </li>
       <li>
        They keep implying that the solution is for men to dislike, distrust, and ignore women.
       </li>
      </ol>

        an overall attitude of "debunking"

      <p>
       Why is debunking a bad thing? As people admit constantly (usually when talking about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ), echo chambers are bad things. People bringing in facts or additional info to conspiracy theories are, in my opinion, always a good thing - maybe
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       if those facts or information "debunk" some aspect of the theory. I'm not here to talk about people's wild fantasies, I'm here to talk about conspiracy theories that are based in reality. Facts help that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically ditto my argument above for calling all shills "contrarian". Being contrary/playing devil's advocate/bringing unpopular but true facts into a discussion shouldn't be seen as a bad thing or something only shills do. That's the recipe for an echo chamber and that would be the death of this sub.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A shill will demand multiple sources but use spurious ones in their effort to debunk.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What do you mean/how do you define "spurious" sources? Your next point says that shills defend corporate monopolies, which makes me assume you mean that any 'mainstream' source would be suspect to you. I'm not sure it's helpful to discussion to label anything that's printed in any sort of mainstream source as bad information that only a shill would link to.

       This is you deflecting from the fact that you jumped to an incorrect conclusion, and even when it was pointed out that you were dead wrong you just ignored it and continued to attack me instead of my argument.
