       I will keep this simple.   I have read and studied and researched etc on this whole Illuminati, Freemasons, Secret Societies, etc/ The whole New World Order fiasco sort of speak and my question is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In this year of 2018 and the whole advanced technology, etc and the money and wealth and power these secret Owners of the world possess. Why has the NWO etc their agenda taken place yet. ?
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been planned more then 50 years ago or more, etc and like I asked.  They have the wealth, the power and the tech to make their NWO and still the world is where it was 2000 years ago. 
Separated and conflicted. No NWO, no Aliens landed, no Underground tunnel Lizard people { David Icke mumo jumbo}, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who studied and came up with some good explanations as to why, please let me know. I genuinely would like some opinions.   Thanks

       Because the public is very powerful - yet each individual is afraid of what they themselves might lose. As long as each person has it good, relative to 100 years ago, then each person will ignore all the bullshit. If the food runs out or if the TV and/or Internet is taken away then, and only then, will all hell break loose.

       Yes, it is. All the fantastic items you refer to (Illuminati, NWO, etc ...) mean nothing to the common person. Politics mean nothing to the common person. The common person has an IQ of 100 at best. Food, a car, an iPhone and Football are all that matter. Take those away and a revolt will happen. Continue to provide those and the evil one's can get away with anything they want forever.

       My question was regarding the establishment of their agenda, the NWO.
       <br/>
       We are not discussing the revolt of the common folk when things go bad.

       Obviously the average Dick&amp;Jane is pleased with a simple job, TV and fast food.

       It's happening every single day slowly they're slowly changing every generation of humans to be more complacent to be stupider to have slower attention spans to be more easier to program and manipulate you can see it in children nowadays compared it to like yourself I am 40 years old I have seen how children in my generation acted in The Next Generation the generation after that for every 10 years Cycles it's happening and it's happening with media they just need to create the global consumption of media then based on what they show you they change your perceptions in your mind remember children are the most easily influenced because their brain is still the most non develop the more you consume the more you change their plan will be done within the next hundred years you don't do things fast you do things slow when you do things fast you get Hitler

       That is why they win. People can't conceive of a slow moving, inter-generation plan to convert the world to a one world government that enslaves most of humanity. Reflect on how much of a slave you already are and how much of society and culture is already controlled. What voice do you have to counteract it? stand on a soap box and rave like an idiot.

       Good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that they are just playing a waiting game and pushing humanity towards cataclysm that they will be insulated against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global Warming, global war, impending water shortages, they KNOW these things are happening and WANT them to happen, they just don't want you to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the elite purposefully trying to keep us using dirty, archaic technologies knowingly ruining the environment, knowing that no matter what happens or how bad it get's, they'll be completely insulated from the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like that Nestle post on the front page, we have giant companies draining freely available
       <em>
        finite
       </em>
       water resources and selling that water back to us, making a fortune from it. What happens when that water disappears? We die and fight for it while the elite sit in their compounds laughing at us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The global war angle has been covered to death and I don't have the time to contribute anything meaningful, but we all know who benefits the most from wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "plan" is to keep us arguing over what real or not or what's actually happening or not while the people that actually KNOW what's going on use that knowledge to bleed us dry until we're dead and they have their elitist enclave society.

       Do you think that they want this way to continue? I mean. If they establish their NWO and half of us are dead and the rest just slaves like zombies, won't they get bored?  So I am thinking, all this strife and agony the world suffers, they sit back and enjoy the show while pulling the levers.   It's no fun when all is well and quit on the front.

       It's like that saying or whatever.

       I think the decrease in population is necessary because as it stands now there are too many people for the elite/oligarchy to effectively control. The more society/humanity is pushed to the brink, the more we'll come to rely on the services given to us by corporations as opposed to government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're already starting to see it in healthcare. Politicians and people on the internet are constantly screaming talking points at eachother to the point one side never trusts the other and things get done. What pops up in the news recently? Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JP Morgan getting together with the intent to launch their own healthcare plan.
       <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/25/amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire-health-care/350625002/">
        https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/25/amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire-health-care/350625002/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As resources become more and more scarce, and more and more distrust is sown amongst the population regarding anything politically related, governments will buckle under the pressure of sustaining their societies and we'll naturally fold into relying on the companies that we give our money to anyway.

       What's the hurry? When you control 90% of the wealth and power, and are increasing it more every year why rock the boat?  It has to be slow and steady or people revolt.

       We still have guns. And they know we're catching on to them. So, They want us to have no guns. In fact, they want us to hand them over willingly. Once we can no longer defend ourselves they will make their move.

       Apart from secret societies there are biblical prophecies that point to a one world govt and religion from thousands of years ago. The tech requirements have only been coming together in the last few years. One of the biggest prophecies has to do with the restriction imposed in buying or selling
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       unless you submit to and receive a mark from the system.  The mark of the beast —666.  Revelation 13. This deceptive system is demonic in origin and will lead  to horrific wars that will culminate in Messiah Jesus stopping the Beast and saving us.

       This is another thing I didn't think to address in my comment, but it fits perfectly with what I'm saying. Be afraid, because
       <em>
        these guys

       are working with the power of Biblical prophecy. Be afraid, because
       <em>
        these guys

       have the demons standing behind them. Be afraid, because this is way, way bigger than you. Be afraid, because only Jesus can save humanity. And that's why we're in this mess. Because humanity is afraid and won't save itself. This kind of argument
       <em>
        is why they're not worried about us at all

       "NWO" is already here. It's not about overt ownership of the planet; when you have the money and the power that some of these people or institutions do, you can do literally whatever you want. You don't need to sit on the throne because kings can be decapitated. Kings are targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the people are constantly bickering amongst themselves instead of uniting and solving problems, they win. Wanna see how effective divide-and-conquer is? Post something--anything--about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton here. Any thread you want, no matter the topic. Watch all these allegedly "woke" people immediately start arguing as the discourse suddenly dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you're afraid--of losing your job or your guns, or of terrorists, or of school shooters, or anything else--instead of actually doing anything, they win. As long as you're glued to your screen, trying to stay entertained or distracted or even to sift a few grains of truth from an ocean of disinformation and bullshit, instead of organizing yourself and those around you, they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the whole Illuminati/NWO/Freemason mythos about a secret, all-powerful society that orchestrates every single global event is part of the control mechanism because everything suddenly becomes part of the conspiracy. NWO/Illuminati/whatever else have become a catch-all. A cop-out. No matter what event happens, if it makes it to the national or international news, it can be blamed on these organizations. And this serves several purposes. It's a smokescreen, it's a distraction, and most importantly, it adds to the Fear. "Why bother fighting when THEY are all powerful...I'm just little old me, I can't do anything about it."

       If you put a frog in boiling water, it jumps out. If you put it in cool water and slowly raise the temperature, you'll boil the frog. There are also natural triggers for cataclysmic events, so why would "the Illuminati" go to the trouble of ending the world themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Eg 1) A Coronal Mass Ejection could wipe out power to half the earth, rendering all technology inert on that side and triggering a power grab. This would basically reset half the world. Maybe the NWO turns that part of the world into their feudal playground and the rest of us die horribly or go off planet / underground. I'm pretty sure if we stopped producing pollutants on one side of the planet all of a sudden there would be some kind of environmental consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eg 2) A major Supervolcano could erupt, causing a global winter and possibly forcing all the upper atmospheric poisons we put there to the ground. Perhaps such events are more predictable than thought but classified. Maybe it'll go off tomorrow but until it does we'll be business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eg 3) A nuclear war could break out, destroying the earth or triggering retaliatory doomsday devices, Dr Strangelove style. Still, salting the earth wouldn't really benefit anyone living, so I see this as more of a potential threat than a likelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eg 4) Humanity could just be naturally unsustainable, so why not just use it to build a secret Utopia and watch the world crumble when your hidden hand disappears? Personally, this option seems the most likely to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite (or whatever you want to call them) are the only people properly prepared to survive these scenarios with a long term guarantee. They give us access to technology to further their preparations, but only in so far as it can be easily stripped from us in less than a generation of turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the fun conspiracy here would be to think that sentient life on earth is common across all time periods. Eventually something like us shows up, but global societal prosperity is a fool's errand. The elite of that species prepare a utopia, and then log as much information as possible about the rest of society before their inevitable destruction. Hence the recurring "all seeing eye," being a reference to what came before and what will come again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentient life is a cancer on the earth, if we're allowed to remain the earth will die with us. If there ever were reptilians, they made a good choice in passing on the torch.

       My understanding is they've had numerous available candidates for the Antichrist position for several decades now as they've thought they have been imminent, but they keep getting set back in some form or fashion. If you had been planning something for centuries - nay, millennia, then you'd want to make sure you're 100% ready to pull the trigger. You don't get a second chance if you screw up something of this magnitude.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All kinds of people are pointing at the year 2000. Occult prophecies about the year 2000 come from Irene Hughes, Alan Vaughn, Edgar Cayce, Kenneth Odhar and many others. De Sabrato an occult prophet believes Christ will return in 2003 in the form of an ET Christ. However, if plans fall apart there are indications that the AntiChrist could arrive later in the 21st century. Henry Kissinger said, “We are going to have a New World Order, if not in this generation, then in the next.”
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the men who worked high up in the New World Order. and who had inside information felt that the AntiChrist wouldn’t rule until 2047 and that he would be born in New York City and have blond hair and blue eyes. From what the Lord has shown this author, and taking into account the vulnerabilities of the Illuminati’s plans, this author would state that the AntiChrist may not arrive until quite a few years from now. On the other hand, there are already candidates who have been presented before the Illuminati councils who are candidates to become the AntiChrist.

      <p>
       You make a hypothesis which is falsifiable. In this case “Secret Elites are very wealthy and powerful, and will implement a New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hypothesis would be falsified if, in fact, the Secret Elites do not put in place a NWO.

       We observe that, in point of fact, they haven’t done so, despite the stipulation that they have had the resources to do so any time in the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion is that the hypothesis is not supported by reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some conspiracy theories are simply wrong.

       Because the public is very powerful - yet each individual is afraid of what they themselves might lose. As long as each person has it good, relative to 100 years ago, then each person will ignore all the bullshit. If the food runs out or if the TV and/or Internet is taken away then, and only then, will all hell break loose.
