       I would never think there is even such technology within phones, but this shit is deeply concerning me. It's going beyond Google's smart-guessing based on search history and ad companies etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first noticed it a while back, I got on a kick of listening to an old artist I like, Daft Punk. I was playing all the general ones most people know, Harder Better Faster Stronger, Around The World, etc. An obscure one hit me I haven't heard in forever, Emotion. Definitely not one of their hits or anything I've searched before on this account. I got as far as "daft punk " and
       <strong>
        <em>
         THE FIRST SUGGESTION
        </em>
       </strong>
       was "daft punk emotion"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been doing it here and there with things I was thinking, "eh maybe it just knows me that well." But no, it
       <em>
        JUST
       </em>
       did it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I've had a mole on my neck my entire life. Never bothered me, I never cared. Today though, it felt huge and was bothering me. I search on Google, "how to remove a mole"
       <strong>
        <em>
         THE VERY FIRST SUGGESTION IS
        </em>
       </strong>
       "how to remove a mole from your neck" and the next 5 suggestions were "how to remove a mole from your yard" and at the very end "how to remove a mole from your skin"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not face, not anywhere else, it specifically knew where my mole was above all the other search suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This mole is on the back of my neck, and as I said, it never bothered me and I never cared, so I never searched it, hell I haven't even thought about it in years. I didn't even say it aloud today, so the mic-always-on rumor couldn't even done it. The
       <strong>
        <em>
         only
        </em>
       </strong>
       thing it could've matched was my
       <strong>
        <em>
         exact
        </em>
       </strong>
       thought process of typing "how to remove a mole from your neck"
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with the song, maybe it guessed somehow someway, but there's no fucking way I've ever had an interaction with Google where I mentioned that little tiny mole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has this shit been happening for anyone else recently?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking off-putting as all hell.

       You know when you avoid putting a profile of yourself online because you are not a narcissistic consumer looking to be profiled by multiple agencies, corporations and enforcers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then your partner shows you a picture from facebook on their phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That dead dark little eye on top of her monitoring device has just delivered your name, face, relationship and partial interests to facebook and whomever else might be looking in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your profile is up and running and you never signed up for shit.

       I totally get that. But there's a few points against that smart algorithm I'm getting at here
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't spend much time with anyone
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even then, nobody ever really shows me things on their phone/etc
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The only person I really spend time with doesn't like Daft Punk, nor do they even really know about the mole.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Believe me, I'm a tech geek, I know most of the [publicly known] skeevy techniques they use to profile off-their-grid people. There's is absolutely no way at all it knew these things. That's why I made this post. Whether it be someone's else's device, or advertising spyware, there was no keyboard input, verbal mentioning the mic could've heard, maybe the camera saw my neck but realistically they wouldn't go that intrusively far due to being such a resource hog, no interaction with others or their devices. The only piece of information it matched was literally what I was
       <strong>
        <em>
         currently
        </em>
       </strong>
       thinking.

       Surveillance is pretty much full spectrum, especially if you bring the monitors into your midst.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are outside at work or play how many cameras do you imagine are compiling endless hours of footage?
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have hit on something a bit different but I think we have yet to find out what is running in the background serving the creation of an all-seeing, possibly AI run, matrix.

       Look at the predictive programming of the current zeitgeist and take exactly no comfort in the fact that it is "just a movie/show".

       Every website you look at, every search you enter, every purchase you make with a debit or credit card, alongside your age, job, home address, the car you drive, your location throughout the day, every place you visit, every storefront you linger on, everything, it's all been put into an ongoing, ever growing profile of you that's been being constructed for the last two decades (or as long as you've been active in the world).

       He's specificly talking about when you don't say a bloody word about shit to no one other than think the thought in your mind. This has happened to me, shit I would not speak about only think about and bang, fuckers directing adverts to me, I looked long and hard at how this could be and I never said shit, somewhere and some how they grabbed that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a thought in your mind? energy, information, data and so on. Maybe they can plug into our thoughts like we can connected to a wifi router and access the data that is available on the Internet, only they can do it to access out thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is very fucking scary I have to admit, having this type of power or developing this type of power, well it would be very messy indeed, true thought police in full power.

       My SO and I were talking about how we could do with an ice maker. Later that night, without searching for it or anything, an ad on Facebook showed up showing ice makers from Amazon. That's when I was convinced that our phones and apps are listening to everything.

       I know this is a late reply, but it sounds like Experiment Time! My SO is out of town now, so I just mused to myself that we really need an new air cleaner. I'll keep doing it for a while then log into Facebook and see what happens. Will update accordingly.

       It goes far deeper than reading minds.  Think of the computers they have running this stuff, they are tapping into other dimensions or something we cannot explain.  This is not an algorithm doing this, it's something else completely.

       there are actually a lot of possible reasons this could be happening involving all sorts of entirely feasible physical models, people have this strange notion that everything always has to be magical and simple but of course it's not, so often people wave their hand and say 'the universe just came into existence in a big bang, that's all there is to it' and that's good enough for them? just like that a magic spell and then all this happened for no real reason then one day it'll be gone... Why try and make things so simple? why try to avoid complexity or interesting possibilities?!
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems more likely to me that the entire universe only exists inside the concept of itself, that all things are simplex expressions of probability stacked through multi-layers of chaotic and uber-chaotic order - we're an empty universe imagining itself in all directions and all dimensions...
      </p>
      <p>
       or we're in a simulation and the system has a little corner-cutting when so instead of bothering to fully parse all our communication it just pulls it out of our brains which sometimes means it's get's the right intent even when language system messes up the delivery... maybe we can use it to our advantage, discover where the system is allowing us to do this and see if we can use it to discover secrets or solve problems, maybe we can work out how the system works and devise item doublers and glitch enhanced items, real magic by hacking the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       why not? the very concept of existence is 100% totally mad however it happens so it could happen any way just as happily.

       if there is a god he' s not very friendly, seems he'd rather you just forgot about him and went about your life but you're right the only things that really matter are being good to each other and loving ourselves.

       Have you read "The Code of the Extraordinary Mind" ?  It would be nice to have more people around that like to get into discussions like this.  Sometimes I get caught up in what I think is really happening and then I have to tell that Ego that it does not know shit.  Cheers.

       This sort of thing has been happening long before the internet. I don't know if you're old enough to remember. 
Back in the day, we used to notice that someone would always call right after you think of them.
There's a book "Illusions" by Richard Bach. It mentions this effect. He used a blue feather as an example, IIRC

       Recently woke up with some pain and tenderness around my knee after running the day before so I wanted to take an anti-inflammatory to bring the swelling down before going back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only drug on hand that fit the bill (Naproxen) was slightly past its expiry date so I picked up my mobile with the intention of searching for its safety and efficacy past its use by date. I'd only typed in 'Taking out of' before Google search autocompleted my thought, i.e. 'Taking out of date Naproxen'. I couldn't believe it. Is Naproxen a common drug? I hadn't mentioned it to anyone what with me taking it during the wee small hours, and I don't recall typing Naproxen into Google in the distant past. It's not even my prescription!

       I think it's because mole on the neck is quite common (the most popular place to have a noticeable mole imo), so many people already searched for that and google's guesses are based on popularity. It's not because they can see at the back of your head

       My phone sometimes "reads my mind" and I actually find it convenient enough. Now, what gets annoying is both my TV and Youtube are spamming me with the same GD commercial....it has such a terrible, annoying song to and the product is totally irrelevant to me lol.

       I got all of Dragon Ball Kai off of a friends hard drive and have been watching it on my laptop that hasn’t been connected to the internet in over 2 months. Logged onto facebook on my phone yesterday and saw DBZ ads for the first time ever.. thought this was very strange as I’ve never even so much as logged onto my facebook account through my laptop ever so I’m not sure how facebook knows I’ve been watching DBZ.

       Strange coincidence you posted this, I have been looking at my emaill, text and phone history to see of and when I mentioned something to anyone about a course I should take. I cant find any instance I mentioned or discussed it, even with my wif
e.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to take a 7 hour seminar by April 15. The normal deadline for people in my field is September 30 so I am not in a target group of similar licensees in my profession. I havent told anyone at work because I am considering letting it lapse and changing careers and dont want anyone to know this. I havent searched for info on the course I am getting ads for, Ive basically done nothing except think about searching.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all this said I have been getting battered by ads for an online course that will fulfill the requirement. When I say battered I mean upwards of a dozen ads a day. Just prior to posting this I read an article on the Guardian and the ad that popped up is the ad I am talking about. I read an article in LA Weekly and it also came up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way any ad seller would know I need this course out of cycle, I may be the only one in my state with this requirement due to an extension I am requesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant believe the technology exists but I cant explain the ads either.

       Okay no check this shit out. 
Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about “what if life is like a game” because I got into a discussion with someone on the life of Kendrick Lamar and how PERFECTLY set up his life was to become who he is. So I got to thinking what if life is a game and there’s players controlling outcomes and what not. The thing is
I HADNT DISCUSSED THESE THOUGHTS WITH ANYONE YET EXCEPT A FRIEND TALKING OVER THE PHONE not texting or anything talking ON the phone
That is the only time I expressed my thoughts on what if life is a game.
Then next fuckin day I’m on instagram/Facebook and get bombarded with memes about “what if life is a simulation game” and “how come I think of shit and it ends up on my TL life is a simulation”
And I mean Bombarded. 12 memes in a row about life being a simulation/game
I freaked the fuck out because the only time I had spoken about it was a private call between me and a friend and all the sudden it’s all over my fuckin Time lines.

       It's coincidence, or you're schizophrenic, or you're being targetted with mind reading technology by the military (for scientific purposes). If you want more info on the latter read "the matrix deciphered" by Dr Duncan.

       Dude, it’s not your phone, seriously. Okay,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       your phone is reading your mind, but IMO it’s more like a glitch in the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of times I’ve started thinking about a song and shortly later that exact song would play somewhere has been uncanny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like one day I’m driving down the road and just started thinking of Joan Jett’s I love rock and roll... no big thing right? Ten minutes later I’m in BJs shopping and the song pops up on their music system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now maybe my phone read my mind, but it would have needed to contact the BJs music system to tell it what to play. But this has happened often in my life, even while phones still had a cord that it needed to work.

       So obviously if I have a conversation out loud about cat food and see an ad shortly after for cat food I can assume it has something to do with my microphone...or seeing ads for things I google....BUT LATELY I see ads and articles for RANDOM things I only think about in my mind....it’s not confirmation bias either....for example I live in a tropical place where it has never snowed and I don’t travel to anywhere cold...the other day I randomly was thinking about the boots people use to climb ice mountains and saw an ad for them an hour later....or the time i thought about going on a safari and saw several ads for safari excursions later that day....it’s not random and it’s been happening so regularly I’m legit completely creeped out

       Been happening for months, I think about something I want to buy. I don't even google it, and there it is, on some youtube ad or random website ad, some product I'm looking to buy. Swear this shit is scary.

       Verbalized my craving for tea from a particular coffee &amp; tea shop to friends at work. Later that day, the shop's Instagram account, which I do not follow nor had ever searched for, showed up on my Instagram feed.

       I was going to search the time of the sunset the other day. I opened chrome and the first suggested word before typing the letter S was “Sunset”.  I’ve searched this before and probably around the same time of day... but it was creepy.

       That’s sound logic. It was probably about 5 days ago. It was in the predictive section of my Samsung phone’s keyboard which I believe is connected with google. So it knows me well...

       So I had to call off from work for a couple of a days a few weeks back. Didnt want to tell managment why or where I was going/leaving. So I started think to myself the days leading up to telling them about what I was going to say. I decided to tell them I would be going to Naples Fl for my moms bday. Thought of this in my head. Never searched naples fl, never said it out loud. Never. Pandora ads started showing up for naples fl and marco island.

       Guys.

      <p>
       It’s literally so simple. It’s artificial intelligence. It’s already here. It’s already been voiced by high society members like Musk that it’s the biggest threat to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s morphed itself to have such good predictive programming and algorithms that can “read” your mind by learning your personality and how you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a quantum computer can learn how you think. It can think for you and give you the answer you already were going to eventually conclude yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s absolutely terrifying stuff here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The singularity has already taken place. It’s too late. One day humans will look back and know the exact point it happened.

       I was in a public speaking class and a guy gave a speech about how he became an auctioneer and went to auctioneering school. I definitely did not look any info about that up simply just listened to the speech. I soon after got ads for auctioneering school. Also this just happened today actually, I got an ad for a leaf blower today when yesterday someone in my house was complaining that we didnt get the leaves cleaned before winter and now they're still all over the yard. this one is a little more dubious, I admit but the auctioneering school one is something I literally can't help but think is google listening in.
