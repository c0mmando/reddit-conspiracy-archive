<p>Progressives and anti-imps who voted for King Cheeto are feeling right cucked right now.  As are MAGAs who are now seeing their god-emperor kissing the ring of the one true King.</p>

<p>Administration after administration, everyone swears fealty to the House of Saud.  Without fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I know what you mean.  But these days I&#39;m waking up and feeling like I&#39;m not on crazy pills, with everyone trying to outjingo each other as a way to prove their patriotism, ironically while acting as Saudi&#39;s royal mercenaries.  I feel that they are conditioning us to accept a full military occupation of at least the northern parts of Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, now follow close because we&#39;re entering reality now and I don&#39;t want you to get lost again, Trump is telling Saudi Arabia what the deal is - after all, he did just change the regime there and had them cut their oil production.  He&#39;s pretty much running the show there since they need him to curb Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ship was always on this course, but dismantling the neolibs and vexing the sleeping electorate by pitting them into 4 groups, both parties dealing with electorate insurgency, the millennials, is a more worthy and attainable goal for the the younger generation.</p>

<p>I know after 17 years the public is tired of war, pretty much a fact that everyone is tired of the war. We were always on this course, thats why the media does these flash awareness events, to garner an inch of support for the war. Have you even heard of aleppo since? </p>

<p>Trump does this thing where he admits the truth because hes not a seasoned politician, he doesnt have the right friends in the media so he plays this balance game where TPTB powerhouse their legislation through a &quot;deadlocked&quot; government  while trying to tear him down.</p>

<p>We&#39;re left with this disastrous slapstick theatre, unfolding before everyones eyes, because TPTB wear the democrats colors and thus have voted with trump. Ahahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress was thrilled when he tomahawked Syria, so why wouldn&#39;t he just ask them for money rather than SA? Sounds like there&#39;s more than he wants congress to know. Assad recently deployed support for coalition-Kurds so who knows what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2/3rds of those cruise missiles never even reached their airbase target and the ones that did reach the air base hardly did any damage at all.  It&#39;s rather obvious that Russian defenses were spectacularly successful in causing this.  It&#39;s also rather obvious that Russia used the occasion to learn things about the US missiles to improve their defenses.  The Israeli attack of a couple of months ago was a similar failure and the Russians certainly used that occasion to once again improve their defenses.  The notable absence of US and Israeli attacks since these events demonstrates the likely truth of my assertions here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If those canisters held Sarin, as you assert, then how do you explain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkyTq20ivI">this journalist standing among the canisters and suffering no ill effects</a> whatsoever?  The journalist did not have to wear any protective gear to make the video.  If there had been any chemical weapons at the Syrian base, even empty containers would have been highly dangerous.</p>
