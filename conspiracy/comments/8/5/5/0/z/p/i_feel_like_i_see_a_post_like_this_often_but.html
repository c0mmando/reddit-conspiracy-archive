       Well... a madman with lots of high-powered rifles shot a bunch of people attending a concert.

       Seriously... the problem you seem to have is that you haven't seen what you want to see (proof that some sort of conspiracy was involved) and thus seem to think no information has been released.

       I don't know... I'm not an expert in aberrant behavior or on criminal psychology.   All I was doing is answering the dude's question,  "What other details would you expect to see?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a "motivation" is a better word... what motivated him.  The word "motive" tends to frame it in a criminal,legal  way.  "Motivation" gives it more of a psychological aspect.  Even a crazy man has a motivation... for David Berkowitz it was because he was schizo and his dog told him to do it.  So yes, what was Paddock's motive, or motivation.  He certainly had one, so yes... why are we not hearing about it.?

       It may not be possible to know now. He is dead, so we only have what he left and what he told others. As I said in another response, not everyone lets out something they want to do until they actually do it.

       No new info as far as I know. The FBI said it wasn't going to release its report for something like a year which is like 9-10 months from now I think. It still gets posted and talked about though, I don't think anyone has forgotten.

       To the best of what I've been able to peice together, it was either an arms deal sting with ISIS went bad, or it was an attempted hit on a saudi monarch (the arms deal could have been a cover for the hit). Trump may have been meeting or planning to meet with him in secret. Either way the shooters got loose, they don't know where they are and they don't want to say anything that might provoke them furthur.

       Check my post history. There is no good evidence that any actual shots were fired in Vegas. Crisis actors and goofy/smiling people abound. No record of real injuries, gunshot wounds, bullet damage, medical activity.... in one video I posted you hear someone survey the crowd and say "It doesn't look like anyone is actually injured."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a movie, just a sham. So many fell for it. Newnationalist.net even wrote an article about a post I made here documenting about 40 users who claimed to know a Las Vegas victim but none could even attempt to prove it.

       You also hear people yelling "they are in the palm trees" sooo idk about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy controlling the stage lights says "everyone you see here is dead" before medical even came to the scene and that's strange..nobody's talked to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple people who had claimed to have proof of other gunmen or chased by gunmen died shortly after the massacre under suspicious circumstances..one was going to start a vegas truth group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always believed people died but I've been fighting for truth in this story since it happened and not 1 family member has came out and said they don't believe the story,or that they aren't happy with the non transparency and the fact lvmpd wanted 500k to release any video evidence...anyone fighting for truth seems to not have any relationship to anyone there that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was my mom,brother,sister or cousin I would be raiding hell about the timeline changing..letting a possible suspect run to mexico after the shooting.
The fact they were so busy guarding him the "shooters" house was broken into..and campos gained about 30 lbs and looked completely different coming back from Mexico an we got 1 interview ON ELLEN on all places. He had a chalkboard and pointer in front of him snd he still gave contridictions in his story..
Now laura loomer comes out with a report that fbi briefed congress on isis and Mexico connections to the shooting..didn't jesus skip out and travel to mexico with a bullet still in his leg and return looking way heavier.
His radio audio he's calm as can be after being shot and hit an having "200" rounds fired at him..
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing to hide then show some footage bc all we have is a GOVERNMENT worker found in a room dead *us government mail carrier, IRS agent,internal auditor for UNNAMED GOVERNMENT defense contractor and accountant at lockheed martin..
The same place the guy works the ammo came from...so why does his wiki page list prior occupations as professional video poker player? ðŸ¤”
Unless you go down into history and read for 30 mins...why can't I add his old jobs to the top where it's easily seen? Why's his page locked?

       Yep, the online discussion surrounding Vegas was carefully controlled: we are "allowed" to say it was a false flag and question many details of it, but not to question whether it even happened. But if you do look at my post history, one post in particular where I asked for visual evidence of real gunfire is very revealing.

       In many cases there is the "official" conspiracy theory, which is planted too, and still not the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, 911:
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 0 (MSM nonsense): bearded acrobatic pilots throw passports outside of cabin windows and pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 1 (official conspiracy theory): aluminum planes enter steel skyscraper like a hot knife through butter, and then (nano-)thermite used to demolish buildings. False flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 2 (truth): no airplanes. Nuclear demolition. Occult ritualistic mass-sacrifice and psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "official" conspiracy theory will be generally well received. Try and formulate something that approaches the truth, and see the astroturfing commence. Your comment is a sign of that; you formulate a valid hypothesis, yet it stands at
       <del>
        -4
       </del>
       -6.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Parkland event, it is clear to me they are
       <em>
        expecting
       </em>
       people to question the narrative. See
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xmqt4/parkland_shooting_swat_team_drills/du9leqp/">
        this
       </a>
       . Notice how my comment was downvoted in that thread. Also this whole "FBI did not investigate", drill nonsense/confusion, second shooter testimony, etc. - all of that is done on purpose.
      </p>

       This is not true. In particular I recall a graphic video after the shooting where a man is running around the triage area checking the status of fallen victims. Most of them were dead with visible fatal wounds.

       No: in the video you're talking about, which is staged, it is said more than once "I see no entry wound, no exit wound."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        No
       </em>
       wounds are visible. There are no visible gunshot wounds, bullet damage, or actual medical activity.
