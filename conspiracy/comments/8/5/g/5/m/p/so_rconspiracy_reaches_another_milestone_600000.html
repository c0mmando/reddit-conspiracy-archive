        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even though an increased membership points to an increased interest in conspiracies (which would be regarded as a &quot;good thing&quot; for those of us that want to wake people up, and get the truth out) there is an argument that the sub is growing....too fast. There is also an argument that the subscriber totals don&#39;t actually reflect real people clicking the subscription button at all, but are based on some sort of algorithm, but that&#39;s not the point of this post.</p>

<p>When I became a mod here two years ago, we had about 370,000 subscribers and there was a lot less friction, less abuse and the mods had to issue far fewer bans to disruptive users. At the moment, we are banning over 100 users a week on average because the disruption has got out of control.</p>

<p>Clearly the 2016 US Presidential election changed the sub, because it brought it large numbers of politically-motivated users who aren&#39;t really interested in conspiracies. This has changed the nature of the sub - the most upvoted comments on any post are now usually from users who don&#39;t appear to believe in conspiracies and don&#39;t like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p><strong>I think the time has come to reset the balance.</strong> </p>

<p>EDIT: What I mean by that sentence. The point of a subreddit is to provide a forum to discuss a specific issue, or phenomenon, with likeminded people. For that subreddit to work properly, it needs to be populated (and moderated) by &quot;real users&quot; - and for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that means individuals who are believers in conspiracies, and/or those who are genuinely interested in the subject and want to learn more.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE: Let us break down reddit using an estimated/indicative percentage about a conspiracy &quot;microcosm&quot; - the Apollo Moon Landings. <strong>Let us assume reddit comprises these three groups:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(A)</strong>  5% of reddit. Believes that no human has ever walked on the moon, and/or NASA is a fraudulent organisation that siphons off billions in taxpayers&#39; money for illicit deep state projects.</p>

<p><strong>(B)</strong> 5% of reddit. Believes that humans have probably walked on the moon, but NASA is sketchy and the full truth of Apollo Moon Landings has probably not been disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>(C)</strong> 90% of reddit. Believes that the Apollo Moon Landings were absolutely real, because they learnt all about it at elementary school, and thereafter have been exposed to countless references to &quot;man walking on the moon&quot; in popular culture (cartoons, songs, articles, television shows and Hollywood movies). Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe we landed on the moon is ignorant and deluded. Oh, and NASA is amazing.</p>

<p>I believe the makeup of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should be mostly group <strong>(A)</strong>, with interested people from group <strong>(B)</strong>. There is enough skepticism here to engender real and worthwhile discussions and research. </p>

<p>What has happened in the last 18 months is that a large part of the growth of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has comprised individuals from group <strong>(C)</strong> and this has radically changed the way the Moon Landing discussions (an conspiracy discussions generally) go on the sub. </p>

<p>These <strong>(C)</strong> individuals are perfectly entitled to believe what they want, but there comes a point where if the Moon landing believers outnumber the doubters, the sub has ceased to operate as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub at all - it has been absorbed into the mainstream. That is not what the real users of this sub want. </p>

<p>Let us be honest, the vast majority of redditors are ill-disposed towards <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and you only need a relatively small percentage of them to join <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to completely overwhelm the &quot;real users&quot; sub and render it not-fit-for-purpose. This seems to be where we&#39;re heading, and we need to give real users their platform back.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: As usual TMOR linked, then brigaded this post. Members of Conclave who want to discuss how we should deal with TMOR and other &quot;personae non gratae&quot; who are attempting to neuter <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> please do so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_conclave/comments/85kqda/when_mainstream_anticonspiracy_views_predominate/">here</a></p>

<p>We do. &quot;Real users&quot; being those who actually want to discuss and read about conspiracies, and who will entertain new ideas with an open mind. </p>

<p>Real users don&#39;t follow links from other subs like TMOR to post anti-conspiracy comments and manipulate vote totals.</p>

<p>Real users don&#39;t simply parrot mainstream talking points, and have the common sense to realise that MSM-endorsed conspiracy theories are largely bullshit. </p>

Many people believe we are witnessing the unraveling of one of the biggest conspiracies in modern politics, many believe we are witnessing the Deep State trying to frame a sitting president. Fine. Argue those ideas instead of saying one of them doesn’t belong here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this is CONSPIRACY where people are free to discuss CONSPIRACIES with an open mind.  The problem is that half the mods now run the same excuse as you: &quot;Oh, any MSM conspiracy is bullshit and you&#39;d have to be an idiot to believe them&quot;.  THIS SHOULD BE THE PLACE TO DISCUSS THEM, EVEN IF YOU DON&#39;T AGREE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally, Automod hides these TotesMessenger posts showing the latest brigade from TMOR, but I have approved it as it helps demonstrate my point about that sub brigading ours. It is obsessive and relentless.</p>

<p>Of course, you may ask yourselves why those TMOR wankstains never get punished by the Admins for brigading. You could even ask the admins directly, but they won&#39;t give you an answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t come from that link, but I have been on that sub. For me, and I would assume a few others, there is another reason I occasionally take a look here: macabre curiousity.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t quite remember how I first got linked to this sub but there have been more then a few posts in the times that I&#39;ve visited that have been so bizzare and twisted that it genuinely piqued my interest. Not like enough to get worked up over, but definitely enough to have me invest my morning commute. It&#39;s a bit like going to have a look at some of those green texts on 4chan or looking under rocks as a kid (at the creepy crawlies). I appreciate this may not be a very nice analogy for anyone here who takes this stuff seriously but I tend to keep myself to myself.</p>

<p>From this sub I got linked to topminds and I have to admit they do an ok job of distilling some of that weirdness down for me (I actually think like every sub the hit rate for posts is low but then they tend to keep an eye on lots of subs). It&#39;s like a greatest hits of some of the stranger shit going on on Reddit. Like any sub there are people who clearly take it too far and are way too involved but for an outsider it can be quite entertaining for 30 mins a month or something.</p>

<p>It is more about pointing and laughing at people who view things differently than the common group think of that community. The people there revel in the validation they feel by pointing at  and feeling superior to a particular subset of reddit. It is a group that is designed to eat away at diverse thought in the reddit userbase, and is the epitome of what is colloquially termed a &quot;toxic&quot; community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of agree with your second bit, but again I&#39;m just saying you need to put it in context. I mean there are people here who look for validation by claiming to be superior to the entire majority of the population. Case in point: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85ewdz/why_arent_we_talking_about_parkland/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85ewdz/why_arent_we_talking_about_parkland/</a> <a href="/u/HackQuack">/u/HackQuack</a>&#39;s comment with +50 karma referring to people like me as &#39;lemmings&#39;. Do you think those people feel superior? </p>

<p>As for the toxic bit. Yes and no. I think there are lots of people who think this sub can at times be toxic. The problem is that I get that for lots of you guys this is idle chat, and that for the vast majority of those who take it seriously they still understand about human boundaries and compassion. But the issue of conspiracy theories spilling over into the real world and hurting people has been a problem for a few years in America. And this sub doesn&#39;t always do a good job of collectively drawing a line and saying &#39;no - this is unacceptable&#39;.  I remember reading a post on here about Chester Bennington&#39;s death that really unsettled me. Not because it was plausible - but because the tone of the post and of many of the comments were along the lines of &#39;we need to wake his family up to this, they need to be informed and if needs be confronted&#39;. So when we talk about a sub being toxic yes I agree topminds is quite mean spirited but there are other ways for a sub to be toxic besides that.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think it matters too much either way to be honest. I mean I hope this sub stays open and I don&#39;t get banned or whatever but what I would definitely say is that if you have some more bizarre and unsettling subs for me: yes please. I could do with some new rocks to look under...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I REALLY don&#39;t want to advertise, but if you are interested in specifically fringe ideas, go look at subs that are dedicated to specific fringe topics. They tend to be smaller subs, but they really let their freak flag fly. In a big group like this, the posters tend to be a bit more reserved.</p>

<p>There are also subs that are dedicated to self mutilation and gore specifically that i dare not mention by name but I find that the fact they still exist on reddit (albeit  quarantined) and are sort of well known disturbing when there is a big push to ban groups that are controversial.</p>

<p>Now to address the toxic bit. the Top Minds sub has a LONG history of targeting specific users. There is occasionally efforts put forward to curb that, but really only enforced on posts and RARELY in comments. I mean that is the whole point of the sub, really, to go &quot;look at this person! They said &lt;x&gt; thing. They sure are stupid.&quot; That is as targeted as anything that fat people hate was accused of. I have seen a large number of redditors post about their harassment from the users of that sub after a post of theirs gained traction, and a handful of people quit reddit altogether as a result.</p>

<p>Now you can go ahead and focus on the idea of conspiracies &quot;leaking out&quot; and focusing on people outside of reddit, but realistically those sorts of calls to action are an overstated minority and rarely gain any sort of traction from people at large. Most of the people they speculate about are WELL out of their reach. That is QUITE a bit different than a sub dedicated to harassing other members of the same website, who are directly linked to and easily targeted.</p>

<p>As for the conspiracy users who think they are superior to others because of the ideas they subscribe to, they really are no better, but on the bright side this sub isn&#39;t dedicate to them posting about users who they think are stupid. There are assholes in every large group, but that is a far cry from a group dedicated to being assholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah fair enough not advertising. Again I&#39;m not looking to oggle car crashes - or watch people have sex with weird shit (well anything really) - like I say I like to check out the creepy crawlies once in a while. This sub is pretty good for that, as is T_D, cringeanarchy, braincels, the red pill subs, and that sort of thing. Macabre, but harmless, curiosity.</p>

<p>As for</p>

<blockquote>
<p>focus on the idea of conspiracies &quot;leaking out&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not focusing on it. I&#39;m just trying to tell you that one of the things that got me on Reddit in the first place was all this conspiracy theory bullshit. I started hearing about &#39;pizzagate&#39; and so did a teeny bit of digging around to see what was going on. Since then there have been many more stories leaking out of reddit and into the mainstream - the families of the victims of Sandy Hook being harassed - the current case with the family of Seth Rich (which made the front page of the BBC here in England recently). You need to understand that if you want to read about the Seth Rich conspiracy it&#39;s going to take you here. And as an outsider you come on here and you see a bunch of upvoted posts claiming Seth Rich was murdered by Hillary and that is toxic.</p>

<p>As for the fat thing I also think it&#39;s different attacking people for what they say over how much they weigh, but I still don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m supporting or defending harassment or brigading. I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>I would like to say I think you may have miss-stepped slightly in your defense. This sub is about promoting and sharing conspiracy theories and almost all of those theories involve attacking other people. I mean I have seen conspiracies on this sub that, in order to be true, would mean members of my family are evil. As it happens I think it&#39;s all mostly so ridiculous I don&#39;t even bother to engage but again you should be aware that it&#39;s not nice to read. Again there is a human cost to making these sorts of accusations. I think do topminds goes to far, often, in their rebuttals, but at the same time if you throw mud around you can&#39;t complain about getting it thrown back.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a reading comprehension problem, because in no way did I state I should get to decide who gets to be here and who doesn’t. I also don’t get to say what criteria will be used in choosing who is allowed and who isn’t.  Oh that’s right, it’s because I didn’t. So why don’t you take your salty little crocodile tears somewhere else. Ok buttercup?!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recognize your username but haven&#39;t seen it in awhile on threads I frequent.  This is by no means an attack on you in the least. </p>

<p>That post is rather disheartening because it seems that we are headed down a path where it will be the norm in a sense of &quot;shape up or ship out&quot;. I really like this sub, I visit here multiple times daily and more often than not lurk. Recently though the actions of certain users have made me want to participate more now than I&#39;ve ever felt the need to before.</p>

<p>This sub is under attack and it seems to be an inside job. When I look back at that nomination thread from the secret sub I&#39;m sickened by the fact that there&#39;s a specific user whom calls out another user in an extremely aggressive manner and is not chided by the mods or reprimanded. I also think that user is the same one who runs all of the various Shill variation accounts and that&#39;s the reason they&#39;re allowed to continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I’m still here.  The mod log would answer that question fairly quickly, however.  I make it a habit to check it frequently because it gives you a good idea of what mods are doing what, when, and how often.  It used to be easier to search through because you could click on an action like banuser and it would only show those actions.  Not sure why it changed, or if it was on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that as well. It used to be really easy to sort through bans, removed comments, and approved comments and get a general idea of what was going on. Another thing that has made the mod log even more inconvenient is the massive flood of automod content in there. At times I&#39;ll have to go through two or three pages of just automod before seeing anything by an actual person. I guess this means that the massive amounts of indiscriminate reports that the mods were complaining about must have stopped, because I see very few &quot;Approve Posts/Ignore Reports&quot; in the log anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand corrected then, but let me clarify a bit.  There might not be a secret Discord used by all mods, but that doesn’t mean some/certain mods might be part of Discords/whatevers that discuss/coordinate tactics.  I’m not limiting that to mods at all; there is also likely a group, or more probably various separate groups, of users that do something similar.</p>

<p>As for TMOR, I keep telling people to stop giving them so much attention.  It only fuels them.  I also think there might be an effort on the part of some users here to subtly elevate TMOR to greater visibility because it creates a tangible “enemy” to rally against, mainly to create and/or feed a persecution complex.  That’s just speculation however.</p>

<p>I say pro-government because it&#39;s not just Trump that some users take his word as gospel but also Republicans in general.  I mean, Congress probably has an even lower approval rating than Trump but if a GOP member says anything it&#39;s never questioned by these users. </p>

<p>I think the issue here was the action of a particular mod openly inviting a group who&#39;s blind acceptance of the Trump administration is definitively partisan.  And then not opening the doors, so to speak, for their polar opposites.</p>

<p>The invitation to the T_D was a double sided sword in that it showed obvious political bias to the right and in doing so encouraged far-left political shills to beseech r/conspiracy if for no other reason than to even the scale of political bias.</p>

<p>Conspiracy had a fraction of political posts before the unofficial welcoming committee encouraged an influx of shills and partisan hacks, beginning with single sticky post.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that&#39;s where the slow decline began.</p>

<p>That post was 10 months ago. If you don&#39;t think r/conspiracy had already become incredibly politicized and divided along partisan lines long before that, I have to doubt whether you were even here. </p>

<p>Because that&#39;s exactly what it was. A public invitation.  That in itself was bad enough, but then calling out the die hard DNC crowd in the same breath?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see how this comment (from a respected moderator) might have come across to those who already has preconceived notions about r/con?  It smacks of partiality. 
How many times do you suppose boards like <a href="/r/marchingagainsttrump">/r/marchingagainsttrump</a> and others of its ilk used that exact thread to &quot;prove&quot; that r/con &quot;is an alt-right, KKK hate group&quot;?</p>

<p>That one phrase gave the shills and trolls all the ammo they needed to completely subvert the community.  All while opening up the gates for for the Donald, as if inciting a civil war of left versus right radicals in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>It was incredibly politicized in the middle of 2016.  No arguments there.  I have a difficult time believing that you didn&#39;t notice sharp increase in political talking points almost immediately following the post in question.</p>

<p>In my opinion you&#39;re beating around the bush. It doesn&#39;t &#39;seem&#39; algorithms are influencing voting and those who mock conspiracies are upvoted, this is an absolute fact. </p>

<p>The old Mods who established this sub put in place rule 10 for that reason. </p>

<p>-An attack on conspiracies is an attack on this sub. </p>

<p>-Mocking a poster for their source is an attack on this sub.</p>

<p>-Any behavior in the comment section that could result in the banning of this sub is an attack on this sub. </p>

<p>100 bans a week? I&#39;m fine with 10 X that. There is a concerted effort by people who will not stop until r/conspiracy no longer exists, and they use the Mods own desire to appear unbiased as the fuel for their attacks. This is right out of &#39;Rules for Radicals.&#39;  </p>

<p>Take a page from Polkadotgirl. No mod should attempt to control the narrative, but if they even smell like a shill ban them and sort it out in Modmail. Error on the side of both the integrity of the sub and it&#39;s continued existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories have always been fringe to the culture, but have become front and center...both in revelations about events and resultant mass doubt, and the weaponizing of theories for political purposes. Now the president is under investigation based on a conspiracy theory, and numerous exist against his opponents. Every mass shooting, war, disaster, significant event is able to be portrayed as a conspiracy theory with little effort. There&#39;s absolutely shills around who just want to distracy and demean, but I think there&#39;s just a general interest in theories that keeps increasing.

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I made that comment before seeing your edit because I&#39;m on mobile and there seems to be a lag.</p>

<p>You say that we are trained to dismiss downvotes comments. I call that BS. This is a sub for free-thinkers, to insinuate that we all have that viewpoint is insulting. I&#39;m extremely fearful of the path that this sub is heading towards. It&#39;s very easy to see comments that have any amount of downvotes and to assume that all users are unable to discern what is true or false is getting to the point of asking for thought police. </p>

<p>I hope to all higher powers that this sub isn&#39;t changed in a drastic manner. It will only mean that this place is lost and has become an echo chamber, as have so many other subs. If the mods need help, open up the mod applications (in an open forum) so we the users can help out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just looking at reddit. A brigade from TMOR on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will achieve the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TMOR users will downvote to dramatically reduce, even reverse the vote count of a new post to ensure it never gains traction or reaches the front page. A dozen downvotes on a new post can kill it stone dead.</p></li>
<li><p>TMOR users will post comments denying/denigrating/deflecting from the intended purpose of a post, </p></li>
<li><p>TMOR users will then upvote these anti-conspiracy comments so that they reach the top of the page, giving the impression that most people disgree with the OP.</p></li>
<li><p>TMOR users will simultaneously downvote any comments that don&#39;t fit the TMOR narrative, to ensure those comments do not compete for attention with the TMOR placed bullshit comments.</p></li>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/854yr5/trump_white_house_associate_george_nader_was/">This is the thread I was speaking of.</a></p>

<p>If I&#39;m in any way out of line with this or any other comment, please let me know so I can correct how I may have come across incorrectly. I attempt to remain within in the rules, and would like to correct my behavior if I&#39;m crossing any lines.</p>

<p>I still believe that the truth can stand on its own no matter the attempts of others to bury it. The users that we should encourage to come here are the ones that can see through the spin and attempts to bury it. With the threads made by yourself and AP over the past day, it almost seems that we are heading towards a path of censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is like arguing that you are free of an authoritarian government and pseudo-police state because you chose to put peanut butter on your toast this morning. &#39;Speaking the truth&#39; is all fine and good - i&#39;ve been doing it on this sub for over 6 years now - but when you cannot speak without having your words twisted and your visibility diminished, its&#39; not much of an argument and it is more frustrating than it is enlightening.</p>

<p>Are you truly arguing that top-down control and manipulation does not matter? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a Conspiracy Theory about why the general state of Conspiracy Theory is now in the shitter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe for 1 second that this sub has 600,000 readers, with 6,000 online at any given time.</p>

<p>The numbers don&#39;t add up. Consistently I see the very best posts, with original research and bombshell connections established recieve zero or 1 comment in the thread.</p>

<p>The best comments are scored as 0 or -10.</p>

<p>The daily scroll is dominated by clickbait to current news. Most of those links I have already read during my daily keeping up scan of the headlines.</p>

<p>And fucking Trump Vs Crooked Hillary.</p>

<p>The goddamn Archillean Mothership could de-cloak and touchdown on the Pentagon lawn, the Inter-Galactic Ambassador grey space alien could hover down the ramp and hold a press conference announcing that Earth will be pulverized in 48 hours to make room for a space expressway, but nobody would notice because the FAKE NEWS and Liberal (Wing)Bat country would be hysterical about whatever Trump tweeted at 6:00am.
The Right Wing wouldn&#39;t notice either, because Breitbart and Fox and True Pundit and Cuckservative Media would be too busy lost in the daily Vast Left Wing Conspuracy minutia of hearsay about documents and DC chattering class gossip and cryptic Nostradamic prophecies made up by the Q LARP team.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that everything has changed since Trump.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we get back to the Golden Age supernatural topics of Conspiracy Theory like Big Foot and UFOs and Ancient Aliens and Atlantis and lost treasures and good old fashioned CIA wetworks?</p>

<p>At least those topics made sense. They were linear, motives were clear, and every new discovery made us feel good about making Progress towards Human Knowkedge.</p>

<p>Now Conspiracy Theory is mundane, a cynical mindfuck that makes you hate human nature for succumbing to petty pedestrian corruption, and worst if all it&#39;s BORING.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme, I don&#39;t give a shit if some footnote in a Court document names some crony who cross references to a front company who laundered cash to funnel Pay4Play to dozens of other shadowy front companies controlled by the CIA, Russian Oligarchs, Zionists, Nazis, Bilderbergers, Soros, Mercer, Koch Bros, yadda yadda.</p>

<p>If &quot;I Want to Believe&quot; meant doing the job of a Forensic Accountant, I would have gone to Business School.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s where it gets weird.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Conspiracy Theory becoming a Circus sideshow with an infinite number of attractions is just an accident.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s the next phase of Infowar.</p>

<p>I think 75% of the 600,000 subs here are bots. Run from both sides of the political divide.</p>

<p>I think Conspiracy Theory is intentionally being flooded to overwhelm Normies and scare them back into a state of confusion and doubt so they will shrug and give up hope of ever knowing the truth.</p>

<p>And I believe it is the US military who is doing this on a massive scale.</p>

<p>Here is why I believe this.</p>

<p>Cass Sunstein&#39;s paper &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; lays out exactly why it&#39;s probably our own Govt who is manipulating our perceptions and shaping domestic opinion so they can achieve &quot;Full Domination&quot; over the psychic battle field.</p>

<p><a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;amp;context=law_and_economics">https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;amp;context=law_and_economics</a></p>

<p>Cass is a CIA Lifer and his wife is Samantha Power, so he&#39;s not just some typical DC moocher. Cass is plugged into the dark heart of the MIC, so whatever he says, the Swamp obeys.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2w9d.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2w9d.png</a></p>

<p>Right there on that page, Cass recommends the Govt should counter Conspiracy Theory by using &quot;Cognitive Infiltration.&quot;</p>

<p>Cass suggests the Govt should become forum shit poasters and inject doubt into Conspiracy Theories.</p>

<p>You might think he means Govt employees ought to debate us and try to refute us using evidence.</p>

<p>But what Cass actually suggests is for Govt employees to call you a Fed, or a Russian Bot, or a Brock Bot or a Soros Shill or a Pierre Paid Pal or a 4chan basement dweller virgin.</p>

<p>Then the Govt keeps you enchanted like a Yogi hypnotizing a Cobea by a trickle of staged releases of unimportant faux secrets, glimpses of old conspiracies, creating a massive soap opera with a bigger cast of characters than Game of Thrones.</p>

<p>Ever notice the more leaks the more declassified dox the more Insiders tell all, the less we know?</p>

<p>That aspect has made no fucking sense to me. Never before in history has so much been exposed about The Conspiracy, yet so little has changed.</p>

<p>We are in a target rich environment. I am one of the few who has read all 21,000 pages leaked by Snowden and even I don&#39;t know where to begin.</p>

<p>Did you read a single one of the JFK files?</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Did you even download them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s only 100GB.</p>

<p>Were you just going to wait for someone else to tell you what to think? Such as CNN or BezPo?</p>

<p>I think the belly flop failure of the JFK files is the best example of Cass Sunstein&#39;s plot to neutralize Conspiracy Theory.</p>

<p>Even the Professional JFK researchers who publish books about it have been shockingly quiet about what&#39;s in the JFK files. I doubt they&#39;re even reading them. Because everyone is looking for a Smoking Gun that lays out What Really Happened on 1 easy to digest page.</p>

<p>Well, I have put a dent into reading the JFK files. I have read over 5,000 of them so far. Here is what I have found.</p>

<p>I no longer expect to find a smoking gun. What I have found is worse than that. The scale of what CIA involved itself in is breath taking. The Truth is not out there, because the Covert World is a non-linear Minotaur&#39;s maze that is so big, you&#39;ll just go in circles without ever finding an end.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the point. And that&#39;s just JFK. What about Snowden? What about Assange? What about Syria and Libya abd Benghazi and Iraq? What about 9/11? Hell, we still don&#39;t know what really happened in Iran-Contra, because John Kerry covered it up.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the Pentagon probably employs 10,000 soldiers to run &quot;Persona Mgmt&quot; apps, where 1 soldier has at least 10 sock puppets, and spams all Conspiracy Forums with useless chatter and ridiculous soeculation?</p>

<p>&quot;The Storm is Coming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;64-D Chess!&quot;</p>

<p>The question you should be asking is from 10,000ft over tge runway.</p>

<p>Why are there so many Conspiracies? Why is it impossible to discuss them because no matter what you say, you always end up where you started in the maze? Has the World gone mad?</p>

<p>Cass Sunstein discusses this on this page: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2w9e.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2w9e.png</a></p>

<p>&quot;there is a causal link between the prevalence of conspiracy theories and the absence if civil liberties...&quot;</p>

<p>This sub is a canary in the coal mine. This sub might be so bombarded with D&amp;C clickbait from an NDAA troll battalion at Fort Gordon, but at the very least, it proves we have lost our civil liverties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, excellent post, my man. Too much to cover in adequate depth, so I&#39;ll just focus on what I think is your central point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I have found is worse than that. The scale of what CIA involved itself in is breath taking. The Truth is not out there, because the Covert World is a non-linear Minotaur&#39;s maze that is so big, you&#39;ll just go in circles without ever finding an end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<p>This is an excellent way of putting it, and I think is something that&#39;s often missed by a lot of both self-described &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and those who mock them: conspiracy is not the exception to the rule; it&#39;s the goddamn rule itself. </p>

<p>&quot;But how could so many people keep a secret for so long?&quot; Because they don&#39;t need to. Each individual act of conspiracy isn&#39;t covered up by hiding it, but by engaging in even more audacious and outrageous conspiracies than the last. When one does get uncovered with documentation, the masses either pretend they believed it the whole time, or they lose interest in a couple days, only to be drawn into the latest manifestation of the Spectacle.</p>

<p>And I think a trap a lot of conspiracy theorists fall into is looking up, looking for that higher level of the game, the people with the <em>real</em> power, somehow coordinating all of the other smaller conspiracies. That if we just exposed <em>those</em> people, and took away <em>their</em> power, that somehow we&#39;d fix the rest of this mess. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t one grand overarching conspiracy, but the rest of them would go along just fine even if the head were cut off. Conspiracy isn&#39;t a particularly hierarchical issue (though that&#39;s how it often manifests), it&#39;s a <em>pervasive</em> issue. </p>

<p>The reaction in the US public to the Trump/Russia story just seems mad to me. Both sides of it, really. The supporters of that conspiracy theory think that there&#39;s high level collusion, but somehow the fucking CIA, FBI, Congress, and a Special Counsel are going to fix it, while the other side thinks a heavily indebted billionaire is their hero. I mean, fuck.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the maze analogy is great, especially once we realize there&#39;s not really a way out. It&#39;s a maze with many twists and turns, rabbit holes and dead ends, but ultimately no exit, at least out of the maze. I think if there&#39;s any way to escape it requires recognizing how thoroughly entangled in our institutions it really is, and then creating and strengthening our own communities and affiliations outside the maze. I don&#39;t think incremental reform is even possible at this point, if it ever was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that The Conspiracy can&#39;t reduce to some tiny group of ghost-like elites who have galactic brains and are pulling the n-dimensional puppet strings manipulating the masses.</p>

<p>Take George Soros. While I certainly believe he is Evil Incarnate, I don&#39;t believe he does it all by himself, like Dr Evil on Volcano Island. Soros is 87 fucking years old. How many 87 year olds do you know who can personally orchestrate a cast of thousands in a global master plan to topple Govts, destabilize populations and smash nations against each other in pointless wars, all to achieve some distant and vague goal that nobody knows and isn&#39;t even clear?</p>

<p>Your average 87 year old is lucky if they can stay awake for a few hours per day to get their diaper changed, and can still hear or see anything. I don&#39;t believe for a second that Soros is what his mortal foe the Mercers make up about him through their propaganda rag Breitbart. I just believe that Soros is a sentimental old man with a big ego who is being taken advantage of by a small army of meddling Do-Gooder Liberals who just want the old man&#39;s money. Which he is happy to throw away on their pet ideological causes. Soros being so irresponsible and giving away all of his money to radical extremists is the real problem.</p>

<p>Smashing The Conspiracy is not as simple as outing whoever these Illuminati are, lining them up against the wall (motherfuckers) and opening fire on them with machine guns. I wish it was that simple. If it was, believe me, I&#39;d be stocking up on machine guns.</p>

<p>The Conspiracy is not any finite group of Overlords, rather, it&#39;s a Chaotic emergent system that arises naturally as a consequence of our larger social super structures by which we try to impose Order upon the world.</p>

<p>The absolutely best description of just what The Conspiracy is that I have every seen was in this scene in the old cult classic movie from 1997 &quot;The Cube&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boDgkH7Yw-0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boDgkH7Yw-0</a></p>

<p>&quot;There is no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It&#39;s a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan. Big Brother is not watching you... if this place every had a purpose, it got mis-communicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a forgotten, perpetual public-works project... nobody wants to see the Big Picture, Life&#39;s too complicated.&quot;</p>

<p>With that said, I don&#39;t just accept that The Conspiracy is like a Natural Law--it is what it is, and work around it.</p>

<p>Fuck that shit.</p>

<p>I want to smash The Conspiracy into extinction so hard, that even if it takes restructuring the entirety of Civilization to make The Conspiracy&#39;s existence impossible, then so mote it be.</p>

<p>Would that make me just another evolute of The Conspiracy?
Perhaps.</p>

<p>But I have also learned the only valuable lesson from reading enough Foucault to melt m brain.</p>

<p>Words and accusations and elaborate descriptions of who did what don&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>All that matters is that you win. With such overwhelming physical force that nobody can dispute you.</p>

<p>So how can The Conspiracy be smashed from ever emerging again?</p>

<p>This is the absolute best essay ever written about The Conspiracy and what it proposes is only thing that can work.</p>

<p>Conspiracy as Governance by Julian Assange, 2006.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf">https://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf</a></p>

<p>Assange says Cryptography has made The Conspiracy too efficient. A century ago, if you wanted to
run a medium sized conspiracy, you would need hundreds of people in on it. Which meant
a hundred times the threats of leakers, double-agents, swindlers, theft, or just plain accidental failure.</p>

<p>There was a kind of evolutionary Natural limit imposed on any Conspiracy, bounding it from growing beyond
a certain size, because if it got close, it would implode upon itself due to logistical failures.</p>

<p>But now thanks to the ubuiquity of strong cryptography in everyone&#39;s pocket, all Conspiracy has metastasized.</p>

<p>There is only one Chemotherapy.</p>

<p>We have to destroy cryptography.</p>

<p>All of it.</p>

<p>By cracking it. By inventing some new math breakthrough
that makes it easier than brute force to crack all of the most popular ciphers. Then nobody
is going to invent any new ciphers, because they know this new algorithm will smash them too.</p>

<p>I consider Julian Assange as a genius not for anything he did with Wikileaks, nor for his principled defiance and self-sacrifice and risking his life to stand for Humanist Ideals, but for writing that prescient essay in 2006 and putting the microscope over the sole fulcrum driving the expansion of The Conspiracy, and putting a definition on the Archimedean lever that can move the Earth.</p>

<p>Which is why these days I no longer work on hacking, I don&#39;t care about any more leaks, I have zero faith that &quot;participating&quot; in the empty rituals of Civic Society can change a damn thing, and I certainly want nothing to do with any &quot;Resistance&quot; nor &quot;Nationalists&quot; nor any subversive factions who are so myopic to believe theatric staging of &quot;actions&quot; can make a dent in a globally emergent phenomenon. Instead, I dedicate my time to the The Conspiracy&#39;s greatest fear. Namely, the quiet, dreary and boring work of R&amp;D in math and code breaking.</p>

<p>Assange&#39;s proposal to destroy the possibility of cryptography is so frighteningly ambitious and so ludicrous on its face and sounds so impossible even after you grasp the truth of it, that I doubt anyone in the world is working on it. You&#39;d have to be certifiable batshit crazy to even try.</p>

<p>Well, at least I don&#39;t have any competition.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>I’ve seen this a bunch of times today in response to both my own and other users’ comments. It’s always weird to see a multitude of accounts using the same phrases, especially when they all seem to be intentionally derailing conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, take my top comment from t_d.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a request here. The D&#39;s aren&#39;t &quot;the left&quot;. We need to do this together, fuck MSM and their labels. The D party pissed on the left in the primary. One thing Bernie Sanders and Trump have in common is that we both believe in the people, we may have different opinions on how to go about things, but we have to take down the establishment together before we can ever get into the position of bickering about differences in implementation. We both have passion to make this country represent its people again and actually give a shit about our concerns and have our voices be heard. I have thrown away my &quot;liberal&quot; card the moment the corporate assholes that are the D party decided to hijack the label. The establishment right has done the exact same thing with the label &quot;conservative&quot;. They just muddy the waters and make the label so vague that it has no real meaning. This isn&#39;t about the left or the right. This is about us, the American people demanding to be represented. We need no political aisle. Together we can do this.</p>

Ive been browsing r/conspiracy since 200k subs and these posts are super sketchy to me. They have always seemed like problem, reaction, solution in order to &quot;manage&quot; or depose mods. Or, to increase questionable censorship. I dont mind if people believe in the moon landing or not. What i mind is dumbass shit-posts like this from mods or non-mods because they have never &quot;helped&quot; this sub, its content, or the quality of its mods.</p>

I do agree, however, that it seems like there are a ton of users that don&#39;t seem to believe in any conspiracy theories, and who are only here to ridicule anyone that does.</p>

<p>With regards to the users who don&#39;t believe in conspiracies, we are entitled to question their motives for hanging out in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s a bit like a hundreds of evangelical Christians lurking in <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> and systematically downvoting posts disputing the existence of God.

    <div class="md"><p>What can you do when the system is spending real money to hire real people to take a conspiracy conversation off track?</p>

<p>I think this sub is flooded with bots and shills and I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ve had exchanges with a few of them and what can anyone do about that when Reddit is based off of anonymity and no user really knows anything about another user and this makes trying to fight the system an uphill battle.  </p>

<p>And remember, this is the same system that has injected this bullshit about the earth being flat.  The flat earth thing is relatively new and it only started becoming popular in the last two years but whoever launched the campaign were surely successful at it because a few of my dumbass co-workers have asked me if I felt the earth was flat.  </p>

<p>But I feel the Mods are going to make things worse if they try and fix a system that&#39;s unfixable.  I mean, how can you fix it if you really don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with but on the other hand, I would stop visiting Reddit if they required my real name like Facebook does.  </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I made that comment before seeing your edit because I&#39;m on mobile and there seems to be a lag.</p>

<p>You say that we are trained to dismiss downvotes comments. I call that BS. This is a sub for free-thinkers, to insinuate that we all have that viewpoint is insulting. I&#39;m extremely fearful of the path that this sub is heading towards. It&#39;s very easy to see comments that have any amount of downvotes and to assume that all users are unable to discern what is true or false is getting to the point of asking for thought police. </p>

<p>I hope to all higher powers that this sub isn&#39;t changed in a drastic manner. It will only mean that this place is lost and has become an echo chamber, as have so many other subs. If the mods need help, open up the mod applications (in an open forum) so we the users can help out.</p>
