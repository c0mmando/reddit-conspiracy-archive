        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel like the more you get into history and conspiracies, the more prone you are to have anti-semetic beliefs. I have absolutely no animosity towards Jewish people, but the more i look into history, economics, and the mainstream media, the more i see that international bankers/media have controlled world events and a lot are Jewish. Sometimes I scare myself because I wonder if neo-nazis aren&#39;t as stupid as people make them out to be and they might be the ones who know &quot;true&quot; history behind world events. I can be completely wrong so if someone wants to educate me...please, please do! </p>

<p><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/International_Jewish_conspiracy">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/International_Jewish_conspiracy</a></p>

<p>Edit: my rationale comes from &quot;the people who control the money supply, control the world&quot; quote from President Garfield I believe.  Since they have all the power, and history shows that jewish people have largely been control of the financial sectors, is it that crazy to say that those have controlled the world and have the most power do tend to be Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word Holocaust used to be a word in Hebrew that was changed and is now thought of for one thing, which is what most people when they hear the word.</p>

<p>It actually used to mean a burnt offering. Or a child sacrificed to burnt offering. Like Moloch worship.</p>

<p>By changing this meaning they have made people ignorant and unable to use this word with a true meaning in it&#39;s reference to history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. My question was always who decided to call the slaughter of &quot;muh 6mil&quot; a burnt sacrifice to their God? Rabbis? Common peeps? I realize that Yahweh is a god  of war and seems to have a  insatiable desire for violence and slaughter. He also required animal sacrifice early on. Dude loves blood being spilled. Strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the jews are used as fronts and proxies. the nobility doesnt like handling money, in part because it is considered dirty and majorly because they have better things to do, such as keeping a low profile and leading a leisurely life. but the jews dont mind money, so they manage it on their behalf. tis was like this since the medieval times, since the big italian banking families were established in genoa, venice, etc</p>

<p>both the european royal houses and the papal court keep a bunch of &#39;hofjuden&#39;, court jews, or court factors, and the likes of rotschilds and soros are eactly that.  most of the money they handle is not theirs to keep.</p>

<p>here is a the meeting of the chabad lubavitch rabbis, often pointed at as being the jewish cabal capstone. they are lucky its not raining: <a href="https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2770602/jewish/Thousands-of-Chabad-Lubavitch-Rabbis-in-Annual-Photo.htm">https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2770602/jewish/Thousands-of-Chabad-Lubavitch-Rabbis-in-Annual-Photo.htm</a></p>

<p>and then here is the holy roman empire: <a href="https://kek.gg/a/6wqnBm">https://kek.gg/a/6wqnBm</a>  they look more like top boss to me. they are the ones hiding behind the jews and also directing all the hate and blame at them. they own the western civilization, including israel, including jerusalem. its a papal holy land really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we live in a society that we share with those we hate.  that society offers us roles to play and some of us are angry at the role others are granted.  There&#39;s a lot of terms for this mental state, Nietzsche called it bad conscious.  It looks like the tight-end is mad because the qb gets to throw the ball all the time.  If you got a problem with the game, getting mad at the players isn&#39;t gonna change that.  If you are angry at the players, then you are playing the game exactly the way you&#39;re supposed to.  Get real or get rolled.</p>
