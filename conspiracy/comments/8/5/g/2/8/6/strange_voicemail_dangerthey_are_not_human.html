<p>So some guy gets a weird voicemail, turns out it&#39;s military code that translates to:</p>

<p>&quot;Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human SOS danger SOS&quot;</p>

<p>It also gave coordinates near Indonesia, close to where the Malaysian Airlines flight disappeared.</p>

<p>Wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people keep posting about this without looking? There are so many copies of this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the reason people are focusing on this is to push away from other stories.</p>

<p>I mean users went from 5000+ to 7000+ just in these last few hours.</p>

<p>And this story keeps popping up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm i hadn&#39;t seen it before tonight. What do you think focusing on this is pushing people away from? </p>

<p>I only posted it because I found it interesting, and wanted to see if anyone had any other thoughts or theories on what it might be or mean. My first thought was obviously elaborate hoax; but I still found it interesting enough to want to discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also...when you say users went from 5-7k, are you saying users of this sub? As in 2,000 more ppl have subscribed in the last few hours, in correlation with the repeated posting of this story?</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s the real conspiracy...like I said, I just found it interesting, and thought this was the obvious place post it. But I doubt that 2000 other people had that exact thought process. So maybe this story is some sort of red herring to distract the people interested in this type of stuff from something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...&amp; no need to downvote, I&#39;m trying to have a civil discussion here. I admitted not searching first was my mistake, and if there&#39;s a better thread for discussing this story I&#39;ll happily head on over there.</p>

<p>That said, I think we might have stumbled on to a conspiracy within this conspiracy. Given the multiple new users and threads about this story; could this story itself be some sort of distraction meant to divert attention away from something else?</p>

<p>I mean this story&#39;s got everything: spies, secret military codes, aliens (or non-human entities) mysterious origins and geographic coordinates...even that damn disappearing plane. It&#39;s beginning to strike me as a little TOO juicy. And as Hermeticism mentioned maybe this story&#39;s purpose is to distract from something else...we have to go deeper!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha same pretty much.  Was discussing this with my lady friend and she&#39;s convinced that they&#39;re here among us already. Idk about all that, but it it&#39;s anything like the less horrific alien encounter movies  (ie. The alien series, predator, starship troopers, body searchers, the thing, etc. etc.) I think it&#39;d be pretty cool, and hope I live to see first contact.</p>

<p>Though what a race capable of FTL or inter-dimensional travel would want to do with us (aside from steal our resources and/or precious bodily fluids) is beyond me.</p>

It&#39;s pretty safe to say the call was deliberate, maybe not to this individual.

<p>Interesting statements about the original posters accounts going missing, also people re-posting getting Indonesian threat messages.</p>

<p>One of the OP&#39;s also had a guy taking photos of his house.</p>

<p>Half of the technical ideas such as the solar flares boosting the phone call, and the fact that a BlackBox would even make a phone call, particularly one with a non-generic message such as &quot;They are not human&quot; is too far-fetched.</p>

<p>Juicy idea for a conspiracy though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, but I&#39;m leaning toward ridiculous. I <em>think</em> the numbers at the end aren&#39;t coordinates, but a phone number. +42 is the country code for the Czech Republic and if you&#39;re dialing within the country, you&#39;d put a 0 at the front. </p>

<p>Also, I looked up the number and people have been getting dropped calls from this number since February. No weird voicemails though, so idk what to make of that. </p>

<p>And, I saw someone post something about an app you can use to do this to fool your friends. </p>

<p>Plus, this makes no sense. The <em>military</em> is going to use the phonetic alphabet (a child could decipher that code) to relay a message 
1. This sensitive &amp; 2. This long?! </p>

<p>Seems absurdly absurd to me.... but I could be wrong. </p>
