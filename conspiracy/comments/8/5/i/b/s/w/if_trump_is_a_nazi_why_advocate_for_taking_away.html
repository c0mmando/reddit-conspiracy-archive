        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the big issue that leads me to conclude these shootings are all staged and fake, and that the MSM is focusing on short-term clickbait issue-based narratives. Not the truth.</p>

<p>Almost nothing now reported by big media seems authentic or credible anymore. Maybe entertaining, but nothing we can rally around anymore as ‘my America’. </p>

<p>I’m not going to link to evidence, just let the idea sink in that our media is now treating us all like we are dumb.</p>

<p>ARE WE ALL THAT DUMB?</p>

<p>Maybe the truth is boring, but tonight I saw on the news where a woman in CA was interviewed and she repeatedly stated Trump is a Nazi. Repeated it over and over. </p>

<p>I laughed at how the media created this monster, then I realized the true amount of fear in my body when the very next story discussed was Parkland and the anti-gun narrative.</p>

<p>WOW. They are that blatant about it.</p>

<p>Are we really falling for the “Donald Trump is a Nazi, but don’t worry, you won’t need these guns either” narrative?</p>

<p>Edit: I wrote this at the end of last week and have casually brought this up 10 times. It leads to fantastic conversation, and you’ll see most are willing to ponder.</p>

<p>Try and wake as many people up as you can with this message, not everyone will see it, but it’s opened a lot of eyes around me in the past couple of days. Our MSM gives is all the truth we need from their lies.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone. Godspeed.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the work of Gustave le Bon? He is considered to be the grandfather of what we now call &#39;crowd psychology&#39;.</p>

<p>More than 100 years ago he was writing about the very phenomenon you are describing. PDF <a href="https://archive.org/details/crowdastudypopu00bongoog">here</a>.</p>

<p>Anybody with a serious interest in learning not only about the mass deceptions taking place today, but <em>how easily the authorities can get away with</em> their deceptions, will benefit from reading even just the first chapter of that book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve had two family members deeply affected by gun violence, on two separate incidents decades apart, and on both occasions I was very vocal about discussing the root of the issue — you guessed it probably — MENTAL ILLNESS. </p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Both times the VERY LIBERAL media took it and used it for gun control debates, and absolutely nothing mentioned about the meds the shooters were on, mental state, BEHAVIORAL SIGNS MISSED, and finding out that they should have been in treatment instead of out shooting people. None of that discussed.</p>

<p>Only, “how many victims do we need until proper gun laws”.</p>

<p>WTF? </p>

<p>Let’s talk about dealing with our mental illness problems and the drugs people are prescribed.</p>

<p>One thing to consider, how come we haven’t seen the Uber driver interviewed by the media? Was the driver Cruz’s handler?</p>

<p>Why did Cruz only use 10 round magazines? 30 round mags are abundant whereas 10 round mags are just about unicorns to find at gun shops. Maybe to illustrate that even a 30 round mag ban doesn’t go far enough and that even 10 round capacity is too much? There goes every semi-auto weapon that can hold a magazine.</p>

<p>The FBI is well known for picking useful idiots to ensnare into stings to make it look like they’re stopping terror attacks. Maybe this one was allowed to go live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the moment they reported the cops stayed outside to maximize body count, the news stopped reporting on it and suddenly packages in Austin TX started exploding.</p>

<p>Gun control debate now on hold, going back to standard fear mongering!</p>

<p>And no, nobody died, they kept real officers out because they didn’t want anyone ‘pretending’ to get shot by a real bullet. The coach they claim who died was no longer at that school, and there is much more leaking out about it being a hoax.</p>

<p>They couldn’t take the chance they would accidentally shoot the people decorating the ‘crime scene’.</p>

<p>The trigger for me was the students who have fake injuries, knowing from a close friend’s unfortunate personal experience with an AR-15 how long it takes to recover. </p>

<p>These kids are clearly faking it. </p>

<p>My guess is Trump knows, has proof it was staged, and will use the evidence he has to red pill Americans when needed. Trump has quite a few red pills to hand out I hear.</p>

<p>It’s far easier that Sheriff Israel, Noodles Schultz, the deep state FBI people, and that BLM School Superintendent colluded to sweep under the rug all of the red flags this Cruz kid was waving for years. Cruz was groomed to do this attack.</p>

<p>The planned FFs using crisis actors under Obama  didn’t work because they were such obvious fakes. Just before Trump was elected, they switched tactics. The deep state FBI has been running the show ever since. Just look at the FBI’s involvement in the Orlando attack and all the other attacks ever since. Las Vegas has FBI creepiness all over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he is a Nazi. But the argument for taking guns away would be that a majority of gun owners don&#39;t what that belief with him. Nobody to fight back if you take them away. </p>

<p>Now, that being said, you&#39;ve fallen into the trap of equating all gun owners and Nazis. Take that garbage somewhere else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you misunderstand the point of my question?</p>

<p>I’ll say it a different way...</p>

<p>If Trump is a Nazi like they claimed for the last couple years, is it smart to advocate for the removal or erosion of gun ownership for Americans?</p>

<p>It hardly seems arguable, but I’m willing to listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading more comments, I think what you&#39;re trying to ask is</p>

<p>&quot;If the liberal media believes Trump really is a Nazi as they have claimed for at least a year, why would they also advocate for voluntarily turning in guns?&quot;</p>

<p>Well there are several ways of looking at it. </p>

<p>1) there is the &quot;Trump is a puppet&quot; theory. A lifelong Democrat runs for office as a Republican and wins. Maybe he has really changed his thought process. Maybe he is a puppet and when you get people to turn in their guns you can do whatever you want. It&#39;s a bad strat though because most gun owners don&#39;t give them up No matter who they are associated with. Just because an ar15 was used in a school shooting doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to get rid of mine. </p>

<p>2) the more likely one... they love fearmongering. It gets them ratings to say Trump is a Nazi. It gets them ratings to say guns are bad. Why wouldn&#39;t they push that as much as they can? Sheeple eat that shit up faster than CNN can produce it. So it works for them. I doubt they ever talk about the oppression in ww2 when they talk about these things to avoid connecting any dots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read about Jared Kushner on Wikipedia, sometime around 2015 he had an ‘ideological conversion’. Trump did as well, around the same time.</p>

<p>The reason is because he was picked on by Obama, after popularizing Obama being from Kenya, so he decides to run for POTUS and discovers Hillary already bought the DNC. Since nobody bought the RNC after Bush, it made sense for Trump who had no real party affiliation.</p>

<p>If Obama wouldn’t have run his mouth at that one dinner I can guarantee Trump wouldn’t have run.</p>

<p>He literally ran for President out of spite and WON.</p>

<p>PURE LEGEND.</p>
