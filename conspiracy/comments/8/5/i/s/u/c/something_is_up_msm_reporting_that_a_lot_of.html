<p>edit (UPDATE): Just watched F&amp;F interview with guest Hannity, who stated right away that he was rolled out of bed unusually early to make a special appearance on the split screen. He confirmed a (late night) WhiteHouse statement that Mueller would not be fired, but nevertheless trotted out a comprehensive list of anti-investigation bullet points. Maybe Trump &amp; Co needed Hannity&#39;s face up early to calm the markets? Dunno, but it was clear that Hannity was definitely on an out-of-the-ordinary earlybird mission.</p>

<p>edit II: Trump is on the Twitter warpath early this morning...already his 2nd tweet on the subject (<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975720503997620224">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975720503997620224</a>). Incoming...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m traveling right now and saw talking heads on international edition of CNN reporting from in front of the White House where the lights were indeed <em>on</em>. Can&#39;t verify their claim of &quot;unusually early&quot; but assume they stake out the place regularly in the wee hours. </p>

<p>As to proof of conspiracy, no, don&#39;t have any...yet. If there is any, then Mueller would have it, or not. In whichever case, if he gets fired today, then we cannot know whether there was any conspiracy or not. That&#39;s the whole point of the investigation.</p>

<p>This sub is slowly being diluted into a team sport and the quality of what is passing as an engaging informative topic is diminishing rapidly.  </p>

<p>Have a nice day sir, your theory maybe correct but at this point it adds nothing to the conversation beyond what I perceive to be wishful thinking at this juncture. </p>

<p>This collusion story is certainly a conspiracy committed by one side against the other. The evidence available at this moment is inconclusive as to whose side is guilty of it.  </p>

<p>Otherwise, yeah, it&#39;s looking more like a false alarm. Just checked Fox &amp; Friends front page and saw caption reporting that Mueller would stay. Not sure if that is what they are actually saying or who their source is, but Trump is already up and linking the show (<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975707627182219266">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975707627182219266</a>). Maybe someone there who is watching can confirm (thanks in advance). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair question. It&#39;s clear to most everyone, regardless of your politics, that this political pot has reached a boil. Further, it&#39;s a Monday morning after an even more brutal than usual weekend news cycle. I still believe the hammer is about to fall. All the signs are there. There you go...my LARP-free 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are aware the Trump didn&#39;t fire McCabe, right? That it was Jeff Sessions acting on the recommendation from the OPR? Flynn is facing jail time for lying to the FBI, despite the agents who interviewed him believing he didn&#39;t. Why shouldn&#39;t McCabe be held to the same standard others are? The IG&#39;s been conducting an investigation for over a year now. I believe that investigation is what led to his dismissal. The news cycle is nothing new regarding Trump. This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve heard rumors that he&#39;s considering firing Mueller and how there&#39;s a clear line in the sand. Didn&#39;t happen then, I see no reason to believe it&#39;s going to happen now. You could absolutely be correct. It&#39;s quite the leap you took though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m aware, but don&#39;t think it is a leap, even if the GOP is warning him off. In fact, that may be why the lights were on early. Maybe after Trump and his lawyer&#39;s weekend tweets, the GOP elite were calling to make sure there weren&#39;t going to be any Monday morning massacre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You left out the part about &quot;unusually early&quot;. Anyway, I just updated post to say that Hannity was roused out of bed <em>unusually early</em> for a special Fox &amp; Friends guest appearance this morning stating that WhiteHouse will not fire Mueller. Maybe Trump &amp; Co just needed him to calm the markets before the massacre later this afternoon? Stay tuned... </p>
