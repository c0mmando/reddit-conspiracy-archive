        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reality is this - Without external intervention the rebels in the Damascus suburbs are within days of losing any ability to consolidate forces and maintain a stronghold. This is a factual reality.</p>

<p>The questions now, are these: </p>

<p>How important is it to the US that Syrian rebels be allowed to fortify their positions to continue the civil war in Syria?</p>

<p>What does the US consider to be &quot;acceptable military action&quot; in its efforts to assist rebel forces in the Damascus suburbs?</p>

<p>Will Israel launch a decapitation strike on President Bashar Assad or will they launch a bombing run on the forward points of pro-Assad forces in the suburbs and claim justification for doing so under the auspice of limiting the threat of Iranian influence in the area?</p>

<p>What false flags should we watch for that would justify external military intervention?</p>

<p>Most obvious and most ridiculous: Just as Assad is liberating critical areas in the Damascus suburbs he decides it is now a good time to launch a chemical weapons attack. This attack would be on the civilians of any geographical location within Syria, it does not have to have any rationale behind it. </p>

<p>(This is an extremely important point considering the nerve agent attack in the UK. We have all witnessed the complete absence of any western power offering a &quot;rational motive&quot; in connection to the accusations against Russia regarding this. In their narrative, this is not even a valid point of discussion...I&#39;ll take it one step further and state that there has been a collaboration between western powers to create an atmosphere around the entire event that seeks to stifle &quot;any rational discussion&quot; about the event.)</p>

<p>Another possible false flag scenario:</p>

<p>Assad now decides it&#39;s a good time to let Iranian forces within Syria launch a missile attack on Israel. It could more appropriately be called a &quot;rocket attack&quot; because the chances of it doing any significant harm to Israeli citizens will turn out to be nonexistent.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason for justifying military intervention, it&#39;s going to have to occur very very soon...this is a guarantee...this is not speculation.</p>

<p>From the WaPo article -</p>

<p>Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi also said at a briefing Saturday that Russia is concerned about signs that U.S. forces could be preparing missile attacks on Syria.</p>

<p>“It’s reliably known to us that American instructors in the area of the city of al-Tanfa are preparing several groups of fighters for carrying out provocations with the use of chemical weapons,” he said, according to Russian news agencies.</p>

<p>He said poisonous substances have been delivered to southern Syria under the guise of humanitarian convoys.</p>

<p>In addition, he said, “We are noticing signs of preparation for possible attacks” from the sea.</p>

<p>“In the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, in the Persian Gulf and in the Red Sea attack groups of carriers that carry cruise missiles have been created,” Rudskoi said&quot;.</p>

The past tendencies of our government and the wider West make me think that we won&#39;t simply allow Assad and Russia to win this one...there will be, as you say, a final hammer blow...one last hail marry as an attempt to destroy Syria and Assad.</p>

<p>The problem is that too many in the West still believe the Corporate Propaganda machine...they think CNN is somehow better than RT, so they &quot;trust&quot; it and will gobble up the bullshit they feed them as justification for war... </p>

<p>&quot;The Russian Chief of Staff has been officially informed by the United States of America that it would conduct military operations in Damascus within 48 hours.
Russia has informed Iran of this and Iran is moving anti-ship missile batteries to the mouth of the Persian Gulf.  The USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group may not get out of the Persian Gulf alive&quot;</p>

<p>Quote: </p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>On Tuesday, Russian officials claimed that militants are preparing to use chemical agents in Syria, and intend to put the blame on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Tass, a state-run news agency in Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Russian Army Gen. Valery Gerasimov said that the United States is planning to then use the chemical attack as a way to &quot;furnish the so-called ‘evidence’ of the alleged mass civilian deaths through the fault of the Syrian government and the Russian leadership supporting it.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>&quot;As a countermeasure, Washington plans to deliver a missile and bomb strike against Damascus’ government districts,&quot; Gerasimov said, according to Tass.</p>

<p>Those assertions are a distraction from the Assad regime’s own use of chemical weapons in the Syrian capital of Damascus, according to Marine Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>

<p><strong><em>“It is impossible to ignore the growing body of evidence that Syria is continuing to use chemical weapons on its own people</em></strong> — a clear violation of international law,” Rankine-Galloway told Military Times. “As Secretary Tillerson said in Paris in January, <strong><em>Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the countless Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It it true? Has Syria used CWs <em>&quot;against its own people&quot;</em>, as claimed?</p>

<p><strong><em>If so, why?</em></strong> Have illegal chemical weapons been <em>more effective</em> in killing and maiming in Syria than the &quot;legal&quot; conventional weapons that have been readily available to Assad and his allies?</p>

<p>The short answer: No.</p>

<p>The long answer: FUCK NO.</p>

<p>Having done a fair amount of research on the use and efficacy of Chemical Weapons in Syria, I have learned that, compared to &quot;legal&quot; conventional weapons, Chemical Weapons have been <em>pathetically impotent</em> when targeting civilians, an <strong><em>utterly worthless</em></strong> when targeting enemy combatants.</p>

<p>In fact, the ONLY thing that Chemical Weapons are <em>really</em> good for (in this type of theater of war) is <strong><em>PROPAGANDA</em></strong>: <a href="https://deanoworldtravels.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ww1-french-gas-masks-1917.jpg">Thanks to the horrors of Trench Warfare in WW1</a>, the fear and dread of such weapons in the public mind is such that the mere <strong><em>accusation</em></strong> of their use can influence the ignorant and befuddled <em>consumers of propaganda</em> (that would be us) to support egregious offensive military campaigns that they would otherwise reject outright.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at some facts and statistics regarding the use <em>(or alleged use)</em> of Chemical Weapons, <em>and their effectiveness as a weapon</em>, in Syria from the onset of the war through January, 2018:</p>

<p>As of January, 2018, there were a total of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/U8Gaczw.png"><strong><em>69</em></strong> reported CW Incidents in Syria.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In <strong>28</strong> incidents, ZERO deaths or injuries were reported </p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>30</strong> incidents, <strong>Civilian Injuries</strong> were reported</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>17</strong> incidents, <strong>Civilian Deaths</strong> were reported</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>7</strong> incidents, <strong>Combatant Injuries</strong> were reported</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>2</strong> incidents, <strong>Combatant Deaths</strong> were reported</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a pie chart approximating the number of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ECrLhPB.png">ALLEGED deaths causes by CW&#39;s in Syria as opposed to all deaths from the war.</a></p>

<p>Here is a pie chart showing the numbers of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8qR330k.png"><strong>deaths/injuries of civilians and combatants allegedly from Chemical Weapons</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of Civilians Injured: <strong>1,145</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Number of Civilians Killed: <strong>1,016</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Number of Combatants Injured: <strong>80</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Number of Combatants Killed: <strong>4</strong> <em>(yes, you read that right - FOUR)</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is another illustration of the above data <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QtSJHOc.png">that may help</a></p>

<p>Here is a chart showing the <strong><em>military affiliation</em></strong> of  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T7WagFO.png">combatants allegedly killed or injured by Chemical Weapons</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Total Injuries 80</strong>: Assad&#39;s Soldiers=66; Kurdish Forces=12; Free Syrian Army (rebels)=2; (ISIS and other &quot;terrorists&quot;=ZERO)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total Deaths 4 (four)</strong>: Assad&#39;s Soldiers=1; Kurdish Forces=3; Free Syrian Army (rebels)=ZERO. (ISIS and other &quot;terrorists&quot;=ZERO)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Considering that recent estimates put the overall death toll of the war at ~</em><strong>500,000</strong><em>, *civilian and combatants, it soon becomes clear that Chemical Weapons</em> <strong><em>SUCK</em></strong> <em>as a weapon, at least in THIS war)</em></p>

<p>Moving along, we see that of all 1,016 deaths attributed to Chemical Weapons in use Syria, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/A7E8kas.png"><strong>92% occurred in only THREE</strong> <strong><em>(two?)</em></strong> <strong>of the 69 reported incidents</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>837 Deaths</strong> resulted from the Twin Attacks in Ghouta in August, 2013</p></li>
<li><p><strong>~100 Deaths</strong> resulted from the attack on Khan Shaykhun last year (April, 2017) <em>(figures subject to official revision)</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DRHpMP9.png"><strong>Tally of Casualties by Suspected Chemical Weapons</strong></a> </p>

<p>As noted above, 92% of all alleged CW deaths in Syria occurred in 3 incidents, and <strong>Sarin Gas</strong> was the suspected chemical agent used in each of these 3 incidents. Sarin is also blamed for 586 of the 1,145 injuries attributed to all CW use in Syria. See the above image for details.</p>

<h1>A word about Chlorine</h1>

<p>Scarcely a week goes by that we don&#39;t hear fresh allegations of Assad&#39;s forces using <strong><em>Chlorine</em></strong> as a Chemical Weapon -- usually, it is said, dropped as &quot;Barrel Bombs&quot;, dropped on innocent civilians from government helicopters.</p>

<p><strong><em>However</em></strong>, when we see the figures of the <strong><em>effectiveness</em></strong> of chlorine <em>as a Chemical Weapon</em>, we should ask ourselves: <strong><em>Why would they do that?</em></strong></p>

<p>Reviewing the compiled information on alleged/suspected CW use, Chlorine appears more often than any other suspected agent... <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DRHpMP9.png"><strong><em>but look again at the total casualty figures</em></strong></a> for Chlorine:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Total Injuries</strong>: Civilian: <strong>312</strong> Combatant: <strong>ZERO</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total Deaths</strong>: Civilian: <strong>18</strong> Combatant: <strong>ZERO</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Chlorine is not much of a &quot;Weapon of War&quot;, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Some</strong> have argued that Chemical Weapons have played a significant role in the Syrian Conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Others</strong> have argued that SPELLS, HEXES, and VOODOO DOLLS would be every bit as effective as CW&#39;s.</p>

<p>The &quot;debate&quot; continues...</p>

<p>I do quite of research on Syria and chemical weapons also...I mainly use twitter accounts of rebels such as FSA to predict where they will launch a chemical attack..</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a &quot;motorcycle gang&quot; (I shit you not) riding all over the place in Syria lately..everywhere they go they try to propagate protests against Assad...reports of chlorine gas being used on civilians soon follow wherever these motorcycles have just been.</p>

<p>Thanks. It&#39;s all original content, compiled from the Wiki source page. If there are any errors in calculations, they are mine.</p>

<p>The following are links from a corroborating peer-reviewed article published in The Lancet, showing cause of death among civilians in REBEL HELD territories. Interestingly, <strong><em>they fucked up their math</em></strong>, and I had to fix it, lol!</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/KUU33bN.png">Pie chart putting the Lancet article figures in perspective:</a></p>

<p>As the sources and methods are different, there are slight variations from the Wiki page numbers used as a source above, but in general, the figures support one another in that they demonstrate the comparatively TRIVIAL relevance of Chemical Weapons -- except in the realm of PROPAGANDA, of course.</p>

<p>Chlorine gas is easy and cheap. Hell, I&#39;d bet that 80% of Redditors have the household chemicals needed to make the cheesy concoctions in their homes, <strong><em>RIGHT NOW</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>(The other 20% have disgustingly yellow &quot;whites&quot; in their laundry, and filthy, stained toilets and showers)</em> </p>

<p>Heh! :)</p>
