</blockquote>

<p>Why exactly is it horrible for kids who are interested in and seeking out porn to be able to find it?</p>

<p>Many years ago (I assume...) YOU would have been an adolescent teen looking for porn and would no doubt have appreciated being able to find it in the quantities so readily available today. </p>

<p>What about that makes it wrong for current generations to do the same? </p>

<p>We need to stop pathologizing sex to the point where it becomes a big deal. That&#39;s where it starts to fuck up people&#39;s lives, when it&#39;s strictly off limits to them, and becomes too taboo to be spoken of. </p>

<p>I really hope that the easy availability of porn becomes a major factor of change for this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because porn isn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>I&#39;m now a 29-year old female, but I accidentally discovered porn on my computer in third grade, at the age of eight. I became obsessed with it, not really knowing why.</p>

<p>The porn that I discovered was typical, super glamorized. The women were mostly silicone - this was when Pam Anderson boobs were in style. As an eight year old girl, this was what I ended up aspiring to be.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t matter that I had two decent, intelligent parents who weren&#39;t superficial; I grew up camping, getting straight A&#39;s, did sports, and was in clubs. </p>

<p>But nothing effected me throughout the rest of my adult life as much as my porn addiction. It made me hate my body, feel like I was never going to live up to the standards of any man. Sexual journeys littered with unrealistic porn and ridiculous beauty standards are not how humans should be experiencing intimacy. </p>

<p>Did you talk to a health professional? If not, then do so. </p>

<p>Also, have you explored other forms of intimacy that does not require penetration? Or alternate forms of penetration? </p>

<p>Yes, porn may be a factor, but don&#39;t say that it&#39;s 100% the evil fault of of all your intimacy problems. </p>

<p>I hope that you both are able to find a solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think porn has historically been an organic response to the suppression of natural human sexuality. Over the past decade, with the internet freely available, it has developed into a means to fill the gap of loneliness, and can be pretty unhealthy. </p>

<p>However! I think it’s an affliction specifically targeting millennials - or rather - the most socially awkward generation. They have been raised by the internet, where generations before and after them are less dependent on online everything. </p>

<p>It will all wash out eventually. </p>

<p>Equating porn with ALL women is super-creepy and agenda driven. The fact IS that YOUVE STATED women are equivalent to porn. </p>

You&#39;re late to the party...but since you&#39;re here...and I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll respond. You don&#39;t see the danger that I do in porn. I&#39;m not speaking of any issues I may have with porn. I&#39;m speaking to the addictiual effects porn has on a society. You seem to be coming from a place...of loneliness. A place where you only think of yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Internet time; that&#39;s funny. Make sure you check your phone! I assume you are just as concerned about other addictions; food, consumerism, social media, cell phones, Netflix, romance novels, etc. From you post it appears you have some sexual hang-ups and a problem engaging with &quot;real&quot; people. Your last statements are a projection of your own inadequacies. I am far from lonely and am charitable and (unlike you) open minded. Oh, wait was that too long in Internet time to reply?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Turning us back into animals to be herded&quot;. Humans never quit being animals. Yeah, we have a conscious to make us feel a certain way and analyze our bodily functions, but we&#39;re just barely moving away from being dumb animals not the other way around. Also, porn and crack are very very different. Lastly, whats up with this sub and the porn hate? No one is forcing you to watch porn except for you, quit trying to ruin it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Psychological addiction can just be as savage.</p>

<p>Crack, as would some believe, was introduced to induce a state into a people without their consent. Aren’t we being put into a psychological state to induce an intended result just the same, whatever that intended result may be. I mean look around you. Aren’t we all fighting with each other? Aren’t we all becoming tribal? Almost, one would say, animal like??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The women of this generation are no better than the men. While the men are staring at screens all day instead of accomplishing something with their lives, women are busy obsessing over their image on social media. Apps like Tinder have also made romance a thing of the past. Now casual hook ups are the norm while marriage is becoming increasingly more &quot;unappealing&quot; to the youth. I&#39;m not an angry old man. I&#39;m a millennial myself so I speak from my personal observations here. We can not let technology strip us of our humanity. Moral values need to make a serious comeback.</p>

<p>Why you getting so defensive?
Some people actually see porn as the reason women are treated as objects and also for the #metoo movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is my comment defensive? I already said I don’t care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. I don’t care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference between me and you is I am not trying to push an agenda. Porn doesn’t control me, no media does. #metoo has no affect on me, and ultimately will have little/no effect on Hollywood or any other industry. </p>

<p>Think for yourself, friend. Once you learn to do that, all these media trends will seem much less important. </p>
