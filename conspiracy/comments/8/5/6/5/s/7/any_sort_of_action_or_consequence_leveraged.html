        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m going on small rant, please hear me out.</p>

<p>The blatant DNC rigging of the primaries and subsequent   collusion with the MSM to cover it up was far more of a negative influence in our election than internet trolls posting divisive comments on social media ever could have been.</p>

<p>Yet, &quot;there are indictments&quot; and all sorts of threats from government and pleas from the common man for some sort of legal action or consequence to come to these internet trolls, while here in the States, a complicit court stepped back, raised its hands in surrender to God knows what influence, and said it was <strong>completely okay for the DNC to have sham primary elections</strong>.</p>

<p>Now I know that terms like &quot;election meddling&quot; are subjective and can mean many things to wide swathes of people, but...</p>

<p>I am having difficulty understanding how internet trolls making comments online are a greater threat than State Sponsored Sham Elections.</p>

<p>THAT IS NOT THE POINT OF THIS RANT, HOWEVER.</p>

<p>The point of this rant is that any sort of legal action or consequence leveraged against Russian Internet Trolls, <strong>whether it be justified or not</strong>, will be setting a very disturbing precident for silencing views which are subjectively deemed to be influential in ways not pleasing to those in power.  If internet trolls can be punished for &quot;influencing an election&quot;, thats going to come back home really fucking quick.  Anyone not in agreeance with their power structure, even Americans in the good ol&#39; USA, can be punished merely for voicing dissent.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, on a greater level this isn&#39;t about any specific politician or political party.  This is about the fact that ANY group in power could silence the views of any dissent based merely on the idea that they can &quot;influence the upcoming election of 2036&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a direction we, as a country, cannot go.  I hope that everyone, regardless of your views or affiliations, understand that this is a fork in the road which will determine if we retain whats left of our freedom of speech or descend into a North Korean-style 1984 world.</p>

<p>I thank everyone that read my whole post, even those of you I have thrashed angrily in days past.  This is bigger than all of our individual upsets with each other.</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently, for the average person, 1984 can&#39;t come soon enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Internet trolls” is the preferred label being pushed by pro-Trump shill groups, so it should come as no surprise so see supporters dutifully repeating something that they were essentially programmed to think and share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sure they are internet trolls. They probably have other labels, one of which is <em>Russians</em>.</p>

<p>Look, the entire left and half of the right, including some of Trump’s own picks, are saying the Russians were involved. Eventually they are going to have to share some of that evidence, one way or another.</p>

<p>Not yet, mind you, and why would they? They’re still gathering evidence, after all, as would be expected when investigating the covert actions of a foreign government, and especially when doing so in the face of a non-cooperative President.</p>

<p>But the deal is, either nothing will ever happen to Trump, in which case eventually someone is going to have to apologize to him for the fucking witch hunt, or something is going to happen to him and someone is going to have to explain why.</p>

<p>My money’s on the latter, but I guess we’ll just have to wait and see, won’t we? This whole denial thing though is pretty obviously the work of die hard supporters who have been convinced of something that no objective observer would possibly be convinced of given the lack of any evidence one way or another.</p>

<p>So we can downplay it, deny it, ignore it, attack it, but reality is reality and what’s happening is happening and eventually, one way or another, this debacle will come to a head.</p>

<p>If you want to buy in to the propaganda of one side and defend someone when you have no idea whether he’s guilty, simply because he’s “your guy”, then be my guest. Usually that doesn’t work out too well though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC rigging wasn&#39;t dismissed...  the case was dismissed because it was outside the scope of the court, but the Judge did make it clear that he wasn&#39;t pleased with the actions of the DNC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Court continued, “For their part, the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have characterized the DNC charter’s promise of ‘impartiality and evenhandedness’ as a mere political promise—political rhetoric that is not enforceable in federal courts. <strong>The Court does not accept this trivialization of the DNC’s governing principles. While it may be true in the abstract that the DNC has the right to have its delegates ‘go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,’ the DNC, through its charter, has committed itself to a higher principle.</strong>”</p>

<p>The DNC didn&#39;t &quot;meddle&quot;.  They rigged.</p>

<p>That is worse than any internet comments that you prefer to think ruined the election.</p>

<p>NYT and then post that trash source. </p>

<p>Why is globalresearch.ca a trash source and the nyt isn&#39;t?  I&#39;ve given probably the most egregious example of nyt failing at journalism,  but I can find more if you like. You are giving them this prestige and credibility that they simply don&#39;t have. Their track record speaks volumes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Own your love of Putin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I never said anything defending Putin. Again creating strawman arguments makes your position weaker not stronger.</p>

<p>Trying to suggest that questioning the &#39;meddling&#39; narrative is equivalent to a supporting Putin is laughable. I&#39;m not taking sides, I&#39;m interested in the truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia fucks with our democratic process! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, by what stretch of the imagination is creating fake social media posts &#39;election meddling&#39;? Did they tamper with the votes? </p>

<p>At first the narrative was all about the leaked emails being stolen by russia , but that narrative fell apart when it became obvious that Seth rich stole them from the inside and was subsequently assassinated for it. (thanks Hillary!) </p>

<p>The story has completely fallen apart for anyone with even the slightest ability to think critically. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pure speculation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not.  Again read my paragraph I requoted. It was inevitable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>patriotic to publicly defend your country from hostile foreign governments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh no, defending yourself from the scourge of spam/ fake social media posts. </p>

<p>You should probably begin sanctions and aggressive rhetoric against all those Nigerian princes who keep sending me emails about $25 million in gold bullion. Clearly they are government agents &#39;meddling&#39; with the banking system. </p>

<p>Seriously, read that article on American history of election meddling to see what election meddling actually is. I can assure it it&#39;s more than fake Instagram and twitter accounts.</p>

<p>No need, you were wrong the first time you posted it and copy/pasting the same thing again isn&#39;t going to make it any less wrong. </p>

<p>NYT is a globally respected source of investigative journalism. Globalresearch.ca is a propaganda blog. </p>

<p>Makes sense why you&#39;d love them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve done nothing but bend over backwards to defend his campaign to interfere in our elections. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;re interested in pushing a discredited pro-Russia narrative. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, by what stretch of the imagination is creating fake social media posts &#39;election meddling&#39;?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you continue to pretend this was just a few Russia trolls just having some fun leads me to believe a) you&#39;re just not smart enough to understand what they did here or more likely b) you&#39;re just pushing a narrative that you know is complete bullshit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it&#39;s not.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it is. You have no way of proving how much of an effect Russia&#39;s meddling had on voters, and you continue to ignore the effect they had by ignoring anything that conflicts with your pro-Russia narrative. This is why you refused to acknowledge the NYT article I posted that details the reach their campaign actually had. Can&#39;t be acknowledging anything the conflicts with le narrative, can we?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should probably begin sanctions and aggressive rhetoric against all those Nigerian princes who keep sending me emails about $25 million in gold bullion.  </p>

<p>Maybe in some alternative universe does Nigerian SPAM emails equate to Russia interference in our election but it&#39;s not this universe. </p>

<p>Schultz said she would step down after the convention. She has been forced to step aside after a leak of internal DNC emailsshowed officials actively favouring Hillary Clinton during the presidential primary and plotting against Clinton’s rival, Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>“Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic party,” Sanders said in a statement, adding that the party leadership must “always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race”.&quot;</p>

<p>That is hilarious. So if I post alternative media, it&#39;s conspiracy nonsense propaganda. If I post MSM, then that&#39;s bullshit because I called them out for being propaganda.</p>

<p>I provide a MSM link and you completely ignored it, didn&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t you tell me how naive I was for believing anything the MSM says? Right? But now we see you loooove the MSM when you want to try to prove a point, huh? </p>

<p>So, still waiting for proof here. Let&#39;s see the DWS emails that prove election rigging. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Guardian reporting on the number of people Russia was able to reach with their propaganda during the election. You remember, the same information you ignored when the NYT reported it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/30/facebook-russia-fake-accounts-126-million">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/30/facebook-russia-fake-accounts-126-million</a> </p>

<p>I guess since the Guardian reported it that means it&#39;s true now, huh? </p>

<p>Do I have to provide statements from Warren about Russia&#39;s meddling in our election too? </p>

<p>In the meantime, STILL waiting on emails from DWS proving the election was rigged and stolen from Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>Your perception of sarcasm is almost as impressive as your mental gymnastics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right around the time of the convention,** the leaked emails revealed Hillary’s campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes**, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races. A Politico story published on May 2, 2016, described the big fund-raising vehicle she had launched through the states the summer before, quoting a vow she had made to rebuild “the party from the ground up … when our state parties are strong, we win. That’s what will happen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding, just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August. When the Politico story described this arrangement as “essentially … money laundering” for the Clinton campaign, Hillary’s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie’s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...When I got back from a vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, I at last found the document that described it all: the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.</p>

<p>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.</p>

<p>I guess Donna brazile is part of this right wing bullshit pot-pourri too. Lol </p>

<p>I gotta be honest, this whole exercise has been quite amusing. </p>

<p>How have I pretended anything like this? Lol it’s crazy to me that belief in Russian collusion is equated with a dismissal of DNC election fraud.</p>

<p>At any rate though, <strong>yeah I think a foreign country meddling with our election is worse than Americans meddling with American elections</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Internal rigging is going to happen, as it has been happening for years.</strong> Make no mistake though, Republicans are the masters of election rigging. Just ask either Bush.</p>
