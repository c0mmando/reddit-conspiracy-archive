       Today the top article is about Trump knowing a pedo lol but you know were all crazy for thinking politicians and the rich and powerful are pedos. It's funny because as long as they can throw the Trump name in they'll support it. They don't care of the children or innocent people involved they care about Trump.

       I'm sure they'll learn eventually...just like the early 2015/2016 shills once had accounts all made on the same day that posted nothing but political content...they've since learned to "mature" the accounts and have them post in minor non political subs to make them look "real".
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem, tho, is that there's really no difference, in the end, between an actual shill and a useful idiot pushing their talking points as a matter of Faith. They both accomplish the same thing in the end- disinformation.

       If you think you're able to see who a shill is or not then you're overestimating yourself. Shills have been around since Dorner.

       Words to live by. Also why I think it's important that everyone get RES and start tagging people, so as to keep track of their arguments and internal logic.

       I think they buy a lot of accounts now.  I've seen older accounts with a few years of comments about sports and video games.  Nothing political.  Then around the election they start posting almost universally about political stuff.  :/

       Haven't actually talked about that. But I can tell it really upsets you when someone thinks there might be some shady shit about Trump. You're gonna have to get used to that dude. You're gonna run into some different opinions around here.

       Or robots. Some of them completely fail to understand overt sarcasm and context.  That has become my gold-standard test.  If they reply to obvious, overt sarcasm with a "so glad you've changed your mind" then it's a robot.

       Totally agree.  Good litmus test.  I guess they are trying to get some ROI from their AI sock puppet programs.   Everything voted up here seems astroturfed to the max.  Trying to create overwhelming consensus and drown out the real users.  Head to controversial for non astroturfed content.

       There are plenty of conspiracies I believe in dude. That's why I'm here. Nah I'm not an Alex Jones type that thinks everything boils down to evil liberals who eat babies and worship Satan and the deep state is out to get Trump. I'm obviously left leaning. But I'll remind you that 911 conspiracies started on the left. Somewhere along the line it turned into a conservative movement. So I'm sure you think I'm some outsider. But I'm not.

       I love how you start out with Alex Jones (NOT respected here), used really inflammatory and easily misunderstood examples of conspiracy theory after insinuating that we believe everything without closer inspection, then followed up by conflating a serious and real issue (the Deep State actively subverting an elected President) with your previous bullshit routine.

       To be honest, I think you're just imagining that. I think you're just not used to people who don't go along with a very narrow, acceptable narrative. For some reason, you feel some duty to come here and attempt to stomp out anything that isn't within the realm of the official Deep State narrative that you love so much. I think that's disgusting behavior.

       As for myself, I've posted a variety of content here (on a number of accounts) and I actually enjoy critical thinking.

       Most of Fox is straight MSM.  There are a couple commentators who have had somewhat independent material at certain times.  But generally speaking, no, Fox is straight MSM.

       I speak as a Trump supporter (actually, Jill Stein supporter, hoping the Greens get a decent shot at a real run in a couple years), who doesn't watch any televised news broadcasts.

       Fox pushes the same conspiracy theories you see on this sub about the DNC, none of the ones against Trump. Trump calls fox to tell them about moves he’s making before he makes them so fox can report it first. Fox is pretty much state run media, yet the only conspiracies you see on this sub are about the DNC.

       The sentiment that Trump ran on has been rankling in rural America for decades.  This includes the "conspiracy" stuff.  There has been a "conspiracy" community for a long, long time.  Ever heard of HAARP?  Special markings on the backs of highway signs?  All the old FEMA concentration camp stuff?  Long time.  You can see the community face-to-face at gun shows and similar events.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been an internet face of this community since its inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a sub about "conspiracies," despite the name.  This is a sub for a very long-lasting community which predates Trump, predates Reddit, and in fact predates the Internet altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a quick filter: if you aren't on board with popular ownership of guns, have never heard of Operation Condor or the School of the Americas, and think the Branch Davidians burned themselves down on purpose, then you've come to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are not interested in learning more about those topics and are not interested in possibly changing your mind, you are probably in the wrong place.

       All of the msm narrative was about her overseeing the torture of Abu Zubaydah they also said she mocked the prisoner’s suffering in a private conversation.  Which is completely false.  NYT is referring to Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri who was there under her command of the prison for bombing the USS Cole and killing 17 people.  The CIA tortures people.  It's the least of what they do.  If I had my druthers I'd see them smashed to pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The destruction of documents is something I do find concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point being that ProPublica made her out to be a monster and a year later the rest of the msm gleefully used the false ProPublica story solely in an effort to disparage Trump and didn't even bother to fact check it.

       I don't know anything about ProPublica as I hadn't even heard of them before this story took off.  Hopefully they do what they say and work a little harder to report facts accurately.  Though I am skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       They freely admit the CIA released a statement that said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An agency spokesman declined to answer any of those questions but released a statement that was quoted in the article, asserting that “nearly every piece of reporting that you are seeking comment on is incorrect in whole or in part.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which they did include in the original article but then in the retraction they reflect:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In this instance, we failed to understand the message the CIA’s press office was trying to convey in its statement.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Really?  What was there to understand?  Seems pretty clear that their facts were wrong and yet they went ahead and published it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not trying to single you out or anything.  I just felt compelled to comment because I'm sick and tired of the shameful way journalists operate these days.  They love to bang out a juicy story that is built on sand and then profit off the attention it gets.  Later they quietly issue retractions but nobody really notices because the attention is already focused on the next 'big story.'  This was a rare instance of an old 'story' getting resurrected and then they had to retract.

       Entirely fair. I apologize if I came off as combative. I completely agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm just a bit frustrated because it seems like this sub and the r/TD community completely overlook this for conservative stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the story awhile back about how CNN supposedly scripted what one of the high schoolers at parkland was supposed to say. Thousands of upvotes here, latched onto by the fox news/Alex Jones crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when it came out that there kid's dad "accidentally" edited the emails and that cnn had actually told the kid to stick to the script he had originally submitted, that story got less than a thousand upvotes here (would check, on mobile) and a super weak retraction from Fox while most of the other news sources fully printed a correction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am keenly aware of my own biases and tribalism, so I probably overlook a lot of bad journalism when it tends to support my own political leanings, and that is not a good thing. So thank you for informing me of this. Even though it doesn't really exonerate her imho, it's good to know a more accurate story

       I love TD and I completely agree with you that it affects everyone.  So much of the bs would go away if journalism had an ounce of integrity and just laid out the facts without the bias/agenda pushing.  I blame the media for most of the problems we have in society today.  Cheerleaders for hate and discontent is all they seem to be anymore.

       There's a palpable difference between a conspiracy

       TPTB.

       And no, Trump is not part of TPTB.  That's why the media and both sides of the political apparatus as well as nearly every branch and agency of our government remains in utter opposition to him.

       My friend, I’m totally on board with the over-arching narrative you are expressing, but are you sure this observed effect is not mostly due to the fact that the vast majority of reddit-users are totally brainwashed to believe MSM/CIA narratives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to believe there are thousands of shills with tens of thousands of accounts, but we need to discuss how to prove it rather than just declaring it as fact.
