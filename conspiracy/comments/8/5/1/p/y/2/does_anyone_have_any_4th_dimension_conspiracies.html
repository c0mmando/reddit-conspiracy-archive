    <div class="md"><p>I think its hidden from our 5 senses, but our bodies and nervous system can be effected greatly. in the kaballah practise/many like it - you must transcend the wants of the 5 senses, opening up a sixth sense, beyond linear time and 3 dimensions, thus opening up your inner eye isnt for everybody, should be ready and willing to have your whole world perception, belief system, basically the ego dissintegrated, upgraded. its full of light and potential, consciousness, awarness, colors and all sorts of other visual experiences (maybe hah). I dont think it necessarily changes whether you get there on dmt/mushrooms etc, or through meditation (more difficult with all the noise in the spectrum (technology buzzin) but its not a place to go and spend great deals of time unless you dedicate your life to being a shaman, cuz its not always fun. I think with higher dosages, and more frequent and welcomed visits, one can learn a great deal about the spirit and human origin, so ultimately all occult/religous leaders/cabals currently hold many back from truth using focused fear and dark magik... really I think a lot of conspiracy stems from this itch many of us have to the matrix all around us, were locked by these three dimensional ideas/prisons, yet we really come from higher dimensions, and must do our best to return. either born semi awake or your programming wares off, maybe from off world 4D homies looking out for our race (I hope) but we then seek truth everyday, reminders that conspiracy has wrapped itself tightly on this whole system, military, government, church, media, borders and other games these few sickos play... Tapping into 4D thinking helps remind its all a trick, reality is what we make it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think it&#39;s possible to actually control the 4th dimension tho? Assume you smoke a lot of DMT or other drugs, can you actually control time, or the 4th dimension in this dimension? </p>

<p>Can you affect the real world with positive change</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think we can control it, as its the programming around our reality, but I do think we can balance it in our own bodies/minds, for the sake of our spirit, or source having full access to the moment. I believe monks and shamans etc do a lot of work in the 4th and higher dimensions, which ultimatley is reflected in our world with many positive results. when on dmt I felt time as a construct of my mind dissapear, in one session I kept my eyes open and tried to walk around the room, but staying connected to your body and 3 dimensions feels strange and you kinda just have to lay down and go inward, accept the journey. I would think doing a lot of dmt might mess up your ability to integrate into society, which is for sure normal as society seeks to limit ESP and individuality en mass, so it wont help us change the nature of society and the unfortante current human nature, but as individuals we come back with clarity of all that we do that may hurt others, including animals and nature, whether currently or in our past - so it definitely makes for positive change allowing us to be better humans, or atleast an awarness of what we need to do to be our best self. All of that ripples out, so I do believe psychadelics have potentially a huge role in lifting this planet up, and restoring empathy amoung other skills which will help this race get out of its prison setting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meditation, lucid dreaming etc... Its stuff I used to be able to do pretty easy, but as the years have gone by it gets a little scary when you start to leave your body before sleep, and grounding out and breathing here/now is the biggest challenge after opening up to all the unknown... but all is known, peace is positivity, as long as you carry that in any realm nothing can hurt you.</p>

<p>I will try to track some videos on youtube and link them, but check out &#39;enter the void&#39; a film which dives into the tibetan book of the dead. The imagery, the sounds, certain harmonics and frequencies will give you full body experiences, way less intense of course than any natural phycadelic, but if you wanna know what a dmt trip looks/feels like, that movie captures it very accuratly. the ending of Annihilation also had similar art/sound that gave me goosebumps head to toe. look into Schumann Resonance, or pick up a tibetan singing bowl, things can get pretty trippy with sound alone :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve accessed it one time through meditation and what I saw was really scary. I made a post about it. It&#39;s never happened since then and I didn&#39;t actually know reaching the 4th dimension was possible. It&#39;s truly one of the scariest things that have happened to me. But I don&#39;t think everything that happens on the 4th dimensional is negative and scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I believe your heart is the 4th dimension. If you follow it, it leads you to the 5th dimension. All of &quot;all&quot; is working together at the same time. Improving the moment, improves the future, as well as the past.</p>

<p>Source: I&#39;ve been on an incredible 4 year journey, following symbols and learning the language of the universe, trying to find freedom from 3rd dimensional challenges. </p>

<p>This whole trip has been blessed, and that is the point; you were always meant to find your treasure. So follow your heart!</p>

<p>I met God, I met a King, I met a real life Genie - at a real life magic ceremony, made a wish, found a real life treasure map, (with my very unusual name right on it) that led me to the Caribbean, where I found my treasure! The 4d journey was incredible, and led to 5d riches! That&#39;s &quot;the secret&quot;, it&#39;s all real. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got 15 days left on this journey, and I just want to make it home safe, (there was a drive-by 50 feet from me, an hour ago), to share my treasure with my two children! I am happy and content with life. I have all the treasure in the world!</p>

<p>I hope you find what you are looking for = )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d reccomend a journey down the CERN conspiracies.  there is A LOT of potential dark stuff going on there, Im no expert in physics, but what is an expert in a field studying a fraction of the scale of our visible universe, in which unexplained dark energy makes up like 90%. The meddling with other dimensions is starting to show up more and more in our entertainment (Stranger Things, Annihilation)  the idea of the void or things manifesting from it really, has always been on our minds.</p>

<p>basically what does poking holes in the fabric of reality do. our top &#39;scientists&#39; are trying capture and store dark matter, knowing very little about it or the consequences of bringing it into our world, for all living things. It takes common sense to realize if you poke a hole in the hull of a ship, water will start seeping in and eventually the boat will be consumed by water. I worry weve already made a few tears in space since discovering atomic energy again, which could explain (percieved) increased in chaos and secrecy insociety. Im pretty hopefull the balance of the forces wont let a few infantile humans throw off the balance of everything, but weve likely done so before, and had to start from a clean slate.</p>
