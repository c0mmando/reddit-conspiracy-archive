    <div class="md"><p>Go check the thread with all the folks claiming Florida was faked. My cousin&#39;s bestfriend had a daughter killed. I have met the woman multiple times and now know how she is hurting. Yet there is a giant thread of people saying nah this is fake, didn&#39;t happen, actors, etc. </p>

<p>While the molestation/sexual assault cycle is happening in Hollywood, many in this sub extend it to every famous person. The multiple child sex dungeons for all of them around the country... cmon now. Does it happen? Yeah. But this sub likes to act that its commonplace for any celebrity. </p>

<p>The worst of it all is ignoring real conspiracies. Like the president of the US acting crazy with his firings. Having his corrupt past dug into. Hell he is suing a fucking pornstar. This is like US history in the making and while people here love to call the russia narrative fake... there are so many things that don&#39;t add up with Trump oddly supporting Putin and everyone brushes it off bc Trump does no wrong.</p>

<p>Edit: Just saw the other news article about the countersuit. Is this tantamount to admitting that Stormy Daniels was speaking the truth the entire time?</p>
