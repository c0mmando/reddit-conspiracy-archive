        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a little unsettled about this Hollywood sexual misconduct crud...why all the sudden? It&#39;s not a secret that Our news media is controlled by powerful people like Weinstein--in my opinion, he could&#39;ve paid to have these accusations buried and out of the public spotlight like they&#39;ve always done.
How odd is it that since October of 2017; the news media has bombarded us with so many accusations that were burnt out and tune it out. Like a &quot;boy that cried wolf&quot; scenario...</p>

<p>Knowing how shady our government is; could the media outlets be focusing our attention on Hollywood to smear accusations like &quot;pizzagate&quot; within our government? </p>

<p>...just sharing a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we were too focused on distractions like &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, &quot;Russiagate&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Sexual Scandals&quot;, and &quot;Antifa vs Alt Right&quot;. We had been tricked into being intrigued with distracting stories instead of considering the big picture. The true enemy is hiding behind and it&#39;s a global control grid complex based on communism (With capitalism being the same thing). And we are being distracted so much that we won&#39;t talk about the real enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me Too has transformed the debate...and only for the worse. It has shifted the narrative from the <em>reality</em> of Hollywood child abuse to a critique of &quot;casting couch&quot; culture, which really isn&#39;t the same thing at all. Me Too has helped to cover up the fates of kids like Heather O&#39;Rourke, Miranda Cosgrove, Jamie Lynn Spears, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Wood, and so sooooo many more. And the Media has gone glibly along with it...because they know that the threads of Pgate/Pedogate/HW can NOT be unraveled... </p>

<p>You also need to familiarize yourself with the blog crazydaysandnights, which I will use some more comment copypasta of mine to explain:</p>

<p><strong>copypasta</strong></p>

<p>The Hollywood blog site crazydaysandnights.net has been getting more traction here on r/conspiracy, and for good reason. For those of you unfamiliar with the blog- it was founded in 2006 by a user named “Enty” who is, to the best of our knowledge, an entertainment lawyer in LA.</p>

<p>Whatever his occupation, the site has gained steady traction for what is called a “blind item”, which is a HW tradition in which gossip is spread w/ names redacted, but with hints and clues added so that the subject might be surmised by those who pay enough attention. CD&amp;N was calling out people like Spacey and Weinstein years before they were publicly exposed this fall. Here are links to these old blinds providing proof that CD&amp;N is legit-</p>

<p>Weinstein in 2016- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2016/04/blind-item-10_7.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2016/04/blind-item-10_7.html</a></p>

<p>Spacey in 2012- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/blind-items-revealed-6-anniversary-month_11.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/blind-items-revealed-6-anniversary-month_11.html</a></p>

<p>James Toback in 2013- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/06/blind-item-1_22.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/06/blind-item-1_22.html</a></p>

<p>Matt Lauer in 2014- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2014/04/blind-item-1.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2014/04/blind-item-1.html</a></p>

<p><strong>end copypasta</strong></p>

<p>I want you to familiarize yourself with CD&amp;N and how it is legit because Enty offers some more evidence for Cosgrove, Bynes, etc;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of being laughed at or made fun of, I think everything that goes on is a distraction. There&#39;s something very fucked up and sinister about this existence as a whole. That&#39;s what I find myself wondering more and more about with each passing day. Yeah, the contents of this world consists of so many horrifying and fucked up things and I don&#39;t want to make it sound like I&#39;m being dismissive when I say it&#39;s all a distraction. We&#39;re all in one rat cage or prison cell together. Religious and new age explanations for our existence just don&#39;t sit well with me.</p>

<p>Not trying to make a light joke with this, I would love for the block to be pulled out for it all to come crashing down and maybe we can all find the true answers to the many questions we seek about this existence. Yeah, I have my own beliefs about what&#39;s going on. Doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m right or it&#39;s the true answer.</p>
