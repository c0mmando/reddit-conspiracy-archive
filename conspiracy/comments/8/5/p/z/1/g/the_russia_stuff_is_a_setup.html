<p>The US election wasn&#39;t hacked anymore than any other election in the world or in the past. We play around in everyone&#39;s elections and they play around in ours.</p>

<p>The CIA has Anti-Putin Russian&#39;s in Russia. These people serve a double purpose - 1) to fuck over Putin and 2) to fuck over Trump, neither of whom the deep state likes. It turns out if you spin it the right way, you can fuck both over at the same time.</p>

<p>The rumor always was prior to the election that Clinton was going after them if she won. With the anti-Russia stuff since then, it&#39;s pretty clear the foundation is being laid. The latest assassination is just another addition to it.</p>

<p>The Russian election rigging this week was another joke. They have no need to rig elections on video when they can do it in private on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>Putin and Russia aren&#39;t perfect, hell Russia created one of the biggest threats to our civilization there is - Socialism, but this is a battle for oil and control. </p>

<p>We have millions of things that need repaired right now and housing/subways/trains would all be welcome to be built. Unless you are mentally disabled, there is a job you could do somewhere.</p>

With them gone, 12.5 million jobs and houses/apartments would be available(dropping rent prices and increasing wages) while we would have 12.5 million less people consuming our natural resources and ruining the environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not shoot for Libertarian Socialism? A decentralized state with the goals of the community in mind? There&#39;s no reason Socialism has to end in dictatorship or even with the State. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Leftist who has been drawn increasingly towards Anarchist thought and especially its Leftist strains. I think Socialism done right is the preferred end game- but only if conducted via a decentralized, stateless society based on the principles of Direct Democracy and Action in the Economy and Politically. And oriented around the Local/Municipal/Commune scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a severe rise in population, and the reliance we as a species have on one another to form communities, a proper and fully functioning socialist society is basically the &quot;end game&quot; of humans as a species. I&#39;m on my phone so I won&#39;t go into all the particulars, but the rise of the current technology we have and the increased usage of automation, a large portion of society will be essentially deadweight. And as tech advances more, EVERYONE will be deadweight. Figuratively speaking. Hopefully by that point humans will truly decide altruism is an ultimate truth, otherwise you will have to cull a large portion of society. Even if you didn&#39;t actively get rid of them, they would die off as they are unable to work, forage food, or live in society. That is what I base my assertion on.</p>
