I think it will be Economic at first- whether we end up going to war or experiencing another &quot;terrorist&quot; attack after that, I&#39;m not sure. What I do know is that we are only just now entering the Darkness...we have a long night ahead of us. But Night is always Darkest before Dawn.</p>

<p>You know the media reported on the Nixon investigation and that all ended up being true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the CIA and the bankers were behind <a href="http://tarpley.net/online-books/george-bush-the-unauthorized-biography/chapter-12-chairman-george-in-watergate/">Watergate</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason why the Watergate scandal escalated into the overthrow of Nixon has to do with the international monetary crisis of those years, and with Nixon’s inability to manage the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the US dollar in a way satisfactory to the Anglo-American financial elite.</p>

<p>It was the leading Anglo-American financier factions who decided to dump Nixon, and availed themselves of the pre-existing Watergate affair in order to reach their goal. The financiers were able to implement their decision all the more easily thanks to the numerous operatives of the intelligence community who had been embedded within the Plumbers from the moment of their creation in response to an explicit demand coming from George Bush’s personal mentor, Henry Kissinger...</p>

<p>The Plumbers were created at the demand of Henry Kissinger, who told Nixon that something had to be done to stop leaks in the wake of the “Pentagon Papers” affair of 1971. But if the Plumbers were called into existence by Kissinger, they were funded through a mechanism set up by Kissinger clone George Bush. A salient fact about the White House Special Investigations Unit (or Plumbers) of 1971-72 is that the money used to finance it was provided by George Bush’s business partner and lifelong intimate friend, Bill Liedtke, the president of Pennzoil. Bill Liedtke was a regional finance chairman for the Nixon campaigns of 1968 and 1972, and he was one of the most successful, reportedly exceeding his quota by the largest margin among all his fellow regional chairmen. Liedtke says that he accepted this post as a personal favor to George Bush. In 1972, Bill Liedtke raised $700,000 in anonymous contributions, including what appears to have been a single contribution of $100,000 that was laundered through a bank account in Mexico. According to Harry Hurt, part of this money came from Bush’s bosom crony Robert Mosbacher, now Secretary of Commerce. According to one account, “two days before a new law was scheduled to begin making anonymous donations illegal, the $700,000 in cash, checks, and securities was loaded into a briefcase at Pennzoil headquarters and picked up by a company vice president, who boarded a Washington- bound Pennzoil jet and delivered the funds to the Committee to Re- elect the President at ten o’clock that night.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was basically a set up of Nixon because they didn&#39;t like how the transition off of Breton Woods was going.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know why people assume that since the media talks about the Trump Russia shit that it&#39;s not true just because it&#39;s on TV a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">CIA</a> controls the media.</p>

<p>Apparently you&#39;re illiterate. That article was written by Webster Tarpley, who ran for Senate as a Democrat in 1986, and created the &quot;Tax Wall Street Party.&quot; The article also refers to Reagan and Bush as fascists.</p>

<p>What else would you like to lie about in order to defend the CIA? Maybe we need to start reporting all of these ridiculous straw man posts you make, because it&#39;s now proven that you intentionally distort what people say to distract the discussion in the comment section, a well-known <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">disruption tactic</a>.</p>

The ones they’re describing share a few traits other than similar naming convention, emoji usage being the most overt. They also tended to use <strong>bold</strong> and ALLCAPS for emphasis.

<p>There’s another sockpuppet group that has gibberish letter usernames, they tend to use text speak, make frequent typos, and use the rarely seen convention “r subreddit”. They also exclusively crosspost between here, conservative, t_d, t_c, thenewright, and political humor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some do, but to differing degrees. I usually look for multiple tells as well as posting time similarities. Just looking at the comments of this post there are a couple of people who use CAPS but they don’t match on other variables.  All of the listed “shill” “Bernie” accounts share both writing and content similarities, regularly and tangentially accuse people of being shills and someone named “Charles”, and also often just outright admit to the behavior and the fact that they have more alts in waiting and will get away with it. Even if they’re being facetious it’s immature and trollish behavior. </p>

<p>Also, all caps and bold wouldn’t be a good tell in certain subs, like t_d, as it could be a part of the culture of the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I know it’s crazy right? I can only assume it’s because of the brilliant play by the Trump team to associate criticism of Trump with hatred or mockery of his followers.</p>

<p>They’ve made it so his followers think that anyone who disapproves of Trump thinks they’re the worst most evil people in the world, or something. </p>

<p>So when someone attacks Trump, they take it as a personal attack upon them. It’s no surprise they get a bit defensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I&#39;m a Bernie bro, and I too think something bad is on the horizon, and have thought so for quite some time. Here&#39;s a quick look at the fundamentals of the US economy, from an old comment of mine: </p>

<p>41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

<p>I will believe when I see it too, brother. But there are definitely signs that something is on the horizon: <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/974978856997224448">https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/974978856997224448</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I know it’s crazy right? I can only assume it’s because of the brilliant play by the Trump team to associate criticism of Trump with hatred or mockery of his followers.</p>

<p>They’ve made it so his followers think that anyone who disapproves of Trump thinks they’re the worst most evil people in the world, or something. </p>

<p>So when someone attacks Trump, they take it as a personal attack upon them. It’s no surprise they get a bit defensive.</p>
