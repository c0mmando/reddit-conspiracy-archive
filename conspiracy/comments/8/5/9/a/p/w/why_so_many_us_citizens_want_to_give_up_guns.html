    <div class="md"><p>Because with privilege comes responsibility.  With responsibility comes restrictions.</p>

<p>Not everyone should own a car.  Blind people, young kids, old people, those with health restrictions - they become a liability and risk to others.  Similarly, I believe owning a gun should be similarly regulated.</p>

<p>I recognize that many will take issue with my stance and say that &quot;guns are a right, not a privilege&quot; - but I disagree with that statement.  The 2nd amendment states a &quot;well regulated militia&quot; and, to me, that reads similarly to owning a car which is &quot;well regulated&quot;.</p>

<p>So in my opinion, no it should not be easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the beautiful thing about America (in theory).  It&#39;s not about what I deserve, but about what I earn.  I earned the right to drive a car by studying for the test, passing the test, saving the money, buying the insurance and then buying a car.  I recognize that is a privilege, but it wasn&#39;t given to me, I earned it.</p>

<p>I also recognize that at any moment I can lose that right, so I follow the laws.  When I am no longer fit to meet the requirements, that right will be taken away from me, as it should be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know many poor people who have made owning a car a priority and worked hard and smart to earn and maintain the privilege.  I know many people who haven&#39;t, and rely on public transportation, or work within walking distance of their home.  That&#39;s the way it works.</p>

<p>Yes, I do have economic privilege because I work hard.  I have not always had that privilege, but I recognized nobody was going to give me anything because I &quot;deserved&quot; it, so I made up my mind to work hard and move forward in life.  I may not always have that privilege, at any moment life could go to shit and I&#39;d lose it all, but I recognize that is the game of life and to win you have to play by the rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conversation usually comes to rights vs privileges at it&#39;s core and there is a lack of understanding what the difference is.</p>

<p>Primer on rights vs privileges from a very experienced person on the topic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjhkydPddEE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjhkydPddEE</a></p>

<p>You either have a right to something that no one can take away without violating that right or you have a permission to do something which is given and can be revoked.  Privileges is taken away after due process typically or revoked by someone else exercising their right.</p>

<p>People have a right to guns as acknowledged as a human right which is in the 2A.  The first 10 amendments are the bill of rights, not the bill of privileges.  When people bring up cars and licensing they&#39;re mixing up rights and privileges.</p>

<p>If these people don&#39;t understand the difference, they&#39;re either ignorant or choosing to ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandfather was a gunsmith, so I grew up around guns.  Everyone in my family had them - men, women, kids.  But it wasn&#39;t something anyone made a big deal about.  Further, it was <em>always</em> understood they were serious, deadly and not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years I&#39;ve seen this explosion of gun culture.  Personally, I think it started with Obama, when conservatives scared the hell out of their base by saying the guns were going to be taken away.  So everyone rushed out to buy more guns.  BIGGER guns.  Fancier guns.  MORE GUNS.  Now my social media is flooded with everyone posting photos of their guns, taking selfies with their guns, comparing guns, rating guns, modding guns, screaming about how &quot;NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE MY GUNS&quot;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why does owning more guns seem to be something you think is a problem now?</p>

<p>You haven’t seen an explosion of gun culture. It has always been there. The difference is social media. Social media (the literal Satan of society) is so prevalent now it makes it hard to distinguish if something is coming more frequently or the voices are just louder and have more exposure so you think it is more often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because more guns = more problems.  In a number of ways.</p>

<p>And I agree the difference is social media.  But we can&#39;t turn back that clock.  And younger kids, crazier people, bigger extremists are influenced by social media - and gun culture - which is creating more problems.</p>

<p>Since we can&#39;t put the cat back in the bag, we must address it.  Preferably <em>before</em> I get shot in some random act of violence.  Regulation seems to be the most rational solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They jumped into this conversation in an interesting way. First they started off light talking about how they were all around guns, guns are okay but then they start to slide in with some politics and other bits with their responses. It starts with Obama, moves into shouting about people saying they don&#39;t want their guns taken, social media, rants about &quot;gun culture&quot; and then it devolves further down from there.</p>

<p>If I was going to write a post about how I support guns and then move into how I also think they are bad I&#39;d probably write it out much like this because it is subtle and most people will fall for it. </p>

<p>They could have easily made their point up front with guns being fine but wanting some legislation around it and walked away from there but they didn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion I feel like a big part of this problem began when guns went on the mass market and places like Walmart &amp; Academy started selling them.  Nobody has put this on the table, but I feel like people should have to work just a <em>little</em> bit harder finding and buying guns, so perhaps outlaw mass gun sales and leave it to gun shops who are liable for not following strict regulations.</p>

<p>Outlaw bump stocks.</p>

<p>Require the National Criminal Instant Background Check system to stay updated.</p>

<p>Raising the age of legal gun ownership to 18-21.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I believe any of this will actually work, but it may help some.  Rather, I think this is also a societal issue.  I have a crazyass uncle who has posted threats on social media while posing with gun selfies.  I&#39;ve ignored that crap for a year but finally decided to report him to authorities.  My family was aghast - but whatever, that shit is crazy and I wouldn&#39;t be okay with myself if I didn&#39;t try to do something.  We all need to be doing <em>something</em> to help put an end to the surge of gun violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government knows that if they attempt to establish total control over the population that the people will fight back—that is why the second amendment was created. It’s meant to limit the government’s power. But now it seems that the government is becoming more and more corrupt and tyrannical. Before the recent shooting in Parkland, the shooter strongly suggested that he wished to become a school shooter on social media. The FBI totally ignored this, and he proceeded to kill 17 people. This led to the nationwide walkout, which further brainwashed students that all guns must be banned. It all starts with the children. Once these anti-gun beliefs are instilled in the next generation, there will be no opposition. No more guns. No more freedom.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Nobody is asking for guns to be banned.  </p>

<p>If conservatives continue to do nothing, the next generation <em>will</em> move forward on banning guns because they will grow tired of being randomly killed due to growing gun violence.</p>

<p>But the vast majority believe that gun ownership is a right that should continue to be respected and enabled - but <em>regulated</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 1.5 million military personnel in the US. Do you believe they could hold off 250 million Americans armed with AR-15s marching on the white House? This is also assuming that the military would fire upon the people they swore to protect with their own lives. It would not surprise me is 90% disregarded their orders and stood shoulder to shoulder with the average citizen. So yeah, the people stand a chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than half of the US can&#39;t even be bothered going out to vote, do you think there&#39;s any chance they would go to war against their own government? Do you think there&#39;s ANY chance that they would even be on the same side of a civil war? Yes, if 250m Americans marched on the White House they could easily take it, but if it were possible to unify the people like that they could take the White House through Democracy just as easily.</p>

<p>Only 1/3 of American households even own guns, what do you believe the chances are that a majority of Americans decide to unify and take up arms against the government? If you have the numbers then voting is far more effective than shooting, if you don&#39;t have the numbers then you&#39;re screwed anyway. This image of 250m Americans marching on the White House is purely delusional.</p>

Because worst case is the only way people will take action. Idon&#39;t know what type of scenario you are thinking about. When the grocery stores are empty for a week and gas stations are bone dry for weeks, then people will take action. Parents will not let their children starve. </p>

<p>There are over 300 million guns in the US, I&#39;m sure if necessary neighbors will pull together and lend an extra gun. You asked if the plebs really thought that they had any real chance vs the almighty US military. I gave an answer that absolutely would work if people would get off their fat asses. So your &quot;delusional&quot; insult was added at the end just for the sake of insulting my idea, because you admitted it would work. Thanks for the enlightening chat.</p>

You&#39;re describing a situation where the US has become a third world hellhole with no democracy and somehow everyone&#39;s still holding onto their guns, hundreds of dollars worth of weapons when they can&#39;t even afford food.

    <div class="md"><p>If we have no gas for 2 weeks and trucking/transportation is halted it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve reached 3rd world status. I envisioned children going hungry which forces  parents to take action, whatever that may be. It might be  walking to the WH or simply your local courthouse because that&#39;s as far as you  can travel.</p>

<p>If it reaches the point where food shelves are empty a gun will be your best friend for protecting your family from desperate people who will do  anything for a little food for thier kid. IMO it would be the most important tool you could own in that situation. So it&#39;s very realistic in my case because I&#39;ll do anything to protect my family.  To each their own though. Hopefully neither of us will ever have to experience a situation like that.</p>
