    <div class="md"><p>Look up Jewish Bolsheviks, the pale of settlement, the Red Terrors in Russia, Hungary, Spain and German, the Holodomor, the German Revolution in aftermath of WWI, the blood ritual murder of the Tzar and his family, the programs, the gulaags, the people that brought communism and aid to Mao in China, and everything else with communism.  Then look to cultural Marxism, the Frankfurt school.   Once you figure out it isn&#39;t Russia that is the bad guys, but the people that brought these terrors onto the world, youll figure out why they still hate Russia to this day and simply use it as their whipping boy to trot out whenever they need to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but we also don&#39;t need to demonize and get hysterical about them. I worry that all the attention paid to Russia recently is partly to accomplish these two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Delegitimize populist concerns, which were shown to be significant with Trump&#39;s election and Clinton&#39;s defeat. </p></li>
<li><p>Prepare the US for greater involvement against Assad in Syria which may involve direct or indirect conflict with Russia(which supports Assad)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As proof of this we can see that a lot of the Russian hysteria comes from neoconservative #neverrumpers like Bill Kristol. They run orgs like Foundation for Defence of Democracies which generates a lot of the resarch and arguments agitating against Russia, while pretending to be a non-partisan. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that Russia is a great moral country(they&#39;re not),  just that their threat to us is greatly exaggerated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, this sub is full of people who don&#39;t trust what the mainstream media says, and the louder they yell it, the less we believe them. Couple that with anonymous &quot;experts&quot;, &quot;sources&quot;, and &quot;insiders&quot; who without presenting proof, parrot all the same talking points.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re confused about this sub pushing back against the propaganda machine? I even think the ratio makes sense. What? 35 anti-anti-Russia posts on here in the last couple days? Compared to the dozens and dozens and dozens Anti-no-war-with-russia posts all over the front page.</p>

<p>It all makes sense, really.</p>

I mean at a certain saturation of Mexicans in that area, it would make sense. What&#39;s ironic is, when these Hispanic areas inevitably fail, they will again head north and start all over again in Oregon, Nevada, Idaho etc. The only people who don&#39;t believe this is happening are people who benefit from it happening. </p>

Then the people overwhelmingly decided by referendum that they want to go back to Russia which makes sense since Crimea was Russian for a long time and most of the populace were Russian. If the US didn&#39;t stage the coup in Ukraine Crimea would still be Ukrainian. It is US that constantly invades other countries, bombs them to stone age and then we in Europe have to deal with a migrant crisisis.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not wholesome like the USA, which founded itself on a Native American genocide, continued slavery for over half a century after the Europeans finished it, declared war on remaining Native Americans who were already displaced, continued an economic war on Spain for land grabs, then declared war on Mexico for more land, then put itself in a position economically before intervening in WW2 setting itself up as a superpower for the next century, perpetuated the &quot;fight&quot; against collectivism in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, half of Latin America, helped Iran through some issues, helped Afghans against the pesky reds, brought &quot;freedom&quot; to Kuwait and Iraq, fought those villagers in Afghan who crashed planes into the twin towers, ended ISIS which totally wasn&#39;t their creation, and had been directly or indirectly involved in foreign nation elections of over 100 countries in the last 70 years....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the part where any of that was proven to be Russia.  You should be extremely wary of false flags; they are the new standard operating procedure.</p>

<p>You should, by now, have noticed an increase in false flags in all areas of propaganda.  For example, the increase in fake hate crimes, or people who pretend to be extreme liberals on twitter, then post the twitter screenshots on right wing forums, etc.  The fact that false flagging has become a standard tactic for the average person is terrifying.  Because it is so effective that there is NO WAY that the secret services haven&#39;t been using them (and officially, they have plans to perform such maneuvers as far back as the 60s [operation northwoods].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe much of the anti-Russia hysteria today is an “Emmanuel Goldstein” like figure for the military industrial complex and neoliberal/neocon global order. As well it’s sorta a relic of the anti-Soviet Union/communism of the Cold War era that baby boomers/gen Xers we’re raised on.</p>

<p>Having said that there is also a historical basis for the vilification of Russia. Before the 20th century European countries that didn’t have any Roman influence, such as Germany and especially Russia, were always viewed in a xenophobic manner. Russia, especially was viewed harshly, they were Slavic people (Slav is were we get the term “slave”) they had been ruled by the mongols (so we’re viewed to be part asiatic), and their language and even the Cyrillic alphabet were viewed as very alien. </p>

<p>On top of this prejudice, history would exacerbate Russophobia. Russia was the country that Napoleon ultimately met his folly. Throughout the 19th century Russia was viewed as a country ruled by strong monarchy that would crush any rebellion in Europe. During the height of Great Britain’s empire, there was tension in Asia with Russia. India was always considered the crown jewel of Britain’s empire, so during Russia’s expansion into Central Asia, the British were very suspicious Russia. Many novels during the Victorian era depict Russians as enemies, much like modern day Hollywood movies. This rivalry though was put aside because of Germany’s industrial and military progress that put them directly in competition with Britain.</p>

<p>After the world wars the rivalry between Russia and the Anglo sphere would still continue. As America would take Britain’s spot as the western hegemony and Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution would become the Soviet Union. The ideological basis of the Soviet Union would again put Russia at odds with the West specifically, America. The military industrial complex and the anti-leftist bias of America would further exacerbate this during the Cold War and even afterwards.</p>

<p>This isn’t to excuse the Russia hysteria that escalated in the past few months/years, just rather to give an explanation as to why it seems so pervasive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, this sub is full of people who don&#39;t trust what the mainstream media says, and the louder they yell it, the less we believe them. Couple that with anonymous &quot;experts&quot;, &quot;sources&quot;, and &quot;insiders&quot; who without presenting proof, parrot all the same talking points.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re confused about this sub pushing back against the propaganda machine? I even think the ratio makes sense. What? 35 anti-anti-Russia posts on here in the last couple days? Compared to the dozens and dozens and dozens Anti-no-war-with-russia posts all over the front page.</p>

<p>It all makes sense, really.</p>
