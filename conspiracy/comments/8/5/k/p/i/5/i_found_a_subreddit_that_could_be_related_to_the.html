    <div class="md"><p>You kinda have this backwards. If each vote had the same weight, then candidates would only have to campaign in 6 cities and 5 states.

    <div class="md"><p>I think every person should have an individual vote that counts just as much as everyone elses, and not be treated as &quot;part of a demographic&quot;, the US system is a form of identity politics, where your vote counts more when you live in a certain state. </p>

<p>A city doesn&#39;t vote, people do. I think saying that an individual&#39;s vote should count less than an other person&#39;s because they live in different areas, is a dangerous form of identity politics. Imagine replacing location with any other form of identity such as age, or color or anything else, that would sound crazy right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t be facetious, they were saying that people in cities tend to add more votes than rural areas. And in the US’ case, it makes sense. The 2016 election was a perfect example. </p>

<p>If you look at raw vote data, Hillary won by something like 2 million+, and in LA and NYC alone had something like 3 million more votes. Which means trump won more in other areas. Our system makes sense because it’s prevents major cities from dictating the outcome of elections and basically gives every state an influential say in the outcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were being facetious by saying people vote and not cities. Obviously “cities” don’t vote, and poster merely meant the occupants of the cities. </p>

<p>Firstly, life in NYC is vastly different than life in, say, Iowa. Two people living in these areas are going to have different viewpoints, feeling, beliefs, etc. keep that in mind for;</p>

<p>Secondly, groupthink is a very real concept. Especially here in the States. Look at how many people are interviewed and asked about a policy of someone they support/oppose, only to find out they were on the other side. It’s usually posed as a joke on late night tv, but it’s serious, and it’s sad. People don’t vote because they support a candidates views anymore. They vote based on appearance and the “popular” opinion. </p>

<p>When you take that into consideration, it’s a lot easier for candidates to travel to large cities, campaign and forget about the flyover states. It’s not fair to those smaller states who have other needs from the federal government. </p>

<p>The other thing you have to keep in mind is that counting 300 million+ votes in a night is not easy. Add in margins of error, inaccuracies, and other issues and it could take weeks to see who won. </p>

<p>Lastly, the concentration of citizens in certain areas is the reason we have the senate, which works hand in hand with the house, and they both make up our legislature. The senate ensures every state, now matter how big or small, has an equal say. </p>

<p>I’m not sure where you’re from, but with such a diverse background of citizens, I think our system works. Not everyone’s going to be happy, but then again they never are. </p>

<p>Where are you getting the idea that Russian elections are limited to Putin&#39;s party? It sounds like you&#39;ve reached a conclusion (Russian elections are corrupt) and are just making up facts that fit your conclusion. Vladimir Putin was opposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_presidential_election,_2018">2 candidates</a> in the most recent election. This is nonsense, and it is far easier to get into a Russian election than most American elections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was literally in the article that you told me was proof. The article itself says it is not proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, stop looking for reasons to discredit this and just view the evidence for what it is. There was a variance of almost 6 standard deviations in one state, meaning you could hold the election millions of times and not get that result. You&#39;re being a coincidence theorist, and it&#39;s making you say silly things.</p>

<p>This is controlled opposition in optima forma. How much votes did the real opposition such as Navalny get? The only parties that get to participate are the ones who are slightly different to Putin&#39;s or even completely identical. </p>

<p>Or you know, have you ever considered that maybe the polling data was incorrect? Or are you saying that the national elections were hacked aswell because the polls said Hillary would win? I really, really don&#39;t want to defend Soros in any way, but this is non-sensical.</p>

<p>According to u/emaged, the Russian election expert who thought that Putin ran unopposed and is now scrambling to construct a backup explanation that the opposition was somehow fake.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not a lot, because Vladimir Putin enjoys overwhelming popularity even according to hostile western polling agencies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>More fabrications. How is the Communist Party of Russia (the ones that ran things for most of the century) a controlled opposition party? Heads up, I&#39;m going to block you if your next comment contains any more of you just making things up like this.</p>

<p>Oh, so it was a 6 standard deviation variance? That&#39;s more likely than election fraud?</p>

<p>Zero, because he couldn&#39;t participate, like all other critics of Putin. </p>

<p>I know that Putin would still be elected if they didn&#39;t commit fraud and even if they let all his critics run. However, every election he would get less votes, his mandate would be smaller and the call for democratization would be greater. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that the polls could have been incorrect, not saying that it was a 6 standard deviation variance. your reading comprehension is abysmal.</p>

<p>Just block me dude, makes it easier for the both of us. I heard blocking people is the easiest way to ignore facts and reality!</p>

<p>The primaries are open to anyone, sure money plays a huge factor in elections, but that is still not equal to literally not being allowed to participate or be a candidate at any stage by the president and his party. I am not American indeed, but I do know how your election system works.</p>
