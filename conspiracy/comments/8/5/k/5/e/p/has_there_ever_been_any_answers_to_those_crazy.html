I’m talking about the incredibly loud rumblings, or groans if you wanna call them that, that were being posted online a few years ago. Some over Canada, some in the US, etc. </p>

<p>Anyone have any info on that stuff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this: “Something is going on in the inner core of the Earth.” It has to do with the magnetic poles changing and involves minerals recycling in the mantle of the Earth. The sounds are being generated in the mantle as large static discharges of energy, pushed up through the Earth’s crust, broadcasting as infrasound through the ionosphere and then bouncing back at a lower frequency that we can hear and feel as vibrations.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The static discharge in the ionosphere is similar to how thunder happens, for those that are interested, it&#39;s not really weird that stuff is moving in the earth, it has a molten core and shifting tectonic plates, it is pretty cool though. </p>

<p>I would love to hear these sounds, where in Canada can I go to hear them? I&#39;m in NH so it&#39;s not super far for me unless it&#39;s far west &amp; north.</p>

I am in NH as well :) A little west of Mt Wash...Id like to hear these noises as well. AND id really love to see some of the lights and crafts that have been reportedly been seen worldwide by everyone except me. Ok, well maybe not everyone, but it sure as hell seems that way! Im a big sky watcher, especially at night, the night sky is amazing here. I grew up in WV so Im used to living places in the middle of nowhere and that once the sun goes down the moon is the only light and even with a bright full moon and clear night its dark as fuck outside! Its amazing haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>although, I do see tons of shooting stars and green flashes/tracers all throughout the sky. Granted I have spent many nights sitting alone in the woods with my bud and my smokes just watching the sky all night long so I doubt any normal people get to see this stuff as much as I do. Ive also seen of a few occasions now something really awesome...it was like little explosions happening all over the sky. I live up on a mountain so I can see the entire sky pretty much with no obstructions what so ever. Anyways, the &quot;explosions&quot; is one of the coolest things I&#39;ve seen so far. There were soooooo many stars, like just everywhere and it looked like they were exploding all over the sky and I dunno it reminded me of sparklers you get on 4th of July or something and the sky was so glittery looking and I know my description could never do it any justice but you should keep an eye out for that. Ive lived here for 2 years now and have seen it multiple times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you&#39;re talking about the sounds you can find on YouTube recorded all over the world that sometimes sound like distorted trumpets, sometimes like booms and rumblings. I had my own experience with this back in mid-December. I live in California. I heard some absolutely crazy shit in the sky one morning, woke me up at 7 a.m. Sounded like coordinated drumming that got louder and louder. Did a &quot;Nextdoor&quot; post that day, and could only find a few people who responded that they heard it and thought it sounded crazy too. A lot of my neighbors had already left for work. Still freaks me out when I think about it. Sounded like the end of the world -- like the drums were announcing something -- and was totally unexplainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>weird. I thought I&#39;ve never heard this stuff with my own ears but maybe I have and just haven&#39;t realized it. I&#39;ve sometimes been in my house and hear what sounds like a helicopter just hovering in the same spot or some kind of noises coming from a big rig truck or some kind of tool or work being done but then when I try to find out where the sound is coming from I can never find any explanation. Ive always just told myself it was one of those things and that I just can&#39;t see it and my brain is just playing tricks on me. its just so fucking loud that I can&#39;t imagine it being any of that stuff. Its very, very rumbling/low pitched bass. Like the kind of bass you get at a concert in that the sound travels very far away from the source and you can feel it in your body.  I can never pinpoint the direction it comes from either. Ill think I have but then when I go to that spot it fades away and sounds like its coming from a different direction. makes me wonder if I&#39;ve been hearing these sounds all along and just never put 2+2 together until now.</p>
