<p>I don&#39;t know.  The hollow Earth theory was around forever and people could discuss it gleefully without necessarily signing up for the church of hollow Earth or without having some sort of ideological war over it.  This flat Earth thing seems different on both ends from that.  I really think it&#39;s a testing ground for mob psychology or something.  I have a distinct feeling that the people pushing for and against flat Earth theories are all a part of the same project.</p>

<p>Thing in both the Soviets and the US were sending up &quot;fake&quot; equipment for a long time. Hmm... why didn&#39;t either one call each other out? Is it cause they are controlled by the same groups? Is this the hypernomalization that Russia &amp; USA dealth with during the Cold War? Hmmm </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not a psyop. It&#39;s really one of the last big conspiracies that make you realize how compartmentalized and controlled certain information is. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t the CIA and psyop regime have enough of those agendas? Between reptilians, illuminati space aliens, satanist, baby fuckers, don&#39;t they have enough? The only thing I believe out of all of that is baby fuckers. Definitely a lot of those. </p>

<p>Anyone who goes deep into &quot;Flat Earth&quot; learns one thing. We&#39;re being lied to about space. No one, including Flat Earths, have no idea what shape the earth is but we know what it&#39;s not. i.e. there explanations make no sense when you pull the whole narrative together. </p>

<p>Also: Eric Dubay, ODD TV, RichieFromBoston, EnSlavedByMedia, Mark Sargent, Jeranism, Patricia Steere, MGTV, (I could go on for days) are majorly controlled opposition shill/actors. THESE are flat earthers btw. Within the last 2 years intelligence agencies have big bringing testing shills like mad trying to find ones that will become movement leaders. These people will give you some good hits here and there, but won&#39;t help for the long haul. </p>

<p>95% of conspiracy disinfo. The best way to hide a conspiracy to encrypt it by layering it with fake stories, accounts, personalities, info in general. </p>

<p>The thing is NASA does have ALOT of control. Not just money, but programming. Look around at all the NASA fanboys, look at the front page of reddit. You must realize the moon landing was &quot;THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF MAN KIND!!!USAUSA&quot;. Eventhough it&#39;s no like this as much for the younger generation the NASA programming has come back. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t answer the space, flat earth, or any discussion. Instruments have been used for thousands of years to plot these movements regardless of space or no space. Just because the sun does that, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s because of an orbit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the sun actually does move in that fashion. Has this been tested from every place on earth? Either way, it doesn&#39;t matter. The Sun is a large object in our near solar systems so close systems easily collapse within it. Not trying to not answer the question either, I just hope you see it doesn&#39;t make sense of any model.</p>

<p>I would love to see you break down the explanation of this over a 2,000 Year model. Why don&#39;t we constantly see parallax from all the other light being scattered? Why are we not constantly seeing paralax from the build-up due to all the delayed light? Stars are not lasers in this case. The are projection light in a &quot;sphere&quot;. This should be producing crazy light streaks all over the night sky, but it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Lets think this through. </p>

<p>If the sun moves in such a fashion that anywhere on the planet it moves 15 degrees every hour for 24 hours it now moves 360 degrees, a full circle. </p>

<p>Yes, its simple observation. Every society has observed this since they started looking at the sky. Its the most common knowledge possible that literally any person can verify.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we constantly see parallax from all the other light being scattered? Why are we not constantly seeing paralax from the build-up due to all the delayed light? Stars are not lasers in this case. The are projection light in a &quot;sphere&quot;. This should be producing crazy light streaks all over the night sky, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>First off I think you have a huge misunderstanding of how light functions. Why do you think we would expect to see &quot;streaks&quot; all over the sky? </p>

<p>Lets think this through.</p>

<p>If the sun moves in such a fashion that anywhere on the planet it moves 15 degrees every hour for 24 hours it now moves 360 degrees, a full circle.</p>

<p>If the sun behaves as we are told by the FE model then this is not possible.</p>

<p>This is wrong on many front. First and foremost, there is no &quot;FE Model&quot;, there are currently multiple models with many differences. The main thing is we don&#39;t have the ability to do this on a mainstream front and the ability to observe what we&#39;re being told is true. Example, it&#39;s going to be quite a push + cost to verify all the distances. </p>

<p>I highly doubt someone has been on every place on earth sending their degree changes over a 24 hour period. This is simply impossible because not all places can be recorded was my point. While I don&#39;t think this is misinformation, it still doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>All that is being expressed is the sun move (roughly) 15 degrees every hour for 24 hours. In this scenario nothing is being expressed except the time it takes the sun to circumnavigate the earth based on a 24-hour loop. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While I was mostly playing around with this response you don&#39;t get it. Every place on earth isn&#39;t tracking this movement to scientific perfection. I expect a few hubs yes, but how could we know for sure? Still, it&#39;s irrelevant to the grand scheme because it doesn&#39;t explain any model or the shape of the earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First off I think you have a huge misunderstanding of how light functions. Why do you think we would expect to see &quot;streaks&quot; all over the sky?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please explain how I&#39;m wrong. As you should know the light travels to your eye. While you&#39;re not looking at stars they are shooting off the light in multitudes of direction between the poles of reference. </p>

<p>So if Sunlight takes &quot;15 min&quot; to travel to earth, what do you think about the multitude of stars all around? All the stars from different distances are sending multiple &quot;packets&quot; of lights to a location where earth would be upon the orbit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure how this would actually look, but it should be a huge bright smear or parallax depending on star size, distances, and orbit. </p>

<p>Can you please break this down simply and explain how I&#39;m wrong?</p>

<p>Kind of like how there are different models in the sciences...?</p>

<p>I mean sure but its very cheap to at least perform a few observations and model how they work or should work. </p>

<p>Lets look at it from another angle and you can see how crazy this starts to sound. </p>

<p>Do you have an electron microscope? Have you ever seen an electron move through a logic gate on a CPU? Can you even begin to comprehend a billion instructions per clock cycle? </p>

<p>There is no way for you to prove to me computers are not magic, you have no way showing me the evidence. You are just taking another persons word for it. </p>

<p>You are applying the same logic here to the Earth. Do I have to put you in a rocket and launch you into space? I shouldnt have to. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again that argument is getting a little out of hand. </p>

<p>Why dont you give me a location that this doesnt work from. The reason no one has ever heard of this not working is because it always works, this is how it works. </p>

<p>It would be like saying to me &quot;Prove that water at 50 degrees C is wet everywhere on Earth&quot; come on dude. THis is an extremely weak argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a Psyop by the Chinese government against the English-speaking truth seeker community.  They started Nov. 2014.</p>

<p>As for why, I wish I knew.  My fear is that they have a long-term vision in which they govern the English-speaking world,  and in the process they need a way to get rid of the truth seekers.  There&#39;s enough vitriol over flat earth that we might get violent with each other in a true shtf scenario.</p>

<p>I would suspect that China foresees a shtf scenario for the US and UK in particular, in which they later step in and provide government, after the truth seeker movement has mostly wiped itself out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on Eric Dubay&#39;s travels immediately prior to starting the modern movement.  He traveled to SE Asia for a Kung Fu gathering, then to China for about 3 months.  When he came back, he went from being a person who didn&#39;t have much flat earth material, to a person who had compiled 200 very befuddling mathematical-seeming arguments supporting flat earth.  He published his video, which uses a lot of stock footage, and neural entrainment techniques.  Very little time passed (a couple of weeks) between his return from China and releasing his &quot;200 proofs&quot; video.  </p>

<p>If you check it out at 0:09, the horizon is shown spinning.  This causes a brain wave rhythm in the visual cortex.  It&#39;s a fairly advanced technique, especially since it seems to be coupled with the rhythm of the speaker&#39;s voice.</p>

<p>I doubt Eric Dubay could put that video together on his own.  In particular, the brainwashing techniques are sophisticated, and the 200 arguments are cleverly designed to confuse.  He had no published work on fe prior to his trip to Asia, where he spent most of his time in China.  Soon after returning, he published this curiously high-effort and high-sophistication brainwashing video.</p>

<p>My question is whether Dubay is consciously working for China, if so, whether that&#39;s voluntarily, if not, whether they brainwashed him.  I can&#39;t see how they could brainwash him in such a way that he would in turn use brainwashing techniques like synchronizing a speech rhythm to a visual cortex neural entrainment method, but I suppose that&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m probably going to get hated for this comment. But my opinion is my own.</p>

<p>I read the bible, right, God&#39;s word is truth. The bible has more quotes saying the earth is flat than any spherical earth. </p>

<p>The four corners with angels at each one, can only make sense with a flat earth.</p>

<p>1 Chronicles 16:30: &quot;He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 93:1: &quot;Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ...&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 96:10: &quot;He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ...&quot;</p>

<p>Psalm 104:5: &quot;Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:18: &quot;...who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast...&quot;</p>

<p>There is like 72 or something quotes in the bible for flat earth and not a single one that is for spherical.</p>

<p>NASA can create fake laws of physics and people believe it. Do your research, find the answers. I used to believe in spherical earth as well, and laughed at people that said otherwise. I finally did my research, I was saying &quot;no no, this is all lies&quot; Kept going, more and more, now I am a firm believer.</p>

<p>Even if Evidence, there will always be counter arguments to make Flat earth evidence a lie and vise versa. I would rather trust my bible any day than what science says.</p>

<p>If you think that god is something else, not in the bible, that&#39;s fine obviously, but the &quot;bible god&quot; has &quot;interfered&quot; at countless points throughout history.  So says the book, at least.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not gonna be the one to argue against that point, but I&#39;m curious as to how you so quickly flipped from &quot;the bible is all literally true&quot; to &quot;it&#39;s false information&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>What would the goals be of pushing this as a psyop? If its a test to see how gullible the populace is, why use the question of what we live on as the premise? Id say the studies on human psychology in the past century have already proven how ignorant the populace is. </p>

<p>If its to take the current intellect of humanity back a step, how does the earth all of a sudden becoming believed as &quot;flat&quot; accomplish that? What negative effects, besides speculation as to what it would do to human intelligence/psyche, would occur? </p>

<p>I cant see any new knowledge being gained by the CIA or gov&#39;t, from spreading &quot;flat earth&quot; as a psyop. What makes people question if it IS a psyop, is the fact that it hasn&#39;t been put to rest and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the population. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay here&#39;s a simple one. Why does the sun move 15 degrees every hour regress of where you are on earth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t answer the space, flat earth, or any discussion. Instruments have been used for thousands of years to plot these movements regardless of space or no space. Just because the sun does that, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s because of an orbit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the sun actually does move in that fashion. Has this been tested from every place on earth? Either way, it doesn&#39;t matter. The Sun is a large object in our near solar systems so close systems easily collapse within it. Not trying to not answer the question either, I just hope you see it doesn&#39;t make sense of any model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I catch your drift, so if a couple of scientists get in a room and shoot us numbers is real, right? Wrong, because to do it perfectly would require a god among men. There are so many flaws in their models that it&#39;s not even funny. For instance, Polaris is an anomaly of itself in a world that is spinning on a tilted every hurling around a sun from 93 million miles away. The only reason FE is getting hot is because people are beginning to pull up the old content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can do this ourselves with our own eyes and own observations.</p>

<p>I would love to see you break down the explanation of this over a 2,000 Year model. Why don&#39;t we constantly see parallax from all the other light being scattered? Why are we not constantly seeing paralax from the build-up due to all the delayed light? Stars are not lasers in this case. The are projection light in a &quot;sphere&quot;. This should be producing crazy light streaks all over the night sky, but it doesn&#39;t. </p>
