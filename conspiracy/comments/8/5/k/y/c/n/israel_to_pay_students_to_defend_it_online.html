       S.s. shills exist. Some are paid and some are not. We all must realize that people are online to troll specific topics and key words are always attacked, white phosphorus, gmo, Monsanto, vaccines, Israel, cultural Marxism, all met with very swift responses from accounts using known  provocateur tactics.

       Am I accusing anyone or being a shill? And it's not about disagreement, it's about muddy waters and known provocateur tactics of obfuscation. There is a specific pattern they use that a normal human would not.

       We vastly disagree on your use of leading questions tangentially related to the OP or whatever comment you replied to and your habit of putting words in other people's mouths.

       Sir, I am not disagreeing with you, I'm just sick of people on this forum baselessly attacking renowned members of this sub for being shills. I know there are shills active on this forum, however I think a lot of them are the ones posting articles, and not in the comment section. Also as of late I have seen an insane amount of what I believe to be self-promotion and I don't really like it.

       Are you clicking on a thread about Israel because you think Jew's are lizards? Wow that's disgustingly anti Semitic... This whole Jew's aren't human "conspiracy" is used to muddy the water and make conspiracy theorist look evil. You're sick. Jew's are not reptilian.. They are most definitely humans...

       You have the most recent thread at the time of this posting. After scrolling past half a dozen tantrums about Israel, I went back to the top and clicked yours. Israel is shady af so I figured what the hell, maybe this one isn’t just crying about the jews. Clicked, and...it’s an article from one of the biggest media outlets in the world, about something publicly acknowledged by the Israeli government. Where’s the conspiracy? Where’s the fun insanity about crop circles and shit?

       They won't post a submission. They are just here to spread anti Semitic memes. Everyone knows 4chon and storefront call Jew's lizards. It's extremely anti Semitic to imply that Jew's aren't human but they just go around doing it... It's disgusting.

       He let them take all their money and possessions and paid for travel and board to Palestine via the Haavara Agreement. They eventually decided that this resettlement was cruel to the native Palestinians, so they formulated a plan to create a Jewish state in Madagascar, but the plan never came to fruition because of the war.

       As it goes the British government had come up with the Balfour Treaty and agreement in 1917 I think : that one w presented to the Rothchilds, so they ended up in Palestine.

       Oh I know, it gets harder to find this information every day. I'm not sure what a great source would be, but the Haavara Agreement is too well-known for them to hide it so you would probably have some luck if you google it.

       Are you talking about the Haavara/Transfer agreement? That's the only historical thing that resembles your comment. It was basically a small footnote in WWII history. It was an
       <em>
        attempt
       </em>
       by Zionist organizations to get Jews out of anti-Semitic Germany by paying off the Nazi government with a portion of the assets of those fleeing. It never came to fruition, the Nazis lost interest when they invaded Poland.

       They didn't "pay off" anyone. They allowed German Jews to retain most or all of the value of their property by purchasing German goods for the Yishuv, which would redeem them in
Palestine local currency.

       <strong>
        Straight up false, don't lie.
       </strong>
       The Haavara transfer was a major factor in making possible the immigration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine in the years 1933-1939, and together with the money invested by the immigrants themselves, in providing an incentive for the expansion of agricultural settlement and for general economic development.

       Listen man. I know about the Autobahn and jet engines. How the Jews got back Israel after losing it to the damn Muslims some 1300 years earlier. I understand the we never found a gas chamber or huge oven. I get that the world population of Jews increased during WW2.

       But what you fail to realize is that socialists believe that "people kind" are one organism. A quasi gelatinous blur that is interchangeable. By their own doctrine. "For the greater good".
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus they are not people, they are one factor of an idea. An idea that is cancer on this world. Fuck whom ever pushes that failed political bullshit.

       You can't say that some people (jews) and bad because of their blood. Then also believe that other people (oppressed class) are all equal. It's extremely contradictive. All or none man!

       When you say “Nazi shit” you mean anti-Semetic right ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that you do..
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is criticizing the policies of the Israeli government anti-Semitic ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we critique the Saudi government for bombing Yemen are we automatically Islamophobic  ?

       Thi subreddit is indeed anti-semetic and focuses on every bad thin Israel has ever done, if one israeli soldiers slaps some palestinian you will hear it here in 3 seconds after it happened, they don't focus on the countless other oppressed people in the world, no, it only happens in Israel, why? Because this sub is anti-semetic and nazi, simple as that, I do remember time ago they nominated a literally neo-nazi documentary as "best

       Israelis are obsessed with spreading their pathological programming to a world that has too long watched their belligerent Supremacist  Apartheid  Ethno-State attack their neighbors with brutal, criminal force and steal their land.

      <p>
       Under SA apartheid or "Jim Crow" laws: there were separate facilities for whites and blacks: separate public washrooms, separate parks, separate drinking fountains, separate restaurants, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these do not exist in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under SA apartheid or "Jim Crow": blacks had no voice in government or in the courts; they couldn't be part of mainstream society in politics, professions, the army or police.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Israel: Arabs vote, work in any profession anywhere, including the army or the police, as lawyers and judges; non-Jewish judges were in the courts that sent a former president of Israel and a former prime minister to prison in Israel! Arabs serve in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Arabs can visit any park, beach or public facility. They can buy property almost anywhere if they chose to do so. Visit Israeli hospitals and you'll see Arab and Jewish doctors and nurses working side by side, on Arab and Jewish patients in the same wards and rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official language of Israel is Hebrew… and Arabic. All the street signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does the apartheid "second class citizen" myth come from? From the same source that the medieval blood libel against Jews came from: ignorance, prejudice, jealousy, pre-conceived stereotypical racist stigma, and from political or religious indoctrination that give an excuse to hate Jews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ethno-State
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Israel has Asian Jews, Indian Jews, Black Jews, Arab Jews, etc. The idea that Israel is an ethno-paradise is just projection by ethno-purists. It's a stretch to say Jews around the world separated by 70-100 generations (1750-2500 years) are a single ethnicity. It's more of a common identity, but I'm personally more related Europeans than I am to a Persian Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palestinians on the other hand, want to create an ethnostate, with a land that bans women rights, lgbt rights, any jews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        steal their land.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Judea and Samaria (you call it West bank) is disputed territory. Right now it's no one's land but everyone's. The concept of theft or occupation makes no sense in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judea and Samaria were given to the Jews by the Mandate for Palestine, as voted on by the League of Nations, and then granted this land again through Partition, by the UN. The only nation to occupy Judea (Yehuda) and Samaria in recent history is therefore Jordan(rescinded claim in '88). The fact that the Arabic word for Jews is derived from the word for Judea, Yahud, gives further lie to the claim that the Jews have occupied Arab land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arabs well know that Judea is the birthright of the Jews and this is reflected in the Arabs’ own native lexicon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time Israel offered a deal to the Palestinians, they were offered 99% of what wanted. If that is the case, they obviously want no Peace.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        indigenous people of Palestine
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Regardless of the length of the timeframe of Jewish depopopulation events, Jews have the right to live there under indigenous pretexts. They have the right to live there without threats about thievery on lands for which they are indigenous to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Palestinians share common ancestry with indigenous peoples, but they neither follow indigenous traditions nor do they self-identify as those indigenous peoples. They share neither religion nor language with them. Blood quantum alone is insufficient to transmit indigenous status.
      </p>
      <p>
       If conquerors, such as the Palestinian Arabs, can become indigenous, then the white Europeans who came to my indigenous lands in North America could now claim to be indigenous. The white Europeans who went to Australia and New Zealand could now claim to be indigenous. If we, even once, allow that argument to be made, indigenous rights are suddenly devalued and meaningless. This is somewhat peculiar, as those who are arguing for Palestinian “indigenous rights” are usually those who have little grasp of the history, and no understanding of the truth behind indigenous rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land.

       Why would I bother to answer a comment made by a serial plagiarist who copy-pasted material originally posted by a Zionist zealot doing a nit-picky semantic tap-dance in a pathetic attempt to "justify" the abhorrent racist policies and practices of the Zionist state, and the inherent racist supremasim that runs to the marrow of the bones of many (if not most) of the Jews who live there?

       JIDF marches on. They already have several apps, such as 4IL, devoted to astrotrufing pro-Israel propaganda online. Of course, most of the major sites, Google, Reddit. etc., are already Jewish-owned and inherently favorable to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an ad for 4IL. No, this isn't a parody skit:

       Are you talking about the Haavara/Transfer agreement? That's the only historical thing that resembles your comment. It was basically a small footnote in WWII history. It was an
       <em>
        attempt
       </em>
       by Zionist organizations to get Jews out of anti-Semitic Germany by paying off the Nazi government with a portion of the assets of those fleeing. It never came to fruition, the Nazis lost interest when they invaded Poland.
