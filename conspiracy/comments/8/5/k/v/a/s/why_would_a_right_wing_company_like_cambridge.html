<p>Why would someone like this be involved in the operation at all? Is CA not exclusively a right-wing group? Does this not strike anyone else as odd? Why would this guy choose to help out Steve Bannon? Why would Steve Bannon look to this guy for help?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense, I can see that from his perspective at least. But why would Bannon use him? There aren&#39;t any good right wing programmers? Or is Steve Bannon just not as polarizing of a figure as the media has made him out to be?</p>

<p>Because they claimed to be connected to the Camebridge university (they weren&#39;t) and were able to do excactly what Bannon needed. They had targeting models that noone else used.</p>

<p>Bannon is a very polarizing figure, however he is, just like the CA guy, also a very opportunist person. Whenever he sees someone that can benefit him, he uses him. Just like Bannon tried to use Trump to get his own agenda through congress, which hugely backfired on him.</p>

<p>Capitalism and communism are a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>There are other ways to organize society outside of the systems that we have been given, I.e. capitalism and communism. Capitalism and communism are both based on materialism at their core. Other societies that have historically existed have had other &quot;gods&quot; at their center.</p>

By creating these post event &#39;discoveries&#39; and &#39;interviews&#39; , it lends credence to the narrative.  Look post 9-11.  All the cementing stories that really sold the message.
