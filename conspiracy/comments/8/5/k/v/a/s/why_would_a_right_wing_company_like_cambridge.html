       I'll admit, I'm basing his political biases based solely on his appearance and the fact that he's an MSM darling right now (so if anyone has evidence to the contrary, then please let me know).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would someone like this be involved in the operation at all? Is CA not exclusively a right-wing group? Does this not strike anyone else as odd? Why would this guy choose to help out Steve Bannon? Why would Steve Bannon look to this guy for help?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this isn't adding up to me, and am interested if anyone can help connect some dots for me.

       That makes sense, I can see that from his perspective at least. But why would Bannon use him? There aren't any good right wing programmers? Or is Steve Bannon just not as polarizing of a figure as the media has made him out to be?

       Because they claimed to be connected to the Camebridge university (they weren't) and were able to do excactly what Bannon needed. They had targeting models that noone else used.

       Bannon is a very polarizing figure, however he is, just like the CA guy, also a very opportunist person. Whenever he sees someone that can benefit him, he uses him. Just like Bannon tried to use Trump to get his own agenda through congress, which hugely backfired on him.

       One of the biggest "fake news" writers during the 2016 election cycle was actually a lifelong democrat who found right wing communities easy to exploit for ad revenue.  There was also a group of teens in Macedonia who did the same thing, and they ran both articles on the right and  left.  It was all for the moolah.

       Capitalism and communism are a false dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other ways to organize society outside of the systems that we have been given, I.e. capitalism and communism. Capitalism and communism are both based on materialism at their core. Other societies that have historically existed have had other "gods" at their center.

       The way this story is being hyped and presented is raising red flags for me.  This is their 'stage 2' of cementing the story.  By creating these post event 'discoveries' and 'interviews' , it lends credence to the narrative.  Look post 9-11.  All the cementing stories that really sold the message.  We are all still being told to believe that the U.S. voters were duped by some facebook ads.

       Yea the media coverage is what first raised my suspicions as well (as anyone should be suspicious whenever there is a media blitz like this).

       It's a prepared and coordinated shot.  This will maintain the population divide they have worked so hard for.  I think some of that divide was starting to fall apart last week, but lo! its even stronger today.  It's the sly expectation that, if this story is so compelling, maybe the other stories are too!  Where's Stormy ?  Bring her back!

        why would Bannon use him?

      <p>
       Because they claimed to be connected to the Camebridge university (they weren't) and were able to do excactly what Bannon needed. They had targeting models that noone else used.

        Or is Steve Bannon just not as polarizing of a figure as the media has made him out to be?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bannon is a very polarizing figure, however he is, just like the CA guy, also a very opportunist person. Whenever he sees someone that can benefit him, he uses him. Just like Bannon tried to use Trump to get his own agenda through congress, which hugely backfired on him.

       One of the biggest "fake news" writers during the 2016 election cycle was actually a lifelong democrat who found right wing communities easy to exploit for ad revenue.  There was also a group of teens in Macedonia who did the same thing, and they ran both articles on the right and  left.  It was all for the moolah.

       They scammed him to hire them, by pretending to be something they were not. Doesn't mean that they weren't excactly what he needed them to be.
