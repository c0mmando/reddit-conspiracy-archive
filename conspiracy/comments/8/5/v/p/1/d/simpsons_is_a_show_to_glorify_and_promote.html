<p>Homer and Bart are generally the main protagonists, and they generally do stupid actions, or act about trifle things. Things a normal American should worry about. And everything always turns out alright.</p>

<p>I see The Simpsons as a show to glorify and promote mediocrity and submission to the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting perspective. </p>

<p>I personally always felt the opposite. Upon rewatching or just rethinking about certain episodes as I got older, I always felt that Matt groening was kind of subversive and doing social commentary from a conspiratorial mindset. Well, as much as he could be within the context of primetime fox show. </p>

<p>For example...</p>

<p>The obvious one being the stonecutters (illuminati) </p>

<p>Or when Mr burns runs the casino and goes crazy, and the germs on smithers face say &quot;Freemasons run the country&quot; </p>

<p>Or when Homer eats the crazy chilli and starts hallucinating. This seems to be referencing dmt and enlightenment. And this kind of thinking to me ties into why fluoride is in the water and peoples pineal glands get calcified. </p>

<p>Also when Bart get ADD and gets put on &#39;focusyn&#39;, then he literally puts on a tin foil and thinks that MLB is using satellites to monitor everyone (nsa?),  and when he turns out to be true, suddenly a baseball player appears and everyone chooses to watch him hit some balls rather than learn the truth (perhaps commentary on that something meaningless like the Bruce Jenner transition can be pushed to the forefront of the news and peoples conversations/thoughts to distract from the snowden leaks)</p>

<p>Not saying you are right or wrong, this is just my perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been watching them from the beginning? I think you have to take them in the context they were first created. The family situational comedy format was, what? 30 years old by then... the concept of a prime time cartoon family sitcom was half the unique twist, I don&#39;t think anyone had tried it since the early &#39;60s and The Flintstones. The social satire was the other half - there was this idealized family portrayal that was being mocked.  </p>

<p>In &#39;89, other shows included The Cosby Show, Married With Children, Roseanne, Full House, Growing Pains...Family Ties had just ended. Homer&#39;s lazy and stupid because he&#39;s not <em>Dr.</em> Huxtable, or any of the other &quot;hard-working&quot;, white collar heads of TV households at the time. Roseanne&#39;s whole schtick is the blue-collar angle, but you wouldn&#39;t describe Dan as lazy or stupid. Al Bundy comes closest to Homer in character, and both were working that at-the-time-edgy, satirical FOX vibe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, the Simpsons fell victim to same phenomena that ruined Star Wars. Namely, they were part of the counterculture that became popular culture. As a result, they became watered-down, generic, shadows of their former selves.</p>

<p>The Simpsons used to be a smart, clever, anti-establishment satire. Now, I agree with OP that it has become a mainstream mouthpiece for the Establishment that is mediocre at best. As a huge fan of vintage Simpsons, this is very sad to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well take Homers character and see the ways in which Frank despised him. The episode revolves around Homers mediocrity. Frank works his ass off and plays by the rules while Homer fucks off and still reaps the benefits. Frank&#39;s background was nearly as heart breaking as Homers is nonsensical. The writers created the antithesis to Homer in the same manner they created the bumbling idiot himself, context. There wasn&#39;t anything funny about Frank beyond his interaction with Homer. </p>

<p>You believe you have uncovered a hidden element to the show when in reality,to use the words of General Disarray &quot;Simpson&#39;s did it&quot;.</p>
