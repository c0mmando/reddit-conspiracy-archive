<p>Use your words and express your thoughts. If you can&#39;t easily explain why &quot;whataboutism&quot; is bad, and why what you&#39;re attempting to dismiss is a &quot;whataboutism&quot;, then you&#39;re always going to be easily dismissed because you&#39;re arguing at the level of a child.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem arises when governments deflect attention away from their own crimes for which they are actually responsible, by pointing out the crimes of a foreign government. This is indeed propaganda and an evasion of responsibility. Calling out your own governmentâ€™s hypocrisy in matters of state sanctioned murder abroad is the exact opposite sort of thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with this accusation is that this person isnâ€™t switching the subject to bring up anotherâ€™s transgression to deflect from scrutiny of his or her behavior. In contrast, the person is putting the conversation in its rightful place, which is to question the behavior of oneâ€™s own country. When it comes to issues such as nation-state violence, the primary duty of a citizen is not to obsess all day about the violence perpetrated by foreign governments, but to hold oneâ€™s own government accountable. This is as true for an American citizen in American as it is for a Russian citizen in Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a propaganda term where it is a claimed to be an actual propaganda technique.   The earliest actual reference to it I could find is from the economist in 2008. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/node/10598774">https://www.economist.com/node/10598774</a></p>

<p>A very important detail is that it is often presented as a form of the tu quoque fallacy, but it is actually not anything of the sort.  In the fallacy, the conclusion is claimed to be false because of hypocrisy, but when  an accusation of &#39;whataboutism&#39; is thrown around, the truth of the conclusion is granted.  What is denied is starting point in the argument as the starting point of concern, and this is a legitimate tactic of contention.    </p>

<p>It is ultimately meant as a thought stopping cliche. </p>
