    <div class="md"><p>Did they have a drill earlier in the day?
What&#39;s suspicious about it? 
If it was for gun support, but people still died that makes no sense.</p>

<p>Many shootings are not questioned, like the black guy who shot up a chuch and killed people last year, it barley hit the media.</p>

<p>Also, shootong a shooter is the most effective way to stop one. Period. No conspiracy needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read leftist writings. Their heroes are people like Lenin, Castro, Mao, Alinsky, who advocate committing crimes from deception to mass murder in order to bring about their leftist utopia, which requires people to give up their freedom and property to the state in the name of the oppressed. These tactics are abhorrent to the right, which believes if you have to use deception and violence in order to advance your agenda, something is wrong with your agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never stated that it was the consensus, just that they were called false flags or a hoax. That is all, no more no less. Did my comments seem to insinuate that it was the entirety of the sub making these accusations?</p>
