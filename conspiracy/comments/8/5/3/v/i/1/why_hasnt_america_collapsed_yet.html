        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to all of the predictions about the end of America in the past, if they were all true, The US would had been taken over by a global government last year. Why has nothing happened yet? Why is world war iii not starting yet? And why had all the riots stopped since the charlottsville one? Also, why hasn&#39;t Obama or Trump abolished the american government for a global government last year? </p>

<p>Why are all of these stuff not happening at all? People keep saying big and ugly events will happen but few ever come true. I DO believe something big and ugly is happening soon but it&#39;s strange that it isn&#39;t even sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same reason all the other constant predictions about the end of the world, global conspiracies, and massive wars don&#39;t come true. The predictions are usually made based on no evidence by people who are a few aces short of a deck. Most will also still say the things are happening to fit their views, much like those who believe in types of astrology or a higher power/literal holy book translations, they will interpret it various ways so some stuff can be called true and their cognitive dissonance can continue.</p>

<p>Any more reading this, it does not violate rule 10 as I did not single any group out and honestly answered his question to the best of my abilities based on observation, i.e. Free discussion, since I&#39;m sure someone will get offended and report it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the below is thinly sourced (the facts are often available, but what&#39;s missing are appropriate comparisons; for example FRED data <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DJIA">for the Dow Jones Index doesn&#39;t go back far enough in a single chart</a> for easy meaningful long term analysis, this was not always the case as I recall comparing the great depression with the great recession previously).</p>

<p>In addition many data sets and analysis pointing to this conclusion are locked behind paywalls and taken down aggressively with copyright notices or otherwise censored.</p>

<p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS"><em>Federal Funds Rate</em></a>
This is the rate of return of investment you get for investing in the United States, peaked around the time the US put a man on the moon for the last time and has been in decline since then:</p>

<p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1"><em>Money Printing</em></a></p>

<p>Classically known as inflation (CPI is a political measurement)[<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/US_Consumer_Price_Index_Graph.svg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/US_Consumer_Price_Index_Graph.svg</a>], but shows similar rates of runaway hyperinflation.</p>

<p>The above two are the most objective ways of looking at whether an economy is in collapse, but we can also look at other more subjective measurements:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/despair-american-style.html"><em>Despair, American Style</em></a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen this kind of thing in other times and places – for example, in the plunging life expectancy that afflicted Russia after the fall of Communism. But it’s a shock to see it, even in an attenuated form, in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-18/america-decay">US Political Institutions in Decay</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These days, books are written arguing that the Forest Service ought to be abolished altogether. If the Forest Service’s creation exemplified the development of the modern American state, its decline exemplifies that state’s decay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/05/30-4-14-malan-joelandre.pdf">Book Review: Political Order and Political Decay</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the risk of political decay is especially high in the U.S. due to the confluence of partisanship and the hampering of state effectiveness through checks and balances. The upshot is that a state apparatus lacking sufficient autonomy from an overly politicized legislature results in weak government—or, as Fukuyama succinctly puts it, “When polarization confronts America’s Madisonian check-and-balance political system, the result is particularly devastating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate"><em>Incarceration Rate Per Capita</em></a></p>

<p>This is the percentage of people incarcerated. The United States is number 2 on the list, far ahead of collapsed or failing states like Rwanda, South Africa, Iran and Russia. And the numbers for the US listed above only include adults who are incarcerated. This is around triple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/50n7sn/what_was_the_rate_of_incarceration_in_nazi_germany/">the incarceration rate of Germany in 1939</a>, according to AskHistorians.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/"><em>How US Gun Deaths Compare</em></a></p>

<p>The review of 2010 World Health Organization data also revealed that despite having a similar rate of nonlethal crimes as those countries, the United States has a much higher rate of deadly violence, mostly due to the higher rate of gun-related murders. Gun deaths in the US are higher than in Mexico or South Africa, per capita. Neither of which are really prime examples of successful states.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/child-sexual-abuse-top-5-countries-highest-rates-1436162">Child Sexual Abuse: Top 5 Countries With the Highest Rates</a></p>

<p>The ability to protect children is a mark of a functional state. Once again, look who we find on this list of worst collapsed countries.</p>

<p>Are there any other statistics which normally indicate collapse that you think prove America Stronk? Keep in mind that North Korean and Soviet Propaganda kept boldly claiming they were stronger than any other countries long after the state collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The bilateral Sino-Russian trade agreements denominated in their own respective currencies are the first cracks in the edifice of the petrodollar.  I think this is why Syria and Russian collusion continue to feature heavily in our propaganda diet.</p>

<p>Couple that with new generations of missile technology rendering the bulk of our conventional force projection via aircraft carriers obsolete against these nations, and you start to see the basis for a shift in the balance of power.  I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen overnight, and probably the best strategy is to let US corruption gradually eat the nation from within.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactley the states that have/or formed an alternative, and that could eaisily be tackled, namely the african alliance have, or are in the process of destabalisation, Syria, south Africa at el. Russia and China are a different kettle of fish. Especially China. As the US has painted themselves into a corner with them by forming a too big to fail symbiotic (weakness) relationship with them. Puts the sino-russian side at a bit of an advantage, that is unless the US can untangle, but I think nigh on impossible. The amount of debt stored up by both parties on the US is incredible. Do you think this new belligerence is a shot across the bow that they know the petrodollar is sorta on its last legs, you know, with all the what not of alternative energy etc, that they planning on reneging on that? Im sure some think tank has put the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>How could it ever be accomplished?  And even if it were possible, how could the leader of one country make it happen? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>project bluebeam - faking an alien invasion, triggering the humans into unifying against the threat, causing the nations to surrender their sovereignty to the pope (a la ronald reagans speech at the un). </p>

<p>ww3: using the hegelian method, several thesis/antithesis ideologies will destroy each other (pike and blavatsky), presenting us with the synthesis: the nwo. again, headed by the papacy</p>

<p>causing a civil war in america and thus destroying it and especially the middle class thus achieving socialism. after a bloody purge of millions of &#39;heretics&#39;, america will be ready to join its socialist brothers (primarily russia and china), who both already underwent the purge under mao, lenin and stalin.</p>

<p>keep demoralizing and indoctrinating the americans through education, failing infrastructure, gmos, politics, pollution, pharmaceuticals, corruption and other slow-kill and soft-kill methods, to the point it looses its superpower status and simply collapses like rome did. </p>

<p>there are possibly many other ways to do it.</p>
