        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CIA is an enemy to the U.S. Constitution, and an enemy to peace-loving people in America and around the globe.</p>

<p>The CIA is a war-loving, U.S. taxpayer money-stealing mass slaughterer of at least 18 million innocent people around the world since its creation in 1947. The CIA is no better than the old KGB, and probably much worse (consider the assassinations of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Fred Hampton, Frank Olson, and many others from Salvador Allende to Patrice Lumumba to Orlando Letelier and, in all liklihood, Andrei Karlov a few months ago, and many more).</p>

<p>Patriotic, knowledgeable Americans oppose the CIA and want it shut down, just like so many Russians wanted the now-defunct KGB shut down. The CIA and their friends in the War / &quot;Defense&quot; industry (mega-companies like Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman) rob and steal from American tax payers on a huge scale: Trillions upon trillions upon trillions of taxpayer dollars to build <strong><em>way too, too many</em></strong> Hydrogen bombs, missiles, ICBMs, nuclear attack submarines (expensive as hell), fighter jets (we don&#39;t need the F-35 jet because the F-15, F-16, and F-22 are enough, and actually better than the F-35), ABMs (anti-ballistic missile systems which are a farce and don&#39;t work 97 percent of the time), too many long-range strategic bombers, too many aircraft carriers, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The U.S. spends on &quot;Defense&quot; each year <strong>what the next 12 nations combined</strong> spend on defense. That&#39;s crazy, but the War / &quot;Defense&quot; companies (Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.) love it. They see their profits soar while our taxes go way, way up.</p>

<p>A shockingly high 60 percent of our Federal Income Tax dollars goes to &quot;Defense.&quot; No more than 30 percent (and probably 15 percent) of our income taxes should be spent on &quot;Defense,&quot; but the &quot;Defense&quot; companies and their CIA enforcers control our government, not the American People. We do <strong>not</strong> live in a democracy. For example, the vast majority of Americans were opposed to the Iraq War that began in 2003 (15 years ago), but President Bush/Cheney started the war anyway on a lie of &quot;weapons of mass distraction&quot; to the great joy and celebration of the &quot;Defense&quot; / War industry.</p>

<p>If anyone is currently in college/university or if you have the time, do yourself a big, big favor and please take a Peace Studies class, so you can more easily see through the propaganda and lies of the CIA / &quot;Defense&quot; industry. Their lies dominate the news on a daily basis. In many ways, we live in George Orwell&#39;s dystopia of <em>1984</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like the CIA either.</p>

<p>But your claim is just not supportable at all. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka">Read this on the Cheka</a> in 1917 and compare that to, say, the CIA in 1950. No matter what the mayhem the ex-Yale playboys of the CIA got up to, the entire structure of revolutionary security was truly monstrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well admittedly, I don&#39;t know much about early 20th century Russian history, but I do know that the Western powers including Britain, France, and the U.S. invaded Russia in 1918, shortly after the Russian Revolution, when the Russian people overthrew and executed their corrupt czar (monarch / king) who kept the Russian people impoverished for decades.  (During the American Revolution we freed ourselves from a king too).</p>

<p>I was struck by this line in the link you provided: &quot;On August 3, a VCheka section for combating counterrevolution, speculation and <strong>sabotage on railways</strong> was created.&quot;  So it sounds like there were still a lot of monarchists who supported czarist rule, and the remaining monarchists may have been supported by Britain, France, and our own country, the U.S.</p>

<p>After doing a little more reading at the BBC&#39;s site, I learned that in 1918 and 1919, Britain, France, and the U.S. captured certain Russian regions and cities like Murmansk and Vladivostok until the Russians won those areas back a year or so later.  So the U.S. has invaded Russia, while the Russians have never invaded the U.S.</p>

<p>I guess we need an expert on the Cheka, an expert on the KGB, and an expert like John Potash on the CIA to debate each other to see which is the worst organization :-)</p>

<p>The article you linked to provides estimates of deaths attributable to the Cheka (which occurred partly during the Western powers&#39; invasion of Russia) to be somewhere between 12,000 to 200,000 (which is just a decimal point rounding error for the CIA&#39;s 16 million deaths -- and some estimate well over 20 million).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian Revolution led by Jewish Revolutionary leaders. Trotsky went to NYC where he received trained men and gold from Jacob Schiff. The Cheka and secret police were filled with Jews. 
Same with the French Revolution btw. The lodges where the the planning began was inundated with Jews. Voltaire, Robespierre met with them to receive funding and help spread propaganda. </p>

<p>So finally we come full circle to the present. If you want to address this problem, expect to fail, since you will be fighting the Full Establishment with its cabal of greedy, deceitful gentiles and Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t read far enough. There were numberless victims after the days of the Cheka, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn">Alexander Solzschenitsin</a> recorded in his novels, and a million deaths <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag#Death_toll">are estimated for the gulag</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">Holodomor</a> was executed by the Cheka/NKVD/KGB entity in the decade prior to WWII:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent research has since narrowed the estimates (of deaths) to between 2.4[17] and 7.5[18] million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to see where the 16 million CIA deaths come from. I suppose if you count all war deaths of conflicts related to the USA since WWII, then yes - but that&#39;s a stretch.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t understate the excess of the historical Soviet terror apparatus aimed at its own people, not at distant banana republics. The difference between today&#39;s Russia and the Soviet version is immense.  </p>

<p>Well, I read the whole wiki page you provided for the Checka in your first post&#39;s link.  Now in your second post you&#39;re providing a wiki link to Gulags and Solzschenitsin, which you admit that [quote] &quot;there were numberless victims <strong>after</strong> the days of the Cheka.&quot;</p>

<p>So you changed the debate a bit.  But okay, we agree, there&#39;s too much death and havoc in the world, thanks to the CIA and other evil entities like MI6.</p>

<p>When the Soviets were invited by Afghanistan&#39;s secular government to fight in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989 against religious extremists armed by the CIA (called the Mujahideen), it&#39;s estimated one million Afghanis lost their lives.  During the Vietnam War, which historians recognize was the CIA&#39;s war, about 3.8 million innocent Vietnamese died, another 800,000 Cambodians died, and another 1 million people died in Laos, totaling 5.6 million people.  Author John Potash estimated 8 million Koreans died during the Korean War, just for a few comparisons.  The CIA is believed to have dropped anthrax during the Korean War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I agree to agree.</p>

<p>The thing of it was that hyperbole does not help, and I thought your &quot;worse than the KGB&quot; was over the top. The tricky part is that the Russians really did move away from those Communist excesses, so we have to talk about phases where it was really bad, up to the situation post-Cold War, which - except for some excessive deviousness on Facebook - they look pretty OK.</p>

<p>Now on the CIA - I would throw in that they had a chance to come clean and get back to the business of keeping the USA from being outwitted by the rest of the world. It was during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">Church Committee</a> and then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra Hearings</a>. At that time, the clear public opinion was to rein in the CIA. It did not happen - instead, we got George Bush I and then 9/11 with Bush II. Clinton was along for the ride too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot to add:</p>

<p>The United States did not recognize the legitimacy of the Soviet Union for a very long time: an entire 16 years.  Finally in 1933 when Franklin Delano Rooseveldt (F.D.R.) became president, we recognized the Soviet Union.  It&#39;s likely that had FDR survived World War 2, instead of dying on April 12, 1945 (less than a month before V.E. Day, which was May 8), the U.S. would have remained allies/friends with the Soviet Union.  </p>

<p>FDR&#39;s very progressive Vice-President, the great Henry Wallace, also was friendly towards the Soviets like his boss.  Suspiciously, FDR&#39;s &quot;advisors&quot; convinced FDR to replace Wallace with Truman as Vice-President shortly after Rooseveldt&#39;s fourth presidential victory.  Truman became Vice-President on January 20, 1945, which must have been on FDR&#39;s 4th inauguration day.  So then with the great progressive Henry Wallace out of the picture, less than 3 months later, F.D.R. dies on April 12 at the young age of just 63 -- supposedly of a cerebral hemmorhage.  And V.E. Day was only 26 days away in the future (May 8, 1945).  The militant hawks foresaw the handwriting on the wall.</p>

<p>Looks suspiciously to me like the militant hawks in the Administratin replaced Wallace with the Nowhere-Near-As-Progressive Truman, then very possibly killed 63-year-old FDR just 2 months after that.  They couldn&#39;t kill FDR with Wallace as Vice-President waiting in the wings, because Wallace was even more progressive than FDR.  So the future of the world was written in those short 2 months.  The militant hawks, hungry for world domination, power, and imperial conquest of the Third World nations from Central America to Asia, replaced Wallace and killed FDR and went on the war path with our Soviet allies, costing American taxpayers MEGA TRILLIONS UPON TRILLIONS of dollars and leading to the deaths of 18 to 20-plus Million people worldwide.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so obvious what happened (or what very likely happened), but, of course, you won&#39;t hear any of this narrative explored on CIAstream media.</p>

<p>Direct democracy worked in ancient Greece.  What&#39;s dangerous is the so-called &quot;representative&quot; republic in which &quot;elected&quot; officials make the deicisons for us, like when our representatives voted to authorize the Iraq war 15 years ago, the Vietnam War, the Korean &quot;conflict,&quot; etc., etc.  That&#39;s the true danger that you Walter Lipmann types are &quot;protecting&quot; the American People from, I guess.</p>
