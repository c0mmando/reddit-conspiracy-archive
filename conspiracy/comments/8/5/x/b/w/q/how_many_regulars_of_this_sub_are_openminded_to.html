        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fairly straight-forward question. Regardless of &#39;who&#39; you think is at the top of the social/financial/spiritual hierarchy, are you open to the possibility that they are not &#39;evil&#39; after all?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is because it seems to me like this is the primary doctrine which most conspiracy people hold dearest: they see the world as &#39;us&#39; vs &#39;them&#39;, and &#39;them&#39; as &#39;evil&#39; or malevolent or nefarious.</p>

<p>I used to see it this way, too, but I could never reconcile certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv6FHRoDwVo">obvious clues</a> they left in their deceptions. It is like they <em>want</em> some of us to <strong>wake up</strong>, to see that their acts and performances on the telescreen are a charade.</p>

<p>Of course the majority of people who respond to this thread will be steadfast in their view that the &#39;elite&#39; are &#39;evil&#39;, and that is okay, I am not trying to change your mind. I just want to know:</p>

<p>1) How do reconcile the blatant clues they leave behind?</p>

<p>2) Are you at least OPEN to changing your mind?</p>

<p>Discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this mostly but I think there are family members of groups like the Rockefellers or Rothschilds who are just rich because of who they are and what they inherited but don&#39;t give a shit about wielding some dark power. </p>

<p>The families are so large and dispersed at this point that some of them can just sit around on their rich asses buying artwork and turning grapes into wine because they don&#39;t really have anything else to do nor do they care for playing puppetmaster. To them it is much more fun to screw around being rich.</p>

<p>Me... not that anyone asked... but if I had one of those last names I wouldn&#39;t bother with shit. I&#39;d be doing lines of cocaine of the thigh of a hot model in Monaco between picking out the the new colors for the carpet in the den of my 7th home. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Power can only be truly demonstrated by making the inferior ones suffer, so even a relatively benign elite by necessity needs to be evil (however you want to define &quot;evil&quot;).  That people will, in the absence of any counteracting force, tend towards malevolence, is just an observation anyone who knows people at all can make - there are a great many malevolent cowards in the world with no status or significant power, who will readily go along with any sort of brutality (which can be exploited by anyone seeking greater domination).</p>

<p>I&#39;m coming from a different place than many of the people here though.  I&#39;m a believer in socialism, and I am well aware of the typical conspiracy theories fed to conservative plebs for consumptions and how to deconstruct them.  Still, I would expect powerful people to conspire - that&#39;s what powerful people do to stay in power, and that&#39;s how networks of human beings work.  Being someone who is a loner and was never socialized properly, I&#39;ve had to learn how that works from the outside, out of necessity to survive and cope with people I largely hate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mentality is irrelevant.  What sort of idiot would ignore millennia of war and torture, or things they should have learned as children if they had any exposure to the wider world?  Just observing the behavior of children at school should be enough to give everyone a basic idea of how power works, although that environment is deliberately engineered to hyper-charge malevolent behavior and reinforce the existing social hierarchy.  Enforcing a social hierarchy is only possible on the basis of ignorance and the application of terror and suffering, and ignorance can only be enforced by malevolent actions which most of us ought to be familiar with (and ultimately, the application of terror and suffering).  So long as one group of people must deem themselves better than another, the inevitable conclusion is that those who consider themselves superior are willing to use terror to enforce their belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this sub is fixated on the whole pedo thing.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s gross and horrific but it&#39;s just the tip of a much worse iceberg.  These elites are evil but...they live by a certain morality kind of like a dedicated Nazi.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what they believe:</p>

<p>Darwinism.  The people who are super rich and powerful in the world are this way due to natural selection.  These people have been involved in selective breeding between elite families for at least centuries to the point where they consider themselves almost a different better species than us average humans.  </p>

<p>From this comes the doctrine that to save the human race and indeed move it forward to the next stage of evolution is the only thing that matters.  However many of ordinry people have to suffer and die to advance this agenda is meaningless.  Nature has already made the selection and history shows that no matter how much genocide you commit, a few generations later those people will have been replaced with others.  Despite horrific plagues, wars, and numerous genocides in the millions we have more humans today than ever and the number seems to keep growing.</p>

<p>So wiping out a few million of the common people is no more concerning to them than cutting the grass.  It&#39;ll grow back.  And if you think for a minute that these people aren&#39;t VERY good at controlling populations of us then you haven&#39;t been paying attention!</p>

<p>Just think about things from that standpoint for a while and see if a lot of what seems really bizarre in the world starts to make perfect sense.</p>

<p>Of course, the wealthy get the real data, so they know better than we do when the party will end. And I imagine they will be nowhere to be found when it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the elite know this, too. That is why public education was dumbed down,  the MSM have been turned into propaganda outlets, local police are now militarized, and we have bern sold hypersurveillance. They know how this ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But all those things accelerate those outcomes. Dumber populace, worse opportunities, heavy police approach, people worried about big brother... this accelerates discord and resentment. Does not mean revolutions or uprisings or populist uprisings have good outcomes but the result of an undereducated angry paranoid populace is usually bad for everyone... but in the short run they buy things and let the top .1% plunder everything on sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The period from 1945-1960 produced the best publicly educated students in the world. When the wealthy tried to send them to Vietnam, social unrest resulted. The systemic reduction of US public education started in the early 1970&#39;s and continues today. The dolts we produce today fight the elite&#39;s wars willingly. No, there will be no resistance unless the teevee goes dark and the fridge goes empty and, by then, the wealthy will be far out of reach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the social unrest of the 1970s is far over rated and that same generation is sticking it to young people today while trying to grab everything for themselves. We had some protests against Vietnam by the people who weren’t going anyways, the war went on for a decade. Social mores got relaxed but the roots of today’s dysfunction were laid then. </p>

<p>And I am not talking about 1970s social unrest, I am talking Russia 1917, China 1949, Venezuela today, Syria today, Germany 1930s, etc. As I said before, the outcomes aren’t good but everyone suffers... sure some elite get away but many don’t...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very open to the possiblity. However when you&#39;re systematically trying to genocide whites via mass immigration and demography in order to, over the course of many centuries, create a homogenous dark skinned global underclass without nationality, culture, race etc... it&#39;s very hard to entertain the possiblity that they may not be evil. This underclass will then be eternally ruled by a white global artistocracy that will be akin to gods as they use technology that will seem like magic to the slave underclass.</p>

<p>But I have no doubts that high level masons are propagandised into believing that cutting down the tall poppy (whites) and working towards UN-mandated global communism is a noble goal. Nobody gets up in the morning thinking &#39;I&#39;ll do evil today, haha!&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that once someone is alienated from the majority (especially by accumulating wealth), they begin to see society in a different light.  The fakeness, cruelness, greed.. all of our darkest sides are more visible to someone when they are looking from the outside.  This results in the elite playing us like a game.. because we are no longer of the same kind, and so it&#39;s only natural to recognize each other as enemies, pawns, or whatever you want to call this rat race we part of.</p>

<p>Sure people and groups go rogue within larger elements but there are reasons they have constructed it this way. </p>

<p>Think of good people who get forced into setting up/doing a not so great thing and stuck with the lie that was handed down to them. As long as people believe in this layer of reality which INCLUDES the conspiracy that there is an evil baby eating elite, then we do not rule our own minds. </p>
