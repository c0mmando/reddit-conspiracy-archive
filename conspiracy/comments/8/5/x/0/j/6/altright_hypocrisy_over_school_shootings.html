       How many people here was pushing an agenda that the Florida shooting was a left-wing conspiracy theory to take away guns while mocking the students, but the school shooting in Maryland was a legitimate one with an armed resource officer that proves that we need guns in schools?

       No it's not.  You obviously don't even know what the alt right claims to be in their own words.  It's just another term to throw around in an attempt to delegitimize anyone you disagree with.  It's no different than calling everyone Nazis.

       Are you referring to Richard Spencer ? The alt-right is like the new generation of conservatives that are more technically inclined, but were still raised and brainwashed by racist neoconservative colonialist parents that would often identify with the Tea Party and Alex Jones. I don't see why that is hard for you to understand?

       The left has an over-dependence on AI amplified public relations campaigns, indiscriminately unleashed on the public of all partisanship leaning for any statement not lock-step in line with the key narratives of the day. High frequency of false positives then exposes people that otherwise would be a Dem voter to abuse and name calling on line if they dare the criminal offense of arguing for additional items in the platform, different direction for key issues, offering critical feedback that would improve the Dem messaging, or taking issue with any of the leadership. The rabid attacks that quickly follow get noticed. It's like training a dog to pee on a pad, they go and pee outside on the grass, but the action was unexpected and the tool registers failure and whacks it with a newspaper anyway. That's some real behavioralist conditioning reinforced over and over and over again. It's creating massive changes in the voter population that will requite years to decondition again.

       Yet we have actual proof of the right doing this and falling for it with Cambridge Anyalitica. Just like with the ReleaseTheMemo twitter campaign being pushed by bots. Same with right wingers sharing and retweeting, now proven, Russian propaganda accounts.

       More nonsense hyperbole. Should have added that the right are masters of projection, it's scary how accruate the projection is as well. Almost like they are self aware of what they do so they assume everyone else is as dishonest as them

       Are you even capable of not talking on hyperbole? You must know of the indictments that show it was a huge state sponsored operation. Which is seperate from the Cambridge Analytica news we've recieved.

       I don't believe there has ever been a "staged" school shooting.  I do think that your point about the "alt-right" jumping on the school shooting in Maryland shows that these events should not be politicized by either party.

       Furthermore, it shows the issue of creating legislation from a state of emotion, instead of a state of logic.

       Doesn’t the Maryland shooting highlight how less damage a shooter can do when they have a handgun vs an assault style weapon like an AR?
      </p>
      <p>
       In both instances the schools had someone armed. The only difference was that the person that defended the students in Maryland was going against someone with equal sized weapon. Whereas the Florida Sheriff that was on campus didn’t go into face the attacker because he was outgunned.

       Disagree with "the only difference" part here. From what I understand about the Maryland incident the shooter had two specific targets in mind due to relationship difficulties. Correct me if I'm wrong. If that is the case then the shooter doesn't appear to have the "intent" to shoot anyone else.

       From my understanding as well, you are correct.  It’s not complete apples to apples and it was probably misleading for me to phrase it that way.  There were certainly unique in there own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im mostly just trying to make a point that the difference in the guns used, played a factor.  I don’t think you can compare the two shooting to determine the difference between having unarmed vs armed teachers

       You make a valid point regarding the gun used in the Maryland incident possibly playing a part in the decision by the armed security guard to engage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason the term "equalizer" is used frequently by LEO's and military personnel.

       I would also think the armed security guard thought about the Parkland incident very briefly before engaging. Who wouldn't in their situation?

       I'm not exactly bought into the whole crisis actors thing, although the poor kids are being used to some degree, but whatever they are making their mark on the world.
       <br/>
       A few random answers/discussion:
       <br/>
       Conspiracy theory does not equal alt-right.  There are plenty of conspiracy theories against alt-right as well.
       <br/>
       Now, in this case, the shooting you're referring to today seems pretty cut and dry.
       <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/maryland-school-shooting-resource-officer-response-trnd/index.html">
        https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/maryland-school-shooting-resource-officer-response-trnd/index.html
       </a>
       Simple, clean.  We have all parties involved.  Everyone accounted for.  No real questions need answering, we have even a very real motive. Only real question is who shot the assailant, but that's normal for this time frame, not all details will be released.  This is what a normal information exchange is supposed to look like.
       <br/>
       Vegas, Florida, and others have these seemingly normal questions shrouded in secrecy, which only further engages the conspiracy theoriest (left or right).
       <br/>
       Also, counter to your point, the fact that the MSM isn't really pushing this story is also somewhat telling.  Granted the article here is from CNN, but I haven't heard a peep about it on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I'm not alt right, whatever that means, and don't necessarily believe those other incidents are false flags/crisis actor type situations.  I do believe weird shit happened in connection to those other incidents however, which deserve further inquiry.

       The people weren't "pushing an agenda" that Florida was a false flag. They were pointing out the dozens of things that pointed to the shooting being a false flag, from the many chances authorities had to stop the shooter long before he started shooting, to the armed deputies waiting outside while the shooting went on, to the kids hiding from the shooter in the closet doing anti-gun interviews, to the ready-made media campaign and expensive and highly organized anti-gun protest movement that instantly arose after the shooting, to the key spoke-student's ties to the media and FBI. And more. Just because Florida shooting was a false flag doesn't mean that every other shooting will be.

       Immediately after a shooting, certain people consider a couple variables, decide it's a false flag, then work backwards from there. In the case of the MD shooting, the good guy with a gun narrative is more valuable than the false flag narrative, so that's what they go with.

       While the school shooting obviously happened it is also very obvious who was pushing the agenda.  A group of 15 year old kids are not organised enough to arrange a national walkout.  Elementary school children are not organised enough to arrante a walk out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know who are? The adults behind the children.  The few kids who decided to refrain from the walk out were often threatened with punishment (Google this).  So whose agenda are we really following?  Grade 3's or adults?

       You're basically saying that high school kids are not capable of organizing themselves in any way, especially to feel safer in there own schools, so therefore they must be controlled by the school staff? The news story you are referring to in regards to facing detention I believe was another fake right-wing concoction, that actually the student refused to follow directions to go to study hall and tried claiming it was because they refused to participate.

       Yea, nice dodge on the Elementary students.  A few years ago I was in high school, so yes that is what I am saying.  If anything the vast majority would have dodged any sort of protest and gone home to smoke weed, play games, go to a restaurant with friends, etc.

       Which elementary schools are you referring to? You are advocating for arming elementary teachers too then? Might as well put a big fence around it and call it a prison... I'm sure though the goal here is to try to somehow get Betsy Devos to allow rich to use taxes to pay for their home school while forcing the poor black communities to go to their prisons so they can learn the right-wing version of history that includes Noah's Ark.

       Haha... Orchestrated by adults? These kids live with adults still, of course they encouraged and supported their children to do what is right. What is wrong with you to think that isn't possible, and yes other parents and adults stood with them and supported them in their efforts. Of course, don't be silly. Why are you acting like this isn't common sense?

       Anytime a parent or adult supports the actions made by someone younger, then it is really the adults making those actions and just the young person doing what they are told? Really...

       True fact. Teenage brains don’t  fully develop until the age of 25 or so. Therefore, children literally do not have the cognitive development to construct critical thinking skills. It is for this reason there is simply no way they orchestrated this themselves. It was put into process of their reasoning from somewhere.

       True fact, you can join the military at age 18 and drink alcohol at age 21. To say that people don't have the cognitive ability at those ages to construct critical thinking skills is just wrong and a way to ostracize people younger to prevent them from making decisions for themselves. Essentially a way for older people to try to exploit the younger generations in fear that they may take away something, when in reality it is the younger generation creating much of the positive change in society.

       This doesn't suggest that they wanted to maximize body count. They could have been investigating, but not quick enough. I agree that there should a lot more transparency in government, but it doesn't help when you get people who want to politicize every issue and then blame the victims for being crisis actors. It is one thing to hypothesize about issues, but the only case that is getting closed is here:

Their actions or lack thereof they may have increased the death toll, but that doesn't indicate that was the motive. Every cop is put in situations where they must act and try to make a decision as to what the best course of action is. I believe and hope to hear more from the story in that regard as well, and feel free to ping me once they release more information or if you don't think they are within the next 3 months and you submit the proper requests for information yourself.

       It’s also come out that Cruz was supposed to have been institutionalized nearly 2 years prior, but they didn’t do it.

       @FartfullyYours: I can definitely accept that the FBI may have been actually tormenting this kid to try to get him to do something, and that they may have helped inspire his actions. They are notorious for creating issues and I firmly believe that they do this way too often, and that they owe reparations to probably thousands of Americans who will never find out just how much their lives were impacted by issues that they would facilitate.

       They are the groups that frequently push the conspiracy actors debate, but in Maryland they were quick to jump on legitimate shooting stopped by an armed resource officer, and therefore it proves that guns are good and we need more armed people. That is the story they are running with at least this time around. Their opinions change to fit the narrative though, so it is hard to keep up.

       I have no political affiliation but I think the doubts and questions begin when there coincidentally happens to be a drill or training excercise with the same game plan at the exact same time as the "real event.'

       You missed the point of the posts. Just because they plan and prepare for accidents, doesn't mean that they can predict a real life scenario, which everything indicates it actually happened except people from the alt-right pushing gun control conspiracies.

       From my understanding as well, you are correct.  It’s not complete apples to apples and it was probably misleading for me to phrase it that way.  There were certainly unique in there own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im mostly just trying to make a point that the difference in the guns used, played a factor.  I don’t think you can compare the two shooting to determine the difference between having unarmed vs armed teachers

       So then all this we see in the media about the resource office being a hero, and that there would have been many more deaths if he didn't have a fun, is just more right-wing propaganda?

       Are you referring to Richard Spencer ? The alt-right is like the new generation of conservatives that are more technically inclined, but were still raised and brainwashed by racist neoconservative colonialist parents that would often identify with the Tea Party and Alex Jones. I don't see why that is hard for you to understand?
