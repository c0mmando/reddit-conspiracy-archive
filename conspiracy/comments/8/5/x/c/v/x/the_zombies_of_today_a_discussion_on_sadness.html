        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><em>Preface</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/52145-tiny-brain-implant-could-treat-depression.html">Have you heard about the wirelessly powered brain implant that could treat depression?</a></p>

<p>Or what about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/darpa-s-brain-chips-could-be-the-next-big-mental-health-1791549701">DARPA’s brain chip implants?</a></p>

<p>Growing up, my friend, who was about 13 at the time, was suffering from major depression. At 13 years old, she was put on pills for this depression immediately. Now, she cannot live a day without these pills, or there will be dangerous consequences. Did anybody consider that she was perhaps too young to be put on such pills? Why weren’t alternative measures considered before pills? This girl’s family certainly had enough money to afford it (they had an indoor pool!). </p>

<p>Today, many years later, today, there is a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/14/rise-in-teen-suicide-connected-to-social-media-popularity-study/">rise in teen suicides connected to social media popularity</a>. </p>

<p>Further, in just 15 years, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/sc-hlth-antidepressant-use-on-the-rise-0823-story.html">antidepressant use jumped 65 percent</a></p>

<p>While we hear about suicide, depression, and related issues all of the time, it never seems to be discussed deeply. Sure, we see the ads on TV, but what is really going on? Is depression really just an issue with chemical imbalances in our brains? Or is there something more? Is it ever okay to be sad? Are our views of mental illness completely twisted? In this post, I want to discuss the conspiracy behind depression and sadness, and I want to argue that, maybe, we are already living in a world of zombies. </p>

<p><strong>Depression – is it all chemical?</strong></p>

<p>As somebody who has dealt with my mom’s suicide, I am in no way dismissing the fact that depression can be genetic or due to chemical imbalances. I am also not dismissing anybody’s individual experience that may counter this post. I just want to offer an alternative perspective.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have spent much time on many subreddits like <a href="/r/suicidewatch">/r/suicidewatch</a> and <a href="/r/depression">/r/depression</a> and others like that. In some ways, I was coping with my own depression, and in other ways I wanted to help people. One common theme I saw amongst users is that they always feel like there is no escape – that this depression is just part of them. Again, I am not dismissing this, but I am often shocked by the amount of people who dismiss environment when it comes to psychological issues, and that seems to be happening today. Further, people are more likely to choose medication over other means of help. Why? Well this is a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201507/psychotherapy-vs-medications-the-verdict-is-in">conspiracy itself</a>. </p>

<p>From the article,
“The profession of psychology is under heavy scrutiny with revelations that officials in the American Psychological Association (APA) colluded with the Department of Defense, tailoring its established ethics policies so that they comported with DOD preferences after the 9/11 attacks. Although those senior officials have resigned or retired in the wake of the scandal, the entire affair has the potential to tarnish the reputation of the thousands of licensed clinical psychologists working in the field who provide ethically responsible mental health services.
It would be a shame if the clients who stand to benefit from these services turned away from the psychological interventions that have the potential to help them. Psychotherapy is known to be an effective treatment for a wide range of psychological disorders. Yet, even before news of the APA scandal hit the press, the average person seeking help has tended to seek psychiatric drugs rather than psychotherapy. Antidepressants and antianxiety medications are among the leading prescription drugs not only in the US but around the world.”</p>

<p>This is alarming. Again, it is not that some people do not need medication, but the problem is that depression seems to be viewed today as just an issue with a brain – nothing to due with a person’s living conditions, or environment, or life in general. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/21/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-treatment-chronic-depression-antidepressants">Yet, studies show mindfulness is as effective as pills when it comes to treating depression</a></p>

<p>And big surprise, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/depression-not-governed-by-genes-and-environment-is-a-major-factor-when-it-comes-to-being-happy-a6958686.html">environment seems to be the biggest factor in depression</a></p>

<p>Again, we should not dismiss the genetic link to depression, but I find it alarming that the above article even states that these findings could lead to new medications. </p>

<p><strong>As long as people get treated…</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I am not against people getting help through medication, and there are many people who do need medication. However, again, there is an over-reliance on it, and it is a go-to even when environmental factors are likely the cause of depression. And sure, therapy has a bad reputation at times, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/06/15/the-strategies-that-science-actually-shows-are-effective-for-depression/#7595b2cc5117">there are types of therapy that really do work</a></p>

<p>Moreover, people dismiss the fact that anti-depressants (like any other medication) are not 100% safe and can have many consequences. For one, anti-depressants literally <a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-antidepressants-brain-structure-20140918-story.html">rewire the brain</a></p>

<p>As noted earlier, my friend who was prescribed anti-depressants at 13 has to take them forever now, or there are dangerous consequences. Her brain needs them.</p>

<p>Addiction is another problem. For example, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/24/ministers-demand-action-rising-numbers-hooked-painkillers-anti/">There is a rise of anti-depressant abuse amongst middle-aged woman</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-antidepressant-studies-found-tainted-by-pharma-company-influence/">Is it a surprise to anyone that many antidepressant studies are found to be tainted by pharma company influence?</a></p>

<p>The conspiracy is obvious here – these major companies make money off of prescribing these pills, and in the meantime, people face serious consequences. It would be impossible to note all of the serious side effects of anti-depressants, but the saddest part of it all, is that people are being convinced that their depression is not really attributed to anything but something wrong with their brains – that it is not fixable or curable, and the only way to be happy is to pop a pill and watch a cute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twhvtzd6gXA">Zoloft commercial</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Our environment</strong></p>

<p>When we actually look at the environment of our world today, though, we realize something is seriously out of whack. Depression, and suicide attributed to depression, are not just “random” as often painted by advertisements and news sources. There are many factors in our environment today that are causing prolonged sadness in the general population. Yet, instead of trying to fix factors in our environment, scientists are working on more anti-depressants and future brain implants to rewire our brains! Again, “they” are convincing people, in a way, that they have no control. Still, let’s look at some of the environmental factors that might make people depressed:</p>

<p><em>Social Media</em>: I noted the study earlier, but this one seems pretty obvious. When people are constantly comparing themselves to others, they can never be happy. Sadly, teens may have less coping mechanisms when it comes to social media. For many, social media is their life and their outlet. There are thousands of articles about the dangers of social media, not just for teens, but for all, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-medias-impact-on-self-esteem_us_58ade038e4b0d818c4f0a4e4">self-esteem</a>. I focus on teens, though, because they are growing up in a world where they know nothing other than technology. </p>

<p><em>Food/Exercise</em>: While food may not on it is own cause depression, it can definitely be a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626">factor</a>. Today, more than ever, I see teens (I work with teens) growing up with food as their number one coping mechanism for just about anything. There are thousands of studies on the obesity crisis in the United States, and I absolutely do not want to shame anyone, but there is something wrong when kids are completely lethargic and have stopped playing outside. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/children-spend-only-half-the-time-playing-outside-as-their-parents-did">Kids today spend half as much time playing outside as their parents</a>/). What are kids doing today? Playing on their smartphones, and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/child-smart-phones-cocaine-addiction-expert-mandy-saligari-harley-street-charter-clinic-technology-a7777941.html">experts say giving your kids a smartphone is like giving them a gram of cocaine</a>.</p>

<p><em>Isolation</em> More than ever, people are feeling increasingly isolated, and unfortunately, social media gives us <a href="https://www.livescience.com/58121-social-media-use-perceived-isolation.html">an illusion of closeness</a>. We are living in a world today where more and more people pride themselves on hating other people. Communities have been broken apart, and many never speak to others outside of their small circle of friends/family. Again, kids (and people in general) are spending more time than ever on their screens. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/05/09/311082149/not-so-social-media-why-people-have-stopped-talking-on-phones">Even talking on the phone has become somewhat taboo</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31855389">people are literally not talking to each other anymore</a>. This type of social isolation is a huge factor in depression and suicide, and [social isolation is deadlier than obesity](<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/08/dangers_of_loneliness_social_isolation_is_deadlier_than_obesity.html">www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/08/dangers_of_loneliness_social_isolation_is_deadlier_than_obesity.html</a>). Yet, people are being convinced that they really do not need other people, and that technology can replace human presence. The problem is that is simply <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2015/11/21/face-to-face-interactions-can-never-be-replaced-by-technology/#2402078572ec">not true</a>. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that so many claim to hate other people, yet I think the problem is that we are losing the capacity to actually have interactions with people. When we are alone with our phones most of the day, then being around people does seem unusual. As families and communities continually break down in our society, it begins to feel strange to actually communicate with others, but the problem is, that is not “natural.” Humans are made to be around other humans. </p>

<p><em>Chemicals</em> This one is pretty broad, but it is no secret that chemicals in our air, in our food, and in our environment in general have an influence on us. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/8617258/Pollution-can-lead-to-brain-damage-and-depression-warn-scientists.html">Did you know that pollution can lead to brain damage and depression?</a>. While we may not have tons of control over this, it is important to note.</p>

<p><em>Economic Woes</em> <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/04/22/death-america-suicide-surge-parallels-era-economic-woes">A thirty year trend show increasing numbers of people in the US who would rather not live at all</a>, and much of this is directly correlated with the economy, such as access to healthcare. The article notes that suicide is not always attributed to mental illness, and that is important for people to note. People who live in hopeless situations become hopeless. Today, about 1 in 4 in children are growing up in poverty (google it), and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-poverty-can-follow-children-into-adulthood/">the consequences of poverty follow children into adulthood</a>. </p>

<p>These are just the beginning of the list of environmental factors that affect people, yet many seem shocked by the rise of depression and suicide rates in our country. Many are suffering in silence, and for some, the pill may be the only thing that helps because therapy is too expensive. Or, on the flip side, there is such a stigma behind mental illness in our country. Nobody is allowed to be sad, ever, and that brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>It’s Okay to be Sad</strong></p>

<p>Growing up, I always felt ‘different’ than those around me. Everybody seemed so happy. I was not depressed - I just did not feel extremely happy. I felt that there was so much suffering in the world, that is was a hard to put on some façade of happiness.</p>

<p>In our society, being said is looked down upon. Now, I am not using the words sadness and depression interchangeably here. For the purpose of this section, I am just talking about sadness. </p>

<p>If somebody asked you how your day was, and you said “I’m sad”, they would probably look at you as if you are crazy. We have created a stigma where being honest about our feelings is stigmatized. On social media, as noted earlier, most paint their worlds as if they are absolutely perfect, but it is full of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/facebook-instagram-twitter-social-media-makes-sad-lonely-attention-seekers-a7614396.html">sad lonely people pretending they are okay</a>.</p>

<p>So, why is there such a stigma behind being sad or unhappy? </p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the story of Buddha and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_sights">four sights</a>, he did not question his world until he witnessed suffering firsthand.</p>

<p>When we are sad, we question the world around us – we want to know why suffering exists, and we want to seek answers. Could it be that “they” do not want us actually questioning the world around us?</p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway once said, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150413-the-downsides-of-being-clever">Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.</a>. When we think, we realize something is not right with the world.</p>

<p><strong>Actual Zombies</strong></p>

<p>I am sure you have seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnZGdC-vTCo">opening scene of Sean of the Dead</a>. If you have not or do not feel like watching, the joke is, we are all really indistinguishable from zombies in a sense. </p>

<p>People no longer have time to reflect on the world. Maybe they are too busy working, or too tired to think. Maybe they cope with their suffering of the world and their lives with drugs, alcohol, or whatever can soothe them. Maybe they are on social media convincing themselves they are happy, or maybe they are too distracted with hours of entertainment or infotainment, or hours of Netflix or Youtube. It seems that everybody has time to do anything but think (or they do not want to think). <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/busyness-status-symbol/518178/">Being busy is a status symbol of our time</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these constant distractions give us little time to think or reflect on the world. On top of that, people are becoming <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201401/why-is-narcissism-increasing-among-young-americans">less empathetic and more narcissistic</a>.</p>

<p>It is funny to me that zombie movies are so popular, yet many people fail to see the irony in watching some of these zombie flicks. People today seem without emotions, at least not for others, but maybe for themselves and a quest for attention on social media - but little for those around them. Metaphorically, the zombies of today can never have enough to eat in terms of addictions, distractions, and entertainment. </p>

<p>Just a creepy sidenote, though, did you see how <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/03/13/richard-dawkins-suggests-eating-human-flesh-to-overcome-cannibalism-taboo/">Richard Dawkins says we should overcome the taboo of eating human flesh?</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously. Again, there seems to be some deep separation from humanity when we even can start to think about eating other people literally. Perhaps the zombie thing was just predictive programming after all.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The reason I wrote this post is that sometimes I get sad. I thought about how there are so few people to have an honest conversation about being sad with, without them assuming you want to kill yourself or have some type of mental illness. I am not glorifying sadness – absolutely not. Clearly, prolonged sadness that becomes depression can lead to serious consequences, and the intention of this post is not to dismiss depression. Still, could a tinge of sadness in our lives be helpful?</p>

<p>To end, I want to reiterate a few things:</p>

<p>1)  The more we feel that depression or sadness is out of our control, the more likely we are to do drastic things to treat it. Putting chips in our brain is not seen as an unrealistic thing at this point in time. In other words, will we really, voluntarily, let others control our minds?</p>

<p>2)  As noted earlier in this post, intelligent people are not the happiest people. Unfortunately, that means that intelligent people are more likely to <a href="http://bigthink.com/design-for-good/why-highly-intelligent-people-suffer-more-mental-and-physical-disorders">develop mental illness</a> or [drink](<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addiction-in-society/201102/are-more-">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addiction-in-society/201102/are-more-</a> to cope. The problem is that because sadness is ostracized in our society, many feel utterly alone. They feel they have nobody to relate to or nobody that would understand. They feel that they are seeing the world in a negative light, and they are being convinced that it is just their brains – nothing to do with all the problems in the world. Intelligent people question things.</p>

<p>3)  We are becoming emotional zombies. In our efforts to not feel sad, people will do anything but actually think.</p>

<p>4)  Many who are depressed believe there is no hope for them other than popping a pill. So many are unfairly being denied the help they need – or cannot afford the help they need. Again, mental illness is stigmatized, and mental health support is often too expensive. Many are left alone trying to cope, not understanding the nature of depression itself.</p>

<p>Clearly, there are so many different directions this post can go. I want to say, though, if you do feel sad, you are not alone. Further, if you are feeling depressed or suicidal, there is help. Unfortunately, I cannot claim this world is a perfect place, but I want you to know there are still people who care about you and can help you. </p>

<p>“Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.” 
― Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>

<p>Perhaps if people were more willing to be “real” and not paint this picture that everything in their lives is absolutely perfect, the world would be a better place. No wonder teens are so sad. They live in a world through filters, and they never get a chance to see the nature of reality. I mean, they do not even seem to get a chance to think about reality.</p>

<p>There is suffering in this world, and there is sadness. We should stop denying that, and rather, instead of just “coping”, we should try to find ways to change things.</p>

<p>Sure, we may not be able to change the whole world, but maybe we can help an individual’s world (that’s my motto in life). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like you live with another person but they live inside you and this person hates your guts. Everytime you look in the mirror it says &quot;ugly&quot; &quot;worthless&quot;. When you get a moment of happiness it&#39;s right there to tell you it&#39;s fleeting. You find someone who cares? &quot;They don&#39;t care, they want something&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a voice seperate from your own minds voice its the same thing but it feels like it has a mind of its own. Like when I eat my mind goes straight to thinking about people who don&#39;t get to eat. Happiness isn&#39;t an option because you feel like you don&#39;t deserve it. The worst thing about it is you become comfy with this internal bully and you start to believe it. If someone called you stupid and ugly every single day you&#39;d eventually believe it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for all but I am bi polar and this is my experience, people with bi polar are all unique and experience things differently but I hope this gives an insight. Just to finish although I am depressed I am super aware of it, suicide is not an option, I&#39;m 30 and have a brother and sister aged 10 and for that reason alone it&#39;s totally off the cards. They can&#39;t grow up with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic post, my friend. I can tell you really put some effort into this. What technology is doing to us as human beings is the BIGGEST issue that practically <em>no one</em> is talking about. We need to become more conscious of what is happening to us and take a few steps back. We&#39;re projected to have ~75 BILLION devices connected to the IoT (Internet of Things) by 2025. Then there&#39;s the 5G smart grid. This will be <strong>game over</strong> if we do not educate the public on what this will mean for our future, and our children&#39;s futures. We are altering literally altering the brains of humanity and stripping ourselves of our basic life skills. I could go on and on about this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 5G is issue is the can of worms nobody is talking about. I personally can feel Wi-Fi every time it is turned on. The same is the case for others that I know. </p>

<p>People may doubt this is the case, but I can assure you, this is no nocebo. When Wi-Fi is turned on I can with absolute clarity feel a considerable heightening of anxiety in my body, like I was connected to a mild electric current. When it is turned off, that feeling passes. It doesn&#39;t prevent me from using Wi-Fi, as it&#39;s not that bad, but it is a clear nuisance and makes me feel tired if I have the Wi-Fi on my laptop turned on for longer periods of time. It is draining, but thankfully I don&#39;t need to be online all day, as opposed to some people that have jobs which require them to do so and be in a Wi-Fi &quot;infested&quot; environment.  But it is true that not all people are EMF sensitive in this manner, however I have no doubt these frequencies influence everyone, whether they feel it or not. Similiarly to Wi-Fi, I can also feel the 3G present on my phone, however it is much milder than the former.</p>

<p>As for 5G - I can only say that I&#39;m not looking forward to the day when it&#39;s the norm. I wonder what kind of negative effects it will have on people and their bodies and minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately. Living in a relatively rural area as well as being somewhat introverted, I&#39;ve been lucky to be able to find comfort in being alone and enjoying hobbies on my own. I recently went to the city to visit my brother and every time I go there it feels so strange to me; not only being in a place that&#39;s more condensed with people, but the way that people are so cold to each other- and it seems to get worse as time goes on. You go to a cafe that&#39;s filled with strangers and mostly everyone has a very serious expression and is avoiding eye contact at all cost, it feels very discomforting to me. It&#39;s like people want to be around other people but they don&#39;t really know how to interact because of this brickwall of division and hatred that&#39;s been created between us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to relate about your experience in the city as being &#39;cold&#39;. Im not sure if you are in the United States or not....but if you are it is a cultural/individualism thing.</p>

<p>I have travelled quite often to other countries &amp; some are cold fish treatment &amp; some were awesome at how friendly they were in huge cities.</p>

<p>One of my biggest eye openers was travelling in Russia in the 1990&#39;s. People were soooooo friendly in huge cities.</p>

<p>On Saturday nights they would close down the main street promenade/park to only walking traffic. All the people come out &amp; just hang out on Saturday evenings. People just randomly coming up and talking about whatever in a friendly way.</p>

<p>When I went back in 2007 they still close down the area for walking only but people are now much colder &amp; distant.</p>

<p>It is a sad thing to see visibly disappear from society when you know it existed before.</p>

Having spent a lot of my early life dieting in the 90s and 00s, I was shocked to learn about of the effects that aspartame sweeteners have on general health, including mood and exacerbation of mental illness. It&#39;s such a complex web of cause and effect, no wonder so many people are still in the dark about so much of this stuff. </p>

I would caution against giving them to people who&#39;s brains are still developing unless the situation is really severe. Also they should probably never be the only treatment.

I heartily recommend therapy for anyone that has these issues, but know there is also plenty you can do to help yourself, there is enormous potential to heal yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you as always for taking the time to write such a detailed post.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with Alan Moore? He wrote the original <em>V for Vendetta</em>.</p>

<p>In it, V explains to Evey that happiness is a prison. </p>

<p>You see, when we feel happy, we have something to lose. To be free we must have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>This is why the fear of death is so pernicious. After ego death, a new life can begin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that because sadness is ostracized in our society, many feel utterly alone. They feel they have nobody to relate to or nobody that would understand. <strong>They feel that they are seeing the world in a negative light, and they are being convinced that it is just their brains – nothing to do with all the problems in the world. Intelligent people question things.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignorance can be bliss, as the saying goes. Looking at the world as it is <em>really</em> can be a truly depressing thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I loved this post. My belief in regard to social media induced depression is all the comparativism.</p>

<p>If people can break the addiction to popular culture mass &amp; social media forms you will usually see within a year or two massive changes in their positivity levels.</p>

<p>I believe mass media is mostly broadcasting &#39;highlight&#39; reels of good or negative events.</p>

<p>These polarized snapshots/broadcasts will never provide a realistic portrayal of life to relate to.</p>

<p>Once you make the break &amp; keep at it for a few years you often can&#39;t believe how positive change can occur.</p>

<p>Not discounting drugs, but advocating for other possible solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the type of post that keeps me coming back to this sub. I really appreciate your thoroughness and rationality, traits which are disappointingly rare in this community as of late. In my view, the assault on human consciousness and the normalized integration of technology to help us cope with the assault is one of the biggest parts of the conspiracy. I like how you wrote the section on loneliness. We <em>seem</em> more connected with more people than ever before, but overwhelmingly we <em>feel</em> more alone and isolated than ever. I think these feelings will ring true for a lot of the people in this community. I know I struggle with not being able to have critical, meaningful real-life conversations about the subjects we discuss here with someone who is at least open minded enough to entertain them, let alone discuss them seriously.</p>

<p>Of course, like you said, its hard enough to have a normal conversation with anyone nowadays without them pulling out their phone at the slightest pause in conversation. This ties in nicely with your point about people taking pride in hating other groups of people. We are already so divided, so disconnected, and so unfamiliar with normal human interaction that its becoming easier and easier to dehumanize larger and larger populations across the planet. Its a modern divide-and-conquer strategy playing out right before our eyes. And the medium through which this strategy is delivered....</p>

<p>Screens! The ubiquitous black mirror that has completely saturated our society in the last 20 years or so. You already know the consequences of screen time on cognition and perceived well-being, which is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the detrimental effects of overexposure to technology paired with underexposure to socializing behaviors. Point is, we use screens to do everything nowadays, from curing boredom to finding romantic partners, so it seems natural that we would use technology to cure depression. Or at least that&#39;s how the masses in todays society will see it. You are right on though, this is a dangerous line of thinking and I feel it has been implemented by design. If you are curious about aliens and their role in technology, I would recommend listening to Barbara Marciniak on youtube. She has a lot to say about how and why the technology we have today spies on us, I found it interesting.</p>

<p>I feel like I went on a rant there but thank you for writing this. I&#39;m glad to see someone asking the questions about where the depression is coming from environmentally and systemically. This is the type of critical thinking we need!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the past couple years I&#39;ve felt trapped in my own head, and I&#39;ve realized being in my own head is not a great place to be. I focus on the negative and those negative emotions get the best of me, and that&#39;s when I hop on reddit or Instagram. I cant stay in my own head for long so I use social media to escape.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not like being on social media is making me feel any better. It&#39;s still making me think negative thoughts but somehow it&#39;s better than being in my own head. </p>

<p>I just feel lost and hopeless. I&#39;m in debt due to college, I have no job, no license, and no social life. Even if I can fix one of those things, I know I won&#39;t be able to fix all of them so I feel like, what&#39;s the point? I&#39;ll never be able to 100% succeed at everything I need to do to have a &quot;normal life&quot;. I&#39;ll always consider myself a failure and I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore to get out of this slump </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are not alone. i am in a similar situation. the only advice i can give is make a list of goals you want in your life and start making progress on them. this has helped tremendously for me. most of the time when I&#39;m trapped by the negative, it&#39;s because i am reflecting on things that i <em>should</em> have done, but haven&#39;t. i am reflecting on time that i&#39;ve wasted. having a list keeps me on track so that when i start slipping into negative thought, i refer back to the list to see what i <em>must</em> spend my time on &amp; then i stop <em>thinking</em> and start <em>doing</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I really feel for you.</p>

<p>I want to say that most Americans are in a severe amount of debt. At least know youre not alone. They pushed a system on people that is mostly unattainable.</p>

<p>Have you heard of debt relief programs? Your credit score drops for a few years but it can help.</p>

<p>Growing up all my parents cared about was money. They went bankrupt. Even so it did not teach them that there is more to life to money and materialism. </p>

<p>Do not worry about the treasures here on Earth. This is not really &quot;advice&quot; and I am in  no way calling you materialistic. You sound like a great person.</p>

<p>It is so sad that we live in a nation where to make a living one must first get into so much debt.</p>

<p>But instead of people questioning it - they perpetuate. Now we have so many people with degrees working at Starbucks pretending to be happy.</p>

<p>You are not alone.</p>

<p>Next, what has really helped me is spirituality. God has been removed from everything, but to me, God is the only thing I truly have faith in.</p>

<p>Next, you can always talk to me. Your life is better and you do matter. The fact that you are even self-reflective makes you stand out beyond the many people I talk too.</p>

<p>I am here if you need anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. It depends on the individual and the situation. I would caution against giving them to people who&#39;s brains are still developing unless the situation is really severe. Also they should probably never be the only treatment. Therapy and community support can do wonders and should probably be tried before using psych meds. Not that i&#39;m a shining example of my own advice though lol. </p>

<p>Destroy what exactly?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is time to ask if dehumanisation is such a bad word. because, good or bad, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcpWk2WKhEM">it is so</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 5G is issue is the can of worms nobody is talking about. I personally can feel Wi-Fi every time it is turned on. The same is the case for others that I know. </p>

<p>People may doubt this is the case, but I can assure you, this is no nocebo. When Wi-Fi is turned on I can with absolute clarity feel a considerable heightening of anxiety in my body, like I was connected to a mild electric current. When it is turned off, that feeling passes. It doesn&#39;t prevent me from using Wi-Fi, as it&#39;s not that bad, but it is a clear nuisance and makes me feel tired if I have the Wi-Fi on my laptop turned on for longer periods of time. It is draining, but thankfully I don&#39;t need to be online all day, as opposed to some people that have jobs which require them to do so and be in a Wi-Fi &quot;infested&quot; environment.  But it is true that not all people are EMF sensitive in this manner, however I have no doubt these frequencies influence everyone, whether they feel it or not. Similiarly to Wi-Fi, I can also feel the 3G present on my phone, however it is much milder than the former.</p>

<p>As for 5G - I can only say that I&#39;m not looking forward to the day when it&#39;s the norm. I wonder what kind of negative effects it will have on people and their bodies and minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try volunteer work.  Service to others is the best way to counteract a lot of what you&#39;re describing: it gets you off the computer, helps you re-engage with your community, and reorients your thinking towards gratitude and positivity.  You&#39;ll feel better knowing you helped someone.  It&#39;s not going to fix everything overnight, but seriously, give it a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are not alone. i am in a similar situation. the only advice i can give is make a list of goals you want in your life and start making progress on them. this has helped tremendously for me. most of the time when I&#39;m trapped by the negative, it&#39;s because i am reflecting on things that i <em>should</em> have done, but haven&#39;t. i am reflecting on time that i&#39;ve wasted. having a list keeps me on track so that when i start slipping into negative thought, i refer back to the list to see what i <em>must</em> spend my time on &amp; then i stop <em>thinking</em> and start <em>doing</em>.</p>

<p>the journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step, and having a list of goals acts as a map for your journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I really feel for you.</p>

<p>I want to say that most Americans are in a severe amount of debt. At least know youre not alone. They pushed a system on people that is mostly unattainable.</p>

<p>Have you heard of debt relief programs? Your credit score drops for a few years but it can help.</p>

<p>Growing up all my parents cared about was money. They went bankrupt. Even so it did not teach them that there is more to life to money and materialism. </p>

<p>Do not worry about the treasures here on Earth. This is not really &quot;advice&quot; and I am in  no way calling you materialistic. You sound like a great person.</p>

<p>It is so sad that we live in a nation where to make a living one must first get into so much debt.</p>

<p>But instead of people questioning it - they perpetuate. Now we have so many people with degrees working at Starbucks pretending to be happy.</p>

<p>You are not alone.</p>

<p>Next, what has really helped me is spirituality. God has been removed from everything, but to me, God is the only thing I truly have faith in.</p>

<p>Next, you can always talk to me. Your life is better and you do matter. The fact that you are even self-reflective makes you stand out beyond the many people I talk too.</p>

<p>I am here if you need anything.</p>
