Will Trump &quot;drain the swamp?&quot; That would be impossible for one man, especially when the swamp is this deep and is resisting. Can Trump &quot;make America great again?&quot; Not likely, since globalist fortunes are based on the US going 3rd world. </p>

<p>The beauty of Trump&#39;s presidency is that he forced the Deep State to expose itself. The public can now plainly see that that the MSM really is propaganda. They now know, or at least strongly suspect, that both parties are on the same team and it isn&#39;t their&#39;s. They are realizing that globalism is really a euphemism for legalizing wealth transfers from the poor to the rich. </p>

<p>Ive learned that there is no in between with trump. You either really hate him or you’re blindly in love. How can useful discussion come from two extreme feelings of emotion? It’s not possible. Trump says “fake news” and his base screams at the MSM while his opposition backs them further. MSM says “Russia” and his base dismiss every piece of evidence calling it “fake news.” There will never be a common ground with this man. </p>

<p>A few dozen college Antifa kids can make it seem people are taking to the streets in protest. </p>

<p>The reality is things are not that bad. Families are going about their days as usual, people are going to their jobs and joking around the water cooler. People are attending their social clubs and playing their online games. It&#39;s not as bad as you think.</p>

<p>Media amplifies the narrative of a divide by focusing on the fringe. Most of us are fine. Relax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s much more than a narrative. Look at college campuses and the several issues they have with free speech on campus. Look at congress, completely inapt to find any compromising ability between the two parties. Watch your MSM content, notice how the same issue is being portrayed in two very different ways. Go into public schools and study the material they’re giving your children.  Sure, nobody is burning each other alive on the streets but to say we are not divided on very important issues is ignorant to say the least. </p>

<p>This is just not true.  There is a great deal of room for indifference towards the man but still not buying into the hysterical narrative that the left is pushing.  You just can&#39;t see it because you are on the Hate Trump Train and you assume anyone who hasn&#39;t joined you is a blind supporter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for Trump but yeah I’m on the “hate trump train.” My point is both sides are pushing their narratives and the majority of the masses are following both narratives blindly. If you think it’s only the left or only the right, that’s an ignorant assumption. Both play into it, we just can’t find any common ground to uncover some universal truths at this point</p>
