        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve become quite accustomed to this kinda thing around here. It fits a pattern of responsorial counter-conspiracies lobbed back at opponents once bad news and doubt are revealed. </p>

<p>While the CA story has been all over r/politics and similar subs, the response articles and theories have been all over r/the_donald, as if users of that sub are not allowed to call out CA and must instead focus on everyone else. Many of these have been crossposted here.</p>

<p>The deliberate misrepresentation of facts and false equivalencies are not surprising, par for the course for political bad news and basic team sports-- the bigger issue I have is these tactics aim to reduce the impact of the former (CA story) and highlight the impact of the latter (all the response theories)-- and in doing so, the general idea of the people opposing money-driven, unethical data uses for political purposes, regardless of candidate support, gets lost in the shuffle. This is likely deliberate as well, with a good chunk of response posts noting nothing illegal was done and this was simply modernized, effective online data harvesting and good marketing.</p>

<p>While I have nothing against attempts to shed light on operations like CTR and Shareblue, or note similarities with analogous operations used by other campaigns, CA is obviously the topic at issue right now and shouldn&#39;t be deflected. I&#39;m all for any attempt to take down these systems before they rear their heads again, but Jesus Christ the attempts to reduce the impact of CA&#39;s work around here are obvious. </p>

<p>The conversation is actually about Cambridge Analytica and what they did specifically. You are trying to obfuscate that conversation with your &quot;What about Obama and Hillary!?!&quot; comments.</p>

<p>They didn’t fail with Cruz and hen move on to Trump. They were working for both candidates at the same time.</p>

<p>In all likeliness they put forth an effort commiserate with what they were paid but the Trump campaign + Russian oligarchs + plus Mercer &amp; Bannon favoring Trump &gt; Cruz is why they did better work for Trump than Cruz.</p>

<p>If Cruz is offering $5 million to help him win but Trump &amp; friends are offering $50 million plus they’re in bed with the owner of the company then who do you think is going to get more help?? Obviously CA is going to be more helpful to the person paying more who’s also friends with the owner and VP of the company.</p>

<p>IMO Cruz got scammed. CA was always going to do the bare minimum necessary to justify earning whatever money he was paying with no earnest intention of getting him elected as long as Trump was in the race.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really true.  CA started working with Trump in June or July 2016.  Various sources claim different dates, but the earliest I&#39;ve seen is June.  July 20th was the end of the Republican Convention where Trump was officially declared nominee, but Trump clinched the nomination at the end of May when he surpassed the 1,237 delegates needed to win on the first ballot.  Cruz stayed in the race, hoping for a brokered convention.  So at most, they worked for Cruz and Trump for a month, when Cruz had already been mathematically eliminated but still decided to stay in the race.</p>

<p>Secondly, we can&#39;t really know the impact CA had without a counterfactual, that is, how well were Trump and Cruz doing without them. Trump was obviously doing fine, but that obviously doesn&#39;t prove anything relating to the effectiveness of data analytics in general since the Trump campaign had other digital operations not involving CA - Giles-Parscale, Thiel-Palantir, Flynn-VizSense, etc </p>

<p>Why are you pretending veritas &quot;did this&quot;?  Do you think everyone else but you is stupid?  When people tell lies do you equate to people who said something true because both involve speaking and words?</p>

<p>Using under coverage footage to bring truthful accurately presented information to the public is as different from using manipulatively edited under coverage footage to distort and misrepresent the truth as speaking truths is to lying.  It&#39;s insulting that you expect people are too stupid to distinguish between such obviously different activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What info did he change?  What was he saying or showing that was such a massive change in the narrative that it could absolutely be nothing but confirmed lie. That didn&#39;t just come out of the mouth of a competing journalist? I&#39;m seriously asking. DO you have FOIA&#39;s on PV&#39;s legal battles? I don&#39;t watch all his shit. From my perspective undercover footage is the same. The CA stuff looked cut up too. And as far as Ive seen Facebook is heavily involved and tied to both youtube, twitter, and CA. Why not be asking them more questions. Asking leading questions is hardly a distortion of reality though( in terms of his videos with Twitter and Youtube, and the girls obvious attempts to get them to use trump as an example, leaving that part out). Im not so sure about his other stuff though. which is why I was asking. We&#39;ll see what happens with Russia (  to confirm or deny CNN videos). Time will tell all. </p>

<p>I own my friends list. If I want to give an app permission to access my friends list that&#39;s my choice. These people knew they were downloading an app that was related to a political campaign and they gave express permission to access their friends list.</p>

<p>No, not even close. CA hired a third party to create an app that LIED to people and told them they were taking a personality survey for academic purposes and then transferred that data to a political consultant. </p>

<p>That&#39;s part of the TOS you agree to when signing up to Facebook. Still not close to the same thing as CA lying to every person who used their app. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude they still managed to “suck out the whole social graph” and mine everyone based off connections from people that logged into the campaign. I’m glad those 1 Million supporters got to provide consent for the rest of the entirety of US Facebook users to be mined by the obama campaign.</p>

<p>Explain to me how it’s ethical for the obama campaign to suck out the entire social graph based on the consent of just a million users?</p>

<p>The person doing it felt it was wrong and stated as such.</p>

<p>So is your argument that data mining is fine and you are just upset in this individual instance? If so, fine, I fervently disagree, but fine.</p>

<p>You really think they couldn’t have gotten Facebook trump supporters to log into the trump campaign website? It doesn’t take much to network crawl into millions of users.</p>

<p>270,000 in the CA instance led to profiles on 30-50 million users (range based on different reporting I’ve seen). T_D had in the realm of 300,000 subscribers at one point.</p>

<p>I ask this because then they’ll prosecute if they have evidence but in no way will this process stop if all you have to do is get 250,000 people to click “Yes” a couple times.</p>

<p>CA is definitely the shittier instance but Jesus let’s not pretend like it was all peaches when Obama’s campaign mined everyone.</p>

<p>I’m only trying to hammer the point home as I would like everyone to be on board ending data mining rather than turning this into a left vs right thing where people think it’s fine just because the initial thread that unraveled the whole sweater was pulled legally.</p>

<p>I agree it’s not the same thing, but ethically I really don’t think it’s that far off, especially given the campaign media director’s feelings and statements of FB’s tacit approval.</p>

<p>I imagine if the campaign in ‘12 was Romney, you might feel differently about its ethicality as well.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree. They both accessed data from friends lists, which if we&#39;re being honest is a fairly common practice for most apps. CA took it quite a few steps further by intentionally deceiving people into downloading an app that was supposed to be for academia but was ultimately meant to help Trump&#39;s campaign. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s the case then your beef is with Facebook, not the Obama campaign. The Obama campaign played by the book, even if you don&#39;t personally like the rules in that book, but CA didn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spoiler alert:  the CDC was created in the 50’s to eradicate malaria in the US.  We used DDT to do it with no long term negative effects.  We could do that to africa but we dont.  Why?  I used to work for <a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net">www.nothingbutnets.net</a>.  I’ve been to the Bill/Melinda gates foundation.  I’ve met Bills dad.  I wasnt allowed to address the DDT question when challenged by the public.  People that asked that question got a business card from someone in the PR dept who would then givem a BS non-answer.  You could have picked any of his other causes &amp; i wouldnt be as knowledgable.  But you decided to be a smartass &amp; i just fucked you up with my knowledge.  Did you know it is only the female anopheles mosquito that transmits malaria?  Educate yourself before someone exposes your IQ next time.</p>

<p>Looks like DDT is still used in South America and Africa, but the usage in countries where malaria is no longer prevalent (USA) has been banned do to the adverse health effects associated with ingesting it, as well as how long it can stay in the soil after being used.</p>

<p>Curious, what is the “non-bs answer from the PR department” on why we don’t use DDT anymore? Because it honestly seems like it’s do to the reported health effects that are outlined in the link I provided for a myriad of types of animals...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live with my grandmother who is in her 80’s.  She was born in the 30’s &amp; she grew up on a farm in the midwest.  Never traveled more than 20 miles away fromthat farm for the first 20 years of her life.  Her dad used DDT on their crops because it killed bugs which increased their crop yields.  Did i mention i still live with my grandmother?  The PR reason is that DDT is deadly &amp; will fuck your health up.  They wanted to carefully word it to all the SJW’s &amp; Scientists that lnow DDT is the best option &amp; they wont blanket africa with it to prevent pregnant women &amp; chidren from dying... why?  Because they view letting them die as the compassionate choice.  Malaria isnt deadly for a healthy adult.  It will just make you feel like you are dying.  After you get it the parasite never leaves your body.  George Clooney got it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, as a follow up question, did you read the link I posted? The adverse health effects tend to be that of animals. The membrane of birds eggs becomes soft and will kill the babies, rats and mice become sterile. In humans there is essentially a tingling feeling and then it is stored in your fatty tissue till you die. Once it did it’s job, they realized what it does to the environment and the ecosystem and said wait, hold up, looks like it did it’s job and now we have better pesticides anyways. </p>

<p>I like the conspiracy that they allow malaria to still exist since it’s seen as the better way for them to die, I actually do. But why do they still use DDT in parts of Africa and South America if that’s true? Why do TPTB let Gates go and provide mosquito nets and other vaccines? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So malaria is a death sentence if not treated. My family does missionary work through orgs like Doctors without Borders such as Helping Hands Missions. One of the doctors a few years ago got malaria on a trip and soon after died. When I went on a trip a few years ago one of the other volunteers forgot to take his malaria meds and instantly fell violently ill and almost died. </p>

<p>So then how is malaria not the death sentence while the medicine to prevent it is?</p>

<p>They didn’t fail with Cruz and hen move on to Trump. They were working for both candidates at the same time.</p>

<p>In all likeliness they put forth an effort commiserate with what they were paid but the Trump campaign + Russian oligarchs + plus Mercer &amp; Bannon favoring Trump &gt; Cruz is why they did better work for Trump than Cruz.</p>

<p>If Cruz is offering $5 million to help him win but Trump &amp; friends are offering $50 million plus they’re in bed with the owner of the company then who do you think is going to get more help?? Obviously CA is going to be more helpful to the person paying more who’s also friends with the owner and VP of the company.</p>

<p>Secondly, we can&#39;t really know the impact CA had without a counterfactual, that is, how well were Trump and Cruz doing without them. Trump was obviously doing fine, but that obviously doesn&#39;t prove anything relating to the effectiveness of data analytics in general since the Trump campaign had other digital operations not involving CA - Giles-Parscale, Thiel-Palantir, Flynn-VizSense, etc </p>

Never traveled more than 20 miles away fromthat farm for the first 20 years of her life.  Her dad used DDT on their crops because it killed bugs which increased their crop yields.  Did i mention i still live with my grandmother?  The PR reason is that DDT is deadly &amp; will fuck your health up.  They wanted to carefully word it to all the SJW’s &amp; Scientists that lnow DDT is the best option &amp; they wont blanket africa with it to prevent pregnant women &amp; chidren from dying... why?  Because they view letting them die as the compassionate choice.  Malaria isnt deadly for a healthy adult.  It will just make you feel like you are dying.  After you get it the parasite never leaves your body.  George Clooney got it.</p>
