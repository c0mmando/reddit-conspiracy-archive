    <div class="md"><p>Which is funny, because if you go to University and study History, you start to find out that most people in the field openly admit that many things are conjecture, or based on evidence that can only be taken so far. After you read enough academic papers you realize why every good Academic becomes a skeptic of sorts. There is Truth to be found, but even in Academia the Truth is fleeting, and must always be pursued.</p>

<p>Some things have more evidence than others. But even Primary sources ought to be heavily scrutinized. For instance, in Classical Studies there is a massive skepticism towards certain ancient authors, because we know how they were connected to others in power and why they would be biased, but they are the only accounts for certain eras. Sometimes the available evidence still only grants a shadow of the Truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>I apologize for getting lengthy with this part. I never was deeply religious. I just believed in a &#39;lord&#39; that was like a kind friend, somebody you could cry on their shoulder and get help/advice, etc. That&#39;s just what I picked up around the house because my family frequently talked to &quot;the lord&quot;. It&#39;s a sore point between my family and myself because I don&#39;t believe anymore. I do get riled up if my parents say something like &quot;Whether you believe it or not, HE looks after us.&quot; And of course I try my best to peacefully decline it. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t believe it.&quot; And change the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reductionist materialism</p>

<p>Even the fathers of our physics knew better:</p>

<p>Some of the greatest minds in physics have known that the Universe is not a purely mechanistic, materliast, reductionist phenomena. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”</p>

<p>&quot;Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of the Universe&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The total number of minds in the Universe is one&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Erwin Schrödinger</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1933, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Max Planck</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Birthed Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Werner Heisenberg</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1932, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- John Archibald Wheeler</p>

<p>Coined &quot;black hole&quot; to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in the 20th century, and coined the terms &quot;quantum foam&quot;, &quot;neutron moderator&quot;, &quot;wormhole&quot; and &quot;it from bit&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Metaphysical has been science’s designation for all weightless phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long suspected — like it or not — life is but a dream.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>Second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983, architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics 1921</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- James Maxwell </p>

<p>One of the most profound physicists of all time. Greatly advanced understanding of electromagnetic fields</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Paul Dirac</p>

<p>Enormously advanced quantum physics and quantum electrodynamics. Shared Nobel Prize with Shrodinger.</p>

<p>&quot;Other stories tell of Nicholas saving his people from famine, sparing the lives of those innocently accused, and much more. He did many kind and generous deeds in secret, expecting nothing in return. Within a century of his death he was celebrated as a saint. Today he is venerated in the East as wonder, or miracle worker and in the West as patron of a great variety of persons-children, mariners, bankers, pawn-brokers, scholars, orphans, laborers, travelers, merchants, judges, paupers, marriageable maidens, students, children, sailors, victims of judicial mistakes, captives, perfumers, even thieves and murderers!

    <div class="md"><p>Having seen how the school system handles people with low or even average IQs, I&#39;m quite certain they don&#39;t receive the kind of &quot;help&quot; high-IQ people receive.  It is amazing how many doors open in the school system if you pass the IQ screening test, regardless of other acheivements.</p>

<p>Guiding average people to take out student loans and watching them get nothing out of their degree is not really &quot;help&quot;, it&#39;s a rat race of people trying to get ahead.</p>

<p>Seriously, get a good score on placement exams in school, and life is fucking easy street.  I get sick of high-IQ people whining about this.</p>

<p>Source: I tested with a 140+ IQ when I was a young kid.  That had to be adjusted downward when I turned out to be a failure.  You do realize that once an IQ assessment is made, testers basically can&#39;t reduce your score by too much, because they have to maintain the integrity of the judgements?  I haven&#39;t even got into the actual methodology of the IQ test itself which is suspect, I&#39;m just referring to how people are regimented by the education system as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK thanks for your input. I was talking about more from a global-development perspective. Western faith in development and innovation have spread to every continent. The myth goes something like &quot;You can become anything! You just need education!&quot; and reality is that 99% of people can never be geniuses. Can never hold the next amazing patent. Can never really build tech to solve major problems.... meanwhile, the educational system is a process that constantly turns trees into paper, and turns kids into sedentary students. </p>

<p>It&#39;s total confabulation that the educational system drives progress in the world. For most, particularly the majority without high IQ, it&#39;s a false promise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if all of humanity were geniuses, not all of them would be successes.  Part of that is material limitations - not so much in the sense that commodities are scarce and that so many human beings must starve, but that there are so many directions brainpower and thinking can go within the material constraints we operate under, especially if commodities and money are to be distributed purely through competition and market forces.  There is no infinite fountain of wealth that the market or human intellect creates all on its own, and ideas are not tangible wealth.</p>

<p>There is a shit ton wrong with education, that&#39;s for sure, but the problem certainly isn&#39;t that high-IQ people are neglected on average.  It&#39;s more that everyone who isn&#39;t going to be a member of the professional class is treated like subhuman shit, and that schools exist explicitly to uphold the hierarchy and the current people in the top spots.  So I do see your point, in that everyone else is just expected to sink or swim; but my experience is that everyone outside of the college-bound is actually dumbed down deliberately, through deliberately faulty teaching methods and compulsory humiliations.  That is, explicitly, what our models of education were designed to do from the inception.  The expectation that everyone is supposed to get a college degree is just a cruel joke, not a serious expectation by anyone who knows anything about education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument isn&#39;t that there&#39;s &quot;one race&quot;, it&#39;s that race isn&#39;t an actual biological category the way race-theorists believe it is, and there is no such thing as a &quot;half-black&quot; person or any other variation of that sort.  It&#39;s blindingly obvious when considering race laws where one black ancestor makes someone black, but one white ancestor does not make someone white.</p>

<p>Wait, I&#39;m talking to a Nazitard, aren&#39;t I?  In any event, I&#39;m writing to the rest of the people who may be watching this, who aren&#39;t yet sucked into the pernicious race-science that keeps coming back.  (Despite the whining from &quot;race-realists&quot;, these misunderstandings of race and biology are both common and actively perpetuated by powerful people, and even the so-called progressives perpetuate them, either consciously or unknowingly.)</p>

<p>I&#39;d say, to this day, much popular knowledge about biology is chock full of lies and deceit, due to the eugenics movement (which is just a rehashing of old aristocratic and feudal notions about heredity and noble birth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My &quot;thesis&quot; that we are all one?</p>

<p>As I said elsewhere, but bears repeating here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Premise one</strong>:  All of existence is holographic.</p>

<p>(i.e. everything is everything.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMBt_yfGKpU">This has already been proven over and above by even the remedial science that exists in this civilization today.</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Premise two</strong>:  Humans are intelligent.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  Therefore, all of existence is intelligent.</p>

<p>The <em>level</em> and the type of intelligence that existence is and has is another thing altogether and varies, but God defined as &quot;The Volitional Creative Force Behind Everything&quot; absolutely exists, is in fact ubiquitous (i.e. everywhere), and is absolutely intelligent.  Zero doubt.</p>

<p>Again, the syllogism above and its logical soundness ultimately proves this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that&#39;s neat that you had the answer ready. </p>

<p>I heard of the &#39;holographic universe&#39; conspiracy theory before, but didn&#39;t look into it. </p>

<p>When I asked for sources, I also meant ancient texts from various civilizations... for example in eastern philosophy, &quot;life is one&quot; is not a strange concept... isn&#39;t it an actual buddhist teaching?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.</p>

<p>Yes.  The concept of &quot;life is one&quot; is a buddhist, and indeed eastern concept in general.  It grows even deeper in its roots through Hindu philosophy and the idea of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tat+tvam+asi&amp;amp;oq=tat+tvam+asi&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2319j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">tat tvam asi</a>.</p>

<p>Again, everything is one.  Everything is an intelligent spark radiating out from an initial core of Cosmic Intelligence that bore all things in existence.  The different manifestations of that original Cosmic Intelligence aren&#39;t <em>as</em> intelligent as the original progenitor - true - but each spark from the initial great fire shines with a light pointing to the One Source since it comes from It.  Many of those sparks don&#39;t know or understand that they are in fact nothing but small sparks from the Great Flame, but that is what everything is nonetheless.</p>

<p>We are all one.</p>
