       This is the first time I have been on here in a long time. This sub is now a write off to shills, mainly from the left, it's what originally turned me off this sub to begin with a while back when pizzagate gathered momentum. It was once nice conversing with like minded people. This will be my last contribution to this sub, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not reply to any troll messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the sincere people still on the front lines fighting the good fight: I applaud you. However I believe the majority here are now shills in an attempt to control the narrative. Which is now forever broken because this sub is too left field for most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bye chaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this, there has been one group controlling things for a long time, they went into panic mode when trump won, and certain topics became public knowledge, and have been desperately scrambling to gain control again but the illusion has broken for too many.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can weaponise these liberal useful idiots, but too many are aware to what is really occurring, at least to some degree that the official narrative is complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth will prevail.

       Edit: this post started getting momentum into double digits then was immediately downvoted to zero with a couple of minutes. Sure.

       There are a lot of us on the real Left here too man...we're not your enemies. Lots of us saw what HRC did to Bernie, saw the Wikileaks dumps, saw the Pgate evidence, and we're right there with you. The shills here aren't from the real Left, they're Corporatist Neocon/Neolib funded. "Centrists" from
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       sides here to crush anyone who things too far Left or Right.

       You need to browse the sub by /new, it's where the best convo can still be had, and ground zero in the fight against the shills. I've personally encountered Libertarians, Anarchists, Socialists, Communists, Social Dems, and more. You gotta stick around, realize we all, Left and Right, are under attack, and fight with us.

       I sincerely understand your plight, my best friend is a socialist (and a die hard one at that) which he also finds surreal, me being a right leaning libertarian (true libertarian, not the official "party") but it gives us an excellent insight and polemic into why we both think the way we do, and better understanding of one and other. I like to challenge my beliefs everyday to reinforce and reiterate why I am correct in my assertions. I come from a military home. My dad has a lot of friends. There is a reason I believe the way I do. But this sub I believe is too far gone mate. I apologise and I appreciate your absolute humility towards me, we're not enemies and the divide and conquer tactics will not prevail over the love I have for my fellow man.

       parties are the same. most us are socialist whether they no it or not. it's a grand illusion. left is pro handouts which means that those who work give to those who do not. that's theft an immoral. right believes in freedom and personal responsibility. good example would be taking loan from government puts you in jail if not paid however taking loan from private company will not if not paid. those with student loans should understand and know this.

       bad examples. those are authoritarian government and have nothing to do with right unless you are talking about how left and right have been warped and converged. remove that falsity and boil both down and the left still believes theft and coercion are moral. right does not think it is.

       Look into Libertarian Socialism and Anarcho-syndicalism. Decentralized states based on communal values are possible. We're not your enemies.

       Lol Libertarian Socialism wont descend into dictatorship- it is against the idea of the State lol. It literally calls for decentralization and Direct Democracy, but if you want to ignore that that's your prerogative my friend.

       It's not Tyranny of the mob...its DD at the local level, with local institutions voluntarily associating into larger Confederations and Federations, based on re-callable delegates and not Representatives. Total lack of government and rules, pure Libertarianism, still leads to "tyranny" if taken to its logical extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarian Socialism is based on the Municipal level, and Free associations with that level and moving up- no one is forcing you to associate with your local municipality.

       No, I'm not ignorant at all. I'm trying to explain an Anarchist POV w/ a socially focused end game. There can be no dictatorship if there is

       Oh I understand, but I think we both believe pretty solidly in our differing perspectives on things, even though our end goals of decentralization and elimination of Tyranny are the same. We're still allies in the fight against corruption and that's all that matters to me.

       that makes no sense. right wingers are not separate from the government. they are in and make up government same with left wingers. both are the same and have been for a long time. both push government status quo. you seem very ignorant of us system. why two parties? why two paradigms? why two teams? you are being tricked. why does it take outsiders to get us people to understand this!?

       You do have choice, representative government and voting. If you want to be a citizen you pay taxes for infrastructure like roads, protection from police/military, and on and on. And yes the disenfranchised pay less and in some cases get help, but that's because we choose to help because not to do so is immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if that means the most entitled rich folk and corporations pay more into the system then so be it - it is the cost of a stable growing economy which is what enables their wealth.

       Not sure what you are implying but no rich people did not tell me anything. The only thing the entitled rich have shown me is that they control the government through lobbyists and special interests so they can exert their will to pass laws that favor their investments.

       Feisty. I dig it. I actually do watch Fox news and I listen to conservative talk radio when I'm in the car. Just because something is on TV doesn't mean it's not true. Just because someone has a motive doesn't mean what they are saying isn't true. I think it's odd that people don't believe anything they see on TV, but a 4chan screen shot will do just fine.

       But this is what I know about you. If Mueller comes to the conclusion that there was no collusion. You will go straight to the obstruction charge. If Mueller says...no, there wasn't actually obstruction...you will go to the next talking point the mainstream media gives you to impeach Trump with.

       I'm actually looking forward to this all coming to a close. I just want to know what they got. If they don't have a case against Trump on collusion or obstruction, I'm not gonna whine about it. And I'm not gonna say they got it wrong either. So maybe you don't know as much about me as you think dude. I'm pretty reasonable. You just seem to hate my opinions.

       I believe in plenty of conspiracies dude. The whole 911 thing started on the left. Then Alex Jones sort of took over the conspiracy movement and brought in a ton of conservatives. Now people think you're not a real conspiracy theorist if you don't think Hillary murders children and sells their organs on the black market. Or that Satanists are running the whole world. But there's a place for left leaning people here. I enjoy talking to people that disagree with me. It shouldn't piss you off dude.

       How many times have I seen you give this answer now libtard? Almost word for word every single time.

       The whole 911 thing stated on the left...then on to the AJ line then on to the false equivalent Hillary and Satanist line..

       Too bad you never participate in any of the 9/11 discussions libtard...I'm sure ya got a shit ton to contribute.

       You always say "I believe in alot of conspiracies" and then you say "the whole 9/11 thing started on the left.

       But I've never seen you say...9/11 was a massive conspiracy because (insert the actual research and sincere opinion on why here)

       So cheese pizza means pedophilia. And there is a band that plays at the pizza place that made a Jered Fogel joke. And a pizza place near this pizza place has a symbol that looks like a different symbol. And John Podesta knew the Speaker of the House and Podesta received an email. And gays use handkerchiefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that a reasonable summary of the evidence?

       No, it really didn't. Pgate started from the Wikileaks email and was being discussed in r/politics, r/conspiracy, r/wayofthebern, dozens of smaller subs, 4chan, r/pizzagate, and TD. It was never a partisan issue- that's what the MSM wanted you to believe. As my links above show- the Reps are just as involved with this shit.

       Well then we must agree to disagree. I think this shit goes far deeper than any partisan BS people want to bring up- and I think it is the key to removing the corrupting rot that strangles the Social and Political wings of the Republic.

Any TMOR people that read this and actually care about knowing the truth, look up "James Alefantis instagram" on Google. This is part of what Pizzagate is. And it is very, very real.

       I first learned of pizza gate on r/Sandersforpresident. People started talking about it when the podesta emails came out. Whether it's true or not, pizza gate is not exclusively a right wing conspiracy theory. Either you honestly didn't know or you're being dishonest

       There is actual proof that Hastert was a pedophile who molested his students when he was a teacher. There were actual victims that accused him of this and he confessed to it.

       How long before the kids abuse by hastert came forward? If I'm not mistaken it was decades. And who's to say that victims haven't come forward yet? Could be an investigation going on right now that simply hasn't been reported. Or people could have come forward and been silence like so many before. That's not a very good argument in rebuttal of pizza gate

       Name one. Funny how no one called Hastert or King a pedophile before victims actually came forward and accused them, but when it comes to democrats you apparently don't even need a victim to accuse them of a pretty damn serious crime.

       You're the one making this bi partisan. Not to mention, i haven't accused anyone of anything. You're argument is weak, just because the victims haven't done an interview in 60 minutes doesn't mean the victims don't exist. Sometimes it takes decades for people to come forward. No to mention the harassment and intimidation a person would face when trying to expose powerful people. Don't be willfully obtuse

       So you'd be perfectly fine if a bunch of people publicly accused you of being a pedophile even if not a single person has ever accused you of molesting them? Is that what you're saying?

       Here's a brilliant idea! How about we wait until someone actually steps forward and accuses these people of molesting them before we publicly call them out for one of the worst crimes imaginable?

       I never accused anyone of anything bro. That's a stupid question. I disagreed with your logic that if you haven't heard of any victims accuse anyone then no crime has been committed. That is just a ridiculous proposition. A crime can be committed regardless of whether or not victims accuse someone and vice versa. So, why don't you ask another rhetorical question?

       No, if there's no victims and no evidence then you can't ACCUSE A SPECIFIC PERSON of a crime. You understand that pizzagate is a conspiracy ACCUSING specific democrats of being pedophiles, right? You understand these democrats have never once been accused of molesting children, right? So how do you justify people being accused of molesting children when no children have every accused them of anything?

       First off, I'm not anyone of anything, for the hundredth time. Pizza gate to me is simply an investigation. AFAIK, no one has brought charges against anyone in a court of law in regards to pizza gate. A lot of people are convinced that podesta is a child molester/abuser. Personally I think there isn't enough evidence to prove he or alefantis are actually involved in child trafficking. I do think the emails are very strange and there is definitely some strange code words being used but that's as far as I'm willing to say is true beyond a doubt. Again, I'm just arguing against you're shitty logic that a crime only exists if you have heard if a victim has come forward to accuse someone

       That's not even close to what I'm saying here. This was a discussion about pizzagate specifically, and pizzagate is 100% based on accusing actual people of hurting children even though not a single child has accused these people of hurting them. My point is you can't accuse a specific person of being a pedophile if no victim has accused that person of molesting them.

       That's not actually true. Cathy O'Brien for one has accused Hillary Clinton, among others, of raping her as a child many years back, did so in a published book (where she claims to have been a subject of a child-focused MK-Ultra government program, described in great detail) and has never been sued or anything. Not many people consider her very credible, mind, as her accusations go so far beyond consensus reality, but the assertion that none of these people involved have ever been accused of anything like this before is false.

       We also need to all work on taking this fight outside of the confines of internet forums. It's time to start talking to Friends and Family, and slowly showing them the reality, even though it is painful and may be rejected by some.

       To be fair there is a difference between pizzagate and the Franklin cover up.  Pizzagate commonly refers to Alefantis, Podesta, and Comet. Nobody on this sub is denying elite pedophelia in general. Nobody is denying pedogate. Pizzagate is a problematic term because of its specificity. If you start using the term pedogate you will get no argument from people here (I’m generalizing I know). 
You may disagree with my definition of Pizzagate, and that’s fine and fair, but hopefully you can see how it can be confusing to others who read posts with that term because of the history of the phrase.

       I believe in
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       Pedogate and Pizzagate. They are different but connected. Pgate is a specific incident which arose from the Wikileaks emails, Pedogate is the large issue itself. Franklin, Dutroux, Hastert, etc; just add to the evidence that this shit
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       happen, and it makes Pgate all that more believable. Pgate is definitely the "smaller" of the issues, but Pgate spiraled into Pedogate in its modern iteration. I think they are all connected.

       I understand you believe in both, that’s fine, but your defense of Pizzagate in the original post I replied is to bring up Franklin etc. I can totally believe that Pizzagate is partisan and false and still believe Franklin, Hastert, etc. are very real. You saying ‘well what about Franklin’ does nothing to prove Pizzagate, so what do you want them to say? Sure the respectable thing to do would be to say ‘I agree elite pedophelia exists in this country and government, and you have given me a good example I too believe in. However I still believe Pizzagate is false’, but I can see why they may just downvote you for changing the subject (tangentially) and move on (not good rediquette on their part tho).

       Wow you are not going to get away with strawmanning Pizzagate. There is ample evidence and a lot of serious connections between Comet Ping Pong Pizza and FBI-released child-love symbols. There is no conspiracy in Pizzagate, it is very real. Pedogate is the one that doesn't have anything concrete.

       Because you constantly bash the pizzagate theory, restricting your scope especially when such obvious evidence is everywhere that it is a feature of wealth and power, and not political affiliation, you miss out on so many clues.

       an influx of a couple hundred thousand newbies who have no history or context beyond election-post election (about a 3rd of the folks here subscribed) vs the 200k-300k crowd that has been here for a decade or so has surely seen a headache of .... perspective change in direction and narrow scope of events trending for sure.

       Putin sent me two women to fulfil my piss fetish. Interestingly enough the girlfriend is cool with having them around. Really pays to be on Putin's good side. When I shilled for Obama all I got was coffee dates with traps.

       I dunno, after the Democrats sabotage themselves in 2020 and Trump is re-elected, you'll be waiting until 2024 to "go back to normal". Except it won't, because if the astroturf is "successful" in the here-and-now, why wouldn't they still be doing it in 2024? They might change the flavor a bit, accusing a new popular politician of being a Russian spy for no real reason, but it won't stop.

       I can see where this is going, and ofc ur from TD. You people are what ruined, brigaded, and highly politicized this sub and you think the “left” are the ones shilling? Sorry the sub isnt 95% anti Hillary posts anymore, bc that was fun while it last for the last year and a half.

       Mate I agree the political side of things has got intense, but to deny politics has a huge part in conspiracies is naive. It just needs to have emotions removed a little more and a good shill control. Relax mate, I'm not your enemy.

       You are completely misunderstanding what I said, this sub was politicized, i.e. turned into a political battleground and haven for TD to spam anti-DNC, Hillary Clinton, Podesta, etc. stuff until there was quite literally nothing else on the front page. I’m assuming I don’t need to remind you of the times when 23/25 of the front page posts would be abt Hillary? Politically motivated brigading isn’t the point of a conspiracy sub, and I can only assume that you have some misguided notion that the left is taking over the sub now (despite the fact that the sub is still predominately conservative) bc the sub isn’t as disgustingly biased as it was only a short while ago.

       If you participate in the haven of propaganda, censorship, brainwashing, and brigading that is TD ofc you want “shill control,” or an excuse to silence everyone you disagree with.

       You have a complete misconception of who I am mate. I'm English, I live in the Shithole of England. I go to the Donald for the memes and uncensored news that typically gets no coverage in mainstream misledia. I am a right leaning libertarian. I believe globalism is subverting the west under the guise of socialism. This sub has come under fire to desperately control the narrative from both sides. I agree with you on a lot of things.

       Hmmm, pretty close to what he labelled you as.  Not a fan of labels but you pretty much described it for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can get a good takeaway from him calling you a TD monkey, not saying I agree, its that the complaints about the sub being ruined, I think fairly should be directed towards the massive Hillary posts over the last year.  She's out of office and the Clinton foundation is at best in deep hibernation, if not competley gone. Yet we saw massive, massive volume of posts of stuff related to her while completely ignoring Donald's in your face self serving actually documented conspiracies being shown in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
       He conspired to do stuff, did that stuff and then told us he did it.  Meanwhile most of this sub, for a better part of a year, seemed to have laser focus for the person that lost the election and most of her political power and things that have already been discussed ad nauseum.

       A lot of his business dealings beforehand, forcing people to sue to be paid.  If he didn't have the lawyers he did, I'd argue he would have been charged with fraud several times.  Ask how the people of scotland feel about his tactics in getting what he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The women claiming to be assaulted by him.  Don't believe them if you want but they are no more politically or financially motivated then all the people talking about pizzagate or Benghazi with just as much "evidence" and facts people can "do their research on".
      </p>
      <p>
       Lie after lie after lie.  Contradicts himself in his own sentences often.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion is that based on what he says publically, he has likely said treasonous statements many times behind closed doors.  I'd argue knowingly lying to the American public should be treason or fraud.  A crime against democracy.  Sounds dramatic sure but no more dramatic then your original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest point is that left leaning shills or not, no way you can agree that they are the dominant shill side.  Might be brigading but the Hillary posts about nonsense dominated for a year.  There was by far a right bias and when people started to notice, it started to die down.     People were politically motivated, not conspiracy motivated to post Hillary stuff.  A lot were not even conspiracies, just her possibly being involved in something shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think she is shit but this we all would have been better served to have a sub for anything with keywords trump or hillary auto posted to another new subreddit.  r/shillconspiracy or something like that for all your political propaganda jobs

       Not 100 percent sure this ain't a troll post.  I nearly left the sub because of flooding of nonsense Hillary posts.  Not saying it's skewed left or right but I had to defend, multiple times on other subs, this sub as everyone labelled it as right leaning Donald monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really I think it's multiple people trying to censor anybody possible hitting the nail.on the head with a legitimate conspiracy or questioning anyone in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left or right, whoever is in power or fighting for it are currently trying to silence any real discourse because then they have to actually defend their ideas rather then just label people as commies or white supremisists or whatever.  They don't want their ideas challenged.  They want you to agree or be fully demonized by labelling so your opinion is silenced socially

       Every time I post a thread or join a thread about Flat Earth, it is completely overrun by "skeptics" who downvote all pro-FE comments and then demand evidence after dismissing evidence already presented. I understand that people have a difference of opinion and I am not advocating to ban people who don't share certain viewpoints. All I'm saying is that it's a little odd that people would come to this sub and force their own definition of what constitutes an acceptable conspiracy theory. If we talk about theories that don't jive with all the skeptics, it makes more sense for the skeptics to debate us. Instead, they just attack you as uneducated and then refuse to address any points you've made while asserting that you're the one making baseless claims without evidence. They are definitely playing with language in order to seem like they espouse an undeniable position, but the whole point of being here is to discuss possible deception, so for them to come here and assert that there is no deception is very telling. It's one thing to say "yeah these governmental institutions are lying to us" and it's another thing to say "they are lying to us because they are hiding a flat earth." Most of these skeptics won't even admit to premise one and will vehemently attack you for suggesting the second premise.

       If you want to go live in the woods and hunt rabbits and drink river water than you could probably get by without paying taxes.

       You do have choice, representative government and voting. If you want to be a citizen you pay taxes for infrastructure like roads, protection from police/military, and on and on. And yes the disenfranchised pay less and in some cases get help, but that's because we choose to help because not to do so is immoral.

       So if that means the most entitled rich folk and corporations pay more into the system then so be it - it is the cost of a stable growing economy which is what enables their wealth.

       Maybe its different those bastions of freedom like Russia.

       that makes no sense. right wingers are not separate from the government. they are in and make up government same with left wingers. both are the same and have been for a long time. both push government status quo. you seem very ignorant of us system. why two parties? why two paradigms? why two teams? you are being tricked. why does it take outsiders to get us people to understand this!?

       I understand you believe in both, that’s fine, but your defense of Pizzagate in the original post I replied is to bring up Franklin etc. I can totally believe that Pizzagate is partisan and false and still believe Franklin, Hastert, etc. are very real. You saying ‘well what about Franklin’ does nothing to prove Pizzagate, so what do you want them to say? Sure the respectable thing to do would be to say ‘I agree elite pedophelia exists in this country and government, and you have given me a good example I too believe in. However I still believe Pizzagate is false’, but I can see why they may just downvote you for changing the subject (tangentially) and move on (not good rediquette on their part tho).

       First off, I'm not anyone of anything, for the hundredth time. Pizza gate to me is simply an investigation. AFAIK, no one has brought charges against anyone in a court of law in regards to pizza gate. A lot of people are convinced that podesta is a child molester/abuser. Personally I think there isn't enough evidence to prove he or alefantis are actually involved in child trafficking. I do think the emails are very strange and there is definitely some strange code words being used but that's as far as I'm willing to say is true beyond a doubt. Again, I'm just arguing against you're shitty logic that a crime only exists if you have heard if a victim has come forward to accuse someone

       That's not actually true. Cathy O'Brien for one has accused Hillary Clinton, among others, of raping her as a child many years back, did so in a published book (where she claims to have been a subject of a child-focused MK-Ultra government program, described in great detail) and has never been sued or anything. Not many people consider her very credible, mind, as her accusations go so far beyond consensus reality, but the assertion that none of these people involved have ever been accused of anything like this before is false.
