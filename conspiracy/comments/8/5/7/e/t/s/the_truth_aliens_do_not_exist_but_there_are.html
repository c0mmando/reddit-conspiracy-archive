       The fallen angels are the enemies of mankind. I think they can change their appearance so as to appear human in form, but they lack our human emotions. Their goal is to destroy everyone who will not worship their master who we call Lucifer, Satan, the Devil. They are limited in their power and authority here, because the Earth belongs to human beings (the children of God) who were given a free will by God, so if we walk in righteousness and purity, they have no power over our lives. So the more twisted and perverted the world gets, the more energy they have to feed off, and the more power they have to create havoc and destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is where things get interesting. The Scriptures (Genesis 6:4) seems to teach that these angelic spiritual beings mated with human women and produced an offspring known as the nephilim. These were giants who lived on the Earth long ago, but they started to corrupt the Earth because they also lacked human emotions and morality, they turned to cannabilism and sexual perversion that is unimaginable. So their minds were twisted and they turned against each other, and they all fell by the sword as a punishment for the angels who knew they were doing something evil by having children. When they died, because they were neither human nor angel, they became evil spirits, at least according to the Book of Enoch. And so these evil spirits wander the Earth looking for people who are plagued by darkness and hatred, and they begin to oppress these people, which eventually leads to possession if the person they are attacking falls too far into the darkness. After a person is possessed, they lose entire control of their bodies for periods of time, similar to blacking out on alcohol, similar to mental conditions like multiple personality disorder, and this is when they commit great acts of violence against humans, following orders to kill and destroy God's creation. Sometimes it's not possession, but when the person kills themselves afterwards, that is almost a sure sign that they didn't have control of their bodies, since human nature tries to survive at all costs. Suicide is also often caused by severe oppression by evil spirits, the words of hatred that are being spoken in their minds are coming from these spirits, and they are telling people to do evil things to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what their plans are when it comes to some kind of alien invasion, but if something does happen, then know 100% that these are not some nice extraterrestrial creatures from another planet, they are spiritual beings coming from the spirit world and into our physical world, and they are not coming to save humanity, but to further enslave us and to drain us of our light and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to stop them, then you have to harness the light within you by selflessly loving others.

       It's not up to or about medical science.

       It's about evolution on an individual and collective level.  Medicine and science follow
       <em>

       - not the other way around.  Biblical times took place during the thick of the

       This is only the case because you are ignorant of the data that exists.  That's not a fault of the truth of the dynamic.  It is simply a fault of, again, your own ignorance; your own lack of understanding.

       There are actually very little details and teachings about the fallen angels and evil spirits in the Bible, a lot of this was pieced together through the first chapters of the book of Enoch and also historical records of giants that existed, along with many tales and fables of superhuman men who were worshiped as gods in ancient history, and who appear to match their description.

       I feel you, I also don't like it when people claim to know the truth about something that they could possibly be wrong about. If I could go back I would erase that part because I am trying to be more open minded to receiving new information about what's happening.

       All that waits for you on your "death" is a chance to break out of the machine the archons are holding us in.  They will appear as angels/demons, or even members of your family, to coax you back into the machine where they feed on your life energy.  Break free and become part of the free universe.

       The satanic fear vibe farming is done by the Draco/ReptilianBloodline/Vrill team. They have installed themselves in power positions for centuries. The reasons the Monarchies inbred, the control if food like cattle, and possession via eye/brain bio/tech implant. Also religions and inception of the false light matrix for karma wheel mide wipe recycling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heavenly love vibe team is most rest of the universe, we understand it thru science fiction soft disclosure. Love vibes come from the "tree of life" source/roots, your higher ethereal self as trunk, and each avatar as a leaf. They have transdimentional travel, cloaking vs 3D, DNA healing and replicators invented long ago.

       Extreme high/low love/fear vibrations alter our 3D reality because they affect atoms like dark matter. Our religions were created to obfuscate the truth to reality... not hide another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contracts, Laws, Money, Eating Meat, Conformity are examples of Alien influence, being born with SIN means your DNA was midified/engineered to get satisfaction from stimuli that lowers your vibrational balance... too keep you limited and from challenging the social consensus/majority.

       Help me break free if you know how. I hate religion, but I love God. I am seeking the truth, but there is so much disinformation that has been poured into my mind since birth, it's hard to separate the truth from the lies, and there are so many lies, it almost feels like a hopeless endevour, but there is hope, I know it.

       What you call "angels" and "demons" are simply identities that have varying degrees of "service to others" or "service to self" leanings.

       We are the North Korea of the Interstellar community, and our consciousness liberation is near.

       to say aliens are fake but demons are real is ridiculous.   It goes against everything proven to be true the we know about the observable universe.  It's the kind of thing someone who has never set foot in seminary or any other higher education setting would say.

        that
       </em>
       - not the other way around.  Biblical times took place during the thick of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga">
        Treta Yuga

       - which is the Yuga we are said to have
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       entered only a few short years ago.  Humans are indeed said to have a lifespan of ~1,000 years during the apex of this age.  We just left the worst, darkest time -
