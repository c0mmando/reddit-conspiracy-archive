        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I realize it sounds very paranoid. It could also come across as me being narcissistic to the point that I think the FedGov has an interest in me.</p>

<p>Tonight, my fiance mentioned that while I slept last night, she noticed a work truck/cherry picker across the street. There was one guy in the bucket atop a pole which connects the cable line to my house. He was there from approximately 12AM-6AM. She was up all night because she works nights and had the night off.</p>

<p>Previous to this, I noticed something odd in my vehicle a few months back. There&#39;s a fuse panel in the passenger footwell. It had been knocked off and a piece of plastic had been broken from it. This particular piece opens up from the front end of the vehicle, so it would be an incredible feat for my fiance (my only passenger) to have knocked it out errantly with her foot.</p>

<p>It was odd at the time, but I thought I was being paranoid and didn&#39;t inspect it too closely, but the thought occurred to me that this would be a prime location to install a tracking device. I know the newer ones are relatively small and inconspicuous.</p>

<p>I also noticed that a number of times this past week, my cell phone had the battery drained far faster than normal, though this has not repeated today. I did not use it to any degree out of the ordinary. It occurs to me that the drain would be explained by transmission of voice data.</p>

<p>Why me? I post anti-government rhetoric as much as I possibly can in all kinds of places, but I&#39;m affiliated with no groups. I have few friends who I contact infrequently. My parents are dead and I have little relation with my family. I am unemployed. I am angry and disillusioned.</p>

<p>I am, in a profiler&#39;s eye, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_wolf_%28terrorism%29">lone wolf</a>.</p>

<p>So, how would I go about figuring out if I&#39;m right? I don&#39;t really have much of anything to hide, but I find the thought of being spied on creepy. It&#39;d be great to find a tracking device and have the FBI knock on my door and ask for it back.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">14</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/memefilter.html">memefilter</a> 2011-06-18</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Ah, okay - another chance for me repaint the target on my back.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="http://www.memefilter.info/index.php/analysis/3-a-brief-introduction-to-the-conspiracy">this</a>, and forgive my typos.  Amusingly, considering that post is not that old, I have learned a great deal more since, but the essence holds.</p>

<p>Whether or not your specific case is true, it has many hallmarks of the general pattern.  Cops and intelligence are the foot soldiers of persecuting civilians on behalf of the parasite class that profits from our labor.  Threaten that system <em>in any way</em> and the response is as regular as the playbook it comes from.  Recall that a hierarchy is a structure in which one <em>obeys orders</em>, so it should be no surprise that the same tactics are repeated at the lower levels.  The tactics are basically: surveillance (to gather a profile of your beliefs), intimidation (to exploit that profile to create fear), and retribution (to induce pain to induce compliance).</p>

<p>All you need to do is poke &#39;em hard enough once for you to get on the list, and then they roll out the playbook.  One cop can intimidate many people in a day, and if you&#39;re not used to it it may seem like suddenly you&#39;re the center of attention.  You aren&#39;t - they just want you to think you are.  Americans especially are heavily propagandized to believe that a single glance from a cop is proof that the entire apparatus of the state is paying attention to you.  They aren&#39;t.  They&#39;re mostly going to dinner parties and endless committee meetings.  But as a cost/benefit analysis it&#39;s cheap to park a squad car outside your house for an hour.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a> is also cheap.</p>

<p>In 2007 and to my surprise, I had the good fortune of being the host on ronpaulradio.com with the highest listener count.  I was already on the radar as an active libertarian, but goodness did they roll out the red carpet after that.  Just about every version of the carrot and stick have been employed - from &quot;friends&quot; offering bribes to LEOs making threats.  It&#39;s real, and it is equally as meaningless.</p>

<p>Why?  Because Bill Hicks told you the choice is between Fear and Love.  I&#39;m a buddhist - I&#39;m just not scared and frankly I don&#39;t think I even remember what it feels like any more.  But fear is the <em>only</em> tactic they have, whether fear for your life or family, fear of poverty or of ostracism, or of not being chosen by &quot;god&quot; at the alleged rapture... ad infinitum.  If you gain enough wisdom to choose love - loving the cop for (or despite) his pain-driven self image, loving the world with all its problems, loving your imperfect self - their tactics <em>immediately</em> become useless.  How do you threaten a person who isn&#39;t afraid of death?  How do you bribe a person who isn&#39;t afraid of being poor?  How do you <em>rule</em> a person who cannot be fooled and won&#39;t take orders?</p>

<p>So whereas such intimidation tactics are quite real and they <em>want</em> you to notice and be afraid, they only go as far as your internal conflicts and doubts.  My advice is to see it for what it is and keep doing what you think is right regardless of their irrational wishes for a &quot;perfect society&quot; in the form of a rehashing of the pharaohs of Egypt.</p>

<p>We vastly outnumber them, but are chained by our illusions.  Not too hard to figure out how to untie that knot.  YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, of course, a conspiracy and intended to remain secret, so only a few are really over the top.</p>

<p>The key guy who stabbed RPR in the back offered me a job in television in Hollywood, which was doubly funny as I had moved from the middle of Hollywood to NH to join the Free State Project only a few months before.  Once I got to NH a &quot;fan&quot; offered to finance an &quot;alternative building project&quot;, which had been something I discussed frequently.  More recently a mason fronting for an elderly German in Arizona asked me &quot;what would you do with 5 million dollars&quot; (answer - the same thing I am doing without it).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had many &quot;Ron Paul supporters&quot; directly allude to shooting me, including one actually getting a gun, but being stopped by another person.  Most interestingly about 30secs passed where the two stood face to face and negotiated some sort of settlement without uttering a single word out loud.  The one who defended me had no explanation for this, at least after s/he stopped denying that I must have somehow &quot;missed&quot; it.  I&#39;ve had an &quot;ex postal inspector&quot; randomly show up at my hotel room offering me a drink, only to come inside and tell me he hates me and everything I stand for.  He was very insistent about me &quot;checking out&quot; his laptop with a built in camera for any &quot;problems&quot;.  When he was asked to leave he called the cops and said I attacked him and got us kicked out of the hotel.  The cops bolt-cutter&#39;d the bike lock holding my bike to the roof of our car, and stole it.  An Arkansas state trooper was waiting at the state line, obviously for us, and proceeded to lie through his teeth to try to get me to give my SSN.  It was fun playing with him for a bit, pretending I couldn&#39;t remember or using the wrong number of digits, but eventually we had to get moving and the armed cop was getting very aggravated, so I told him and all of a sudden he was happy as a clam and let us roll 60secs later.</p>

<p>It goes on and on.  Those are just some of the most obvious examples.  I can tell they&#39;re mad at me for typing this now, even before I&#39;ve posted it - IRC PMs with &quot;what are you doing&quot;, &quot;hey can I talk to you&quot;, &quot;oh man you gotta watch this video&quot; - all from people I know but am not friends with.</p>

<p>Telepathy.  Discovered and hidden long ago, now machine enhanced, as a reward for serving the goals of the &quot;ancient kings&quot;.  So it goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may actually be spying on you.  After Gabby Giffords was shot, I was on Huffington Post and some asshole troll made some horrible comment about her so I offhandedly said &quot;IF Obama gets assassinated, I am going to burn down all the Republican&#39;s houses in my town&quot;.     </p>

<p>Apparently that is a huge national threat, or they know Obama is going to be assassinated, because a few days later I had 3 FBI agents at my door talking to me about internet threats.  They had pretty much poured through my entire facebook and I do say a lot of anti-authority/govt bullshit. </p>

<p>Keep in mind this also when the middle eastern countries were falling over facebook induced protests.  </p>

<p>I took my warning seriously.  I watch what I say.  I assume that my computer is probably being watched.   Flying may interesting.  My speech is not free. </p>

<p>A little info I am a stay at home mom and housewife in my mid-30&#39;s.  No history of any kind of illegal activities what so ever.  I have no history of violent behavior.  I have not history of pyromania or any other mental disorder.   I do have a Degree in Social Work, and I like to keep myself aware of politics and the major global news.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just mention it because if they were watching me like that, they could be watching anyone.  People think our Govt doesn&#39;t have a lot of money.  It has endless money for the &quot;War on Terror&quot; and spying on it&#39;s own citizens.   Really, who is more dangerous to our Govt right now?  Al Qaeda?

Some criteria are:</p>

<p>Passengers with a one-way reservation.[2]</p>

<p>Passengers who pay cash for their tickets.[3]</p>

<p>Passengers who book reservations the day of their flight.</p>

<p>Passengers who &quot;no show&quot; a single leg of their flight.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t claim to be an expert in surveillance but many of the things you&#39;ve said do just sound paranoid.  Why would they put a man in a cherry picker outside your home?  What would be the point.  Tracking devices need to be maintained.  Why would they put on in a hard to reach location of your car?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, how would I go about figuring out if I&#39;m right? I don&#39;t really have much of anything to hide, but I find the thought of being spied on creepy. It&#39;d be great to find a tracking device and have the FBI knock on my door and ask for it back.</p>

<p>That was a big reason I wasn&#39;t sure of it. There&#39;s nothing they could get from the pole that they couldn&#39;t get through a national security letter to Comcast. I can&#39;t think of why they&#39;d be up there. Still, 6 hours in the middle of the night is weird.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that they wouldn&#39;t, but stories in the media detailing people having tracking devices in their cars all have them outside the card.  I know in general tracking and surveillance equipment is not very fault tolerant though.</p>

<p>If they put it on the outside it could just use a battery and they could swap it when necessary.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the FBI can pick locks. As to fucking it up, it&#39;s not hard to find a power wire to splice into, especially if one has the information on what color wires manufacturers use for what.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would that matter? My car wouldn&#39;t move until I recharged the battery.</p>

<p>It also makes it infinitely easier to find. A set-it-and-forget-it type would be preferable for long-term surveillance against a soft target. More upfront work but no maintenance.</p>

But if you insist on removing all doubt; ditch your phone - at least take the sim card out of it, why does you&#39;re paranoid ass have one anyway?.

But you would have to be involved in some high level shit or just off your fucking rocker to go that far IMO.

    <div class="md"><p>Well....sorry if I came off harsh but, I think his level of paranoia could seriously be toned down a bit. Okay his questions can be valid but in how he presents them they sound like ramblings of somebody that needs to take a step back, preferably away from the computer, and access himself and the situation he believes himself to be in.</p>

<p>Why would one become so paranoid in the first place?
Personally I would like to know more. Preferably how he thinks that comments made on a forum led to a full blown investigation of him. Did he make direct threats? Does he have a history of this? No offense to the OP but...if you truly believe these things to be occurring why would run to your computer?</p>

<p>All of the things that you presented have perfectly reasonable explanations. </p>

<ul>
<li>Cherry picker could be power line work / transformer / cable what have you....most individuals that use those services are asleep at night, it makes sense to make repairs and upgrades at night so as to not interrupt their service when they are most likely to use them.</li>
<li>Fuse panel...plastic breaks easily I&#39;ve broken the little tabs on those before, maybe you didn&#39;t notice it before; or did it yourself while paranoid and didn&#39;t realize it. Besides I don&#39;t think anybody would go that far....doesn&#39;t exactly sound cheap, effective and covert.</li>
<li>Depending on the type of phone you have data usage apps running in the background that you don&#39;t notice can drain battery. If its an older phone....batteries wear out; I&#39;ve had a lot of cell phones give me a false indication of a full charge too. Cheap throw aways and expensive ones. </li>
</ul>

<p>Again sorry for being so condescending earlier, hope you don&#39;t think this post is as well. But its good to examine all angles before getting worked up over little things. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe everything that you read....not everybody is out to get you and more than likely nobody is. Chill out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I understand what you mean and this post was much nicer ;). I agree it can seem paranoid, but look around at the united states right now. There are so many bullshit things happening all the time,(many that luckily can now be spread via the internet) that nothing surprises me. To &quot;them&quot; people spreading the truth is seen as possible derailment of their plans-people knowing the truth is very dangerous. When too many people wake up to whats happening they will be very angry and ready to gain their true freedom back, thats where it becomes dangerous. They want to shut those people up ASAP, like that one person said, intimidation is very cheap and very effective. Make it look like youre spying on someone and it&#39;s just as good as actually doing it, especially if they aren&#39;t a big threat yet, but could become one later on. I understand the side you&#39;re arguing and just ask that you see this one too. I have no idea if he&#39;s actually being spied on or not, I just know it&#39;s not near as ridiculous as people act like. Saying &quot;WHAT DID YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG? NO? THEN WHY WORRY!&quot; is not relevant because the definition of &quot;wrong&quot; is very distorted in the eyes of the higher ups calling the shots. Spreading truth is what needs to happen regardless of what is put in front of you. The way this country was founded is not what it has become. The people &quot;in charge&quot; were supposed to be the voices of the masses, not of the few wealthy elites. We should be calling the shots, not vice versa and they know that with the internet that time is speeding up, they&#39;re protecting it the best way they know how. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree there is a lot going on right now that would make one worry. And wrong could be considered very distorted among certain circles. Take the MIAC report for example. But....I feel that eventually the American public will wake up and a majority of them have at least a little bit.
There is hope and change in truth alone, not empty promises.</p>

<p>Modern conveniences are nice. I take the battery out when having a conversation I wouldn&#39;t want recorded.</p>

<p>And invest in a jammer for cellular freq range and gps range. They are cheap - google it. Most of them are 12v and designed to fit into your cigarette lighter. But you would have to be involved in some high level shit or just off your fucking rocker to go that far IMO.</p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer to use something that could actually detect the presence of such a device.</p>

<p>Also if you have a vehicle that was made after 2002 I believe; you might want to &#39;change up whips to stay off the radar.&#39;</p>

<p>What the fuck does that mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m surprised that I went this far, this is my first time on this subreddit. Hopefully not my last and I hope to encounter intellectuals, not a bunch of paranoid fucks over analyzing shit and entering the early phases of Adult Schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I guess that psychology degree paid off for you.</p>

<p>&#39;I have few friends who I contact infrequently. My parents are dead and I have little relation with my family. I am unemployed. I am angry and disillusioned.&#39; - ......dude.....WTF?</p>

<p>An outsider looking in might interpret those factors as someone who has little to lose and a powder keg ready for a match. </p>

A quote from rapper 50 cent. I&#39;m referring to &#39;black boxes&#39; those of which can be accessed remotely. 
It has been proven by researchers that they can be hacked fairly effectively. If I was worried about someone tracking my every movement. I wouldn&#39;t drive a fairly new car.</p>

<p>Really? Why couldn&#39;t they just cut into a power cable in the vehicle and leave it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know that they wouldn&#39;t, but stories in the media detailing people having tracking devices in their cars all have them outside the card.  I know in general tracking and surveillance equipment is not very fault tolerant though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they didn&#39;t have to access it again, it would be best to put it somewhere that wiring wouldn&#39;t be conspicuous.</p>

<p>If they put it on the outside it could just use a battery and they could swap it when necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall in an article I read about that Muslim student who found his tracker that newer ones are far more compact. Cell phones are so tiny nowadays, I&#39;d imagine it could be as small as a pack of cigarettes or less. I also recall they simply wire it into the vehicle&#39;s power supply so it never needs to be touched again.</p>
