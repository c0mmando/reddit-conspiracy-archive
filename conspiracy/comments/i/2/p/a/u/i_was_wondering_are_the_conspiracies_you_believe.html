       Awesome post. Don't post here much myself but I would say, to put it simply, undeniable, point of fact proof is what it would take to disprove my current beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of what you've listed I feel I can't deny the truths, whether I like it or not, that speak to 9/11 and the history behind the Fed (and what follows that). I feel that I have invested enough time and research into those two issues in order to validate the truth as I've found it to be. I can't speak to your other examples, though I'm familiar with all of them. But I would say that I am personally at a point where disproving the aforementioned beliefs I have would be tantamount to proving the sky is green.  It could happen, science could prove this that and the other about light waves and human vision etc., but it'd take a helluva lot - a helluva lot - and I don't forsee it. There comes a time where the truth is the truth, and barring earth shaking new data, that's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said (and to your point) I hear what you're saying and I think this IS an awesome post because it is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       important that people research their so called "conspiratorial" beliefs seriously and with an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, I think we can all agree that taking things at face value is the issue, no?

      <p>
       As important as research I'd say you should also grasp the situation that many of these things cannot be properly researched. If you're a true skeptic like me you won't be convinced by some anonymous source or some unnamed government official leaking god only knows what. This is not enough for me, I keep this in my conspiracy hypothesis compartment of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very deep complex tapstry of different shades, it's never black and white. I just wish more people on here would remember that and stop taking things for face value just because they speak to them.

       But how do you deal with the complexity of the situation ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any event or claimed event has several facets and each facet is a field in itself. And every field has theory and general concepts but you gotta be real familiar with the field to know what really makes a difference and what is irrelevant or superficial. How do you deal with not knowing all the fields ?

       I love discussing about conspiracies just like most of you but my philosophy in life is to just be kind to your neighbours, explore people and events before dismissing them and avoid negative things. We only get this one life on loan from gaia, yaweh or the universe. So make the most of it, if that involves exposing the truth about governments then fucking do that like a champ!

       Hey Will_Eat_For_Food,
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking you and your question at face value:
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the JFK conspiracy theory says "there was a conspiracy, it wasn't Lee Harvey alone".
      </p>
      <p>
       That theory is supported by the 1976 House of Representatives' Select Committee, who concluded there was "probably" a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to falsify that, there would need to be some sort of decent level of proof that Lee Harvey did act alone. I think that's going to be hard to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we invent time-travel, and someone wants to go back and tail him for a week or two with a video camera, so we have all his actions and conversations etc, and if that basically indicates he was acting alone (and an amazing shot) then I'll believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the balance of evidence at the moment, I don't think he acted alone.
      </p>
     </div>

       The point is that history isn't science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good scientific theories (some of them) are falsifiable. [Though not all of them are].
      </p>
      <p>
       History
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       falsifiable in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's no evidence that I could show you that would persuade you that Queen Victoria was Jack the Ripper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, your belief that Queen Victoria wasn't Jack the Ripper is unfalsifiable.

       Well, start by examining your beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which conspiracies do you believe, and what would change your mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're making the common mistake of assuming that everyone here is an uncriticial 'conspiracy theorist', as opposed to you [and people like you] who critically weigh up all the facts before arriving at your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know anything about psychology, then you know it's extremely likely you don't weigh up the facts in that fashion -- the brain is not designed that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally, while you marvel at other people's 'conspiracy theories', it's likely you believe a few of them yourself -- except in your case of course you think of them as 'history'. Or 'current affairs'.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you keep dodging my question!
      </p>

       What would persuade you that Queen Victoria was Jack the Ripper?

       Not all conspiracies are created equal though, some require more assumptions to be accepted than others. Some conspiracies also clash with the knowledge and experience one already has.

       It could very well be that Queen Victoria was Jack the Ripper. It could be she had that weird fetish and a handful of trusty servants to help her out accomplish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't know enough about Queen Victoria or Jack the Ripper to draw a conclusion. However, if someone came up to me and proposed she was, I'd still refuse on the basis of the assumptions I'd have to accept at face value. For example, that no historical studying the 19th century has seen any indication of this and that no texts or stories were found to indicate this. Last, there would have to be a distinct change in her, I assume, well documented life that would explain the ceasing of her activities. That's some pretty hefty amount of assumptions.

       And there's your answer. What you call your 'knowledge and experience' can really be thought of your as 'world-view', through which you (inevitably) look at everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you arrive at a belief, most times is as a consequence of your world-view, not the end process of a deliberate chain of reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why some conspiracy theories seem so bizarre to you is because the believers have a different worldview to you. It is not that they are any more or less intelligent than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you believe we invaded Iraq because we genuinely believe they were a threat to the region, and refusing to cooperate with UN inspectors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your answer will depend on your worldview, and which particular set of facts you work from. You might think Bush and Blair were a pair of blood-thirsty scoundrels, the former intent on revenging 9/11 on
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       (even if Saddam had nothing to do with it), and there's lots of facts to support that view.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, you might point to Saddam's egregiousness (gassing the kurds), and the various pieces of evidence that he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       have WMD etc etc, and exonerate Bush and Blair -- arguing they made a genuine mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which narrative you believe depends (I would argue) on your worldview to begin with, rather than a careful weighing of the facts of the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone with the opposite view will tear their hair out at your irrationality :)

       In my previous post, I only listed the amount of objections that had to be cleared up before I accepted the Queen being Jack. Now, I guess it was an incomplete reply because I didn't actually state that my mind could be indeed changed. Example: some historians find letters written by the Queen herself. Carbon dating proves the age, writing analysis matches it to the Queen's style and handwriting and everything in the letter matches what we know happened in her life. In the letter she explains how and what she did while being Jack. These details reveal the very risky and secretive nature of her pursuit (which is why no historian found traces) and the stopping of these activities is explained when she ..falls in love with a secret lover or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, that would be an awesome explanation that I would accept if everything checks out such as I described. From that moment on, I would accept the Queen was indeed Jack and what a tale indeed !

       Yes, we agree, one's world-view is important and I don't believe conspiracy theorists  (from whichever point of view) are inherently more or less intelligent than another subset. Just more infuriating :P

       In the invasion of Iraq example, there are indeed several
       <em>
        interpretations
       </em>
       of what's going on. And, as you point out, one's world-view bends that interpretation into different directions. Nevertheless, depending on the disparity between world-views, some interpretations are more easily changeable
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       weighted facts of the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, a friend and I argued about acupuncture. From the onset, my world-view and his brought us to different conclusions on whether acupuncture works or not. We listened to some podcasts, read up some studies, from both sides and my friend changed his mind. Wonderful ! We both had a sensible (or similar?) background in biology and had had science courses.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I discuss acupuncture with people and some won't accept the studies because they're not done by acupuncturists. They also won't accept the burden of proof is on acupuncture to prove it works. They won't agree anecdote isn't evidence. They won't read up on biological concepts or agree on the importance of double-blind studies. They won't read up on why acupuncture being true,
       <em>
        as by the explanation qi
       </em>
       , would imply a whole lot about our understanding of reality. They want to know nothing about statistical significance. They don't seem to understand (or I can't seem to explain) Occam's razor where acupuncture working means a metric shit-ton of assumptions must be accepted. None of this ! I assume they rely on their hopes and anecdotes and emotional evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this second case, what am I to conclude ? Their world-view is such that
       <em>
        anecdote
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        appeal to emotion
       </em>
       is superior to all and any kind of science or logic ?

       Yes, sorry, the context was acupuncture having more healing power than a placebo; it was relating to the more outlandish claims. I read on the pain relief part, which is cool, it works for that. But I also read on the twirling toothpicks studies :)

       So I would prefer them using twirling toothpicks or non-penetrating needles to reduce risk of infection.

       2 edits later: You know, in a way, acupuncture doesn't really work even for mild placebo-solved pain. That is, the actions performed by the acupuncturist do create those results, but the extra claims associated with the same techniques as well as the counter-proof to the basic pillars of acupuncture means that it's not the
       <em>
        acupuncture
       </em>
       that works, but is instead using manipulation and inducing perceived healing; these two things are not the same. I don't know if I'm describing this properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acupuncture works for mild pain like
       <em>
        hitting someone in the face changes their minds because you transmit knowledge through your fist
       </em>
       : it really only works when the person's original thought is "I think this guy in front of me is unable to punch me in the face" and in such case, he has not changed his mind because of the transmission of knowledge. Gods, that's a clumsy analogy.

       Ah ! Excellent question !
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that many properly (control group, standardization, double-blind, large pool, etc) conducted studies showed that acupuncture was indeed better than placebo, beyond the error range. And let's say pain was more quantifiable that it is now also (as to reduce that error too).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I am totally fine with acupuncture being marketed as a mild-pain reducer. Not as a "we say it works on everything, look at these studies on pain", but as "we say it works on mild pain, look at these studies on mild pain". Also, "we'll start washing our hands and using gloves instead of touching our bare skin to your open wound created by the needle's entry point".

       I'd say some-to-most based on their previous works, current works and opinions and tangential thoughts on the matter ("the queen was jack the ripper .. because she was an alien"). Obviously, this happens under heavy influence by my world-view.

        What if you read a book which really convinced you that the queen was jack -- like right down to the last detail -- but 95% of the academic establishment thought it was tosh?

        And they could supply reasons why it was tosh?

       For every heavy reason it was tosh, I'd have to inspect the reason the way I inspected the original premise.

       Right, so let's assume the pain stuff is rock solid.

       If so, you believe an aspect of acupuncture is clinically proven.

       Like personally i think homeopathy is completely explained by the placebo effect. I don't, personally, see any flaws in that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       If tomorrow they clinically prove that homeopathy works way better than placebo for pain relief, then I'd feel I have to revise my views a bit. I certainly wouldn't go round trying to invoke Occam as to why all the
       <em>
        other

       bits of homeopathy don't work, when it's blatantly obvious that one does. :)

       Okay, Queen Vic theorist says: 5 graphologists attest that the Confession Diary was written by Queen Vic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enemies say: 10 different graphologists say it was clearly not Queen Vic writing.

       Now what? Are you going to study graphology? No. You're going to use your 'knowledge and experience' to weigh up whether you believe the theorist is credible or not.

       Indeed, it would be intriguing. Except all the rest of acupuncture's claims don't work (in our hypothesis where the pain component works, or does anything else work ?). The theoretical model of acupuncture is so deeply flawed only one component actually works. What other option is there but to use another model who has more success in explaining this very phenomenon ?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no model that explains it perfectly right now ? How about we study it with a model that seems to work for pretty much everything and try to understand it through it (i.e. the normal medical science). That, or get a new model.

       How about: all ghosts are rubbish. Yes, there is a video of a light specter that's under the shed that made some noise, beyond of what an optical illusion might do. Let's investigate how light can make noise.

       Absolutely. I love medical science. And I'm under the impression it's close to explaining (or has explained?) why pins = pain relief.

      <p>
       As i understand it, this is your position:
      </p>
      <p>
       You will believe anything that is clinically proven, so you are fine with the clinically proven bit of acupuncture.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rest of acupuncture, you don't believe it (because it's not clinically proven, and you understand that placebo effect accounts for it), and you find no reason to put any trust in the acupuncture theoretical model at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       For people who
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe the non-proven/placebo aspects of acupuncture, you try to explain to them that those areas of acupuncture are merely placebo, and you feel that these people's belief in these non-proven/placebo aspects shows that they are 'going against' science [in my wording], that they are using anecdote and emotion instead of rational understanding of scientific principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       (because scientific principle would show them there's no scientific support for 95% of acupuncture).

       "Behold the mighty scientific method, oh benighted ones! It shows the healing powers of acupuncture to be rubbish!"

      <p>
       when the mighty scientific method shows the pain-relieving power of acupuncture to be valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the difference between my position and yours is that I'm much more fascinated than you by the idea that a valid pain-relieving technique might have survived for 23 centuries (even though the 23 century old theory doesn't, unsurprisingly, map on to 21st century medicine).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't find homeopathy at all interesting, because it's relatively late and it's wrong and there's sod all evidence for it. And I'm sure acupuncture doesn't do much of what it's claimed for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ... from a bottom-up point of view, I like that there seems to be one valid data point.

       I guess you feel about acupuncture the way I feel about homeopathy/osteopathy etc etc :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as a fellow scientist (yup, I am) I think the argument I strongly object to is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Acupuncture can't work, because if it did it would require us to rewrite all our medical theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or:
      </p>
      <p>
       If acupuncture worked, we would have to rewrite medicine, therefore Occam tells us to prefer medicine and reject acupuncture.
      </p>
      <p>
       FINALLY I've identified my problem with that. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Acupuncture DOES work (a tiny bit) and it works IN SPITE of the theory -- as we know, sham acupuncture works for pain as well as 'real' acupuncture.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO it is a scientific mistake to throw everything out because of the top-level theory, when the bottom-level data shows that actually there IS a data-point. Eg the theory can be wrong, but that doesn't mean something doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wiki quotes Crick: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."
      </p>
      <p>
       SO. Continue the good fight against alternative rubbish. But you're not allowed to use the above argument, because i think it's wrong. Lol.

       I believe nothing that is reported other than sports scoreboards. I've learned to be skeptical of everything until what is asserted can either be proven, or the facts add up to a logical conclusion. So, the conspiracy is always the story based on facts or logic. Show me a failure in fact or logic and I change my mind. This happened for me with AGW where I went from being a believer to a skeptic based on better information. I also changed my mind on several other points of science that we need not go into here. By and large, yes, falsify my opinion and I will change my mind.

       I can think of one conspiracy theory that I used to believe that I have been convinced otherwise: 19 guys with box cutters took over four planes, crashed two of those planes into buildings and it was the burning jet fuel and paper that made those buildings, plus one next door, collapse.

       First, I'd like to see astronomers freak out as to how a biological byproduct of bacteria and several food preparation processes could exist in outer space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I'd like to see biologists &amp; xenobiologists freak out as to what that represents for life development.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also expect the following to freak out: physicists as to why that things isn't crumbling despite velocity + angular momentum. Then chemists as to why the cheese hasn't melted and isn't liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
       By freak out, I mean papers being churned in all the journals of all these fields monthly for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I'd like to see samples  brought back. Samples tested at labs across the world to determine what the composition is.
      </p>
      <p>
       After, I'd like to have NASA crash some satellited into it and see recording of cheese particulates spouting from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last, I'd be convinced if they sent living species that could feast on cheese in an anaerobic environment and grow and I could observe it myself from a telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, that's a good beginning.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Edit: Flat earth ? Man, the question is so large, I can't even fathom explanation for how it could be flat as there are so many inconsistencies with the reality I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be so many things that would need to be shown/proven.
Almost all of physics would have to be rewritten to explain for ships sinking in the distance. Then the density of a flat or near-flat surface would have to so damn great or gravity reexplained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the progression of sunlight is consistent with a round earth not a flat one so I'd need that explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if the Earth is flat, how much 'till we just dig and reach the other side ? By looking at mines dug and explored, it's kinda inconsistent with a "the earth is a disk" theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also need explanation as to why the Earth-disk doesn't have a hole created in it by comets or meteors or why it hasn't snapped recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'd need explanation for those echos we had been getting while pinging the center of what we thought was a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I would expect all papers in all fields to churn shit out like crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on how fucked up gravity would be, you'd have people spinning faster as they are further from the center of rotation of the disk, so that would have to be explained to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Van Allen radiation belt would make no sense and neither would north and south.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe see some satellite pictures.

       I wish anything nearly as comprehensive as what you describe had been done after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, the victims got a commission run by
       <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2008/2/5/new_book_alleges_9_11_commissioner">
        Philip Zelikow
       </a>
       , one that may of the
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/911-commission-members-doubt-official-story/">
        commission members themselves feel didn't get the full and accurate story
       </a>
       . Edit to fix link.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victims got Popular Mechanics to 'debunk' the conpiracy theories. That debunking had to be
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbY5_qtz83M">
        debunked
       </a>
       . I guess NIST was involved in the 'debunking' investigation, but
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/official/nist/index.html">
        weren't adequately funded
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the scientists.

       did the best he could with what the materials he had access to. He didn't have government budgets to fund his research. The crime scene was being cleaned up before his investigation got started. It would've been nice for samples of all the debris to be tested by multiple labs throughout the world.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b74naeawdCs">
        Richard Gage,
       </a>
       from Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth also does an admirable job of explaining his evidence, considering he also isn't funded by a government budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish the people we trusted had done half as much as you jokingly talk about doing for a moon made of cheese in regards to the real events of 9/11 that resulted in thousands of deaths, a decades long war with hundreds of thousands dead in Afghanistan and Iraq. The abuses of the patriot act. The growing police state and surveillance society. It all goes back to that day.

       Didn't collapse at freefall speed. Again, look for sources other than what you're normally used to - Conspiracy sites will always show you cherry picked sources.

       Time the collapse. At least 12 seconds - not freefall. Building 186M Tall

        2
       </sup>

       372 = 9.81 * t
       <sup>

      <p>
       372 / 9.81 = t
       <sup>

       37.92 = t

      </p>
      <p>
       sqrt 37.92 = 6.15
      </p>
      <p>
       Freefall for that speed would be the entire distance in 6.15 seconds. Please show me that as I would love to know how the laws of phsyics have been broken.

       You conveniently forgot to mention that NIST was forced in their final report to admit that WTC7 fell at freefall speed for 2.5 seconds. This is exactly what the OP was asking about. You refuse to consider or present evidence that doesn't support your preconceived notions.

       Edit: Note I have't commented my take on the 2.5 seconds of freefall. I've not agreed with it or disagreed with it.

      <p>
       And as for show you one theory, if you want me to intentional find a conspiracy theory that says that, then no. I can think of much more banal things to do, commenting on reddit being only slightly less. Several posters have mentioned it here and it's pretty common conspiracy folklore that WTC7 fell in 8 seconds (lol) and WTC1/2 fell faster than free fall. (and had bits of the facade fall faster than that, so faster than faster than freefall.

       None of those say anything about "faster" than freefall. I've seen them. They say "at" freefall. Even your "similar theory debunked" says
       <em>
        "The story... The towers fell at or near free fall speeds, a possible sign of controlled demolition."

       I would never even consider the possibility that buildings could fall faster than freefall speed. It's just stupid to consider. It's even stupider to ask while lying about such a theory even existing.

       Look for some different angles of the collapse rather than the ones the conspiracy community want you to see.

       I often say lack of proof is only that, lack of proof. But in this case, all this lack of proof does point to either incompetence, big incompetence or cover up (but not necessarily for the same reasons decried here).

       There is no doubt that we are still waiting for a feasible explanation about what happened that day. Why did the towers fall at freefall speed, and why did they both fall when both were designed to absorb two direct airliner strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even ignoring that, there is the unavoidable, damning, irrefutable fact that building seven imploded JUST LIKE the other two towers, out of nowhere (although many first responders recount hearing a countdown and were evacuated from the area).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of what actually happened remains unanswered, but to convince me that prevailing wisdom is wrong would simply be another explanation being presented with good evidence and which makes more sense.

       The evacuation was of people around the building. The reports are that first responders were pulled back, a countdown was started over walkie, and the building fell.

Fires continuing on unabated by sprinkler systems will burn, and burn, and burn, weakening support structures and trusses and eventually, when combined with structural damage will collapse.

       What do you mean "it's not two planes?" not sure what to make of that. I said the building was designed to withstand 2 airliners slightly smaller than what it was hit with, because of the standards during the time it was built I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can point me to another steel-reinforced building that has collapsed due to either fire or being struck by a plane I would be happy to look at it. You are the one who needs to produce evidence on this point, because I've never heard of it happening. I do, however, know of cases of both long-burning fires and airliner strikes on buildings, neither of which caused collapse.

       I can't find the video. I remember it was a Japanese guy. I'm now finding that most people are saying it was designed to absorb one 707 hit, including NIST who specifically claims to have checked for documents with New York Port Authority stating otherwise.

       That goes with what I remember too. Nevertheless, an impact with a fully laden jet at cruising speed isn't what the buildings were designed withstand. From memory it was a Plane trying to land at (is it JFK airport?) in heavy fog that got lost and impacted the towers at a much slower speed.

       Yeah, I feel that we are looking at controlled demolitions on all three towers, but at least there is some reason why the first two would fall -- the planes hitting them and the subsequent fires. I am far more concerned with tower 7 since there has so far been no explanation offered that even approaches feasibility.

       If it weren't for building 7, I would probably not believe the first two were controlled demos. Steel-reinforced structures don't just catch on fire and collapse.

       How about steel reinforced buildings that have significant structural damage, coupled with fires, and inability to quench them (Both from a Human efforts and automated fire defense systems) resulting in one of the main three truss's failing bringing the building down? It's a bit more in depth than catching fire and collapsing.

       That's not even mentioning the logistical issue of planting explosives, rigging, detonation, hiding the signs of a demolition etc.

       I'm assuming you've watched 7 collapse right? It's eery to watch as it creases on top and collapse right into it's footprint, just like a controlled demo. I'm not saying its impossible that it wasn't, it just looks exactly like one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this map here. Seriously take a step back and look at this thing objectively. There are at least 3 other buildings that should have been "damaged by debris" before building seven, way on the other edge of the plaza (it's a NIST map). 6 and 4 are RIGHT NEXT to 1 and 2 respectively. 3 is right in between both. Even 5 is closer than 7, and 7 has a building between it and 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up. Why was 7 damaged at all before the others, much damaged to the point of collapsing into it's own footprint.

       I also always wondered if planting enough explosives for a clean demolition wouldn't get the planting spotted at some point by someone before the day of.

       Example: "Pull It" - any video you see that's slightly conspiratorial will show the (short) clip and offer it without context.

       It doesn't matter, building 7 collapsed for no reason. This is still unexplained to rational people who have looked into it. All conspiracies aside it happened and so far there is no rational official explanation. You're welcome to live in your own little sphere of reality for as long as you want.

       There's been quite a lot of discussion on WTC7 structural aspects - according to everything I've seen there were three main trusses, the leftmost which buckled causing the initial collapse (Of the penthouse) and then the other two trusses couldn't handle the redistributed load.
      </p>

       The fire thing is quite visible - don't take no notice of the conspiracy picture of WTC7's north face that shows almost no damage. The reason why fire's spread so ravagely was the lack of water pressure after the other towers destruction hindered the fire supression systems.

       Me too, it's nice to talk with someone who isn't set in a viewpoint. Arguing with someone who you know aint gonna change their viewpoints is an excercise in futility. It's been nice debating with you though. Thanks.

       Yeah I saw the video. It's suspicious but not proof to me. In part because "pull it" can mean demolish, like it's been said, but it can also mean "pull the operation" or the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's the case it was "maintenance workers", I'm surprised it went without a hitch since there could have been so many things going wrong during explosive set up and after as well.

       There are so many holes, inconsistencies, lies, manipulations, distortions, etc etc in the official 9/11 fairy tale that we have reached a point where proving the conspiracy as false would be akin to proving Santa Claus's existence.

       You're suffering from cognitive dissonance. It isn't your fault, if you can't see it by now there is nothing that will help you to at this point. It isn't from a lack of intelligence so don't think that i am insulting you. Your mind will never allow you to see it, it has erected a defence mechanism that no amount of scientific fact, common sense or plain logic can overcome. It isn't a choice. All the best to you.

       The only cognotive dissonance I have is trying to comprehend some of these comments. Which exact example are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind is ruled by common sense, scientific fact and logic. I really think you're describing your own beliefs in conspiratorial topics pushed onto me for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're also suffering from delusions of grandeur. From a quick minute look at your comments it's obvious youre quite the typical truther who will sucker down any shite by the likes of david ray griffin. The dissonance is that how come somebody like me who isn't an idiot can disagree with your stories and beliefs. We can't both be right and I think if we go by common sense, one of the attributes you mentioned as desirable up there then all the people you believe in have been debunked, proven wrong countless times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't think that because you have your doomer buddies around to downvote me, that this implies i'm wrong. The truth is hard to accept here.

       How do you explain the huge discrepancy between believers and non-believers of the official 9/11 tale ? That is, if you feel the proof is so strong and obvious, how is it that the adoption rate is so low (it is low, isn't?) ?

       When you speak of 'changing my mind' it is as though i have a mere 'opinion' that is subject to change. When facts and scientific data have proven something beyond a shadow of a doubt as well as a whole other world of understanding behind false flag attacks, the military industrial complex, US imperialism, the central banking system,psychopathy of the elite and how all the dots connect together to reveal a blatantly obvious picture etc etc. the question of 'changing minds' doesn't even come into play. It is like asking someone to change their mind about water being wet. The huge discrepancy is quite easy to explain and not an unusual phenomenon. These two words should suffice: 'cognitive dissonance'. The conditioning machine is extremely powerful and only few are able to transcend it, and it isn't a choice. You either see it or you don't. If one's mind has not allowed them to see it by now, nothing will. The defence mechanism in place to preserve one's paradigm, value system and generally accepted understanding of the world once erected can be likened to someone trying to drill through a 5 foot thick titanium wall with a 2 inch drill bit. It isn't going to happen. The titanium wall in the mind is a physiological mechanism that overpowers any amount of logic or fact.

       You present it as if it's as simple &amp; plain as gravity acting upon an object on Earth, as if all the data was there to be analysed and there could only be 1 valid interpretation of it. But is it so ? What has been proven beyond the shadow of a doubt ?

       As a rational agent (which no human is), you could change your mind in light of new data. You could also accept that any interpretation of data is bounded by degrees of plausibility. An apple fell to the ground ? Maybe it's gravity. Maybe it's an invisible creature always pulling unattached objects to the ground. And, well, in all pedantism, that is 'water being wet' is a tautology.

       Unfortunately, this exact same thing could be used to describe any side of any coin in the 9/11 debate. And in each case, it's the equivalent of saying "you're just blind". And again, this brings the problem back to oversimplification. Saying stuff like "you either see it or you don't" is a fancy way of saying "the reason for your belief is very complex and I shall treat it as a black box". There is no inherent magical eye in the human mind that pops out of nowhere; everything is genetics and education. That block box where "events" go in and "interpretation" comes out is a product of genetics and education as well.

       Take that energy and venture down the rabbit hole. No need to take a philosophical 'quantum mechanics' approach to this. We don't need to entertain the possibility that the twin towers were just a mirage or a figment of our imagination either. In fact, common sense alone is enough to discredit the official tale. There are far too many holes which cannot be filled regardless of any new 'data'. This would involve the re-writing of the whole series of events into a different fiction. Not plausible. It really isn't that complicated, in fact they didn't even do a very good job with the cover-up. It's embarrassing if you must. I will say it again, if you have spent enough time doing the research and still can't see it, you never will.

       I truly think that anyone who is pre-disposed with the capacity to accept the deception of 9/11 and all it's psychological ramifications has done so by now. I believe there are very few left that haven't been exposed to the facts and maintain receptivity to seeing the light. It's been nearly 10 years, those with the thirst and passion to achieve awareness in this regard have embarked on the journey, and it is a journey, once you start connecting the dots, the natural progression is to continue to do so. The picture then begins to take form at an exponential rate. I appreciate the fact that you did not adopt an immature stance to this discussion and I truly hope you invest the time and have the volition to challenge your conditioned paradigm. For many, coming face to face with this foundation shattering reality has triggered many an existential crisis and episodes of depression, including myself. What to do once you know, also involves great inner conflict. I wish you well, there really is no point as you say to continue this discussion. Everything you need to know is literally at your fingertips.  What we don't know is killing people. The madness needs to stop. All the best my friend.

       It's hard to say. Simply because the theories do not come from thin air. They come from proof or strongly implied proof existing.

       Without access to more information, probably not falsifiable. Of course each situation is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it like a murder trial. There is evidence for(sometimes) and against. There is an argument that spins the evidence favouring each side. The defendant has a story which needs to be be debunked else it will be accepted as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I look at the murder trials that have been reversed in the past, and what evidence is needed to change a guilty man into a free one. Most of the time it never happens. On the few times it does, the evidence that tips it, is usually information discovered with new technology, or records declasified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think reassessing old evidence with new Tech is really an option in most of these conspiracy theories though, as they're swept under the rug. Destroyed or cleaned up not allowing any new investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also quite tired, so probably making no sense. Haha.

       The official story, is the official story. Conspiracy theories pop out when the story does not match the events. So in order for the theory to exist, you must already have evidence of some kind that proves guilt, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted the government has such a history of lying, it's hard now to believe anything they say straight up.

      <p>
       Well that depends on the individual. But I would argue that in order to believe something other than the story. Your beliefs must be open to new information. If you simply believe something blindly ignoring evidence (including new information that may disprove a theory), surely you would only believe the official story in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       So by their very nature, a conspiracy theorist is more likely to change their view based on the information they have at the time.

       Om 9/11, if there was a reasonable explanation for the molten steel, the high temperatures for over a month, and the collapses of the buildings, then I'd be open to the official story. But, there is no reasonable attempt to explain these thing, and there is a coverup. If there was a real open discussion, that would be a good first step; but, there is no effort to prove these things.

       If the government actually showed any actual sound evidence backing up what they claim. Unfortunately their supposed evidence is so shitty it leads people to other conclusions. Not to mention they have been caught lying non-stop. Eg. Hundreds of different camera angles at pentagon and they give us a couple frames that show nothing. Eg. They claim that the luagage, passengers, plane were all pretty much vaporized that hit wtc( by that I mean totally destroyed   No parts lugauge, black box destroyed, etc. But they just happen to find a random passport unscorched which is their proof of who did it.( later proved by BBC. That half of supposed hijackers were still alive.) they say osama did it but never charged him with any crime related to 911. But the cherry on the top is no one can explain why there was large amounts of molten metal in the rubble of wtc. There is ablosutely nothing in the planes or buildings to burn hot enough to actually produce 3000 degree + temps. It's like saying your BBQ melted from the burning propane. And about a million other pieces of evidence. You see conspiracy theories don't just pop up because people are paranoid or bored. They are fact based. Usually the central fact is the government lied and is covering it up. This is easy to prove by there actions. What isn't easy to prove and why there is so many theories is why and how. But don't put people down for trying to keep the goby honest.

       For conspiracy theorists, I highly doubt that they would be falsifiable because they usually choose to disregard every single FACT that doesn't support their "version" of how things went down, while at the same time, spouting mostly facts that are completely unbelievable or just downright crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time, I think their logic is simply wrong also.  You can tell that most of these people figure out the "story" first, and then develop their own pre-event factual scenario to justify their interpretation of what happened.

       To be fair, this is how most people reason to begin with. Go have a debate with [nearly] anyone about [nearly] anything, and deconstruct their argument for a minute or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think of conspiracy theorists as the counter to happy-go-lucky apologists who never think anything is wrong or serious. Sometimes they're right, but often times they're not. It's up to you to figure out which is the case.

       He does point out an important phenomenon though that happens in all aspects of life: being attracted towards a conclusion and then data mining your way back through facts. It was a big problem in "pre-science" and an important step in acquiring the truth (among other things), or an approximation of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no fear, if as humans get over conclusion-first, data-second we also have cognitive bias if we have cognitive bias and a metric ton of fallacies people in every corner of life have trouble dealing with (I'm talking about all human evaluation of the truth, not this subreddit in particular).
