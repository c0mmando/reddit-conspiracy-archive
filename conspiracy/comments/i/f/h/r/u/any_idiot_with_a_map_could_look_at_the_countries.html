       we had about 3.5 billion on this planet in 1948 since we added diesel fuel to our agriculture system we doubled in population to 7 billion in 50 years. This is why when we run out and we will, billions will die from it because we will not be able to produce enough food fast enough. That to me sounds like one of the biggest problems will be facing in the near future.

       The shit will hit the fan way earlier, when Saudi Arabia stops accepting the US Dollar in exchange for oil. This will signal to the rest of the world that the dollar has lost its value. China will demand payment on the huge debt we owe them but borrowing anymore by issuing bonds will be impossible since US treasuries will be downgraded.

       its in Saudis interest to keep the dollar going.  Saudi  along with the other OPEC nations are the #3 largest holders of US Treasury Bonds (

       which oil fields?  for example if the desert of Saudi becomes one big solar plant that electricity can not travel that far.  electricity can only (economically speaking) travel a few hundred miles at the most.  we can send it longer but that will make it more and more uneconomical.  IMHO the way solar is gonna work in USA is most homes in suburbia will have to have solar installed.

       You can, technically, create gasoline
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       electricity.  It's all just a chemical reaction that requires an energy input.  You'll lose some energy in the process, but since solar is "free" it'll be cost effective in the long run.

       yes you are correct.  the only issue i was bringing up was when transporting electricity we can only transport it so far - while being cost effective.  the real solution will have to be for most homes to have their own solar systems on the roofs.  petrol production is stuck at the 85 million barrel per day mark for the past 5 years.  so it does not seem as if we can pump more oil.  eventually (within the next decade) most cars will have to be hybrid vehicles so they will be fueled with electricity.  since we can not pump more petrol and the demand is going up (because of Brazil, India, China and Africa) the price of each gallon is gonna go north.

       Kadhaffi wanted to take Africa and the OPEC nations onto a gold-standard currency, namely- gold.  Issued by Libya which has ~ 150 tons of the stuff.  Oil could then only be traded by buying the Libyan currency.  Something the Globalists and Banksters could not abide.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the US and NATO are in Libya, fighting to back up the CIA-inspired rebellion.

       Seems I remember hearing that that old Saddam was about to switch Iraqi oil onto the Euro right before he was invaded, as well as muslim-style (no compound interest) banking taking root in Tunisia right before all the troubles.

       We are being raped and stolen from daily.  Most of the foreclosures that have happened (well, about 6.5 million, anyway) were
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       because the Banksters took an all-paper system and digitized it.  So the process of foreclosure on those homes was not in accordance with standing, established law.  But the congress grandfathered the law making it legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       My house was one of them.  As to what would happen, I do not know.  All I know now is that I have been robbed.  And I am prepared to fight.

       They don't have private central banks, and thus are not part of the NWO; their economies cannot be looted by the banksters who have looted ours. Well the banksters need more loot now, the NWO nations are about tapped; and therein lies WWIII. The low hanging fruit of Africa won't hold that pack of hyenas for long.

       makes sense to me, except I feel like were already in WWIII and just in denial about it until were openly attacked. I will be really annoyed at any kind of 'we didn't do anything to deserve this' attitude from the gov, media, and the people who can't think for themselves

       US fighting on 5 fronts on 2 continents, NATO fighting on 3 fronts on 3 continents does technically amount to a world war. But most people have been conditioned not to believe it until the major powers come directly to blows, and the mushroom clouds begin to sprout. Too late to prepare by then though.

       wow, this past friday me and my mom were sitting and talking about some military stuff and a guy sitting next to us joined in and mentioned that he was former military too and some are organizing here in central california. my mom told me that people have talked about doing this for years tho but she didn't know that it was already organized, I don't know any details about it yet but I'm just as spooked. from what I can tell from the things I've seen, it seems like this month were going to start seeing collapse, definitely when aug 2 hits and the US defaults. that is no joke about an apocalyptic event that I don't even know how to describe other then picture the dollar being useless as money to buy and sell things world wide

       The collapse has already started, we're just to close to see it (Jared Diamond) Basic research projects are being cut, civic projects are failing and being ignored, national treasuries are being raped while the aqueducts tumble into ruin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The process can be accelerated, slowed, halted, or reversed. The main consideration is our collective will. Here, I fear, is where we will fail.

       yes were in the process of collapse but this is like the phase where everyone is asleep to it while there is still time to prepare, what I'm talking about is where we go into the next phase where it's to late to prepare and something triggers everyone to wake up, snap out of the denial and realize how bad it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       you'll have people like in Alabama and in Joplin MO where people came together and helped each other or there will be places, most likely major cities where people act worse then in New Orleans and start shooting and looting. that will be "the tipping point" where we go into that phase and I think it could happen as soon as a few months to this week. where one thing will put us in the next phase, all we can do is prepare and watch for the next phase to start

       Except, there is no real fighting going on. There are very minor police actions. The actual wars last a few days at best. They they turn into hostile military occupations. So, no, we are not in WW3. When we are, you will know it. There will be actual, wisespread battles going on, not a few bombs dropped on the houses of civilians.

       Well I'm hardly going to claim that would be impossible, but surely it is markedly more difficult to sneak about these days then it was back when the u-boats were doing it.  Technology has come quite a long way since then-- should we be worried carrier groups will suddenly appear at Pearl Harbor again?

       I know about how the navy find submarines today using an E-2C hawkeye. I can tell you it wouldn't stop a sub from trying or a few carrier groups from trying either the US pacific fleet is pretty big and it's how that guy is right about the US surrounding the world, it just can't be everywhere at the same time

       major cities could be targets but other then the entertainment industry I don't know whats worth blowing up in hollywood, there is a nuke plant further down the coast that would do a lot of damage to the whole area. why anyone would put it there on the coast next to a fault line is beyond logical. do your own reaserch, get to know your local area and learn the history about it

       i have no fucking clue, he looked it up on the internet then told us. i've been thinking about this all day now, I mean, turkey there could be an argument, as in the past they expressed interest in joining the EU, even though I'm pretty sure there is a relatively strong argument that they are not in fact part of europe.

       I think you're over simplifying the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       While, I think, Iran will provide a very opportunistic next country to invade, as far as propaganda is concerned, I think it's more important to look at the areas around the countries we've been invading and ponder what they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Southeast Asia has a dickfuck of untapped oil. Afghanistan has a dickfuck of raw ore (iron, silver and gold, among others), Iraq is a good place to sit and watch Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and make sure they're behaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran, I think, is being vilified by most media and would be an even better forward operating base and observation point to keep watch on much larger petroleum producers and other places where there are resources that the U.S. simply can't or won't produce for itself.

       I don't mean to simplify. I just know that when you surround the borders of a country by occupying every country around it. I'm pretty sure I'd call that strategic advantage.

       Here is a list of countries that border Iran: Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Armenia and Pakistan. If you include naval borders you could include: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya (not even close to Iran). I'll even grant you Pakistan.
      </p>

       This isn't to say that Iran won't become a target in the future (though I think it would be stupid to do so), but your argument is horrendously simplistic.

       We most certainly will be in Saudi Arabia if we arn't running black ops there already.
However. That is 3 countries we are trying to control just around Iran. Those three (Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.) Share the largest sections of Iran's border. 
Libya, Yemen and Somalia are different cases of course. 
But, if you don't think that we are in these countries to gain a strategic advantage to eventually take over Iran, than what is the point?

       Which is why iran would be stupid to not be developing nuclear weapons. Of course they've been developing the things since long before the war on terror. But before that there was the Iran Iraq war and the soviets in Afghanistan at the same time.

       makes sense to me, except I feel like were already in WWIII and just in denial about it until were openly attacked. I will be really annoyed at any kind of 'we didn't do anything to deserve this' attitude from the gov, media, and the people who can't think for themselves
