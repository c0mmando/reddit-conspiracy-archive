       if an institution wanted to secretly archive your unique facial pattern tagged to your IP adress, this would be a pretty sneaky and successful way of doing it.

       Interesting theory. There are a few points worth mentioning:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) When you agree to terms and conditions, you are giving out your IP address to Atama. Also, ATAMA is not responsible for the content; but they will give your info to the advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Let's assume that a government agency wants to make a database containing volumetric information of people faces. It's hard to collect such data autonomously without the consent of the person. And the problem of analyzing data soon becomes exponential. So, what to do? It would indeed be a great idea to open a website, where users upload their photos and then analyze their faces themselves. Problem solved.

       Couldnta said it better myself. Too bad this thread won't be seen by more than a few pairs of eyes. 
Also, what better idea then to make the venue of collecting this information play on the vanity and insecurities of people?

       True.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the name itself - 'anaface' - just calls for a pun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somebody in a meeting probably called out: "Hey, let's call it assface!" "No." "Ok, how about analface, or wait... I got it! Anaface!" "Yey!"
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that the very name may give birth to insecurity about one's appearance. It very well may be a form of

       Yes -- whenever I hear that term I'm reminded of
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       's Ministry of Peace and Ministry of Truth. Logically it has the sufficient explanation of analyze + face, but it definitely pulls  an analface connection when you read it. 
The scoring system is great. Compare with your friends! Feel a pang of triumph when that girl who stole your bf scored lower than you! Share on Facebook!
Also, this is worth looking at :

       Both events took place in 2009: Coke event in December, and Anaface was released in May.  It may be that synchronicity explains both these events separated by months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, maybe the Coke event was the forerunner, achieving several immediate goals. For example: testing whether or not the public will accept FRS (facial recognition system); a test of the popularity of the FRS; and a field-run of the FRS.

       This technology is relatively knew, or at least, relatively new to the public, so it could be assumed that this is just two different companies taking advantage of it independently....but it's possible.
       <br/>
       This all definitely coincides with institutional fear and sensationalism of "cyber-terrorism" so it could be possible to justify/rationalize archiving facial patterns with corresponding IP addresses.

       I agree. It's a worthwhile theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are two other possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anaface is complimentary. Here, the driver license comes into play.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make the data analysis easier computationally, the person's face should be neutral (no smiles). Some states have adopted a
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-05-25-licenses_N.htm">
        no-smile DMV photo rule
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-10-13-fbi-dmv-facial-recognition_N.htm">
        FBI has been officially using FRS
       </a>
       on millions of drivers. All photos were analyzed, no exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collecting IP address will narrow down where the person is to a more-or-less precise location (even if the info on that person wasn't given by him/her).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If Anaface has a commercial connection to Facebook, then the advertisers would practically know everything about their targeted demographic. Say, a woman (Miss A.) scores 7/10, her face is too wide, she's not ideal. And the advertiser knows it, then the women used in beauty products advertisements that are targeted on Miss A. will contain a woman with a narrower face.

       Yes, all tied together it's a pretty dangerous thing. IP address, personality profile from Facebook, facial signature, and driver's license (tied with most official records).
       <br/>
       Basically, if these can me mobilized together in an efficient way, anonymity on the internet is gonzo.
       <br/>
       and even if the public knows about it, it's okay. Because mainstream media has done well in educating us on the dangers of the internet we need to be protected from.

       Everything can be used for multiple purposes. But we're on a path of us being controlled by technology, instead of us controlling it. Horrific prospect.

       I think one of my biggest fears is being directly controlled.

       I'm not sure if I believe in hypnotism, but the thought of even subjecting myself to it makes me cringe and shiver.

       This reminds me of something I saw in Tokyo.  I went inside the TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) building and there was a little museum there.  One floor had these "games" you could play ~ you put your finger on a fingerprint reader, and then it takes your picture, and does some cool effect with your face.  I was just watching people play the game and was really creeped out.  I definitely did not participate.

       not exactly pleasant to hear about...like our privacy isn't violated enough in airports. But it should be expected -- if this technology is legitimate it makes sense it'd show up in airports

       that's really strange. do ya think TEPCO was using the information? or maybe these "games" were randomly strewn around?

       It just seemed...way too obvious.  Why should I need to scan my fingerprint to play any "games"?  Especially if all the game does is take my picture?  I don't know how or why they might use the information, but my fingerprint is not something I give out freely.
