    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory. There are a few points worth mentioning:</p>

<p>1) When you agree to terms and conditions, you are giving out your IP address to Atama. Also, ATAMA is not responsible for the content; but they will give your info to the advertisers.</p>

<p>2) Let&#39;s assume that a government agency wants to make a database containing volumetric information of people faces. It&#39;s hard to collect such data autonomously without the consent of the person. And the problem of analyzing data soon becomes exponential. So, what to do? It would indeed be a great idea to open a website, where users upload their photos and then analyze their faces themselves. Problem solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. </p>

<p>And the name itself - &#39;anaface&#39; - just calls for a pun. </p>

<p>Somebody in a meeting probably called out: &quot;Hey, let&#39;s call it assface!&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Ok, how about analface, or wait... I got it! Anaface!&quot; &quot;Yey!&quot;</p>

<p>My point is that the very name may give birth to insecurity about one&#39;s appearance. It very well may be a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak">doublespeak.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes -- whenever I hear that term I&#39;m reminded of <em>1984</em> &#39;s Ministry of Peace and Ministry of Truth. Logically it has the sufficient explanation of analyze + face, but it definitely pulls  an analface connection when you read it. 
The scoring system is great. Compare with your friends! Feel a pang of triumph when that girl who stole your bf scored lower than you! Share on Facebook!
Also, this is worth looking at : <a href="http://www.atamagroup.com/industries/">http://www.atamagroup.com/industries/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Both events took place in 2009: Coke event in December, and Anaface was released in May.  It may be that synchronicity explains both these events separated by months.</p>

<p>Or, maybe the Coke event was the forerunner, achieving several immediate goals. For example: testing whether or not the public will accept FRS (facial recognition system); a test of the popularity of the FRS; and a field-run of the FRS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s a worthwhile theory.</p>

<p>Here are two other possibilities: </p>

<p>Anaface is complimentary. Here, the driver license comes into play. </p>

<p>To make the data analysis easier computationally, the person&#39;s face should be neutral (no smiles). Some states have adopted a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-05-25-licenses_N.htm">no-smile DMV photo rule</a>. </p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-10-13-fbi-dmv-facial-recognition_N.htm">FBI has been officially using FRS</a> on millions of drivers. All photos were analyzed, no exceptions. </p>

<p>Collecting IP address will narrow down where the person is to a more-or-less precise location (even if the info on that person wasn&#39;t given by him/her).</p>

<hr/>

<p>If Anaface has a commercial connection to Facebook, then the advertisers would practically know everything about their targeted demographic. Say, a woman (Miss A.) scores 7/10, her face is too wide, she&#39;s not ideal. And the advertiser knows it, then the women used in beauty products advertisements that are targeted on Miss A. will contain a woman with a narrower face.</p>

Yes, all tied together it&#39;s a pretty dangerous thing. IP address, personality profile from Facebook, facial signature, and driver&#39;s license (tied with most official records).<br/>
Basically, if these can me mobilized together in an efficient way, anonymity on the internet is gonzo.<br/>
and even if the public knows about it, it&#39;s okay. Because mainstream media has done well in educating us on the dangers of the internet we need to be protected from. </p>
