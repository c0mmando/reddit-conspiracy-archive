<p>Your idea of &quot;evidence&quot; and mine are radically different. So far, all I have seen from you is that you have made a number of statements that have not been verified or substantiated by any other supporting data. </p>

<p>Link me to some quoted emails that support your assertions (or really link to any supporting information at all) and give me something to chew on. It is not my job to research your bullshit. You are the one making assertions, therefore it is up to you to provide supporting evidence.</p>

<p>Judging from your past submissions, I thought maybe you were someone who could apply logic and reason to a situation. This exchange is rapidly changing my mind about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To run the site they have <em>had</em> to build the brand...nothing wrong with that-wikileaks has had to do so as well. It really now depends on the mods and users (and admins). Some subreddits have definitely become &#39;infotainment&#39;, like r/gaming, while others have shills by the dozen, like r/politics. It&#39;s still heads and shoulders above any other site in quality (of it&#39;s userbase and it&#39;s content-barring those subreddits).</p>

<p>With the treatment of your account specifically don&#39;t underestimate how formal institutions and private companies will roll over as soon as they receive a communication from the government or think they might-i&#39;m sure you recall what with Amazon and those financial companies did to wikileaks accounts. This is why the admins may have been deathly afraid of the controversy. In a way, they erred on the side of protecting reddit from criticism at a &#39;dangerous&#39; time.</p>

The real leverage will come when private individuals who respect freedom and hate hypocrites hold the keys to every chamber, every vault, every prison, every &quot;secure&quot; installation and every organization. Every bank. Now i&#39;ll be ironic, I certainly hope the necessity of this idea is unnecessary, but.. this is theoretical and governments can and will shoot us when the needs arise and not blink an eye, just like they kill foreigners today, we are open to execution in the future for disagreeing with authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why this &quot;infowar&quot; is so important.</p>

<p>We must all do all we can to keep that future envisioned by the globalists (international corporations) from ever being realized.</p>

<p>Most people do not understand the urgency or how close to catastrophe we are. Also most people know something is wrong but they don&#39;t know what. Many are preparing in the wrong way. What good are your dried foods and gold if they are in a no-go (radiation) zone? What if all the water is contaminated. </p>

<p>The best preparation is a very serious &quot;Go Bag&quot;. In the mean time keep it simple: low profile, small footprint.</p>

<p>I would caution against the Utopian vision of private individuals who respect freedom and hate hypocrites holding the keys to every chamber, every vault, every prison, every &quot;secure&quot; installation and every organization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur with your prognosis. I think the long lead time is over. Gerald Celente thinks we are entering the &quot;you are history&quot; phase. </p>

<p>The people in government and business are not corrupt. They are &quot;just doing their job&quot; and getting well paid to do it. I was once offered $1,000/day to drive supply trucks from Kuwait to Bagdad with a $50,000 injury and $500,000 death benefit AND a $10,000 signing bonus up front.</p>

<p>People with jobs are looking out for themselves and their loved ones. In a culture that promotes &quot;rugged  individualism&quot;, people don&#39;t look beyond their immediate family and friends.</p>

<p>Corporations take advantage of this and by focusing on profits and the return on investment create the circumstances we now see in Greece where they are forcing the Government to take a new loan as large as the last just to pay the interest on the old loan. This is supposed to tide them over until they can get back on their feet and start being as productive as Germany (they never were and never will be). The catalyst to a NWO might be a Greek default.</p>

<p>My hope is the people of Greece rise up and say NO!</p>

<p>Let the dominoes fall!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called SPAM, you idiot.  When all someone does is fill a subreddit with links directing traffic to their site (which by the way is all MADE UP NEWS), it really discredits the whole fucking subreddit.  I used to come here and there would be links to real news sources about factual issues that are not covered by the mainstream media.  Now those reliable links have been replaced with posts from IAmJulianAssange, Kr3at, jdillinger, thebluestlight, and while perhaps these users do not profit from sending web traffic to the sites they link to, the sites are all non factual and contain no real information.  That is why anyone who dares to question the slant that the mainstream media puts on stories is deemed a crazy conspiracy theorist.  </p>

<p>That is why anyone who dares to question the slant that the mainstream media puts on stories is deemed a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite. The reason that people are attacked is simply that the truth threatens those in power and the mainstream system. They are afraid that anything but the current system of corruption will destroy civilization. Anyone who questions the current system is an enemy. Period. You and I are the enemy no matter what we say or how much truth there is to it. Actually the real crazy conspiracies are laughed at and parodied-it makes them feel secure. The conspiracies that scare them to death are the ones that are more or less true and they have a violent urge to enforce the current system on those who disagree. This is the critical moment to gut them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think maybe there was a misunderstanding here somewhere. JSIN33 asked why the IAmJulianAssage account was banned.

<p>I definitely understand the general idea as you&#39;ve expressed it here, re: database, tracking people, etc. I just was wondering if anything was left online of the actions (or evidence of them) that the account was ostensibly banned for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what clued me in: In all of cyber space who can and is willing to track these obscure posts in an extended thread on a minor subredditt of a an unprofitable website? </p>

<p>It was brought to my attention by someone attempting to communicate with me that his posts were being deleted. That person and I made email contact outside of reddit to discuss the issue. I am a point and click person so I don&#39;t know HOW it is done. But that person and I were able to prove to our own satisfaction that WHAT IS ON YOUR SCREEN is NOT ALWAYS ON REDDIT. Also since the other person involved was not identified as the recognizing what was happening he was able to determine that NOT ALL of his posts would disappear only the ones expressing support for me or calling attention to the problem.</p>

<p>At that point I tried to figure out WHY and without any feedback I GUESSED it was because I was either posting against the political views and/or business plan of the owners. It happened WHEN I was communicating to other redditors about what I call bury brigades. The disappearing posts, the sudden appearance of the same old cyber-bullies in remote threads in obscure subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wingman,</p>

<p>I want to point out that part of the reason I took my &#39;blood pressure break&#39; was due to the &quot;you&#39;re doing that too much&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re trying to submit too fast&quot; messages. And, I am inclined to concur with what you&#39;ve expressed in other comments about the admins (or, more specifically, I suspect, Conde Nast and the powers that be) turning this into a social media circus (look at this picture of my dog/cat/sweater-sewn-by-my-mom-but-I&#39;m-pretending-it-was-my-gf-for-reddit-karma).</p>

<p>When Conde Nast bought reddit, free speech&#39;s days were numbered on this site.</p>

<p>There is a solution, though... multiple accounts and multiple proxies. one proxy per account. never let them make connections between your accounts. never reveal any private info - not even something as seemingly harmless as &quot;I was driving on the BA Expressway in Tulsa the other day and saw this&quot;. Just don&#39;t do it. It is THE PRIMARY REASON I had to abandon several accounts.</p>

<p>Karma is irrelevant. Even if you like it (like Jew Confetti), you don&#39;t need to hoard it all under one username. If your mission truly is to promulgate truth, you&#39;ll free your mind of any such limitations and circumvent the barriers to free speech.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>think</em> it&#39;s a per subreddit... or per comment thread.. based thing.</p>

<p>e.g., only one submission per 10 minutes to r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>e.g., only one comment [edit: per 10 minutes] per post-thread.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m guessing IaJA was getting around this by cross-posting (that &quot;as fast as I could copy and paste a URL&quot; thing). If it takes a 60 seconds per submission, and he cycled through up to a dozen or more subreddits, he could do one submission per minute for quite a while before stumbilng on a &quot;you&#39;re doing that too much&quot; message. </p>

<p>Combine that with some intermittent commenting, and basically... he could keep flooding the site with submissions and comments until the cows come home</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a time for talk and a time for action. It has been my experience that r/conspiracy are not a positively oriented group.  I share the responsibility for that.  We all have a limited amount of time to do things in the physical sense.  Knowing about every negatively oriented choice being made on our behalf by the loyal opposition is supposed to make us consider, and work toward a better solution. The sharing of idea and thought, emotion and premise is important to the path we are on.  It is not all.  We should want change.  I have learned the hard way, that change starts inside. If you can not manage it it will manage you.  I urge you all to spend some time thinking about the Us vs Them mentality that pervades our civilization. You have Choice. Service to Self or Service to Others. The Law of Confusion has been invoked. This is my last post on r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was responding to questions about WHY.</p>

<p>My account was deleted WHEN I outed the admins as the bury brigade.</p>

<p>I was told directly by Mod Illuminatedwax several times that there was no DETECTABLE problem with my account. </p>

<p>I was able to confirm with the help of many redditors that my posts were NOT appearing on Reddit although they WERE APPEARING ON MY SCREEN. </p>

<p>One of those redditors posted a &quot;SELF&quot; quetioning what was happenning and the post was immediately deleted.</p>

<p>You are coming late to this and I suggest you get up to speed by having a friendly chat with the Mods. They are not responsible.</p>

<p>As far as motive, I have suggested a couple of ideas that seem reasonable to me based on business and politics. </p>

<p>You have stated that you know nothing and what you do and do not believe. In my experience people who stubbornly stick to their beliefs no matter what the facts are not likely to ever change their opinions. I am NOT trying to convince you.</p>

<p>I am trying to point out the flaw in your logic: you do not believe me and yet you keep engaging me for more information so that you can bolster your opposition. If you REALLY wanted to find out the facts you could communicate with the Mods with whom you claim to have a good rapport. Or you could engage the admins with whom you have had a previous positive experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got a message from one of the MODS who says he JUST found out about my situation and will look into it. So NO I do not need your help but thanks for the offer.</p>

<p>I know you are NOT trying to help me OR figure out what has happened. I have given you all the facts which you call &quot;assertions&quot; or &quot;supposed facts&quot;. I told you how easy it would be to corroborate if you wanted to.</p>

<p>Your arguments are based on NOT knowing anything but having fixed beliefs. To support your FEELING you were trying to provoke me into some sort of confrontation so you can storm off in a huff.</p>

<p>Now you are so frustrated by your own illogic that you have been reduced to name calling. </p>

<p>This is NOT the same thing that happened to you. I have been patiently trying to communicate with the people in charge for over two weeks. So yes I took the time to ask for help. I have had extremely limited response from Mods (all supportive) and NO response from Admins.</p>

<p>With the help of MANY redditors I have been able to find out all that I have already told you. You came late to this conversation and I tried to get you up to speed. You now have all the data I have. If you want to know more you have to ask people who have the knowledge.</p>

<p>The only one who can waste your time is you.</p>

<p>If this is the end then fare WELL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why this &quot;infowar&quot; is so important.</p>

<p>We must all do all we can to keep that future envisioned by the globalists (international corporations) from ever being realized.</p>

<p>Most people do not understand the urgency or how close to catastrophe we are. Also most people know something is wrong but they don&#39;t know what. Many are preparing in the wrong way. What good are your dried foods and gold if they are in a no-go (radiation) zone? What if all the water is contaminated. </p>

<p>The best preparation is a very serious &quot;Go Bag&quot;. In the mean time keep it simple: low profile, small footprint.</p>

<p>I would caution against the Utopian vision of private individuals who respect freedom and hate hypocrites holding the keys to every chamber, every vault, every prison, every &quot;secure&quot; installation and every organization. </p>

<p>I think that what we want is one...then another one...</p>
