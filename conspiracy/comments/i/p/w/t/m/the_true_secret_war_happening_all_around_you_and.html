        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The true secret war happening all around you. (and what you can do about it) </p>

<p>People need to wake up and realize the &quot;battle&quot; and chaos that going on in every democracy is an attempt by Oligarchs (trillionaire international business people) to subvert democracy around the world through media, financial destruction and subversive court ruling against voters because those democracies and strong middleclass governments are the only thing stopping the oligarchs from getting EVERYTHING. </p>

<p>They are attacking every democracy where people have good living standards and keep the oligarchs in check. The US, france, greece, britain, spain, even Canada now)</p>

<p>The financial &quot;failures&quot; in every European and American country are planned attempts to force people to accept less quality of life in exchange for transferring more money through taxes directly to these oligarchs who &quot;hold&quot; the debt.</p>

<p>Rupert Murdoch&#39;s decades long criminal bugging and likely blackmail of the highest politicians around the world is proof beyond a doubt this effort is real if you still needed it</p>

<p>Virtual every voting system in most democracies is now easily tinkered with live to elect the politicians they want, they have been now proven to use those tappable voting systems in the United States (ohio 2004 election whose presidential vote was proven in court to be shunted to Chattanooga,TN  and recalculated in each district to reelect Bush then sent back to the machines in Ohio before being counted. The computer orchestrator died in a strange plane crash when bound to testify in one week) to swing elections in the most blatant attackes on nations seen since the blitz.</p>

<p>Nothing about these happenings including the financial crisis in the USA, and throughout Europe is about any principle a republican or democrat talking point expressions. Those are all cover.</p>

<p>The goal is to have group of current trillionaires who own the most of the important assets in the world to continue to own them for all generations and have no taxes to pay or any controls on what they charge the public.</p>

<p>In order to do that they know they must eliminate social democracies (democracies tilted toward the welfare of their citizens with strong controls on those who would exploit them) either through election fraud, propaganda or financial bankruptcy (often all three).</p>

<p>The strongest social democracies that stand against the oligarchs and instead believe that citizens should have lives with decent incomes, decent times of relaxation and share inthe benefits of automation and computerization are the ones targeted without weapons. The strongest leaders of ruled nations are simply targeted with weapons.</p>

<p>These oligarchs have established offshore huge private militarys such as XE ( the former onshore Blackwater forces which moved outside the US to avoid US law) which they haven&#39;t hesitated to use through their politicians in sovereign nations states that aren&#39;t democracies and have no real reason not to use in democracies.</p>

<p>Either people wake up or they will find themselves increasing virtual slaves with little food, shelter, healthcare or living standards and no chance to re-establish them through voting. they won&#39;t feel the whip but they will not have any life to speak of except labor for the benefit of others either.</p>

<p>All of these facts are known and long proven and even in obvious plain sight now.</p>

<p>We know the oligarchs meet and align interests across nations whether sheiks or kings or businessmen or monopolists and whatever country. They know no sense of national loyalty.</p>

<p>They view themselves as operating on a plane above nationality and the primitive concept other people see as national loyalty.</p>

<p>They are all traitors to their respective nations and rarely respect their own national laws. They openly move operations offshore to avoid them (Dick Cheney&#39;s Halliburton moved form the us to the middleeast to avoid us law)</p>

<p>They want you to blame the corporate names they have established to shield their personal actions but they personally make the decision through those corporations and direct them. So those shields (which are fictional pieces of paper and don&#39;t exist)  shouldn&#39;t be blamed. </p>

<p>The owners should.</p>

<p>They need to be imprisoned and their wealth taken away and put back in the hands of real entrepreneurs who succeed because they produce rather than just own and corrupt and scheme.</p>

<p>It needs to happen soon before it is too late because if Europe&#39;s democracies fall as America&#39;s already are it will be too late for the people to have a methods to organize and enforce the law on these international new kings.</p>

<p>Murdoch should be the first to be imprisoned and a close examination of other major international oligarchs need s to be made to identify the international and national law they constantly break and the politicians who work with them to subvert their national interests.</p>

<p>The only measure of a national loyalty is do you support the quality of life of the people of the nation you claim to belong to or not? if not you are simply a subversive.</p>

<p>On an international scale the only measure of a person is do you support the maximization of the increase in quality of life for others on earth while being rewarded for you own efforts or do you seek to simply seek to increase your own control by subverting the quality of life and choice of others? If the latter, then there is no reason the people of earth should allow you to continue because you are a threat to everyone everywhere. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t stopped soon the advances in unmanned robotics and technology will make it impossible for an impoverished world population to ever stop you later.</p>

<p>Support the use of non hackable voting machines (every voting machine in the usa needs to be replaced with non proprietary open sourced software machines inspectable by everyone- the technology is simple and proprietary devices are unneeded ), support open international media for non funded politicians, support international enforce of a new class of laws against international monopolization and coercion &quot;outside&quot; national reach with punishment by prison and asset seizure.</p>

<p>In short make sure your politicians now are actively supporting the idea that YOU deserve the benefits of modernization (like computerization and robots) which will make much of life labor free and  YOUR life and free time and healthcare and quality of life should be increased as a result.</p>

<p>Support the making of international courts and laws against international coercion and conspiracy to deny people quality of life. make those laws enforceable and apply to EVERYONE whether they &quot;agree&quot; to jurisdiction or not. (Does arobber get to deny the courts jurisdiction?) </p>

<p>There will be one world. Technology is ensuring that.</p>

<p>The only question is will you have a say in it.</p>

<p>Will you experience any of its advances in leisure and quality of life or will you be confined to the job of the lowest bidder for the untaxed oligarch who &quot;owns&quot; everything you need to compete with him including the very ideas themselves through idea patents.</p>

<p>What you force your politicians to work for in the next few years will determine that.</p>

<p>If you let oligarchs saddle the government that you have a vote in with a fictional financial limitation on what it can do for you then you will have no way left to fight them and you will lose.</p>

<p>Your &quot;government&quot; and the money it taxes from the oligarchs and spends  on your behalf is not your enemy. It is literally the only defense you have left against the people who are constantly making supreme efforts to make you a virtual slave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Georedd, that was so well written that I don&#39;t think I can really add much to your statements. I agree with everything you had to say. The issue that has been troubling me is, how do I/we educate the masses? Everyone I know is so busy with family and trying to make ends meet that they have no time to educate themselves. Many people I know catch news blips here and there, therefore they haven&#39;t a clue as to what is really going on with the world. The average person knows they are working harder than ever and not really gaining anything. Those same people look to one of two political parties for some sort of hope, not realizing that neither party has their best interests in mind. We need some sort of catalyst to light a fire in the minds of the people. We need something to occur that will bring the common people together, that causes us to shed what our petty differences, so that we can all work together and defeat those who wish to further enslave us. I just don&#39;t know when or if this eye-opening event will occur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have found that RT america news channel is a wonderful network quality broadcast which openly discusses the internal bankers vs citiznes aspects of the european debt problems for example.</p>

<p>Ironic that it takes the center state  (Russia) of a former oligarchical military alliance (the soviet union) that was brought down by military capitalism (Reagan USA) to fund a network to defend the last real democratic capitalism (Europe) against oligarchical rule .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the government is the enemy. Mind you, they are not the only enemy -- another enemy would be the rich, ruling class that has bribed the government and gained control over it.</p>

<p>But as I&#39;ve posted before, nothing good will happen until we take back control of our own mass media. The media is being used to brainwash the population and keep it docile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup.</p>

<p>and in the 1930&#39;s people finally figured this out too and against all forces including the republican who had literally lent money to the Democratic party so he could control their nominee the people voted in the one guy who openly said the billionaires were subverting the nation (and he actually used that kind of direct language) Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

<p>and he stuck it too them.</p>

<p>and that&#39;s the kind of democratic nominee we need to elect in spite of the business democrats trying to keep their man Obama in who is a patsy.</p>

<p>If we do that things will actually change again.</p>

<p>if we don&#39;t, they won&#39;t.</p>

<p>although at this point an alliance across national boundaries with other citizens of democracies who understand that the billionaires are corrupting each country would be a big help to stop it.</p>

<p>People and importantly the jilted lords who weren&#39;t in on the scheme but had some power had to rise up against their kings in England to change things. they got the magna carta etc.</p>

<p>we need an alliance with powerful but jilted business people as well as international cooperation to make world laws to keep the oligarchs in check to create free  markets where true business people who also care about human conditions can actual start businesses that can compete against oligarchs with virtual slave labor who are trying to lock everything down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you do this to yourself? You ruin a potentially good argument by saying &quot;Just look at it! It&#39;s so obvious!&quot;</p>

<p>An avid astrologer would say the exact. same. thing. You can&#39;t just present a bunch of points as fact and not back them up with hard data. Put in the fucking work if you want people to take you seriously. Or are you afraid you won&#39;t find what you need to support your ranting?</p>

<p>You may have a good point, but your refusal to submit hard data and instead rely on anecdotal evidence is your downfall.</p>
