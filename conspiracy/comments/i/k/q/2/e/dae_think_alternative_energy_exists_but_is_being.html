       Call it faith in humankind but I have a sneaking suspicion that solutions for our major energy problems exist - however they are being suppressed while solutions or alternatives to the oil economy are being worked out.  Possible?

       If this has been suggested and dismissed I apologize - very new here.

       You are 100% right. Why do you think that marijuana is illegal? Not because it's a drug, but because of the immense potential hemp has a viable replacement for petroleum as a fuel source.

       Hemp has

       potential. But not

       Hemp grows in almost any climate.  We won't be using good farmland to produce hemp.  Furthermore, there are tons of offshoot products, such as biodegradable plastics, which can be derived from hemp as well.  It's silly that we don't already have this industry going.  The USA is the only industrialized nation in the world where hemp cultivation is illegal.

       It was originally a threat to the textile industries, that and Wm. Randolph Hearst needed to sell papers, so he created a controversy over the "mexicans and marihuana". It worked. It's only stayed in place because of the moral judgements started in the way back.

       Well, consider that it is a fact that the Pharmaceutical industry is the largest industry in America.  Larger than oil, dollar for dollar.  Larger than anything.

       I think he probably meant that many medications can be replaced with this cure.  By the way, I've seen it evaporate a small skin tumor from someone's face, in real life.  It reall does work.

       personally, i can't go back to cotton now that i've tried hemp, it's just that much better.  hemp breathes better so less sweat and hemp lasts a LOT longer...

       No, oil is just better. Forget dollar cost efficiency. What matters is energy input/output ratio. Oil is 1:18; coal is between 1:5 and 1:3 depending on the grade; anything under the alternative/clean label is 1:2 or worse. Oil is steroids for economies. This is why it's worth going to war over.

       wrong!  Quit spreading misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the oil that exists in the world is below 1:1.  That's why it will never be gotten to.  Most of it is stuck in places that are lower grade than the Alberta tar sands which are only marginally profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       A ratio of 1:18 for oil might be taking into account some light oil fields only.  But if you include heavy, super heavy crude, tar sands, you will get a much lower grade.  As the light crude is exhausted more and more of the oil supply is coming from lower grade sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand solar power has a high and improving ratio:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The energy input for the structural materials of a photovoltaic system delivering 1 billion kWh is calculated to be approximately 300 kWh/m2. The energy input/output ratio for production is about 1:9 assuming a life of 20 years (Table 2).

       WW3 could also occur over clean water.  At a certain point, the only way to get clean water could hypothetically be any of the many desalination processes, which of course, leads us back to the energy necessary to run those processes.

       But then we would be in the same sinking ship that is ethanol. The amount of acreage that it takes to create the same amount of energy as petroleum is a large amount. We have food shortages and high demand for things that could grow on that same land, so taking that land and turning it into something that is just fuel for machines has it's drawbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying hemp oil is a bad idea, but ethanol is essentially
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       costly than petroleum, and takes up valuable acreage of farmland that should be growing food. The farmers that grow corn for ethanol also don't care about the quality of the corn as much, or the land, so the corn destined for ethanol production just gets re-planted every year instead of being rotated properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, not saying it's bad or good, but hemp oil, corn oil, vegetable oil, etc
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have their own drawbacks and negative environmental impacts.

       As far as I understand Hemp is superior to other plants because of the all the different uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The oil is pressed from the seeds and is the healthiest oil, it can fuel our bodies and engines both.
      </p>
      <p>
       and from the same crop remains tons of usable fiber.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiber is extremely strong and has many many uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hemp fiber mixed with Lime and water and you have
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hempcrete">
        Hempcrete
       </a>
       which is superior to concrete in many situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine a similar  simple process to make a biodegradable plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hemp does not  require pesticides unlike corn, soy etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem we have with farmland is government subsidization of  Meat Production and allowing factory farming. Most of the corn and soy is going to feed animals, a very inefficient process.

       And say for example the sun? It doesn't provide the same power for a lesser cost than your brother going to war for a Renewable resource? We can't use that instead? Or wind? Or Hydrogen? Or every other option we have?

       Dollar cost is irrelevant. Little green pieces of paper do not change the laws of physics. Do you know how much energy it takes to make a solar panel? Lots. It takes forever to make it back. Thousands of hours. If it didn't, everybody would be on solar. Nobody is interested in being inefficient just because.

       Doubt that will happen.  Solar seems better suited as a distributed model, where everyone has a few panels and stores/sells energy back into the grid.

       Exactly little green pieces of paper who don't even have a value in the first place. The value of your little green paper is irreverent. isn't it? So why not do the better thing and create or use an already created energy that's beneficial to people and doesn't cost anything?

       Exactly, I'm not Al Gore here I'm saying that the value of the dollar doesn't really matter because it doesn't really have any value and I understand that we need things like oil to prop up a fake economy but it would be much better for everyone involved to have and use a better solution... And there are better solutions.

       Solar panels are really expensive, much more expensive
       <em>
        per unit of energy
       </em>
       than oil is. Before you can get all your free sunlight, you have to put up an enormous amount of money. "It'll be worth it in the end!" Depends how much money you've got lying around. If you really have that much cash, and you can just piss it away, then buy yourself some solar panels. Enjoy. But there's a severe opportunity cost for most people in throwing away upward of $10,000 just so they won't have to pay the feeble monthly electric bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for power plant size electricity, you have to keep in mind the same startup costs that are difficult for a family of four to afford scale upward. Oh, and you have to find some enormous space of land to put all your solar panels. Good luck with that. Or, alternatively, you can just keep digging coal, which, like the family electric bill, is without severe opportunity cost. If you have that kind of money to start on an electricity company (or modify an existing one) then you're smart enough to know you can make much more money, much faster, elsewhere.

       I don't think the oil companies are going to wait for oil to run out before developing them.  They have them stockpiled so when oil is really close to running out.  They just pull them out and charge obscene amounts

       There are technologies that are now viable for efficiency, but all of the programs are funded by (Guess who!?) the oil companies. Universities have to run projects through the oil companies board of directors to get grants for research. This lets them control how technology is researched, where it branches into and when it is released

       Maybe "restrained" is a better word. I don't think it already exists, rather I think we're not only preventing current progress, but also gutting our education system to prevent future engineers and scientists from figuring it out as well.

       Yes 100%. We are led to believe that everything should have price tag attached to it. It is very relevant to their interests for everyone to be dependent on all the energy providing companies. Food is also energy. Dependency = controll. We have ways to produce energy infinetly without the need for nuclear fission or burning fossile fuels.

       More or less, yes.  I refuse to believe that there simply is not a way to reduce oil dependence in general.  Will it cost money?  Sure.  So does oil, and finding new sources of it.  All roofs should be white.

       not terribly expensive, and a good starting point.  New developments in solar seem to happen about every week, lately.

       Let's say that these alternative energy sources exist and TPTB know about it.  So, we currently have oil and this is contributing to the number one cause of population growth, the growing and transport of food, no food, no people.
       <br/>
       If we had "free energy" (i don't think there is completely free energy)or extremely efficient energy don't you think the population would grow out of control quickly.
       <br/>
       The crap is about to hit the fan already with just oil.
Also, oil makes a lot of people at every spot on the pipeline rich.  Shipping, refining, plastics, vehicles, fertilizers, commodities trading, although it's probably not the most sought after commodity when it comes to strictly speculation trading.
Drilling, business management and my own personal theory is that oil itself replaces gold in that it gives currency it's current value.
Even the king of saudia arabia said recently that he prefers oil at $70 a barrel so that his customers won't take the time to develop alternatives.

       It isn't really the oil. It is the population.

      <p>
       By the time "alternative energy" is called upon to serve... our world population is going to have to be well under a quarter of what it is now.

       Food, we can barely produce enough now and that is burning fossil fuels and destroying the planet at the highest rate we can. If you are going to start doing things differently then that is no longer going to work.

      <p>
       A failed crop here and a failed crop there, coupled with the panic.. would cause crazy food shortages and billions will die.

       Coincidentally, one of the largest purchasers/users/developers of renewable energy technologies is the US Military.  ALOT of the research and grant money comes from the DoD.  Oil companies do it so that they can get an edge for future business.  The military actually uses it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the issue is that the existing US electrical grid is outdated, so the integration of the renewable resources into the system is a challenge, not the existence of the resource.

       Learned of an interesting connection between Nikola's work and the (great?)grandfather of journalist Benjamin Fulford. (Ben Fulford had interview with Japanese official, at least a year before the Japanese earthquake, regarding Japan being threatened by US with the use of an "earthquake weapon". I am openminded, yet just as unsure of what really happened as most everyone else.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sr. Fulford is thought to have been killed by the Rockefeller family because of his funding Nikola's research.

       absolutely. check out methane hydrates. its basically methane ice that burns. it burns clean and theres more of it on the ocean floor than there has ever been oil.

       Sounds neat. I'll have to check it out, and I'm certainly no expert, but collecting stuff from the bottom of the ocean seems like a pretty expensive/inefficient way to create energy to me.

       watch a documentary called Collapse. It's part conspiracy, in the way that every impediment to progress is caused by powerful people fighting to retain said power, but it's more just unwillingness/inability to upend the way the entire world gets it's energy. The guy in this documentary shows that oil is much more than just fuel for vehicles, it really is everything, and no alternative energy is even close to being able to replace it yet. But the conclusion of the documentary is still that we will eventually run out of oil, well before we're prepared to and there will be devastating consequences.
