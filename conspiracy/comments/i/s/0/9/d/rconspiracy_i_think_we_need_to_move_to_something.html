       Reddit is no place for people to discuss conspiracy theories. It has a history of censorship, of herd behavior (the so-called hivemind) and, worst of all, it's owned by an evil corporation, Conde Nast, which only cares about its own interest. Reddit doesn't care about its users, it's just a commercial site. So commercial it not only gets money from advertisers but also from "Reddit Gold" subscriptions. Reddit collects info about its users or, if I doesn't, it thinks about it (see "allow my data to be used for research purposes" in the Preferences). On reddit, silent bans aren't uncommon, as one of our most frequent posters can confirm to us. Reddit is filled with corporate shills and government people, as it has been proven several times. Reddit is also US-based, which means it is subject to the absurd American laws that hamper free speech like the PATRIOT Act. Reddit is filled with idiots that would upvote everything hosted on imgur and downvote or ignore serious discussions (look at the most upvoted posts even on this subreddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit in the last year has become the home for a lot of interesting posts I wouldn't have found otherwise. But I feel like reddit isn't the right place for it and  I think we should move to something like Tor or I2P for serious discussion about conspiracy theories. Even if discussing them isn't illegal, the suspicious moderation, silent bans and simply the fear of being monitored that reddit users endure is just
       <em>
        unacceptable
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We're complaining a lot about the moderation issues and the silent bans but creating new subreddits and protesting bans isn't really going to do anything until Conde Nast has the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conde Nast bought reddit to dumb it down, why would it bother buying a tech news site that was only used by nerds? And since it shifted from a tech news social site to 4chan, it seems they succeeded. Why do you think Conde Nast would allow something as controversial as the JB subreddit to stay open? I say there's something nasty going on. See all the Google+ circlejerk these days? And the instant downvotes to those who question Google's intents? There is a conspiracy within Reddit itself, I'm 100% sure of it. Also, the reddit userbase is terrible nowadays, from the teenagers at AskReddit to the attention whores at Gonewild (other conspiracy - since when is reddit filled with attractive women? Why do the most upvoted in GW look like they could be professional models? Some were even outed as such!) this place is becoming similar too much similar to mainstream TV. We can't stay here anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where do you think we should migrate? Tor and I2P seem like good choices, and although nothing is perfectly safe it's safe enough for our purpose, free speech. Freenet has some technical problems right now but its distributed data storage is really interesting, although there are efforts to implement it in I2P as well. The reddit codebase is open source so we won't even need to change
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       radically, although making a fresh site would be better since the reddit codebase doesn't have the best performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probable that, ironically, this post will disappear or I'll get silent banned but whatever, it's important that at least one person gets the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       No tl;dr, if you need one you're part of the problem.

       Naw. It's mostly old stuff we've seen regurgitated over the past 6-7 years. What irks me is the lack of any real discussion. I dip in the woo, but can't stand half the stuff uttered be the extremes of both sides. Only the conspiracy talk that isn't rational gets seen and then skeptics get all jizzy in the pants because they think they are debunking something, which is utter bullshit. It's why I can't stand some of the truth sites, nor any of the bullshit that dribbles out of places like JREF. There is no good place on the internet to discuss these things without a side being taken. Whatever happened to neutral?!?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I've studied concrete and steel column design, I shouldn't go spouting off about thermal graphs that the NIST produces. The same goes for any fuckass chemical engineer who thinks they can have a debate on structural sections and beam/column failure. Everyone wants to prove their point without realizing a lot of these issues are very complex and there is no pretty answer that's going to be produced by just 1 person.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth lies somewhere in the middle and no one wants to admit that because that would imply that neither side is completely correct. The truth of the matter is that you, nor the op bring anything new to the table. I've been hearing the same old 'WE DON'T HAVE A VOICE HERE' followed up by 'NO SHIT, IT'S BECAUSE YOU BE CRAZY'
      </p>
      <p>
       If only I had shotgun shell for everytime that happened I could start thinning out the herd.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I'd like to note is that the rational mind does get upvoted, but it's not because 'intelligent people are seeing this shite for what it is', but rather they upvote the insightful questions. I don't mean to dogging on your parade, but you really had an opportunity to make a decent point, but summarized it up a little too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still a lot of questions out there and you don't get those at other subreddits. I enjoy it here and if anyone feels differently they can get the fuck out.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: If you think about it, reddit is exactly the kind of place to have these talks and find some common ground on the issue. If we can't make it happen here, I doubt there is going to be a better place for these conversations. Going rogue almost indefinitely ensures that professional engineers, auditors and those in the military will not be bringing a much needed voice.

       You may only need statics/mechanics/materials to know physically how a beam fails, but this does not at all mean you know how building systems work.  There is a lot more going on than any run of the mill engineer is knowledgeable about. There is a reason you have to do an extra two day test to get your SE after your PE as a Structural.

       Depending on his exact field, there's a good chance he knows more about failure of structural elements than a lot of engineers but that doesn't mean he knows about Structural Systems and their failures.

       On some scale I agree, but the do not go into detail with indeterminate sections, frames, trusswork, etc. Most statics classes will focus on the major's core curriculum. There are just so many examples to go over, there really isn't enough time to hit all the basics that statics covers, let alone structural analysis. In my statics class I never felt like we hit those topics enough. We had to skip over some of the mechanical questions because there wasn't enough time (fuck plier questions, i don't know you bastards did that). Even in structural analysis I did not feel competent enough in some areas. I think solids was one of the best classes I took, but again, it covered the basics - strees, strain, torque, bearing, shear, moment, fillets, axial compression, moments of inertia. Most of our examples were on tangs and other mechanically inclined shapes. Even in concrete and steel design, we covered the material that was quite basic. I could have taken advanced concrete and steel classes, a second structural class and still not feel comfortable with the complexities. Obviously this is why we rely on computing power for indeterminate sections, which you already know. We study how to make things go up, not how they go down. I don't fully understand the principles of failure other than the fact that we know factors at which they fail, and then design accordingly. All of our code design is empirical evidence and they are still working on improving such working design principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in the concrete and steel design classes will you cover relevant ductility, compressive and tensile failures. If you don't, you simply won't know about things as simple as the Whitney Stress Block, which is fundamental to even start a conversation on concrete columns and beams.

       I understand what you meant by "The truth lies somewhere in the middle".  I use this phrase, I hope most people grasp the sentiment rather than taking it literally.  It is a very short way of summarizing your feelings.

       The same hivemind is mostly the reason I come here, I get a bit of a laugh at the expense of people who don't believe the moon landing happened or who think the jews organized the holocaust,or that HAARP caused the Japanese earthquakes, and various other sadlarious notions out there.

       Wiping out your business competition could be two. Now if you'll look at the middle east, it's as if they're trying to setup another holocaust. Blame it on Iran this time and collect war reparations for the next 100 years. PS: Germany paid off WWI earlier this year.

       Yes, because truth is a perception.  The statement, "I am a cat" is not true coming from me whereas from a cat it would be completely valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Truth" also therefore shouldn't "come from" anywhere because we shouldn't rely on being informed by others to generate something that represents part of our identities.

       I think I meant to say does it matter what the source is if what we are getting is consistent with our understanding of what is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can the truth come from RT, Al Jazeera, Fox, Press TV?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is useful to entertain ideas from sources with which we might often be in complete disagreement. Many people just label "the other" with some derogatory term (e.g. "teabaggers", "stupid people", "conspiracy theorists") so they do not have to THINK about what people are saying .

       The thing with online posting is that people often respond in contradiction just because they think they're being contradicted.  The result is flamewars and idiocy.  So it's hard to tell what people genuinely believe.  It's a strength and a weakness of the net that you can trust everything you see online and trust nothing.

       Are you sure they are not just explaing that they want to know more about why something happened? Is there a chance that because you believe what you do that you think they are just being hard core? Most everyone I know has an opinion about what happened, but almost everyone just wants to get more information about it, even if that means opening another investigation.

       There is always someone that will do that, but stay the course when talking to people. If you are talking about 911 and the gaps in the story, then stick to it, dont' let anyone draw a line from 911 to Holocaust, or anything else. To me that is the same as saying because we don't know everything about how the universe came into existance, there must be a god.

      <p>
       Logic is for the thinking person. Just because you call what you are saying "logic" so you can feel better than someone else, doesn't actually make it logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hivemind are those who don't actually think before saying anything or innovate anything. They go by what they are told by a superior, or what they've heard rather than what they themselves have found out. One that you are so very familiar with, and part of. But would never really fully admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think logic in general is too good for you since it sounds like (especially after linking ImJulianAssange) you can't handle anything outside of what the TV box tells you and what you think is "cool" here on reddit. But no one can tell you that and can get away with it, right? Ah, caught your narcissism racing in your mind to find a response to save face didn't I?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, many theories end up proving true, and many don't. A lot are just not possible and for the people who actually aren't mentally ill, it is pretty obvious. But they are still welcome anyway because on occasion, their twisted mind can catch a pattern even the most free thinking of us might miss due to being so easily swayed into a hive mind mentality, if even momentarily.

       I think what he wants is to get away from all the garbage.  Any and all conspiracy related forums end up containing 99% bullshit and populated by fucking morons.  Finding that 1% and having an intelligent debate is what conspiracy theorists dream about.  However when you have to constantly deal with that 99% bullshit and the morons who come with it you never get to taste the fucking sky cake.

How many joint cheifs of staff signed an operation calling for the MURDERING of Americans on American street the sinking of innocent ships and the hijacking of airplanes?

       Agreed! More than intelligent debate, it seems like the average conspiracy theorist is looking for either someone to astound, or for a choir to preach to. Like hipsters. "Oh, aspartame? I was researching that conspiracy
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       ago." 
Whether you deem them the majority of r/conspiracy posts gullible or just plain stupid, it's an avenue for new participants to enter the sub-culture, which, considering how snotty some of its champions can be, is hard to find. Diversity of perspective can only help the search for truth, I think.

       I was with you until this part - "There is a conspiracy within Reddit itself, I'm 100% sure of it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I find some asshole who claims he's 100% sure about anything, my trust for what he's peddling drops by about half. Never claim to be 100% sure about anything - there are no absolutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is owned by a corporation - yes. Not all corporations are the problem. Is money their prime concern? Also yes - welcome to the present days of life. Has their user base helped anonymously and selflessly? Once again, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will agree that Reddit is indeed sick, but that's the result of it getting more popular in just about every form of media. When anything expands, a loss of quality is the result. Up to us, the user base, to determine the future of Reddit - the management merely keeps things on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unfortunate that people get banned w/o warning at times but mods are human and therefor ere.

      <p>
       TL;DR
Re-fucking-lax. Smoke a joint.

        Reddit is filled with corporate shills and government people, as it has been proven several times.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: any other site we go to in reddit's stead is also going to be filled with corporate shills and government people, eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just as enthusiastic as everybody else about the Internet's promise for expanding democracy, but in the days since it's become apparent that, although many obstacles have been overcome, one is threatening to remain for a very long time: the inability to combat the sockpuppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to know the user's real identity.  We just need to know that the person behind the account isn't also behind some other account.  If you could write for me a function that accepted two user account names and reliably returned a boolean that tells me whether they're the same person or not, then I could see a basis for creating or moving over to a reddit alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, any open forum that gets on their radar gets sockpuppeted.  And you guys have seen the stories, we're not talking about some goon staying up all night with two browsers open, we're talking about software being created expressly for the purpose of allowing the single individual to appear as a hundred or more people.  And you have whole floors full of cubicles in which a person sits for this exact purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither Tor nor Freenet solve this basic problem.  Yes, you can have great success building small communities atop these services, but once you reached whatever they define as critical mass, now you have shills on your Tor or Freenet forum.  What's changed?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be quite the irony if the only viable model for political organization on the web sees us resorting to small communities, if only to better ensure the conversation is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And isn't it interesting that this is exactly the same problem we have with our system for voting.  Corporate shills and government people got so good at spamming democracy in the online forum for a reason: much practice spamming democracy at the ballot box.  Until we require that all votes be published, they will continue to be free to pad the election totals as they see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people are talking about revolution, or at least, describing the coming dollar collapse in revolutionary terms.  Well, that's great.  Nobody wants to see the people who've unleashed these horrors upon our nation punished for their crimes more than I do.  But I'm not hearing anything about how we fix the fundamental problem that put us in the situation to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You give it a new version number when you put out new code.  You don't just come out with the same shit, then call it Democracy 2.0.  The fail doesn't go away simply because you've got new faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, with the corruption of our voting system, requiring the publication of votes is a real fix.  It solves the problem.  From that day forward, every election operating under that simple convention is demonstrably legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the analogous solution to the sock puppet problem?  Requiring authorization before being allowed access to the Internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       We sacrifice something that important to us personally for the sake of creating a public discourse that isn't fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       One step forward two steps back?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course, who else but dotgov is going to insist that they control the user registry.  Which of course defeats the whole point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existing logical topology doesn't seem to be on our side.  And the collapse has a clock now.

       We shouldn't even use internet, because computers, cables and all infrastructure are manufactured either in China or in US and we all know very well that they have some big shit planned up. By using their technology we easily expose ourselves to them, together with our personal data, all information that's stored on our computers and even in our rooms (webcams are in every laptop now.) I suggest buying a big piece of land somewhere in Africa (it's cheap, local governments will give you anything for money) and building our own society, completely off the grid and not connected to the rest of the world in any way. What do you think?

       Isn't Tor funded by the CIA? I think you're on to something though, I despise the hive-mind mentality and the fact that critical thinking is devalued and downvoted in most sub-reddits here to preserve the status quo. I just don't think it will be easy to find a suitable and convenient replacement that everyone will be happy to switch over to.

       The TOR project was partially funded by the CIA, but if you understand the tech, you'll see the medium cannot be censored or controlled. Additionally, you can't host a discussion on TOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the OP's post is seriously paranoid and fucked. r/conspiracy's problem isn't the hive mind, it's the lack thereof combined with paranoia and people's inability to hold a constructive discussion. Check my history; I've been called an anti-Semite conspiracy nut, and a CIA disinfo agent.

       All too often, the theorists do not realize they've crossed into the area of being a nut job. Studying these theories should give one the ammunition to make others question the official stories, but if you think you've wrapped the world up into one perfect package, that the world is being ran by shape-shifting reptiles who used holograms to make it look like planes hit the towers, and that in 2012, the chemtrails are going to align with Marduk to fake the moon landings for real this time so Jesus can return and give us all mad cow, you need to chill the fuck out.

       Conspiracy exists. This is fact. Studying the theories is important. This is fact. The CIA disseminates bullshit theories so people will discredit themselves. This is (by their own admission) fact.. But theories are theories, they are not proven fact, and if you open your mind too much your brains will fall out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that we should be digging for truth and not accusing everyone who discusses from an opposing viewpoint of being a CIA asset or an instrument of Satan.

       And Reddit is user moderated. I want to see some evidence of Conde Nast censoring this subreddit.

        Studying these theories should give one the ammunition to make others question the official stories, but if you think you've wrapped the world up into one perfect package, that the world is being ran by shape-shifting reptiles who used holograms to make it look like planes hit the towers, and that in 2012, the chemtrails are going to align with Marduk to fake the moon landings for real this time so Jesus can return and give us all mad cow, you need to chill the fuck out.

       Then how does the Silk Road (black market for drugs and other things paid for by bitcoins) exist? Sure, you may not be able to keep a single identity, but I could see a 4chan-like site happening (without pictures though, seeing as TOR would be too slow for that).

       That's the beauty of the internet there are plenty of domains available for you to spout your shit elsewhere. See the thing is, even though people might be hivemind-downvoting maybe something they read will stick with them. Even if it's not a life shattering realization or even something they will ever agree with, at least the information is getting out and that's really all that can be done, right?
      </p>

       Oh and Tor is a terrible option. What are you talking about that's so hush-hush. Go to Tor if you're interested in International illegal sex and drug rings.

       We need to start compiling a list of news aggregators. We need to try them out and see which ones we like.

        whatreallyhappened.com
       </a>
       have some interesting links though you have to pick through a certain amount of shit to get to them. But the links on those sites frequently end up accepted a couple of weeks or months later.  But there's no submissions (except by mail) and no voting. And a lot of rightie stuff. As a leftie I just scrap the mud off and look for pearls of truth. The way I found out about rense was years ago they crashed my site linking a
       <a href="http://www.newsgarden.org/wordsofthewise/picturesanimals.shtml">
        cat video
       </a>
       I had. Which I didn't mind. But if I had known it was coming I would have fixed it so I was covered for the traffic. They only do politics and conspiracy these days.

       <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/discover/news-aggregator/">
        stumbledupon
       </a>
       . I mostly know about them because from time to time they will link to parts of my website and I will see them in my webstats.
      </p>
      <p>
       This aggregator has real possibilities. It has voting and a lot of sections:

        http://gawker.com/
       </a>
       but it looks too mainstream to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's
       <a href="http://newslily.com/">
        http://newslily.com/

       It's main problem is the lack of members and traffic.

       There's

        http://socyberty.com/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem with most of these sites is they don't get much traffic. But if reddit ceases to fulfill our needs, that could change for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got any others you know of?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I went to check digg. They are a lot better since their pageviews have crashed and Rose has left (not sure if that is related). They have many fewer votes than reddit and that seems like a good thing. As a result less crap. I was surprised.

       There is no conspiracy on reddit.  Did you ever stop to think the reason this subreddit, reddit, the "hivemind" and everything else you are critiquing is unpleasant to you is bc/ YOU'RE WRONG?  There is no reddit conspiracy, there is a truth conspiracy against the BS on this subreddit.  I have asked for proof many times on here, and I have literally gotten the answer that there is no proof, thats why you know its true.  Conspiracies are way to hard and complicated to work, that is why the world if much more pragmatic.  Conspiracies hinge on the people involved detouring from their normal path to cover something up or achieve some goal.  This is not a conspiracy it is pragmatism.  What proof do you offer of a conspiracy on reddit, not an over zealous moderator or a pissed redditor, an actual conspiracy, slight and random deviation from the normal is not a conspiracy, it is reality.

       The problem with conspiracy on Reddit is simply that the rational is much more valued than the intuitive here.  Many of us got the 'hunch' that something was rotten in Denmark on 9/11, Kennedy's assasination, etc.  We followed those hunches and found the pretty big holes in the cover story.  But, there are other dimensions in play that can not be easily accessed by the rational mind.  It could be that we'll be able to describe some of these places with string theory or quantam physics, but we don't have the language for it right now.  There is definitely a lot more to the universe than we can understand with our five senses.
So it becomes a question of resonance, what information best fits the missing pieces, who benefits, what sets off your bullshit detector?
As an occultist, I use my intuition all the time, it helps to lead me into deeper knowledge about what is going on.  I make the rational connections, but I make the subtle ones too.  I can also often communicate in a way people can feel as well as hear.  But this is all bullshit on Reddit, because people on Reddit shame people that even bring up dimensions, spirit, soul, etc...  For some reason, this is out of bounds, because of the reaction to the way that religion and spirituality has been twisted to serve power, money and ego.
The conspiracy of the plutocrats is only the tip of the iceberg, the real conspiracy is deeper and wider than anyone could ever fully discover in one lifetime.  But it boils down to fear.  Fear feeds the conspiracies, not recognizing our own power feeds the conspiracies.  To hide away when discussing things beyond the normal is pathetic.  Challenge that fear, refuse to let it run you, look into the darkness of yourself, your country, humanity and the fucking Universe itself.  What is the shadow of the rational mind ascendant?
       <br/>
       I will live on my fucking feet and I will not bow down to fear of what might happen to this particular meatsuit.  Remember your own death, then live free.

       An exclusively rational mind, to me, is a form a mental retardation. Quite literally. That is where the real hive mind is. Even though 90% of them in there don't want to admit it and truly think they are being original by summarily dismissing any alternatives to the official story (of say, 9/11). You MUST be abstract and intuitive in order to properly think and learn. If you do nothing but go by what you are told is "common sense" or what you have been told is "rational" then already you are stuck and never move on. Unfortunately, in America, that has become a massive majority. Lazy minded people who could never be told or admit they are actually lazy. Just because you went to school "paid your dues" doesn't make you actually smart. Life is learning, you must always learn each day. Connect dots here, notice patterns there. If you go your life by watching things that give you nothing but confirmation bias all day so you feel smarter, you really aren't smarter at all. You just have your own growing prejudices to feed and nothing new ever gets through.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also a basic survival tool that far too many, even here on reddit, have lost. These people who support the official story because of the word "official" stamped on it are those who would be first to perish in a sudden 3rd world America when the people in our government want to finalize their plans once and for all and stage yet another, much larger, attack with the ultimate goal of mass propaganda and fellow-shipping to become our masters by being fake heroes and friends when in a time of need. A need that they created, so we would embrace them with open arms when starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       The civil war of the near future against the federals isn't going to be fought by the under educated or IQ challenged. Not like before. It is going to be fought by the extremely wise, intuitive, smart, and truly humble (teachable) that know the truth, seek out more truth, and truly fight for survival and our freedom by refusing to be cattle.

       Hey paranoidol, I'm a moderator of one or two small subreddits and am addressing the idea of moderating being somehow part of a conspiracy because it seems like you just don't know how reddit works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadow-banning is when a moderator bans someone or removes their posts without telling them. When I first became a moderator, I did this to some spammers, not realising how serious it could be taken. I then unbanned these spammers. When the spam queue filled, once again, with their posts, I banned one or two of them again. There was no conspiracy, it was just easing the spam queue. Only one of them asked to be unbanned, so I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, you can't attribute significance to moderation. Moderators are all-powerful in their subreddits and if you wanted to see what that could be like, you could try establishing your own, thereby getting an inside perspective on Reddit (There's some sweet graphs).
      </p>

       Content moderation has absolutely nothing to do with Reddit admins or Condé Nast, Reddit is a facility with one main (automatically-controlled) subreddit: the frontpage. Otherwise they just maintain databases of autonomous volunteered information and a few algorithms and stylesheets. You can see for yourself: establish a subreddit, make posts you believe Condé Nast would remove and see if they stick around. Your post hasn't disappeared thus far.

       I remember a while back when a couple of front page pots (something to do with Israel) just disappeared.
It would be good if this was a open source not for profit website. Embracing free speech and a contemporary form of democracy.

       Since joining the sub-reddit I've found a great wealth of information and dialogue. The natural progression is to look for more, and a somewhat bigger more specific site for exactly this. I would be interested to see what could be done. I think it could be something that could work with the sub-reddit, and any other conspiracy based forums. A secondary place that helps organize and archive the posts and ideas shared scattered around on different conspiracy forums. Unity above loyalty to one specific website would be the goal. I'm open to ideas and willing to do what I can to help.

       I think that we need to not be to secretive, I think a normal site would be fine. If we cut ourselves off too much it will keep new members from joining. A site with a similar format to this but with a different report and ban system would be better; like if we could tag people like in RES but for the every one to see. So you could click on a tag next to someones name and see who had tagged them as what.  Also if it showed part of the article right under the head line that would be cool.
Maybe the ability to have a small picture next to your name. More customizationability would be great and would make it easier to spot fake accounts and what not.

       Dude im all for a good conspiracy, there have a been a few good hits on here. however Reddit is full of RATIONAL people. and some of the shit on here. Like the comet thats a brown dwarf thats cold.. and only affects local gravity wells not the asteroid belt or other plantes etc.... THAT SHIT gives you a bad name.    To say that Reddit doesnt have free speech is well retarded. The users get to vote up and down what they like. Also free speech means everyone gets to voice their opinion. If it differs from yours oh well thats your problem. Take a chill pill and maybe filter a few things through the logic part of your brain.

       There's really two kinds of post on here -- there's the Alex Jones posts, and there's the David Icke posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Alex Jones posts are about political and social conspiracies, mostly relating to the elite or the New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       The David Icke posts are those that deal with space aliens, reptilian rulers, bigfoot, end of the world scenarios, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize this is not a completely fair division -- David Icke does discuss New World Order issues -- but it's how I think of the two classes of posts we get.

       The world has always been driven towards a one world government. It will be a good thing. Think of the lives we could save if everyone understood we are all related and all the same. Instead of US vs whatever or Christian vs muslim. That is mankinds greatest sickness, the inability to recognize each other as friends.

       !!! Your voice in public is important, don't hide yourself !!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Tor and I2P are """Network tools""" to make your connection anonymous, so this way you can connect to internet using some supported software (mail, chat, irc, browsers, ...) and keep yourself safe and anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       These tools don't give us a free (as freedom), safe and convenient way to share and communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think on the contrary, that if we have to say something important, we don't have to hide us behind a proxy and that if we are censured we have to shout louder and to ask our friends to to do the same. Again and again...
      </p>
      <p>
       Proxies and firewalls are needed to hide our conversations when we speak about our money or about our personal secrets.

       While I agree this sub-reddit is mostly dead, I don't think it's a conspiracy, just a natural off-shoot of  reddit's target audience - males 18 to 38 - and their never ending quest to quell boredom through internet lulz, trolling and karma addiction.

       Freenet allows you to use Frost and FMS which are decent discussion mediums which tend to be very far away from the mainstream and any corporate interests. I hear Freetalk may be coming out of beta soon™ too....

       Truth is really relative. What you consider acceptable or unacceptable what you think its bullshit and what is truth is all based on your understanding and bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you create a new site you will only impose your own bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides there are plenty of conspiracy sites like above top secret, godlike productions and so on..(don't ask me about them since I don't follow them)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also its criminally naive to think there won't be agents on your new site, EVERYONE gets the agents, heck you could be an agent yourself trying to destabilize r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if your site would have 100% no censorship all that would do is get spammed with endless bullshit.

       might be okay except they don't have a straight politics section. They are a conspiracy forum but when I post or read on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       I am after the truth, not fantasies. You don't see anything here about ghosts or pure nonsense. What is on conspiracy is mostly true stuff or might be true, It's credible.
       <a href="http://buzzflash.net/">
        Buzzflash.com
       </a>
       has a politics section you can post to but nothing else and its all mainstream stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more reddit is being taken over and being made to conform to corporate media. They are trying to shake it out so by the election next year they will have total control.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the mods used to work against right wing and industry voting groups, now they work with them, are part of them. Politics is fully censored now. Any extreme leftie stuff is banned. The mods will even add votes to make something rise to the top. Like this:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/is09d/rconspiracy_i_think_we_need_to_move_to_something/c266akl">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/is09d/rconspiracy_i_think_we_need_to_move_to_something/c266akl
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He would never have gotten more than a couple of votes in conspiracy until lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this reaching #1 on the front page:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/irb53/i_love_reddit_to_death_but_sometimes_i_think/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/irb53/i_love_reddit_to_death_but_sometimes_i_think/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, not unless the mods gave it 1600 votes to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you can find someplace better I'd love to go there. If I won the lottery I'd set up a new reddit just like the old reddit.

       I think people take r/Conspiracy as a joke. There is no place on the internet that cares about us. Or anyone, we do what we can with what we have. If created I'll navigate away and come check it out, but damn the man.

       I think that's the jist of your post. People are too easily swayed by their already formed opinions when they encounter something that's contradictory to their established belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like what's happening here, create your own subreddit (r/trueconspiracy or something along those lines). That'd be one of the better solutions; evading confrontation isn't the best way to go about it.

       And none of the points you brought up have any relevance to your argument. Just because there is a hive mind and pack mentality doesn't negate the fact that you said you have seen interesting things over the last year. Also you claim that Conde Naste is imposing censorship and control only to be backed up by stupid paranoid illogical assumptions. Its people who blurt baseless shit like you who give conspiracy theories a bad name.

       Thank you for posting. Preach on, brother.  I was moved by your post so I made sure to forward this to some friends.  They indicated that your position has been noted and the appropriate groups have been 'alerted' (whatever the hell that means) - they assured me repeatedly that all future posts posts under your account will receive special attention and that your unique perspective won't fall upon deaf ears or be downvoted into oblivion.

       What kind of conspiracy theorist are you if you're going to take your ball elsewhere? That's not fighting the "hive mind" that's giving up for greener pastures. Whats next? Going to give up and go for easier to prove conspiracy theories? If you surround yourself with people that think and agree with everything you say with no arguments then you will only hear one side of anything. Take the trolling with a grain of salt but anyone giving you any real feedback for or against treasure them.

       No matter where intelligent conspiracy discussions go on, there will be assholes and if the site gets big enough, there will be people trying to use mis-information.  I used to use the David Icke forum but now it's full of both, assholes and misinformers.

       "Tinfoil" could be construed as a Southern dialectal term for "aluminum foil", and possibly, he associated the excessive use of the word "fuck" with people who hail from limited gene pools. However, I say that, based on only the comment above, nothing leads an outsider to believe that you are inbred or Southern. Perhaps a troll, as your post did fit the accepted definition of the word.

       Given the unlimited nature of human stupidity I actually thought that you might have been serious.... that is, not a troll.

      <p>
       Given your troll post, either "troll or an inbred southern dumbfuck" seem to be, I think correctly, the two most likely groups that you belong too.

       Whoa Leave X files out of this that show is awesome. Not that I completely disagree with you but what does ones thoughts on conspiracy theories have to do with their social worth. Are you insinuating that anyone on this sub is a useless body incapable of living on their own supporting themselves or their family with a job. You my friend are no better your judgmental troll behavior does way more damage to this site than he ever did. Drop the superiority complex man it is not making you look as cool as you think it is. That being said OP is over reacting a bit in my opinion but then again expecting the normal go with the flow on a sub dedicated to thinking outside the box makes me the dense one.

       One's thoughts don't have bearing on their social worth, they reflect it.  I consider people that don't think critically (and by critically I mean understanding occam's razor while using REASON to deduce reasonable hypotheses, not creating a story and cherry picking observations to back it up) to have a character flaw that shows they are incapable of reasonable thought.  Being incapable of reasonable thought makes you ineligible to do jack-all but hang on while society keeps you from dying because someone decided way back it wasn't ok to let the stupid die off.

       That's a lot of assumptions to make based upon the user stating that censorship of a company owned website convolutes the integrity of the site. While I don't agree with all of the things you stated as legitimate conspiracies far fetched in my mind as well  this is not the issue at hand. Either way I think whoever does post these things probably interests more people than you jumping into a conversation you obviously could care less about just to demean people and throw out blanket stereotypical comments. It's not constructive or interesting it's just you being a dick and you seem intelligent enough to see you should be holding yourself to a higher standard than making jokes about living in a mothers basement.

       And if that's not enough now they're censoring you!  Cuz you know the truth, man!  And the MAN won't let you tell it!  Its everywhere, man, in the media, on the internet, fuck man, I bet if you post something here about the Illuminati they'll be reading your fucking mail and digging through your trash!  Dude, dude.. dude.. no, hold on a sec, let me finish this before I hit the bong.. dude.. I'll tell ya what we gotta do man.  We gotta all get together and go somewhere else, dude, let's go where "THE MAN" isn't and nobody can censor us!  We'll never let them take down the truth there, dude.

       On some scale I agree, but the do not go into detail with indeterminate sections, frames, trusswork, etc. Most statics classes will focus on the major's core curriculum. There are just so many examples to go over, there really isn't enough time to hit all the basics that statics covers, let alone structural analysis. In my statics class I never felt like we hit those topics enough. We had to skip over some of the mechanical questions because there wasn't enough time (fuck plier questions, i don't know you bastards did that). Even in structural analysis I did not feel competent enough in some areas. I think solids was one of the best classes I took, but again, it covered the basics - strees, strain, torque, bearing, shear, moment, fillets, axial compression, moments of inertia. Most of our examples were on tangs and other mechanically inclined shapes. Even in concrete and steel design, we covered the material that was quite basic. I could have taken advanced concrete and steel classes, a second structural class and still not feel comfortable with the complexities. Obviously this is why we rely on computing power for indeterminate sections, which you already know. We study how to make things go up, not how they go down. I don't fully understand the principles of failure other than the fact that we know factors at which they fail, and then design accordingly. All of our code design is empirical evidence and they are still working on improving such working design principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in the concrete and steel design classes will you cover relevant ductility, compressive and tensile failures. If you don't, you simply won't know about things as simple as the Whitney Stress Block, which is fundamental to even start a conversation on concrete columns and beams.

       You may only need statics/mechanics/materials to know physically how a beam fails, but this does not at all mean you know how building systems work.  There is a lot more going on than any run of the mill engineer is knowledgeable about. There is a reason you have to do an extra two day test to get your SE after your PE as a Structural.
