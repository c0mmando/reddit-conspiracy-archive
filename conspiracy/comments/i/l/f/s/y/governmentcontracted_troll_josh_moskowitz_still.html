       don't forget the other anti-conspiracy, anti-truth, anti-RonPaul, anti-freedom trolls: herkimer, nonolibertarians, facehammer, NotCOINTELPROAgent, backpackwayne, Fountainhead, etc. They may not be as stalkerish as jcm, but they  still work hard to spread propaganda and attack anybody who disagrees with them.

       Why can't Moskowitz defend himself? No, he has to send out his butt buddies every time he gets called out.

       EDIT: Look on the links section on the right hand-side. It links directly to his Reddit troll account. Also look at his friends lists, these guys are long-time Digg trolls, part of an infamous group called "The Bury Brigade." There's been countless posts on this.

       I've never been banned from anything. I don't have an account on Digg and I don't have any need for different accounts here.

       Maybe this is answered elsewhere, but what constitutes personal information? If I post a link to a user profile on another website like digg, is that less personal than posting a link to a user profile on myspace or facebook? Or is it similarly disallowed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if instead of posting a link, I tell people to look up the person's username on digg or pipl? If I tell them that this user is a known troll or does bad things, and they can see the evidence on the digg site, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point is information on the internet personal, and at what point is it public?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I send people links or quotes from previous conversations on reddit about a user? Is that personal information? If I post a collection of links to discussions about how user X is a troll or shill or astroturfer or whatever, all hosted on reddit where any user can view them, not published by me, is that posting personal information? Or if I submit a list of suspected sockpuppet accounts for a user?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you DO have a troll problem on here, and they make a huge fuss whenever someone tries to expose them or educate others about them. I just want to know the limits of what I can do to help educate people about them without getting myself banned. I know you've suggested posting in reportthespammers, but that isn't going to help the people who browse r/conspiracy if they never visit r/reportthespammers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I am curious about whether radioactivemilk was given a warning before he had his account removed. As you can see, I'm a little fuzzy on what constitutes a rule violation, so if I screw something up I don't want to be banned without the chance to remove my offending post or without knowing that my action was a rule violation. I know you didn't ban radioactivemilk from reddit, but somehow I doubt that the admins will listen to me if I try to talk to them. So anything you know about this stuff, I'd appreciate hearing it.

       My rule of thumb is this: if they haven't posted the information on reddit, it's personal info. Links to someone's livejournal or whatever with the exact same username as their reddit username is a gray area -- while not really the source of any new information, it is often just an invite to go harass that person. The only exception I would make there is if someone was like "holy shit check out this redditor's really cool deviant art, I love it!" and even then, it's polite to ask permission first.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a troll problem, tell admins about it. Trying to whip up a vigilante mob by trying to "expose" what they do outside of reddit is absolutely not acceptable. And I hate to say this, but
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       tends to be filled with people that...well, see conspiracy in everything. People tend to make a bigger deal out of nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other thing is there's a difference between being a disagreeable jerk and harassing other users. If I go into every Israel/Palestine thread and ardently argue for one side for whatever reason, I am not of the opinion that we should be banning users for that. If people start harassing users while doing so, then we have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see how this very thread was pretty clearly harassment of another user. Doesn't matter what the justification is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, radioactivemilk was given a kind of warning: the rules of reddit are made explicit in the links at the bottom and the admins have made this policy clear several times over in various blog posts.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Ispostingpersonalinformationok">
        Check it out, yo.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this is not something I did. Only admins can do this kind of thing, and they kind of run the site. So it's the people that run reddit who are doing this, not some regular old mod user.

       Did you get the feeling that radioactivemilk was trying to invite people to harass NotCOINTELPROAgent by posting his almost identical digg username+link? Or by posting the link to the youtube page for hortnon who is a member of their troll club? Because I didn't, but I could be looking at it from too narrow of a perspective. I inferred that he was trying to show that they have an extensive history of trolling and spreading propaganda, and are infamous on other sites on the internet, as sort of mini-celebrities.

       Education and exposition is not calling for vigilantism. It's disingenuous to imply that it is. Would you argue that the post which is on the front page at this very moment which lists ostensible spammers' usernames is an attempt to whip up vigilantism? The admins surely have seen it, and have not removed it. I would say that this is a double standard.

       Yes of course a good portion of the people who regular r/conspiracy are going to be more prone to paranoia and sensationalism. Are we going to be nannies to them? Keep them from seeing things which don't necessarily break the rules but which they might react irrationally toward?

       I took a look at the link you posted about personal information. Here is the text:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Is posting personal information ok?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        NO. Reddit is a pretty open and free speech place, but it is not ok to post someone's personal information, or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people and certain individual information, including personal info found online is often false. Such posts or comments may be removed by moderators or admins. Repeated offenders may be banned. Posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of some company is probably fine, but don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or vote up obvious vigilantism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Radioactivemilk did not post a link to anybody's facebook page. He posted:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         publicly visible comments on reddit from jcm267
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         link to a digg page with an almost identical username as NotCOINTELPROAgent
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to a youtube page with an almost identical username as NotCOINTELPROAgent
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to a youtube page which uses the exact same name as jcm267 uses on reddit
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to their troll reddit where they upvote each other to counter the downvotes their trolling other reddits gets them
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to another youtube page listed as jcm267's friend on youtube (who shares the same name as a regular user of their troll subreddit)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to a google search for the three names which showed clearly their infamous status as internet trolls and propagandist mini-celebrities.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a link to pipl.com when asked how the facebook identity was verified.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, which of these is personal information? None of them are facebook. None of them are mailing addresses, phone numbers, email, or anything that does not share publicly available usernames (or very slight variants) that they regularly use on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if these are personal information, then I hope that radioactivemilk was given a more explicit warning than the link you provided me which I quoted.

Is it only different or special because the person himself arrived and left comments about the facebook page (which I agree WAS inappropriate - but that was nononoluciferians, not radioactivemilk's doing)
       </p>

        A public figure from another site is not a redditor. We're concerned with harassment of redditors, or with private information of that public figure being posted on reddit. You can talk about the public figure's public actions, but you can't talk about private information you've discovered.
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="/r/worstof">
         /r/worstof
        </a>
        is concerned with reddit actions only. Again, the "outside" distinction.

      <p>
       Read the rule again:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but it is not ok to post someone's personal information, or post links to personal information.
        <strong>
         This includes
        </strong>
        links to public Facebook pages
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Facebook pages were an
       <em>
        example
       </em>
       . That is not an exhaustive list of things you cannot post. That was a shit load of personal pages you posted, and I think you should look at that list again and realize that list is an
       <em>
        incrimination
       </em>
       , not a
       <em>
        defense.
       </em>
       Guess what? Facebook pages are often publicly available when people use their reddit username as their Facebook URL.
       <em>
        Just because you can guess someone's account name on another side doesn't mean it's not personal information.
       </em>
       If my username was my full name, you're not allowed to post my phone number and claim "IT WAS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE."
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes down to this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or vote up obvious vigilantism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those links were obviously intended to invite harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and did you miss the part where radioactivemilk
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ilfsy/governmentcontracted_troll_josh_moskowitz_still/c24tyf7?context=3">
        thanked someone for posting his Facebook?
       </a>
       His intention was clearly to post as much information as he could about this person.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Did you remove his posts, or did the admins? I know you could not have shadowbanned him or edited his post. But you could have removed his comments. I'm not holding you accountable for admin actions, but I do want to know the extent of your involvement.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I removed his comments because that is my job. I alerted the admins as to the situation, and judging by their action, I am confident I made the correct decision.

      <p>
       That was not the intent I inferred at all. It seems like you are assuming a bit much. Why would calling attention to trolls or propagandists be only for downvote brigades? Do you not value education so that people can learn what a troll or propagandist does so their actions can be countered in an intelligent and polite manner?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. I can understand where you are coming from. I wish that you weren't such a dick about trying to express it. I just think that you're ignoring the problem by focusing on a technicality. It's apparent to me that these guys are a problem. I wish that you would do something to help us to sort it out in a constructive manner and not just censor and ridicule the people who subscribe to r/conspiracy. It's a little disheartening. I can understand though if you moderate a lot of reddits and don't have time to invest in helping us figure out what to do about them and these call-out submissions that pop up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think your name-phone#/username-facebook analogy is quite applicable here. Digg and youtube are not facebook. I understood that facebook was just one example. Digg and youtube are different kind of websites, similar to reddit. I guess it's clear now that removing those links were your actions, not the admins. That's comforting to a certain extent.

       It may be obvious to you, it just doesn't follow for me. I could see if he said "go downvote these guys because they don't deserve to be blah blah blah". and the bit about the traitors being killed was kind of extreme. I'm kind of glad that part was removed. I just don't get how the other comments were bad. Anyway, sorry for being so dense and bothering you. Thanks for sharing what you did.

       What was radioactivemilk's ultimate goal? If it was to get him kicked off for being a "troll", there's no point: we aren't going to do anything unless there is harassment, and in that case, a link to the reddit posts is all you need to post.

       No..., it's the posting of personal information that I am pointing out here. That is not allowed in any way or form. I love a good fight and you are welcome to call me any name in the book. But after the conversation is over you need to let it go. Not go out and make more posts to declare what an asshole this person is. I have never done that and I never will. That's just childish. And posting personal information is being vindictive and is one of the prime directive no-nos on this site. I have never done that to anyone.

       In one instance that I saw, it was reported and removed. Other instances have gone unaddressed. No one is making excuses, but if you have a problem with people getting their personal info posted because of petty online political bickering, then you have a problem with jcm267.

       agreed 100%. Maybe you can convince jcm267 and his buddies of this point. If not, you need to take a closer look at who you are in bed with here, because they may not be playing by the same rules as you.

       You know I bet you'd get along just well with the nutcases I have been dealing with over the past few days.  You know according to one of the idiots you quoted I'm working for CENTCOM, according to

       I'm a member of the Rothschild family. Now, radioactivemilk, according to you I'm some guy named Josh C Moskowitz and I deserve the death penalty for my crimes. The crimes you allege me to do are the same "crimes" that you are committing in the very post you are calling for me to be executed.

       You're a paranoid jackass and a hypocrite, radioactivemilk! Go fuck yourself!

       Maybe this is answered elsewhere, but what constitutes personal information? If I post a link to a user profile on another website like digg, is that less personal than posting a link to a user profile on myspace or facebook? Or is it similarly disallowed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if instead of posting a link, I tell people to look up the person's username on digg or pipl? If I tell them that this user is a known troll or does bad things, and they can see the evidence on the digg site, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point is information on the internet personal, and at what point is it public?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I send people links or quotes from previous conversations on reddit about a user? Is that personal information? If I post a collection of links to discussions about how user X is a troll or shill or astroturfer or whatever, all hosted on reddit where any user can view them, not published by me, is that posting personal information? Or if I submit a list of suspected sockpuppet accounts for a user?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you DO have a troll problem on here, and they make a huge fuss whenever someone tries to expose them or educate others about them. I just want to know the limits of what I can do to help educate people about them without getting myself banned. I know you've suggested posting in reportthespammers, but that isn't going to help the people who browse r/conspiracy if they never visit r/reportthespammers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I am curious about whether radioactivemilk was given a warning before he had his account removed. As you can see, I'm a little fuzzy on what constitutes a rule violation, so if I screw something up I don't want to be banned without the chance to remove my offending post or without knowing that my action was a rule violation. I know you didn't ban radioactivemilk from reddit, but somehow I doubt that the admins will listen to me if I try to talk to them. So anything you know about this stuff, I'd appreciate hearing it.
