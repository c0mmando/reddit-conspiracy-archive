<p>In your personal opinion:
What are the scientific/political/social implications of a failed moon mission, such as death of the astronauts?</p>

<p>What if the whole thing was staged to be memorable, full of scripted details, and a true moon landing could not manageable enough to provide the same results?</p>

<p>I am not saying that NASA did not go to the moon, but perhaps there is strong evidence they staged, but for other reasons such as historic value, Alien presence evidence or just too important to fail at a world wide broadcasting. </p>

<p>What are you thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I entertain the idea of Stanley Kubrick having filmed much of the historic footage we&#39;ve seen. However, that was done as a warranty, a backup material in case they couldn&#39;t get real images and had nothing to show the world (specially the russians). There&#39;s an interesting site that goes on with this idea and expands it to &#39;The Shining&#39; having a not-so-obvious confession of him about working on the Apollo 11 project, however I&#39;ve lost the URL. </p>

<p>I recall reading about similar event re-enactments of later Apollo mission, using astronaut puppets on a stage when they couldn&#39;t establish a clear video link. I really think any footage we saw &#39;live&#39; was heavily monitored/censored; no one wanted to see ruins or menacing ships when they planted Old Glory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want the <strong>facts</strong> then read Wag the moon-doogie. It&#39;s a long article series but your questions will be answered. It does not hinge on any &quot;odd shadows&quot; or &quot;weird light sources&quot;. When you see that the Saturn 5 rockets had 5 times more carrying capacity, and was 20 times faster then today&#39;s rockets and that &quot;we&quot; could do stuff in the 60s that is impossible with today&#39;s tech you will see how ridiculous NASAs claims really are. A bit comical really.

<p>I also realized that a far better case could be made than what is currently available on the ‘net.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised actually by how little there is out there – a couple of books by Bill Kaysing and Ralph Rene, a smattering of websites and a variety of YouTube videos of varying quality. Virtually all of the websites and videos tend to stick to the same ground covered by Kaysing and Rene, and they almost all use the same NASA photographs to argue the same points. So too do the sites devoted to ‘debunking’ the notion that the landings were faked, and those sites seem to actually outnumber the hoax sites.</p>

<p>While suffering through the numbing uniformity of the various websites on both sides of the aisle, it became perfectly clear that the hoax side of the debate was in serious need of a fresh approach and some new insights. So I began writing again. Feverishly. That does not mean, however, that I have abandoned the Laurel Canyon series. I intend to get back to it quite soon. </p>

<p>On a personal note, they might have gone to moon, but not in any way shape or form in a chemical rocket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen and read enough data to lean towards what you are proposing, ie bases and things that can not be shown, however I think the question is moot in many ways if there was no missions. Some of the older pictures have been razorblade edited to cut away the horizon and others have data in the deep black that shows strange stuff.
There is a excellent movie called .... exposing the moon or something like that by the mexican ufo guy :) really worth a watch.

<p>Don&#39;t confuse what NASA &quot;can&quot; or &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do based on technology and what is possible to do because of politics.  Unfortunately NASA&#39;s missions are defined by the whims of politicians.  Additionally, lunar missions that are being proposed these days are far more ambitious than the Apollo missions.  There really isn&#39;t much reason to replay the Apollo missions.  If we&#39;re going to go again, we&#39;re going to go to stay, and as such new technology has to be developed the allow for that.  Even then there&#39;s not any real great reason for us to go, so I&#39;d be surprised if we got any manned lunar missions any time soon.</p>

<p>As far as the stuff you are saying about the Saturn V.  It doesn&#39;t make much sense.  Just that you described the Saturn V as being &quot;20 times faster&quot; kinda shows you have no idea what you are talking about.  Rockets are usually described in terms of how fast they can go.  But lets look at the numbers.</p>

<p>A trans-lunar manouver will require a speed of 10.4 km/s.  To just get in to low earth orbit you need to be going 7.8 km/s.</p>

<p>So just those two numbers right there should tell you your &quot;20 times faster&quot; figure is meaningless and not related at all to what the Saturn V is capable of doing.  <em>That&#39;s not even twice as fast.</em></p>

<p>That Saturn V <em>does</em> have five times the carrying capacity than the Shuttle, but that&#39;s just to Low Earth Orbit.  Carrying stuff to the moon, the capacity of the Saturn V drops to about 1/3.</p>

<p>The Saturn V was created to do a specific job, and it did it.  I&#39;m not sure why it would be such a huge surprise that other rockets aren&#39;t as powerful, since they aren&#39;t carrying as much stuff, or as far.</p>

How do you keep the scientists who come up with the fake data and science from talking to the &quot;real&quot; scientists who are running the experiments since most of the scientific fields are small and populated by small groups of people who tend to know eachother.  How do you recruit scientists to pull off the fake without tipping off the whole scientific community?  How has the faked science stood up to scrutiny for half a century?  Why have all subsequent scientific inquiries backed up the data collected as being legitimate?</p>

<p>These questions, and more, are always ignored by the moon hoax nutters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe what you say is quite possible.</p>

<p>the alternative science history lists several figures who have made enough technical contribution that it needn&#39;t be a chemical rocket (at least not completely) tesla, shauberger, keely all invented tech that would  have helped make a moon mission possible.</p>

<p>I am not saying that NASA did not go to the moon, but perhaps there is strong evidence they staged, but for other reasons such as historic value, Alien presence evidence or just too important to fail at a world wide broadcasting.</p>

<p>Well if there are alien spaceship docks and habitat modules and aliens flying around in jetpacks on the moon all they would have to do to &quot;stage&quot; a real video of them on the moon is just go to the &quot;wilderness&quot; of the moon e.g. one of the many parts of the moon uninhabitated. Unless all that alien tech is underground and the moon is a hollow alien Colossus-class battleship.</p>

<p>So even if there is stuff on the moon... I&#39;m pretty sure you would be able to see it with a telescope therefore the moon landing wasn&#39;t a hoax they just kept the footage of the inside of the moon secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a strong case for this, especially when you look at the reactions of some of the astronauts involved in it.   It also accounts for the scepticism of some who have looked over the images/footage provided by NASA - there seem to be signs of tampering in some cases.  </p>

<p>This sort of washing of the data before releasing to the public was a part of what Gary Mckinnon said he found, based on stories from the Disclosure Project event in 2001.   </p>

<p>If you listen to the astronauts, they&#39;re generally pretty clearly changed from the experience, for what that&#39;s worth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What if the whole thing was staged to be memorable, full of scripted details, and a true moon landing could not manageable enough to provide the same results?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest problem with this is that the &quot;script&quot; is full of very unmemorable mundane moments.  The level of detail in what they were doing on the moon is staggering.  Those who try to push the idea that it was faked never go in to much detail about what they were doing there.  The moon missions, especially the later ones, were scientific endeavors.  They were up there doing stuff other than standing by the flag and playing golf.  The &quot;photo-op&quot; stuff was pretty rare compared to the normal scientific stuff.  There&#39;s hours and hours and hours of footage you can watch and most of it isn&#39;t very interesting at all.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make much sense that they would fake the missions and then produce such a massive library of materials documenting the mission (and thus documenting the fake)  Every bit of fake evidence can and will be turned around to expose the fake.</p>

<p>But through ten thousand photos and hundreds of hours of video, not one continuity error pops up.  Your average well-done hollywood movie will have dozens of continuity errors just in two hours.</p>
