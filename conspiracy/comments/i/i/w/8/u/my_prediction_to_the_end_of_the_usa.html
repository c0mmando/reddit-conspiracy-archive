       sometime in June or July of next year there will be a suitcase nuke go off in the middle of the country, most likely in a telecommunications hub city such as Kansas city or st. Louis at which point it will be blamed to an act of terror and martial law will go into effect. the main reason for being in a hub city would be to divide the east and west coast such that neither knew what was happening. comments on this thought are appreciated.

       Israel probably has some of the missing Russian suitcase nukes and has secretly taken the US hostage.  Any other country like Israel would be heavily sanctioned but instead they get billions in aid every year and American outsourced jobs and control of the White House.

       went missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could already be planted in different places around the US and the country is secretly held hostage.

       What will come first, financial collapse or suitcase nuke detonation?

       There IS a lot of nuclear terrorism going on... but this honestly is not the big problem because people know about nuclear bombs so they are not a good covert weapon of mass destruction.  People don't know that the US can control weather and so they are using this tool.  It's basically a weapon of mass destruction with built in plausible deniability.  They are using it to flood the midwest and as many as 16 nuclear power plants.

       This is a good link to get caught up on the weather control technology.

       Russia has claimed 84 are missing, but that does not mean they actually are. It is actually more likely they are assigned to black ops where deniability is a necessity upon implementation. The US simply ignores the treaty and makes micro-nukes in secret for it's similar operations. Under the circumstances, all the talk about the missing Russian nukes should really be taken as war-on-terrror propaganda. Unfortunately, the missing Russian nukes ruse gives the US plausible deniability when it chooses to nuke its own people in a false flag operation as well.

       I could very well see a civil war erupting in this country if things keep going the way they are.  A bunch of disgruntled, high ranking soldiers stealing weapons and ammo and going on the offensive.  That honestly may be the only way things will change.  That's how the U.S. was formed, ordinary citizens tired of oppression from people who were taking advantage.

       Are you saying that if someone destroyed one hub in one city in the middle of the country that would eliminate all communications between the two sides of the country? For one thing, that would never happen, because telecom has many routes it can take to maintain communications. Also, did you know that there are millions of people in the middle of the country? Would they be cut off from the coasts as well? This idea is silly and you are very misinformed.

       that's why they are getting out, look up insider sell/buy ratio, they are selling shares/bonds at a rate of like, 2000 to one,

       the bond market is completely controlled, the federal debt just gets flipped to the federal reserve, it's just printing money, but people don't get it.

       Bonds don't mean shit if you completely tank the dollar relative to the rest of the world, and inflation starts to run rampant, which will happen if you go bankrupt.  They're a good investment for the long term if the country is stable but in a collapse situation bonds could become virtually worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to protect yourself in this situation is to be completely divested from the USA, but in todays economic markets that's virtually impossible and highly improbable that these guys are interested in letting that happen.

       bonds are the government debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the government didn't issue bonds then they couldn't have debt, government debt is called bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       bonds are the dollar.. bond real return rates are already negative with stated inflation, if the government keeps  interest rates low, which they have to since raising the interest rate would create an infinite feed back loop of debt and hyperinflation..
      </p>
      <p>
       the debt is unmanageable, and eventually investment bankers who manage mutual funds (think retirement savings accounts) won't roll the debt, and the american government won't sell bonds, hence, their credit card will be denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why the federal reserve is buying bonds through the TBTF banks (backdoor digital money printing), because if they didn't then we would face immediate hyperinflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       they will do this for as long as they can, and they are doing it so that the elites can consolidate their holdings in land and commodities, in safe locations that can't be touched by america.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's really pretty simple.

       really? "they" don't give a shit and have the ability to go wherever they want in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       globalists have no loyalty to any country, to them we're all the same, just sheep to be fleeced, the bankruptcy would allow for beautiful buying opportunities from now destitute metro areas, the elite who got out of the dollar and fiat in general would be able to make every bridge in america a toll bridge, every municipal water supply a private enterprise, the buying opportunities on the infrastructure would be multigenerational(as in sustain a ruling family for hundreds of years potentially) carve the whole mess up into fiefdoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       think: the end of democratic representation, full privatization at the hands of the world economic elite.

       The "they" I'm talking about are the republicans who can't all abandon the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely understand that it's possible, and those are the end goals potentially,  but why do you need an end of democratic representation when you have a largely misinformed uninterested population who keep voting for what you want anyway?  Why do you need full privitization when you control the private and public resources anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, they're already getting what they want,  why go through a revolution to have almost the same thing?

       I don't get what you're saying, the government is meaningless.

       the republicans and democrats are both owned by private interests, it's all theater to distract the masses before enslavement..
      </p>
      <p>
       they shifted the global industrial base to places where people will accept less, now americans are largely meaningless, so they will be starved back into subservience so that they will sell their land and protections.. think natural parks, there's profit to be made stripping them.

       When they raise their debt ceiling, the debt they borrow will have to be at a higher interest rate because of the loss of confidence in the USA's ability to pay it back. Since we couldn't pay it before, we certainly can't pay it later when in interest is even higher than a rate that we couldn't handle in the first place. Therefore more debt at a higher interest to stay afloat, more and more etc etc. We're fucked!

       Same area of the country, though instead of a nuke; think cascade of events. You've got the New Madrid fault system, along with the Mississippi/ Missouri rivers which by last count had about 30 dams up river spillways closed, filled to the brim, with 5 feet of snow melt runoff to come. Not to mention the ft Calhoun and cooper facilities. Location and intent are correct, your timeline though is this summer not next, and the means, well ask uncle Sam.

       I don't think this is a half-bad theory.  There is a lot of evidence that 'some event' in the area you describe for the reasons you state is likely to occur.  My only thought is that instead of a communications hub it would be at a Nuclear Facility.  Either one is supportable, however.
