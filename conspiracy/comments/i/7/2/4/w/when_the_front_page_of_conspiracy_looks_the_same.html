    <div class="md"><p>I remember in high school when we were talking about voting, and I got weird looks when I said the whole thing was a scam because the machines are manipulated and a private company, not the government, counts the votes. One girl was like &quot;wow, you ACTUALLY believe that!?&quot; And then I got rude comments after, with people asking me if I believe in UFO stories and shit. Of course, the high school I went to was a private upper middle class establishment so these fools obviously didn&#39;t care about the truth or even questioning their stance in life because they were content with daddy&#39;s money. Say what you will about college kids, but since I&#39;ve gone on to college I&#39;ve found a more interested audience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Daddy&#39;s money.. that&#39;s about it. Today&#39;s society by and large are fed their information through 30-second soundbytes that rarely tell the entire story. One of the biggest testaments as to the mass spellcasting was when the bin Laden story was put out there, which was essentially the next chapter in the farce known as the War on Terror™. All of those people, out in the street cheering based on that ridiculous story. But that&#39;s the environment we live in, so to them that is normal and acceptable. Sad really. And I agree too about the whole voting thing. What a sham that is.</p>

<p>seriously...my wife and i heard the bin Laden news on the radio when we were lying in bed one morning, we both looked at each other and were like &#39;do they seriously expect to believe that they just threw the body overboard and there is no evidence?&#39;</p>

<p>I mean, where is the video from the head cameras of the troops who actually entered the Bin Laden house and killed Bin Laden? Why haven&#39;t we seen it? And why did they get rid of the body in such absurd haste? Does that make sense to anyone? That they would dump the body at sea? But what are we to do, when those who know won&#39;t say?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a giant bullshit campaign. No raid, no <em>anything</em>. We know this because of the pathetically fake evidence. Photo shopped picture? Bin Laden &#39;watching himself&#39; on TV? No body? Mass media pushing the story relentlessly? This is, as I said, the next chapter in their War on Terror™. They needed a new bad guy, so they &#39;killed&#39; the old one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t care whether or not bin Laden&#39;s dead. He&#39;s been rather irrelevant for years, someone less well known has been directing the jihadist operation behind the scenes. He&#39;s an excuse for the government&#39;s illegal activity, if anything. It is quite amusing that the press and the sheep have so conveniently forgotten that the reason we&#39;ve been having military intervention in the Middle East (or at least what the government claimed) for the past decade was to hunt him and his organization down (funny how even their made-up erason is still full of bullshit)....yet there&#39;s no sign of them pulling out. In fact, when the government promised we would be pulled out several years ago, we pick a new fight with Libya. The media relies on our tendency to forget, too bad not everyone does. Whoops!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I respect your opinion, I think you need to look at the bigger picture.  While an abuse cop is a very personal and very real situation, the amount of damage to an entire cause as the result of extremists is unmeasurable.  </p>

<p>An abusive police officer can usually have some level of justice levied against them (in theory, but not in practice these days).  But when you start feeding the fire of doubt, heresy, and austrocism with copious amounts of ill fated extremists, there is no way to control the damage, let alone even see the full extend of the damage completed.</p>

<p>I agree that an abusive cop is an issue, and a large one at that.  Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe, abusive police are being utilizied to draw attention away from actual world events / issues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>What is that exactly? Saying that they run the media? Every Hollywood studio? Finance? Over-representation in government? Saying that AIPAC controls foreign policy of the US? Is that hatred?</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s stating the obvious, which -- let&#39;s face it -- Jews know as well as anybody else. They aren&#39;t stupid. But they are like professional wrestlers. They won&#39;t admit to what everybody knows. Their determination to deny the nuclear stockpile of Israel is a good example of this tendency. Everyone knows about it, but Israel won&#39;t admit it. Similarly, everyone with any sense knows that Jews control the media, have bought the Senate and Congress, and control American finance, but Jews won&#39;t admit to this control.</p>

<p>They say absurd things such as, &quot;But Mr. X is in Wall Street and he&#39;s not a Jew.&quot; I can&#39;t even be bothered to refute anything so foolish. Or they say &quot;So-and-So is a movie producer at Paramont, and he&#39;s not a Jew.&quot; As if that has anything at all to do with the basic premise that Jews run the media.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve come to accept is that it is useless to even talk about these crucially important matters with Zionist Jews, because almost to a man they are unwilling to discuss them honestly. They come forth with the same boring talking points which are designed to be as bullet proof as possible, and to mislead and confuse those who don&#39;t know the issues. I try to put the message out for those who may be open to it, and who may not have considered it seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the distinction is the Zionists (notice I didn&#39;t say jews) that do the things you&#39;ve cited are not synonymous with the entire religion/race of Jews, tho they try their darndest to make people think they are. They don&#39;t even give a fuck about the average Jew, they just hide behind cries of anti-semitism and the masses of Jews in the world to keep people from criticizing them. It&#39;s Jew hatred when people are derogatory to the entire race/religion/whatever because a group of people at the top fuck it up for the rest of them. And again, the best part is it&#39;s debatable whether any Zionists are even Jewish, surely there are plenty that aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I&#39;ve been guilty of minor offenses pertaining to what you have said here. Specifically, I have quoted sayings such as &quot;<a href="http://theinfounderground.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=32363&amp;amp;sid=f561cb4c5634190f83227cb4ec222c57">Jew Confetti</a>&quot;, but I assure you I did so in context and with reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic">source of the saying</a>. </p>

<p>That having been said, I am somewhat thankful that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Johnny_Cash">Johnny_Cash</a> decided to take a leave of absence, despite his earning a <a href="http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Reddit">place of prominence in reddit&#39;s entry in encyclopedia dramatica</a>.</p>

<p>I have never been ashamed of the fact that my biggest peeve about global affairs is, specifically, the international banksters (i.e., the Rothschild empire). One relatively infamous conspiracy theorist was very explicit in clarifying, specifically, what the issue is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpRewsrcmBE">Rothschild Zionism</a>. &lt;-- I was very pleased that he finally stopped hiding behind &quot;codespeak&quot; (i.e., reptilian alien overlords) in this presentation. He even (in the first 2 minutes) clarifies that one does not have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. This kind of clarification brings forth the heart of the matter that there <em>are</em> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Jews+against+Zionism&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=DUa&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;prmd=ivns&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=vid">Jews who oppose Zionism</a>.</p>

<p>Summary: Jews aren&#39;t the bad guys. Zionist banksters, however, <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>vs. saying that &#39;they&#39; run the media or the entertainment industry or the banking industry</p>

<p>there are certainly a lot of Jewish individuals in those industries, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re all part of some grand Zionist conspiracy</p>

<p>if you can&#39;t make this distinction then you&#39;re just a racist bigot i guess</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first story fulfills <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy">the requirements of a conspiracy</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cabal, an association between religious, political, or tribal officials to further their own ends, usually by intrigue</li>
<li>Conspiracy (civil), an agreement between persons to deceive, mislead, or defraud others of their legal rights, or to gain an unfair advantage</li>
<li>Conspiracy (crime), an agreement between persons to break the law in the future, in some cases having committed an act to further that agreement</li>
<li>Conspiracy (political), the overthrow of a government</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that the second does, although it reflects a lack of care for health hazards and the resulting misery inflicted upon others. And the third is merely a symptom of some of the problems-at-large. These types and arrangements of actions and events have long been hypothesized, and though we can&#39;t trust everything we see in the media, it&#39;s good to see the occasional genuine recognition of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because the conspiracies are reaching a critical mass with consciousness; i.e. there are so many in plain sight they are no longer really <del>conspiracies</del> theories.</p>

<p>EDIT for clarification :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just a result of more and more things coming together within the globalist agenda. We are going to see more and more of it over the next year and a half. I don&#39;t think this will change the apathy of most Americans at all though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>like the stories about the cocaine users who&#39;s flesh is rotting off in the US : <a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/news-to-me/2011/06/23/flesh-eating-cocaine-reported-in-new-york-l-a/">http://blogs.ajc.com/news-to-me/2011/06/23/flesh-eating-cocaine-reported-in-new-york-l-a/</a> </p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/krokodil-the-drug-that-eats-junkies-2300787.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/krokodil-the-drug-that-eats-junkies-2300787.html</a></p>

<p>and when I think about the heroin users in Russia who just recently started a new kind of drug where their flesh rots off, i heard a book called Bloodlands. it&#39;s about the really bad cannibalism that happened </p>

<p>then i wonder about the CDC zombie emergency plan and about the new army manual about zombies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember in high school when we were talking about voting, and I got weird looks when I said the whole thing was a scam because the machines are manipulated and a private company, not the government, counts the votes. One girl was like &quot;wow, you ACTUALLY believe that!?&quot; And then I got rude comments after, with people asking me if I believe in UFO stories and shit. Of course, the high school I went to was a private upper middle class establishment so these fools obviously didn&#39;t care about the truth or even questioning their stance in life because they were content with daddy&#39;s money. Say what you will about college kids, but since I&#39;ve gone on to college I&#39;ve found a more interested audience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t count the tin-foilers in the &quot;harmless&quot; bin.  Between the stigma they have given all the free thinkers and the extremes some have gone through to prove their point, they are equally as damaging as an abusive cop.  It may not be physical abuse, but abuse none the less.</p>
