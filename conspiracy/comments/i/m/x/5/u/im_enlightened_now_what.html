        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ok, you got me... I&#39;m not actually claiming to be enlightened. But I do have a question..</p>

<p>What happens when someone gathers data and is in &#39;the know&#39; regarding a decent amount of conspiracies, truths and knowledge. Just for example let&#39;s say this includes concepts of:</p>

<ol>
<li>New world order (or just the concept of a minority controlling the majority) and everything that entails (quite a few conspiracy theories fall under this one btw)</li>
<li>The UFO cover-up and also the possibility of E.T contact.<br/></li>
<li>Theories into how mankind came about, life on earth and interests in cosmology which may include an individual belief of how what and why the universe is.</li>
<li>The real power of the human mind and the human condition. This can include spiritual teachings, neuroscience,  meditation and life disciplines such as kaizen. </li>
<li>Capable in dealing with disinformation and premature conclusions. Such as not labelling a <em>group</em> evil or good without thorough information. </li>
<li>Dynamic understanding of world affairs. This would include the ability to see things in the news and media or internet and be able to see through them to some degree. i.e. see the bigger picture. And this could also include some foresight ability to predict to some degree the direction things are going in.</li>
<li>The ability to think abstract and have knowledge of systems theory. Some understanding of singularity, oneness etc. </li>
<li>Grand perception, accepting ignorance and understanding that there is always more to know and better to be. This includes the dance between the left and right brain, open mindedness and cynical thinking.</li>
</ol>

<p>What next?
Now what? </p>

<p>I reckon given the information revolution someone can watch a video on New York City on youtube, then before then know it there&#39;s <em>9-11 inside job</em> in the related videos. Once someone clicks on that, there&#39;s potentially a life altering chain or research they can conduct like a chain reaction. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always <strong>spreading awareness</strong> but what other things would you guys say you could do? How can you take action? Are you powerless? What can be done? I&#39;d be very appreciative of any suggestions, thanks. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks for the replies! Just wanted to state I&#39;m not american I&#39;m from the UK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. You can go out and devote your life to expose conspiracies and protest at Bilderberg meets and plaster posters on the street... AND you can also lead a decent, honest life, always remembering and taking into consideration the reality behind the curtain, knowing how the public is manipulated and refusing to participate in those lies, refusing to fall for the easy traps of fear, fake patriotism, ignorance. Don&#39;t wear a tinfoil hat, but don&#39;t automatically believe the lies, the &#39;everything is OK, we know what we&#39;re doing&#39; spiel of corporations and governments. And instill this sense of healthy skepticism and questioning in your loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My journey down the rabbit hole all started with 9/11 awareness. Once you see the blatant deception behind that it is very difficult to stop there. The conditioned paradigm begins to unravel like a ball of yarn the more you look, especially given that you are now immune to the denial that sets in as soon as cognitive dissonance blocks most people&#39;s ability to see the writing on the wall. What i find most fascinating is why some people have the ability to see and accept the disturbing conspiracies that plague humanity while others would rather eat live scorpions that see the obvious truth. It is an intriguing phenomenon but given how powerful the indoctrination machine is, i am relieved and hopeful that there are so many of us who are &#39;awake&#39; despite the fact that we are a small minority. First step in promoting awareness is to get people to turn off their brainwash boxes. You only realize the impact that thing has on the mind when it is no longer part of your life. Find your favourite &#39;truth&#39; documentary and start by sharing that. It will serve as a catalyst to those that are receptive. Being in England, maybe &#39;7/7 The Ripple Effect&#39; might be a good one to start with. All the best and glad you&#39;re on the right side of humanity. I know it can be very disillusioning at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to find the best ways to spread the basic knowledge that we&#39;re being ruled like cattle.  We can&#39;t throw off our shackles without a fair amount of willing people and a coordinated effort.  I&#39;d say that is the priority.  So stuff like putting an end to the Federal Reserve is a good place to start.  You can easily show people its unconstitutional, and a system mean to keep them right way they are.  Simple.  They&#39;ll want more if you can use that to expose the corruption within the Gov&#39;t.  Reveal all secreted info&#39;s into Gov&#39;t activity and it will bring down the house.  Expose the &quot;elite&#39;s&quot; and their efforts to run the world then run them off the map.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not enlightened,  now what?   Now this, Now that.   Chopping wood and carrying water.   Pointing at the bamboo or the moon.   By the way,  a good question to live with is &quot;who&quot; is enlightened or &quot;who&quot; is not enlightened?   You said it yourself in one of your posts:  a balance of looking up through the light pollution and looking at what is at eye level.   I think you would enjoy your countryman Alan Watts if you haven&#39;t already taken a look.   He died in &#39;73 but  there is a weekly <a href="http://www.alanwattspodcast.com/">podcast</a> I think it is put out by his son Mark (ps:  he was not a guru,  just called himself an entertainer and didn&#39;t take on students)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about honoring the truth and exposing the lies. That&#39;s what it comes down to. The crusaders of conspiracy theories of any kind, whether they be plausible political conspiracies or way out there theories about superconsciousness and aliens, are seeking to know the truth, and reveal the truth to others. It&#39;s really quite a noble cause, when you think about it, even if you believe some of the leaders of the conspiracy movement are deluded and mistaken. At least they are trying to discover the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight...you are saying people who seek truth and justice should join ARM (a fictitious group depicted in lousy, govt-made youtube communiques) and take hostages?! Wow, you provocateurs aren&#39;t very subtle these days. Let me guess, then Feebee HRT could roll in and save the day from the &#39;crazed 9/11 truth gunman&#39; and the machine would have a new enemy. Nice try, Man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or YOU and YOUR organization could just kindly stop trying to incite people into behaviour that allows you to get money to prop yourself up and pretend to be protecting people. Stop trying to socially construct deviant conduct, seriously how do you sleep at night? Is the paycheck really worth all the harm you do to your fellow man? Do you like sitting in tha cubicle you&#39;re in? Do you like having your whole personal life tapped for 45k a year? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB don&#39;t need to incite violence, they are plenty capable of pulling it off on their own via false flags when necessary. Maybe you don&#39;t understand the gravity of the situation, they are at war with us, they poison us, lie to us, attack and rob us, but god forbid you use violence for self defense. Peaceful revolution from the ground up is a nice idea...but eventually you have to say No, get your goddamn hands out of my kid&#39;s pants before I blow your fucking brains out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  People who try to expose the corruption in our society are such pathetic losers.  They should just see that there is nothing in this life worth doing besides getting a high-paying job, finding a mate and reproducing!  We need more important people like you spending their precious time in this subreddit to show us the light.  Peer-reviewed science and our inborn faculties of reason will show us that the ruling elites of this world (if they even exist) are not conspiring together to keep the rest of us subjugated in any way whatsoever.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. You can go out and devote your life to expose conspiracies and protest at Bilderberg meets and plaster posters on the street... AND you can also lead a decent, honest life, always remembering and taking into consideration the reality behind the curtain, knowing how the public is manipulated and refusing to participate in those lies, refusing to fall for the easy traps of fear, fake patriotism, ignorance. Don&#39;t wear a tinfoil hat, but don&#39;t automatically believe the lies, the &#39;everything is OK, we know what we&#39;re doing&#39; spiel of corporations and governments. And instill this sense of healthy skepticism and questioning in your loved ones.</p>
