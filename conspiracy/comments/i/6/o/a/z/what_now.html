<p>But, there is a very good chance that some are true, and that the truth has been hidden by a powerful group of conspirators.</p>

<p>What happens now? How should I react? </p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing, the safest thing, is to ignore them, and hope they ignore me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As v0x said there is a very good chance that some of them are true.  I&#39;d even go as far as to say that you&#39;d have to be an utter idiot to not think something was up with a lot of &quot;conspiracies&quot; that I&#39;ve read into. There is a problem though...and v0x said it best with &quot;how can canyone compete with facebook and reality television&quot;. Most people I know don&#39;t seem to give a flying fuck.  They are so concerned with their daily lives and drama and seem to think it has no impact on them while one by one their rights and freedoms are being stripped away from them. Costs of living are rising at an incredible rate, largely in part due to the decisions of our policy makers which have and are being based on a lot of things that can be defined as bullshit and false flags. Yet still so few people seem to care, or have any knowledge of it all, or even want to learn about it. They don&#39;t even ask questions.<br/>
Honestly...the only thing I feel I can do at this point is just sit back and enjoy the ride. Laugh to myself while humanity screws itself out of everything that really makes us human. Good or bad...it&#39;ll at least be an interesting story.</p>

<p>Because people don&#39;t voice opinions already?  Because people aren&#39;t already looking for and sharing whatever &quot;truth&quot; they can find?  Because people are currently ignoring politicians?</p>

<p>agreed; but what does that have to do with anything?  you asked if there were banners on the streets claiming the government is corrupt, I responded that there are plenty of popular people saying that exact thing.  the question I got now is: what&#39;s so special about banners on the streets?</p>

not sure what that means. </p>

<p>&quot;some men just want to watch the world burn.&quot; I don&#39;t, but I want even less to burn it. However, it is burning, or smoldering at least, in a million places. I can&#39;t put it out by myself, and I can&#39;t rely on anyone else to help me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing is to ignore them (that is, the powers that be), and hope they ignore me.</p>

<p>is there anything else to do?</p>

<p>If we voice our opinions and tell the truth instead of ignoring the politicians maybe we can achieve something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because people don&#39;t voice opinions already?  Because people aren&#39;t already looking for and sharing whatever &quot;truth&quot; they can find?  Because people are currently ignoring politicians?</p>

<p>The more and more time I spend evaluating the &quot;truth&quot; movement the more I realize how condescending the whole thing is.  The whole &quot;movement&quot; is based on the presumption that most people are &quot;sheeple&quot;; if you want to preach &quot;truths&quot; you might as well tell everyone you know that they&#39;re a moron and wrong about everything while you&#39;re one of the few that actually knows what&#39;s going on...</p>
