       I do not really know, or care, if any of the conspiracy theories are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there is a very good chance that some are true, and that the truth has been hidden by a powerful group of conspirators.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens now? How should I react?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that the best thing, the safest thing, is to ignore them, and hope they ignore me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to hear how knowing, or suspecting, things about the government has changed your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: i want to thank everyone for being civil.

       The best thing you can do is to try and reach one person at a time, and advise them to do the same.  That's all you can really hope for at this point.  It needs to be much more organic and from the ground up.

       "assemble the masses?" how can i compete, how can anyone compete with facebook and reality television?

       and, supposing I had ten thousand people convinced that nobody had ever been to the moon, then what would I tell them to do?

       if republicans and democrats have not realized that consolidating power would help them both, then they are too incompetent to be worth bothering with. so appeal to existing power is not an option.

       Expose the media, expose the planned genocide, expose the controlled opposition, expose the two party system which are really answering to the same masters, predict things in advance and reel in the people who are disbelievers ... if you can.

       As v0x said there is a very good chance that some of them are true.  I'd even go as far as to say that you'd have to be an utter idiot to not think something was up with a lot of "conspiracies" that I've read into. There is a problem though...and v0x said it best with "how can canyone compete with facebook and reality television". Most people I know don't seem to give a flying fuck.  They are so concerned with their daily lives and drama and seem to think it has no impact on them while one by one their rights and freedoms are being stripped away from them. Costs of living are rising at an incredible rate, largely in part due to the decisions of our policy makers which have and are being based on a lot of things that can be defined as bullshit and false flags. Yet still so few people seem to care, or have any knowledge of it all, or even want to learn about it. They don't even ask questions.
       <br/>
       Honestly...the only thing I feel I can do at this point is just sit back and enjoy the ride. Laugh to myself while humanity screws itself out of everything that really makes us human. Good or bad...it'll at least be an interesting story.

       Because people don't voice opinions already?  Because people aren't already looking for and sharing whatever "truth" they can find?  Because people are currently ignoring politicians?

      <p>
       The more and more time I spend evaluating the "truth" movement the more I realize how condescending the whole thing is.  The whole "movement" is based on the presumption that most people are "sheeple"; if you want to preach "truths" you might as well tell everyone you know that they're a moron and wrong about everything while you're one of the few that actually knows what's going on...

       agreed; but what does that have to do with anything?  you asked if there were banners on the streets claiming the government is corrupt, I responded that there are plenty of popular people saying that exact thing.  the question I got now is: what's so special about banners on the streets?

       Writing a book or making a movie also means that the "person" does something and they're both a physical representation of words; plenty of people write books about the government being corrupt, or go on tv and talk about it, or make "documentaries" about it...

       Right now the big picture isn't important, as it is impossible to discern the full picture of how things are now, let alone how they will be in the future.  "Be the change," said Gandhi, "that you wish to see in the world."  Intent, communication, and kindness will bring about what I think you're searching for, and once you open yourself to it, you'll realize that things aren't nearly as bad as you are sometimes led to believe.

       The more and more time I spend evaluating the "truth" movement the more I realize how condescending the whole thing is.  The whole "movement" is based on the presumption that most people are "sheeple"; if you want to preach "truths" you might as well tell everyone you know that they're a moron and wrong about everything while you're one of the few that actually knows what's going on...
