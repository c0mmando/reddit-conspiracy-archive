        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please bear with me and whether good or bad <strong>PLEASE</strong> let me know your thoughts.  Also, if you don’t have the time to go through the links please don’t downvote this post, if anything you can downvote anything else in my history, I just really want to know what others think about his.</p>

<p>A couple months ago I was listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9RiRfMYVlQ">The <strong>1962&#39;s</strong> The Ultimate Revolution speech by Aldous Huxley</a> (to save time 34:00-the end) and was reminded of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUvGvh2k_Dc">this presentation from Jesse Schell, CEO and Creative Director of Schell Games</a>, ( <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/videos/44277/dice-2010-design-outside-the-box-presentation/">whole version</a> ).  Jesse’s speech always hit a cord with me, since it could be relatively easy to control people’s behaviors through a point system.  Just look at reddit and the amount of karma whores… I kid, I kid… but seriously.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about how the whole “theoretical” “Big Brother” system could be brought about through the Aldous Huxley’s point of view of “learning to love one’s servitude”.   This is when it got weird, I start surfing around and read this serendipitous <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/11/technology/google_android_at_home/?section=money_latest">article</a>.  Google’s new platform seems like it would be the foundation for creating something along the lines of what Jesse Schell was talking about.  The amazing things is this announcement was made in light of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2384751,00.asp">apple &amp; google  getting sued</a> for tracking people with their cell phones, Julian Assange saying that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20059247-17.html">Facebook, Google, and Yahoo are tools for U.S. intelligence</a>, “<strong>supposedly</strong>” Facebook has connections to the CIA <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12685">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=8758">here</a>, and this article &quot;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/05/revised-net-censorship-bill-requires-search-engines-to-block-sites-too.ars?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+Featured+Content%29&amp;utm_content=Netvibes">Revised &#39;Net censorship bill requires search engines to block sites, too</a>&quot;.  From my point of view, it seems everything on the web and in our life is being tied together while non &quot;MSM&quot; sites are going to be stripped.</p>

<p>So, do you think that all of this is just the evolution of technology or there could be a grand conspiracy behind all of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! That&#39;s the real question. Unfortunately I have no direct answer, and it sucks.  Keep spreading the word!?!? Letting people know what going on, but other then that, I really don&#39;t know.  I have a daughter and she is 13.  She is into FB and all of that kind of shit, but I can&#39;t just ban her from it.  I wish it was that easy, if I did she would just resent me and fall more into this kind of shit.  All I can do is point it out and guide her through life and let her know what it was like in the 80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s (for me) before all of this.  Other wise, I hope there is a revolt from all of this, but it seems so like it&#39;s so much easier/convenient to fall in line and accept it.       </p>

Speaking of Alex Jones.....   I just happened to listen to his podcast the day before the Norway incident.  How crazy was it that he predicted that we would see a white terrorist the day before it happened?</p>

For me, I walk around with a smartphone device that contains a webcam/microphone that can be hacked to see and hear me, a GPS to see I am, the internet to track my interest and direct comms and social networks to see who my friends are and what my family looks like on vacation.

<p>Your main question seems to be one of concerted effort versus emergent phenomena.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think this is both. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stygmergy">Stygmergy</a> (Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell et al) leaving behind the mental scaffolding for a scientific dictatorship, and then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_mivWFkSKU">bored people</a> building the prison.</p>

<p>That&#39;s speculation on my part but either way I&#39;d say you&#39;re on to something. </p>

<p>Glad to know someone else was paying attention to the Jesse Schell gamification talk. All Seeing Eye reading the logs? All watched over by machines of loving grace? Your grandchildren are going to be able to learn your username and read this thread. That&#39;s the main thing. </p>

<p>Previously, people would assume their every waking moment was being observed by god, and wrongfulness would result in hell, but this.. This is the real thing and nowhere near as intimidating.
Most of your online actions will be at the fingertips of your descendents <strong>hundreds</strong> of years from now, and they&#39;re going to judge you. Hardly as harsh.</p>

Individual problems can be handled easier by the group or the group could be alerted to a member&#39;s needs. A perfect example of this is finance.

<p>Yes, in some regard, but (for the most part) money is transferred for services rendered.  The point system that Jesse Schell is talking about is more about controlling peoples behaviors.  Although, you see money used in this regard in recycling, tax credits, and coupons for facebook &quot;check in&quot; or getting cheaper insurance for not smoking, it isn&#39;t as precise as getting compensated for brushing your teeth, taking the bus instead of your car, or choosing to walk instead or catching a subway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I actually think it was Nathan Rothschild that said, &quot;I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the Empire, ... The man that controls Britain&#39;s money supply controls the British Empire. And I control the money supply.&quot;</p>

<p>Or </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I think the West helped promote the Arab Spring to drive people&#39;s discontent towards the supported dictators to a new Western backed &quot;democracy,&quot; since the Neo-cons ultimate goal is to democratize the world. Of course this is speculation I am not saying its true just a thought sticking in the back of my mind when the reports came out of Propaganda software to control multiple profiles at one time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! That&#39;s the real question. Unfortunately I have no direct answer, and it sucks.  Keep spreading the word!?!? Letting people know what going on, but other then that, I really don&#39;t know.  I have a daughter and she is 13.  She is into FB and all of that kind of shit, but I can&#39;t just ban her from it.  I wish it was that easy, if I did she would just resent me and fall more into this kind of shit.  All I can do is point it out and guide her through life and let her know what it was like in the 80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s (for me) before all of this.  Other wise, I hope there is a revolt from all of this, but it seems so like it&#39;s so much easier/convenient to fall in line and accept it.       </p>
