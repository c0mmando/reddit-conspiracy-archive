       A couple months ago I was listening to

        The
        <strong>
         1962's

        The Ultimate Revolution speech by Aldous Huxley
       </a>
       (to save time 34:00-the end) and was reminded of
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUvGvh2k_Dc">
        this presentation from Jesse Schell, CEO and Creative Director of Schell Games

        whole version
       </a>
       ).  Jesse’s speech always hit a cord with me, since it could be relatively easy to control people’s behaviors through a point system.  Just look at reddit and the amount of karma whores… I kid, I kid… but seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been thinking about how the whole “theoretical” “Big Brother” system could be brought about through the Aldous Huxley’s point of view of “learning to love one’s servitude”.   This is when it got weird, I start surfing around and read this serendipitous
       <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/11/technology/google_android_at_home/?section=money_latest">
        article
       </a>
       .  Google’s new platform seems like it would be the foundation for creating something along the lines of what Jesse Schell was talking about.  The amazing things is this announcement was made in light of

       Personally, I agree with every issue you just brought up. I do think that this is part of the movement towards a new world order, and a smartphone is just the next step towards having a microchip in your hand. Is there a way around it? not really. Is it convenient? You betcha. Even the more dedicated conspiracy theorists have and use these tools.

       And the microchip will be for your convenience and security. People will ask for them and spend their (points) money to buy them. We will love our servitude just as the OP is pointing toward.  I think all these concepts are relates to a single governing body or "New World Order"

       Interesting theory considering that this year's Bilderberg meeting attendees precisely matched the list of people you would need to make this happen:

      <ul>

         Bill Gates - Microsoft

         Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates

         Eric Schmidt  - CEO of Google.

       Ding! Ding! Ding! That's the real question. Unfortunately I have no direct answer, and it sucks.  Keep spreading the word!?!? Letting people know what going on, but other then that, I really don't know.  I have a daughter and she is 13.  She is into FB and all of that kind of shit, but I can't just ban her from it.  I wish it was that easy, if I did she would just resent me and fall more into this kind of shit.  All I can do is point it out and guide her through life and let her know what it was like in the 80's &amp; 90's (for me) before all of this.  Other wise, I hope there is a revolt from all of this, but it seems so like it's so much easier/convenient to fall in line and accept it.

       Interesting, let me say first, I'm not a huge Alex Jones fan, but a couple year ago, he had a investor on who was doing really well and based all of her investments off of the trends she saw from the conspiracy realm.  Do you or anyone you know follow similar trends in order to have an edge on the competition/markets?

       There's too much bullshit out there in the media to base trades on fundamentals.  I'm a technical trader who occasionally reads the news but rarely lets it decide my trades.   I'd never be able to stay awake this late if I had to stay glued to the news 24/7 on a trading day.

       anyway, 
Speaking of Alex Jones.....   I just happened to listen to his podcast the day before the Norway incident.  How crazy was it that he predicted that we would see a white terrorist the day before it happened?

       We are already in the "gamepocalypse". A few other comments refer to the obvious: money as a scorecard. You mentioned the reddit Karma points system. Everything is connected because it works. The motive is control and profit.

       The individual has to intentionally and selectively disconnect from the matrix. The two hardest things for most people are: stop watching TV; and eat healthy food. If you do not you will be hungry, angry, lonely and tired.

       Figure out what is happening within, without and to you so you do not fear. You are most easily controlled through your emotions.

       Corportions are going to grab as much as they can without being sued out of existence. The US intelligence either infiltrates or investsin these companies to get intelligence. It DOES appear that this is being done in a targetted way to collect intelligence on US citizens in a grnd "Big Brother" control network, but people do appreciate the convenience as long a they ignore or respect the dangers. 
For me, I walk around with a smartphone device that contains a webcam/microphone that can be hacked to see and hear me, a GPS to see I am, the internet to track my interest and direct comms and social networks to see who my friends are and what my family looks like on vacation. I understand the risks but appreciate the convenience...

       Thank you, I hope so.  I currently have two children (one of which is 13) so she gets to hear a slight amount of this... I don't push it on to her to much, I just try to get those gears in her head turning.

       It's funny, because I comment to people that the down fall of our current generation is the fact that they are so willing to air their personal problems/information so willingly on FB.  It's sad because my wife is friends with all of her friends and some of the shit she see's posted is just ridiculous.

       Devil's advocate. Openness on social media could be seen as a step toward community. Individual problems can be handled easier by the group or the group could be alerted to a member's needs. A perfect example of this is finance. A lot of people would greatly benefit from airing personal financial issues. Someone in your circle knows how to budget better than you. If your financial woes were public, you could get help. It feels like a small step towards a truthful society.

       It's a valid point, although my initial point wasn't so much about openness in society, but more about controlling societies behaviors.

       Yes, in some regard, but (for the most part) money is transferred for services rendered.  The point system that Jesse Schell is talking about is more about controlling peoples behaviors.  Although, you see money used in this regard in recycling, tax credits, and coupons for facebook "check in" or getting cheaper insurance for not smoking, it isn't as precise as getting compensated for brushing your teeth, taking the bus instead of your car, or choosing to walk instead or catching a subway.

       I actually think it was Nathan Rothschild that said, "I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the Empire, ... The man that controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire. And I control the money supply."

       Sometimes I think the West helped promote the Arab Spring to drive people's discontent towards the supported dictators to a new Western backed "democracy," since the Neo-cons ultimate goal is to democratize the world. Of course this is speculation I am not saying its true just a thought sticking in the back of my mind when the reports came out of Propaganda software to control multiple profiles at one time.

       Ding! Ding! Ding! That's the real question. Unfortunately I have no direct answer, and it sucks.  Keep spreading the word!?!? Letting people know what going on, but other then that, I really don't know.  I have a daughter and she is 13.  She is into FB and all of that kind of shit, but I can't just ban her from it.  I wish it was that easy, if I did she would just resent me and fall more into this kind of shit.  All I can do is point it out and guide her through life and let her know what it was like in the 80's &amp; 90's (for me) before all of this.  Other wise, I hope there is a revolt from all of this, but it seems so like it's so much easier/convenient to fall in line and accept it.
