<p>non-violent, victimless crimes like minor drug possession should dealt with in a more productive manner. I&#39;m sorry but some asshole doing 120mph on the freeway is MUCH more dangerous to the public than a guy with <del>a guy</del> joints in his pocket.

<blockquote>
<p>Any third felony conviction, even if it is not violent or serious, will result in the California defendant facing life in prison. Multiple petty theft violations may cause a simple shoplifting charge to be classified as a felony. Accordingly, a defendant in California may face life in prison for stealing a candy bar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We tolerate it unintentionally because we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe that the penal system acts in the best interest of society at large. Most Americans have no idea that big business and government are in cahoots to make lots of money off incarcerating our fellow citizens in a prison-industrial complex similar to the marriage between the military and the Federal Government.</p>

<p>For a few years, I&#39;ve been planning on making a documentary about the prison-industrial complex. I&#39;ll need lots of money in funding. If any redditors know of a production house, movie studio or non-profit organization that I can talk to about funding, please let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is kind off topic but I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about some law they&#39;re trying to pass in San Francisco.  It&#39;s a law where landlords/employers can&#39;t ask about criminal history.  Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, i&#39;m against child molesters, rapists, murderers, racists, etc.  BUT, say you were a drug addict 15 years ago and you got a possession charge which was a felony.   You have since reformed yourself and are a great person, attending meeting daily, etc.  Is it fair to continue being punished?  No.  Yes, I know i&#39;m rambling. But say if you&#39;re a sex offender or someone convicted of hate crimes/murder THEN I don&#39;t support this idea but if you&#39;re a reformed drug user or dealer and say you haven&#39;t had any charges in a pre-determined amount of time then it should be allowed because it&#39;s unfair to be punished your entire life for screwing up for a couple years.  Prisons are nothing but colleges for criminals.  I learned more things there than I ever did in the streets about crime.  Scams I would&#39;ve never thought of, how to cut drugs, etc.</p>

<p>Prisons help maybe 10-15% of inmates, I fall in that category.  But it also changes you, the mentality you have to have to survive and some of the shit you see changes your mentality for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that but the prisons run businesses selling products at full market price while using the prisoners as slave labor paid less than chinese peasants. It&#39;s a &quot;win-win&quot;; Politicians get to brag about lowering crime by passing some new draconian punishment scheme which fills the prisons (which they are invested in), we get these &quot;undesirables&quot; (usually brown) out of sight, we employ hundreds to watch and supervise them, and they have a legion of &quot;legal&quot; slaves. Now the really fun part is where judges that are invested in the prisons or get kick backs start handing out prison sentences for formerly non-criminal offenses so they have more prisoners for the prisons they&#39;ve built and are sitting empty.</p>

<p>But that would never happen here, would it?</p>

<p>I was ignorant of this for the most part.  I need to research some of these claims.  I&#39;m not doubting them because it all sounds very plausible... just curious as to who all is in involved.</p>

<p>On the flip side I have always thought prisons should have a program in which the prisoners do some type of work to pay for the cost of food, clothing and care.  In a system without corruption it would make sense.  They would be able to contribute to their own care and possibly reduce some of their sentence... but in a system described in this thread it does turn into slavery instead.</p>

<p>I worked in corrections for a few years and those of us in the public sector (public servants) are adamantly opposed to this on principle. Inevitably, though, the decision whether or not to privatize is not up to us... it&#39;s up to the people who stand to profit the most (politicians vying for campaign contributions, for example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another example of privatized prisons manipulating the legal system is what happened in Arizona last year with the immigration law that got passed. Basically, it says that police are required to lock up anyone that cannot show proof that they entered the country legally.
From an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130833741">NPR article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The law could send hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to prison in a way never done before. And it could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to private prison companies responsible for housing them.</p>

<p>One of the main drivers behind this was Corrections Corporation of America, who not only lobbied hard for it, but actually helped get the model bill drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (<a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home">ALEC</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason why the situation is tolerated is because it&#39;s hard to sympathize with violent criminals like murderers, rapists, child molesters, etc.  The other problem is that because our prison system is so out of control, reforming it would be a huge undertaking, and as we know, most people in this society are pretty lazy. Plus in order to reform the prison system in this country, we also need to reform education and mental health systems as well.  As I see it the steps that need to be taken are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We need to decide what people we need to be sending to prison in the first place, we spend so much money locking up non violent drug offenders (a large amount of the prison population are in because of drug offenses).  I think the solution to that is to completely across the board legalize drugs, regulate them extensively, tax the hell out of them, and use half the money for our ailing education system and the other half to fund free rehabilitation facilities for anybody who wants help getting off drugs.  Essentially see drug addiction for what it is, a disease, not a criminal offense.</p></li>
<li><p>For those that we do send to prison we need to do two things. Therapy should be mandatory, to help people figure out their issues that cause them to act out the way that they do.  There should also be trade schools within prisons to help offenders get an education and learn how to do something that can give them a career alternative to their criminality.  In California, there is a class in a minimum security prison to teach inmates how to weld under water, the inmates can make up to 60,000 a year after prison working on offshore oil rigs for the big oil companies.  The numbers show that inmates that participate in that class rarely go back to prison.</p></li>
<li><p>All private prisons should be done away with, there should be zero profit incentive for our criminal justice system.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to provide meaningful education for all of our citizens including those in our inner cities. Otherwise we have a bunch of uneducated people making uneducated decisions and landing themselves in the clink.  But I guess this subject is a whole other can of worms altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to bring back state run mental hospitals, so that we can take care of those in our society that are unable to take care of themselves.  If you read the statistics, our prisons have become mental wards with out any means of taking care of these individuals.  Many of these people would have been taken care of by the state hospitals decades ago but since they were all shut down (at least in California) many of these people were released onto the street where they behave like crazy people and get arrested for it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those above 5 things are what I see as the most important steps to reigning in this out of control prison system we have.  However, because of many people&#39;s dogmatic and unsympathetic views towards drug addicts, the mentally ill, and common criminals, we will most likely be stuck with this system until we run out of money to support it (kind of like the wars).  However, hopefully one day somebody will be able to take this on and fix this and we can have a much more compassionate and stable society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple justifications for punishment. There are two prevailing views, retribution and utilitarianism. </p>

<p>Retribution, as advocated by Kant, argues we have a duty to follow the law. If someone breaks the law then society has a duty to punish them. Essentially society is balancing the scales of justice. The criminal harmed someone, so now he is going to be harmed by prison. So anyone advocating this justification of punishment is under no obligation to reform the offender or benefit society. So to answer your question, for those who subscribe to retributivism, it is fine if prisons are warehouses that don&#39;t reform because the criminal is receiving the punishment he deserves. </p>

<p>When you talk about reform or other benefits from punishment, you are attempting to justify punishment by looking forward in time to the benefits. This is utilitarianism. Utilitarians believe the right act is one that generates more pleasure than pain. Utilitarians justify the pain of prison inflicted on the prisoner because over all society will benefit more than the prisoner will suffer. Benefits like specific and general deterrence, incapacitating (prison) and rehabilitation are advocated by utilitarians.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation were attempted wide scale in the U.S. in the 1970&#39;s but due to a perceived failure to rehabilitate the prisoners (One flew over the cuckoo&#39;s nest), most states now justify punishment by saying the criminal deserves to be punished (retributivism) and society benefits from deterring criminals and incapacitating with prison those who cannot be deterred. </p>

<p>I think you might be addressing the idea of privately owned prisons, and obviously if judges who are sentencing criminals have a stake in the prisons profits there are serious concerns.</p>

<p>However, the fact that someone might be profiting from incarcerating criminals is not necessarily problematic. There are good reasons to place those that commit crime in prison, and assuming that that person does deserve to be in prison, and hasn&#39;t been sent there unnecessarily so someone can profit, it is not necessarily a ethical problem that someone profits from providing society a service it requires.</p>

<p>tl;dr If a criminal deserves to be punished, it is not necessarily unethical that someone profit by providing society the service of incarcerating them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it isn&#39;t inherently unethical to profit off of offering the service of punishment.  But I do feel somewhat ambiguous toward rewarding someone for imprisoning a fellow citizen.  Just like any position of authority, adding an element of profit is a going to reward/encourage corruption.</p>

<p>I guess your argument is dependent on what and how a fellow human being is deemed worthy of punishment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree that introducing profit (private prisons) will probably increase corruption. But I think either justification would accept private prisons in theory. Retributivists would be unconcerned as long as the individual is punished, and utilitarians would accept this if society benefited more than the criminal suffered. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the OP is referring to private prisons. He seems to be just upset that state prisons often make no attempt to reform. I would simply respond that we &quot;tolerate&quot; this because some believe that criminals deserve to be punished for their crime, and others believe that prison deters the rest of society from committing crimes, and protects the rest of society from those who do commit crimes. Futhermore, many probably believe that &quot;reform&quot; is not possible, either because we cannot afford it or it is not possible. So we do the best with those that choose to violate the law and harm others that we can, and place them in prison to prevent them from harming others, and make the victim feel that their rights have been vindicated.</p>

<p>I feel compelled to again mention the prison industry&#39;s powerful lobby.   If there is incentive for profit, there is incentive for more profit (ad infinitum).  Society pays in dollars and tears for the bloated penal system as a direct result of prison profiteering.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that is part of a theory of morality that will be used to then justify punishment. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also right that prisons are a powerful lobby. I don&#39;t see how that necessitates that we have to reform criminals. I don&#39;t believe you have shown society has a duty to reform rational actors who have chosen to harm others. Nor have you shown that society will receive a benefit greater than deterrence or incarceration from rehabilitation or reform. Nor has anyone shown that genuine reform is possible. </p>

<p>Most of those in prison are there for violations of controlled substances. Even when legalizing marijuana was taken directly to the voters in California, outside the influence of the prison lobby, the voters choose not to decriminalize it. I believe this indicates that as much I as personally disagree with the war on drugs, many voters do still support the war on drugs and being tough on crime.</p>

<p>If you are upset about the prison system being &quot;bloated&quot; then I would be more concerned with the drug laws that send so many people to prison, more than I would individuals profiting from prison. And the drug laws seem to be more a problem of society generally supporting the war on drugs more than a result of the prison lobby. </p>

<p>When you say you are concerned about &quot;dollars and tears&quot; I think you are criticizing the poor application of prison sentences not the actual practice of sending individuals to prison. Are you saying it is unjustified to send a person who is factually guilty of murder to a prison? Or are you simply concerned that a non-violent offender will be sent to prison instead of probation because there is an opportunity for profit if he is sent to prison.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you are arguing that sending people to prison is wrong always, sometimes or it is okay if the criminal is reformed.</p>

<p>The incarceration factor is built in... so is the concept of deterrence. Deterrence may be a bit stronger if the idea of prison is punishment alone but other then that why would reform/rehabilitation NOT benefit society greater then what is already inherent to the system.

    <div class="md"><p>But this would add the additional monetary cost of treating 30 people with a return on only 1 person being reformed and not committing a second crime when he is out. Money is obviously a finite resource. Society could use that money in other ways. If improving schools or medical benefits or foreign aid create more pleasure or good, than helping that 1 inmate, then the utilitarian will be obligated to choose the option that benefits the most people. </p>

<p>So it is not that helping the inmates who can be reformed is not a benefit. 
It is that the total cost of trying to reform inmates equals x. 
And improving schools in impoverished neighborhoods also costs x. 
Not reforming inmates costs less than x, so that extra money can be used in ways that might generate more benefit to society then helping those prisoners. 
If we accept than reform is generally unsuccessful, why not spend that money on education, ect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lobby is just a small part. A prison is paid for with taxmoney - which makes it a cost to society.<br/>
As another poster mentioned, the local prison is sometimes percieved as the only good employer in the area, which means that wages will increase because local businesses will have to compete for labor with the prison - which creates another cost to society.<br/>
Prison labor work for $0.21/hr. No local manufacturer or service provider can compete with that - which makes it another cost to society.    </p>

<p>The sum of it all is that you have in the prison an institution that drives up costs for the &quot;real&quot; economy, puts some of them out of business because they employ slave labor - and to top it all off: they are paid for by the very people they are putting out of business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to reform prisoners you are advocating a utilitarian justification of prison and discussing the benefits to society is unavoidable. </p>

<p>&quot;Why can&#39;t this just be a standard cost incurred by the government?&quot;<br/>
If it is a cost to the government then the government is paying money to someone. I.e. how are you avoiding someone profiting if the government is paying a cost to someone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why can&#39;t the prisons support themselves?&quot;</p>

<p>Huh? Prisons cannot grow their own food because maximum security prison is not a commune. Prisoners are not farmers. Prisoners are not carpenters and cannot build their own cells, nor do they have the slightest incentive to build the walls around them that will isolate them from the world. Someone has to profit because criminals will not put themselves in jail. You need a building and you need guards. You need someone qualified to operate construction equipment to build a prison that they will not escape from. The quality of living in a prison will become much worse if you expect prisoners to support themselves. How can you suggest giving farming equipment to individuals who kill each other with shanks? </p>

<p>&quot;Put someone in charge under the government dime&quot;
You need to pay guards to go to work. Even in a state run prison the people who work their will have to be paid.  This is profit for them.</p>

<p>I am not advocating private prisons, I&#39;m merely saying they can be justified. I am saying that both state and private prisons will result in someone profiting from criminals being incarcerated. I don&#39;t see how anyone would volunteer to be a prison guard. Felons are not going to ever form a cooperative farm and support themselves. Even if they could there are the inmate in protective housing. Someone has to be paid to protect them. Someone has to be paid for the equipment to farm and the raw building materials. Someone has to keep the prisoners from leaving. If reform is important, counselors need to be paid to work with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still aren&#39;t explaining why all of this has to be managed by CCA (for a profit), instead of by the Bureau of Prisons. Instead of the Gov paying all the bills, they just write a very large check to CCA, make them maintain the minimal of living standards, and tell them to keep the change. There is a perverse incentive to reduce cost and the only way to reduce cost is to reduce quality of life. There is always a push for more profit so they will always be finding ways to spend less money, which means continually reducing the quality of life for new inmates, and also a pervers incentive to lobby for new laws that will create more &quot;customers&quot;, forgetting that these &quot;customers&quot; are living breathing human beings with families and lives. </p>

<p>A for-profit prison is a blight on humanity and there is no way to justify it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t said that prisons need to be managed by the CCA for profit, if that&#39;s the way it came off it certainly was unintended. I agree with all the problems you are pointing out here and they certainly need to be addressed. I would be fine with the Bureau of Prisons paying all the bills directly. Fiscal conservatives would still spend as little as possible on prisoners quality of life though. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already said I personally believe the war on drugs and similar laws are misguided. But given that california voters would not legalize marijuana I think there are larger problems behind the laws that are filling our prisons. I think the &quot;tough on crime&quot; stance that politicians advocate, and voters embrace, is more to blame than prison lobbies. The judges I work with are tough on crime because they are elected after running on that platform, not because a prison donated to their election campaign. </p>

<p>Essentially I think prisons will be a hell hole no matter who runs them, and I disagree that the prison lobby has enough power to single-handedly pass the laws that fill them. </p>

<p>I disagree that for-profit prisons cannot be justified. They keep very dangerous people separate from innocent members of society that criminals would prey on, they deter others from committing crimes, and they punish those that have harmed others. Private prisons are not perfect solutions to crime but they are certainly justifiable. Just because there are better solutions does not mean the current solution is unjustifiable. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Well for starters it could also simply be a warehouse for criminals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>is</em> that, but when more and more prisons become privately owned, &quot;for profit&quot; enterprises it&#39;s hard to argue that it isn&#39;t a money machine. According to the most recent stats, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#Private_prisons_in_the_United_States_today">200+ privately owned prisons housing roughly 100,000 people</a>.  The largest company, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections_Corporation_of_America">CCA</a> is even traded on the NYSE.</p>

<p>Additionally, companies like <a href="https://www.bobbarker.com/web/default.asp?AppriseWebKey=033700828.02402759&amp;amp;AppriseCustCode=WEBGUEST">Bob Barker Company</a> (started by a former NC  state Senator, not the game show host) make millions in revenue every year selling all the uniforms, toiletries, etc.  This is all paid for with our tax dollars.</p>

<p>Lastly, and perhaps most fucked up, is that a Federally-owned corporation called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Industries">UNICOR</a> basically uses the inmates as slave labor, paying them as little as <a href="http://gbgm-umc.org/Response/articles/prisonlabor.html">$0.28/hour</a> to manufacture goods which are then sold at normal retail prices (or slightly less) in direct competition with traditional manufacturers who have to pay &quot;real wages&quot;, putting themselves at a distinct advantage in the marketplace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we tolerate anything in this world? The more patients a country treats, the richer it is considered. Why are people getting more ill to begin with? Why is it a good thing if more people get sick? A perfect example of a sick consumer society we were born into and have no chance of changing until it crumbles beneath its own weight and we rebuild from the ashes. Seriously.

    <div class="md"><p>I love this one, and it makes sense to a degree. 75+% of the prison pop is black. Prisoners work for commissary, which is basically a slave. Prison = black slavery.</p>

<p>Of course you can go on and on why prisons are absurd. The majority of prisoners are due to <em>non</em> violent drug related crimes. These deserve rehab, not punishment. It&#39;s hugely due to a lack of education and poor decision making.</p>

<p>Corporations make money off of prisons. They need sheets, detergent, food, clothing, etc. Guards need guns, uniforms, training, etc.</p>

<p>War is more important than the citizen&#39;s well being. We might be able to afford rehabilitation programs for drug offenders, but we&#39;re already spending too much at war, among other ridiculous things, and letting the rich keep more of their money, which they should be putting back into the economy, but they aren&#39;t, so jobs are dwindling and salaries aren&#39;t going up. </p>

<p>The last thing anyone cares about is rehabilitation those disgusting, scumbag, worthless, criminals. What&#39;s even greater about prison is that you can&#39;t even vote as a felon in some states, which means you can&#39;t vote against someone who may have voted in favor of legislation that wrongly imprisoned you in the first place. How nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After actually experiencing the Department of corrections from both youthful camps and adult camps i can tell you all that the youth facilities at least attempt to better the lives of inmates. As for adult prisons, it truly is nothing more than a stockroom with a routine. They make available programs for self betterment but honestly nobody attends. It truly was the worst year of my life. Also i experienced state run prisons and a privately owned prison. While the amenities are better at private facilities you also work more and for no to very little (.40 an hour). Prisons have become the new form of slavery in america. In fact, sadly, there are more black males in prison today than there were slaves in the last days of slavery in america. The state and corporations make huge profits off the backs of those who need rehabilitation and might want to re-enter society and actually stay out of prison.</p>
