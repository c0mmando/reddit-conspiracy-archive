       This question has always confused me and to me it shows a deep flaw of how our society functions. So really, tell me how can the planet owe money to itself? How can the planet be in debt to itself? That doesn't make much sense to me.

       the simple answer is : The monetary system is a pyramid scheme. It was built to feed the creators of the debt interest forever. It creates "unlimited" wealth for those who own the banks. Indefinite servitude forever to your banking master, because the debt can never be paid back. If I did what the banks have done/are doing I'd be arrested.

       Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws.

      <p>
       You see, we don't owe money to ourselves; we owe it to the banking elite. Who are nothing more than common con-men.

       What has happened in America is that the banking elite have undermined our government. Bought out the politicians and have completely fucked our entire system in the ass. The only way to get rid of the fed is like Andrew Jackson did.

       I just want to suggest what is obvious to me. 
Debt is not a natural thing, it doesn't really exsist. The so called social contract we were born into isn't valid. As difficult as it will likely be, we need to completely disregard that which has been forced upon us, take back that which has been stolen from us, and most importantly stand your ground above those who claim authority over you. Act peacefully and cause harm to no one.

       References aside, I concur; being an American will likely become much harder, abruptly, soon. 
It's disheartening to have knowledge about that which is actively rejected by the shared delusion. 
Furthermore when ignorance is applauded and inquisitiveness is frowned upon.

       Ok, this probably should be in
       <a href="/r/economy">

       .

       Fiat currency is effectively useless. When we had the Gold Standard, we printed money to the value of the gold we had. Therefor, if you have    $10 000 in gold, you can print $10 000 on paper. That worked fine. I'm assuming you're from America, (forgive me if i'm wrong). Nixon changed that - along with everything else he fucked. Nixon took America off the Gold standard. This gave the US the ability to print money whenever they wanted. So, how do they determine how much money they can print? Well that is - in a perfect world - supposed to work off the Nation's GDP. (Gross Domestic Product). It's a pretty long winded deal, probably look it up on youtube there is a few good examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a country has the ability to print it's own money, whenever it feels like it. You run into problems. Example; if I have a cake, and two people to feed. Each of us will get a reasonable size piece. We might even have some left over that we can save for later. 
But, on the other hand, if I have that same cake, but 10 people to feed. We will each get significantly smaller pieces of the cake. Decreasing it's worth. We will probably still be hungry and will need more to satisfy our hunger. Money is the same. Printing more money decreases the value of the dollar, making each dollar worth less just means you're walking backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with
       <em>
        the world debt
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        the world owing itself money?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, a nations debt is built up of several contributing factors. Alot of it is foreign debt. Where say, America buys bonds and securities from other countries and visa versa. If the US wants to, fund a war effort or start a new stimulus package. It will borrow money from other countries in exchange for bonds, securities and IOU's. In this case $14.7 trillion dollars worth. So the US owes this money to many countries all around the world. (A full breakdown of debts can be found on the CIA world fact book I believe.) Debt's aren't always a bad thing. In fact most economists recommend a country run with a debt. Of around 60 - 80% GDP. This keeps the value of their money up. Going over this limit however has the opposite effect. Decreasing the value of the currency as the rest of the losses faith in the currencies stability. This makes the debt's harder to pay off, cripples the economy and more money is needed to make up for the losses. Hyper inflation. Therefor the country falls further and further behind and debt's get way way way out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this was an example of the US. But they are not alone, most countries around the world are run exactly the same way. Great Britain, Australia, Canada, the European Union etc etc. You might also notice, the value of their money is quite high when compared to say China who has a massive surplus rather than a debt. ( China still does have debt's to other countries, but overall it has a massive surplus of cash.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is a massive flaw in how our economy is run. The Gold standard was the most highly effective method of maintaining strong economies. However issues arise because there isn't enough Gold to cover an entire economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope I kinda made a little bit of sense for you. I'm no economist, I have just spent a lot of time looking into this.

PS: I'm not an American, I'm Lebanese and because of our 60$bn debt we have so many problems, problems that you think are easy to solve like electricity and water shortages (although these are perfectly available from the private sector for an additional fee of course).

       I don't see how being in 60 to 80% debt is better than zero debt. It's still needless debt, would you run your household with 80% debt? How about zero debt and we pay our fuckin' bill amirite? I wouldn't go to a restaurant and order 10 dollars worth of food pay them 2 dollars and work for one hour to make up the other 8 bucks. If you DON'T have the money, you DON'T buy it.

       It's a really complicated process. But basically, if a Country is in Debt to another country. Lets use your restaurant example. A customer goes into the Restaurant, eats their meal but doesn't have the money to pay for it there and then. So he says to the Manager, "I don't have the money at the moment, but I will pay it back to you with interest." The manager will agree, because a) He is getting the money for the meal, whether it's now or later is irrelevant. b) Because he is going to earn interest on that money. So now, this customers money is worth more to the restaurant. They can rely on regular repayments from the customer from week to week. They can also make plans for the money, knowing with confidence he will pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly the same is true for Countries. If America owes China, $120 Billion, China can rely on a regular installment from America. This makes America's money worth more to the Chinese, as they are relying on it and know they will make money from it. If there was no debt to be paid, they would have no need for the US Dollar and it would loose worth on a global scale. China doesn't have very big debts to other Governments. The Euro, British Pound and US Dollar are all amongst the most sort after in the world. Each of these Countries and Union's have National Debts. This is proof of this system. China is a massive massive country with astronomical amounts of Exports. But they have very little debt and there currency is a reflection of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all fairness America's Dollar is so valuable because it is the only currency you can buy oil and precious metals with. It is/was also regarded as the reserve currency of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this makes sense, it is a confusing topic to talk about.

       To bad for China we're defaulting on our debt. You're wrong, but I shouldn't have to explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debt = Bad
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the ENTIRE reason we're in this mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it yourself here, "China.....have very little debt and there currency is a reflection of that."
Having debt means you owe people money. I'd prefer we don't owe any countries anything.

       Too much debt is bad. Yes. China has no debt and they are still destroying their economy.

       So if you were going to start a business. You wouldn't do it unless you could self fund it?
      </p>
      <p>
       By borrowing the money, you give yourself the potential to make more money. I'm not talking about borrowing $350 000 dollars, buying a Lamborghini and never seeing your money again. Its about borrowing and making your money work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one gets anywhere unless they borrow money
If I buy a house now, pay off the loan interest only and sell it in 5 years, I will pocket anything the house inflates in that time. Around here that's a good $50 000+. Without having borrowed money. I never could have made that $50 000. America can afford to run their country without borrowing money. Their GDP is huge. But the problem is, its not enough just to run the country. They wanted to make more money. So they borrowed. But if it gets out of hand, you start defaulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       America wouldn't be half the country it is today if it wasn't for debts that worked for them.

       Because the banking cartels that print the money are owned privately, and all the governments of the world owe money to them. There are people with excess money, just very few of them, while the majority of us and our governments are in debt to them.

       Don't worry, if the Earth is in major debt, we can just ask Mars for a bailout.  And if Mars said no, we can ask the other 7 or so planets out there.  We might even have to go further and get an intergalactic bailout.  Of course, we would have to solve the problem of traveling at warp/light speed first.  As to where the Earth is going to get the money to solve light speed....I don't know.

       Of course, since the money in circulation unbacked, then all debts are unfounded. So realistically, you and everyone are in debt to nobody, you simply have been tricked into believing you are, so you pay...

       I'm just taking a random stab as to why this may be the case.  From a personal level an extreme situation would be if you got a loan on a piece of machinery that broke right away before it could produce enough widgets before you at least broke even.  On a government level this would mean that we are spending money on things that do not put out as much value as we are putting into it.  Or something
