       Right now the government is actively recruiting for patsies. Feel free to join their forum and keep and eye on things, but do so anonymously with stealth proxies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that this is a controlled group, following the Hegelian Dialect of Problem, Reaction, Solution - namely:
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem - Cyber Attacks worldwide cripple Internet infrastructure and cause devastation worldwide. Anonymous Hackers are to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction - People fear the anonymous hackers. They want the Internet repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution - Internet 2 with biometric ID is required by law globally. States resisting this decree are labelled terrorist and invaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd give you a heads up. I've been studying this group for a while and I can reach no other conclusion.

       The sheeple barely understand regular politics and now you're asking them to actively fight against a group of people they don't even know? They couldn't even manage voting bush out of office when he ran for a 2nd term. Then they voted in Obama the Liar. I don't want to accept my bio metric ID. I will however leave you with this. I made a very similar post and this was the response I received.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "I would argue that Anon is very much a group, a group with structure and leaders, no matter what is said outside of IRC. I have learned more about protecting my system and my traffic due to these folks. I understand your concern of their activities opening up the possibility of heavy handed internet regulation, but the government has been trying to initiate this since before Anon started to regularly go forward with these actions. It's Anon that is constantly pushing for a distributed internet that gov can't take down or turn off. In fact, they were one of the first groups to offer ways for Egypt and Tunisia to get online during the beginning stages of their revolutions. You should go to the IRC chat rooms and actually talk to these people before casting a horrible insult at them. It's easy for people to sit and bitch about problems on Reddit, but these people actually try to fight. They have the planet's back, and risk their own freedom daily to do it. Come join us, we're legion and shitz."
       </em>
       -ovoid709
      </p>
      <p>
       What we really need to watch is the difference in ANON groups and MOTIVE. Understand the motive of those posting as Anon, and you will understand what group they fall under. I don't doubt the government is trying to infiltrate anon groups. Being informed to the disinfo and the real stuff is very important.

       To your first comment, where people barely notice or understand "regular" politics vs. the true nature of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're correct, but we do need to educate.  It needs to start some where, maybe not with the men behind the curtain but......show the usual BS policies that lead to special people with power.

      <p>
       Alex Jones: NWO is evil, must end or they will enslave us or kill the ones who stand on their way.

       Guy: Ok, let's take action against them, I will do this, this and that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones: Beware, that Guy taking action against the evil shadow masters behind NWO doing things against global enslavement is nothing more than a government puppet giving them an excuse to act against us. Slay him! (before he makes me lose my job, I have a million dollar house to keep)

       So, the idea is to do nothing and let them follow their plan without any resistance? If thats the true then they will win one way or another... What do we lose taking a chance?

       A few months ago I listened to an interview with Daniel Estulin, where he stated that FBI/CIA are the top "conspiracy theories" publishers, the goal to launch confusion. After reading this post and some comments I can only say: so true.

       Because the Government reacts to threats and attacks by strengthening the part of the system under fire.  This is a sensible way of acting if you're a government and so happens all the time as society develops.  What doesn't break it makes it stronger.  This whole revolution thing is bollocks.  There can't be a revolution anymore, politicians are easily removable but the hidden infrastructures of power will come back.  Anon should realize that any real tearing down of society will just lead to mass deaths.

       This seems way more plausible. Combined with the fact Lulzsec is an offshoot of the whole Anonymous umbrella it could be used to discredit Anonymous and warrant internet regulation.

       As seen here, people will take this idea and blow it totally out of proportion claiming that every hacker out there is a "patsy".  However the idea of the government using homegrown internet attacks and scapegoating existing groups to enact harsher internet regulations is a very valid theory that should not be chucked into the loony bin.

       You've been studying the group for a while and you can reach no other conclusion you say. Based on what findings? Why not share them with us if what you have discovered is so suspicious. The problem - Reaction - Solution is not proof that anyone attempting to fight against the corruption in our world is part of a false flag conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also conspiracy redditors. Notice that the false flag thread has received more than 600 upvotes, more than any post I've seen on this sub. Do you think maybe the trolls were upvoting it too instead of downvoting because they know that the least thing they want is for a credible, trusted and organized resistance to be established.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following your logic I could also say you are a troll, following the "divide/conquer" strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm however not stating you are surely and absolutely wrong, I just think it's irresponsible to throw these accusations around without mentioning any of the facts that made you come to this conclusion.

       If the guy wrote a textbook that has merit in his field yes. By merit, I also include defending his thesis and statements with science and reason.

       Did you even read the 3 paragraph wiki explanation ? It was mainly a quote that was taken out of context; he was describing the biological consequences of human extinction.

       Do you always only question half of the stuff you hear ?

       I went much further than Wikipedia. I actually looked into his publications. You have a very surface understanding of Eugenics if you think Pianca is innocent. Your ignorance on the matter, however, is far surpassed by your naive attitude towards education.

       Okay, then read someone else's books, someone you think is not a crazy maniac.

       If you're getting education in a science field and you're getting moral opinions and beliefs, then the teacher is doing it wrong.

       There are people who have received diplomas in biology fighting for creationism. That doesn't invalidate all the other people who teach the subject.

       All people have moral opinions and beliefs, and unfortunately educated isn't as unbiased as you imagine it to be, even in your lovely prestigious Ivy league institutions.
