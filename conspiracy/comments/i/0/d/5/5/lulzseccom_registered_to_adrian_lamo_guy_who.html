        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Or at least it was a week ago (supposedly): <a href="http://pastebin.com/0Gxgu6ns">http://pastebin.com/0Gxgu6ns</a></p>

<p>The whois registrant has since been changed, around the time that people started raising suspicions about Lulzsec&#39;s motives and affiliations.  I&#39;m not an expert in this area so maybe someone can independently confirm if Lamo was (or still is) the owner of Lulzsec.com.</p>

<p>If so, I think it strengthens the theory that Lulzsec is a false flag cyberop to build public support for &quot;cybersecurity&quot; legislation like Protect IP and others.  I was already getting suspicious of their choice of targets (senate.org servers, FBI-security affiliates, gaming servers).  If someone were to make a list of hacking targets to generate political support for a cybersecurity bill, legislators and security firms would probably be at the top of the list, along with sites frequented by the most vocal opponents to internet regulation (tech savvy folks and gamers).   Their total disregard for screwing over innocent people by releasing their personal info also seems out of character for a security-minded grassroots &quot;hactivist&quot; (but makes perfect sense if you want to get people clamoring for cybersecurity).  </p>

<p>Edit: Another thing I find suspect is how remarkably successful they&#39;ve been - they went from relative obscurity to taking down an FBI security contractor, hacking senate.gov servers, borking a boatload of gaming websites and servers, taking down Sony&#39;s entire PSN network for <em>weeks</em>, and releasing personal/CC info on hundreds of thousands of people... all in less than a month.  I can&#39;t recall a grassroots hacker group ever causing so much damage in so little time.  They&#39;re either really <em>really</em> bored and extremely talented (or extremely lucky) people, or they&#39;re getting a little &quot;help&quot; from someone that has more resources at their disposal than your average &quot;script-kiddie&quot;.</p>

<p>UPDATE: they just took down CIA.gov (trying to throw off suspicion perhaps?): <a href="http://thenextweb.com/industry/2011/06/15/senate-website-cia-gov-hacked-lulzsec-claims-responsibility/">http://thenextweb.com/industry/2011/06/15/senate-website-cia-gov-hacked-lulzsec-claims-responsibility/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not really buying it.  Why be so secretive with the registration of lulzsecurity.com, but put all the contact details on lulzsec.com?  For all we know, lulzsec registered it with Lamo&#39;s info just as a big &quot;fuck you&quot; or to fuel speculation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a possibility, but it could also be the basis for some disinfo to cover a massive exposure fuck-up (hey, this is r/conpsiracy).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that though the registration itself doesn&#39;t necessarily mean much, when considered with other factors (targets they&#39;ve been hitting, decision to release personal data, etc.) all this stuff in the aggregate creates an overall picture that makes me question their real motive.</p>

Pretty much all those in programming culture hate adrien lamo. He outed a national hero in what was much bigger than the pentagon papers or any other lame corporate whistleblower that goes enormous praise and attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of who this guy is, he&#39;s just exposing leaky pipes in these companies&#39; infrastructure.  You don&#39;t fix leaky pipes with robust expensive security systems and key-codes.  You buy a god damn wrench and tighten the pipe, replacing parts if necessary.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t fix idiots hacking companies with government controlled cyber security.  You hire web techs who know how to secure servers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between this and other &quot;grey-hat&quot; groups is that they&#39;re releasing people&#39;s private data/CC info who had nothing to do with said &quot;leaky pipes.&quot;  That sort of thing is out of character for a security-minded &quot;hactivist&quot; - the only possible motive I can think of for doing something like that is to get people clamoring for cyber security regulation to protect their personal info.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lulsec registered the domain to Adrian for lolz. He has since changed the whois info because he&#39;d rather not be associated. This is the most paper-thin proof of a government conspiracy I&#39;ve ever seen. Try hanging out in 2600, LCIRC, EFNet, or ED irc before making uninformed conspiracies.</p>

<p>Not to mention a pastebin is proof of nothing. Hey look! <a href="http://pastebin.com/BLnEAPX0">http://pastebin.com/BLnEAPX0</a></p>
