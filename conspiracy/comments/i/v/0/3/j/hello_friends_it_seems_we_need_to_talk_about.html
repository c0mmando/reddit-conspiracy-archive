       My brothers and sisters, there seems to be a lot of disinformation about the human capacity to modify, manipulate and control our planet's weather.  There are many different instances of weather manipulation in action.  This is not a secret.  This is not an example of the NWO or the Illuminati or anyone else trying to hide the truth from us.  This is publicly accessible information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the mainstream media [
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/research/2008-02-29-china-weather_N.htm">
        USA Today
       </a>
       ] [
       <a href="http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-rain31jan31">
        LA Times
       </a>
       ] reported on China's weather manipulation attempts during the Beijing olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather control has been a seriously discussed issue since as early as
       <strong>
        1948
       </strong>
       .  The following patent,
       <a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=lctbAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
        Process For Controlling Weather
       </a>
       , describes
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "a process for effecting changes in weather conditions and more specifically to a process for dissipating clouds and fog by clearing the atmosphere of moisture particles...The overall object of the present invention is directed to the control of weather conditions generally."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The most well-known facility of this kind today is named
       <a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/">
        <strong>
         HAARP
        </strong>
        [official website]
       </a>
       .  HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is jointly run by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and DARPA.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Thanks to FOIA, we have access to the following PDF, which summarizes some of HAARP's technical abilities as well as their scientific purpose and capacity, titled
       <a href="http://foia.abovetopsecret.com/ultimate_UFO/Advanced/HAARPResearchAndApplications.pdf">
        "HAARP Research and Applications."
       </a>
       This is a good introduction to HAARP's official intent as well as a glance at the wide range of abilities such a facility has.

       [Using the printed number on the pages]:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Sun controls and shapes the three major regions of Geospace (the magnetosphere; the ionosphere; and the atmosphere); these regions interact with each other and form a chain connecting the Earth to the Sun. Disturbances from the Sun spread via solar winds and solar radiation which spread through the chain and ultimately influence the weather; climate; and communications (radio etc). The clouds and the Earthâ€™s surface play a critical role in this chain, which is finely tuned to be in a delicate equilibrium with life on Earth"

       One of the earliest patents of extreme importance is the following (from 1987, mind you):

       I'd particularly like to draw everyone's attention to the eleventh page, first column, last paragraph.  If you don't read anything else,
       <strong>
        read this one paragraph
       </strong>
       --it outlines everything HAARP saw as a possibility back in 1987:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible ramifications and potential future developments...
        <em>

        by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device."

       tl;dr - If you're unwilling to read this, you don't belong in this discussion.  I'm trying to spread information through academically accepted resources; such a method leads to a lengthy post.

       [edit] - I don't understand why I'm being downvoted; I'm not making any interpretation of the facts that I have presented.  The only reason, then, that one would downvote this is to hide the truth.

        The full text
       </strong>
       of the mentioned paragraph of extreme importance: "This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible ramifications and potential future developments. As 45 alluded to earlier, missile or aircraft destruction, deflection, or confusion could result, particularly when relativistic particles are employed. Also, large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and un- 50 planned drag forces with resultant destruction or deflection of same. Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will 55 act as a lens or focusing device. Also as alluded to earlier, molecular modifications of the atmosphere can take place so that positive environmental effects can be achieved. Besides actually changing the molecular composition of an atmospheric region, a particular molecule 60 or molecules can be chosen for increased presence. For example, ozone, nitrogen, etc. concentrations in the atmosphere could be artificially increased. Similarly, environmental enhancement could be achieved by causing the breakup of various chemical entities such as 65 carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and the like. Transportation of entities can also be realized when advantage is taken of the drag effects caused by regions of the atmosphere moving up along diverging field lines. Small micron sized particles can be then transported, and, under certain circumstances and with the availability of sufficient energy, larger particles or objects could be similarly affected. Particles with desired characteristics such as tackiness, reflectivity, absorptivity, etc., can be transported for specific purposes or effects. For example, a plume of tacky particles could be established to increase the drag on a missile or satellite passing therethrough. Even plumes of plasma having substantially less charged particle density than described above will produce drag effects on missiles which will affect a lightweight (dummy) missile in a manner substantially different than a heavy (live) missile and this affect can be used to distinguish between the two types of missiles. A moving plume could also serve as a means for supplying a space station or for focusing vast amount of sunlight on selected portions of the earth. Surveys of global scope could also be realized because the earth's natural magnetic field could be significantly altered in a controlled manner by plasma beta effects resulting in, for example, improved magnetotelluric surveys. Electromagnetic pulse defenses are also possible. The earth's magnetic field could be decreased or disrupted at appropriate altitudes to modify or eliminate the magnetic field in high Compton electron generation (e.g., from high altitude nuclear bursts) regions. High intensity, well controlled electrical fields can be provided in selected locations for various purposes. For example, the plasma sheath surrounding a missile or satellite could be used as a trigger for activating such a high intensity field to destroy the missile or satellite. Further, irregularities can be created in the ionosphere which will interfere with the normal operation of various types of radar, e.g., synthetic aperture radar. The present invention can also be used to create artificial belts of trapped particles which in turn can be studied to determine the stability of such parties. Still further, plumes in accordance with the present invention can be formed to simulate and/or perform the same functions as performed by the detonation of a "heave" type nuclear device without actually having to detonate such a device. Thus it can be seen that the ramifications are numerous, far-reaching, and exceedingly varied in usefulness."

       DoD News Briefing: Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen in 1997 mentions "Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves."

       You can't say airplane contrails are purely water vapor and CO2, yes, they emit more than that.

       "These links between atmospheric sulphur, climate, and the
environment assume an even greater relevance since global
       <strong>
        anthropogenic emissions (60-
100 Mt(S) yr-1) currently account for about 70% of all sulphur emissions
       </strong>
       , the remainder
emanating from oceanic plankton (13-36 Mt(S) yr-1), volcanoes (6-20 Mt(S) yr-1),
biomass burning (1-6 Mt(S) yr-1), and land biota and soils (0.4-5.6 Mt(S) yr-1) (Penner et

       ALBEDO ENHANCEMENT BY STRATOSPHERIC SULFUR
INJECTIONS: A CONTRIBUTION TO RESOLVE A POLICY

       Sorry, you will just have to read the entire thing, but the important thing is that an experiment is discussed along with its ramifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Finally, I repeat: the very
best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be
       <strong>
        reduced
       </strong>
       so much that
the
       <strong>
        stratospheric sulfur release experiment
       </strong>
       would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       need to take place. Currently,
this looks like a
       <em>
        pious wish
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       So from this statement one can assume that unless we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions drastically, an experiment will take place. Have we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions since 2006?
       <em>
        Nope
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So you may ask, What would be the cheapest and most effective way of injecting sulfurous particles into the stratosphere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Using existing technology, of course!
Stratospheric Injection of Reflective Aerosols or Particles by means of Aviation Fuel Additives.

       Why do these things tend to be discussed in conspiracy forums? When it should be an important issue for everyone that breathes?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple things going on in our skies that can't be explained away by a singular link from wikipedia, and yet the apparent conspiracy to hide and/or obfuscate that which is in plain sight continues.

       Great job, now maybe all these douchebags that do nothing but denounce the notion of weather modification will shut the fuck up.  Although those people probably didn't even check out the links you posted, but complain how there is no evidence of weather mod blah blah blah.  Good job man, thanks for getting this info out there so we don't have to hear from these idiots that deny the inevitable just because it's not a popular opinion in mainstream media.

       If you don't want to connect the discussion to NWO etc, then why post to r/conspiracy? Why not post in r/science, if you want a discussion about the actual science behind attempts at weather manipulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to the discussion, I'd like to point out that just because something is patented doesn't mean it actually works the way it's described. The hurricane lightning rods sounds like a scam, similar to hail cannons.

       Humans are a long way from having any real control over the weather, if it is even possible. We can't even accurately predict the weather on most areas!

       I feel like there's a lot of misunderstanding surrounding the power structure's relationship with our planet's weather. A lot of people like to look at HAARP and scream conspiracy [I have my own set of 'crazy' ideas and theories about what HAARP is doing as well] and many others like to think that the government cannot do anything at all to impact the weather. Without an adequate foundation of knowledge to base these discussions on, it is impossible to have a fruitful conversation on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I posted in r/conspiracy because I had a feeling there would be the greatest interest amongst this subreddit's readers.  I tried posting in r/environment as well, but nobody even acknowledged the post.  r/conspiracy has potential to be a beautiful place--there's a lot of really open minded people here!

       HAARP does not and can not cause earthquakes by rebounding microwaves off the ionosphere. That's the part I have a problem with, that and when people start saying oh this earthquake and that earthquake were obviously caused by HAARP, and I can't prove that it didn't, sigh.

       You want to know the truth?  The truth is you're so brainwashed you'd rather believe a top secret communications facility is a weather control machine than believe you're going to change the climate based on the amount of CO2 you created doing that "research".  That's how dumb modern man has become.  The answer is right in front of us, yet we're too blind and brainwashed to see the consequences of our own actions.  Our government distracts us with petty bullshit problems while they rob us blind and the only thing anyone wants to talk about is everything but the actual problems we have to deal with.  Forget the fact that the middle class is being taxed into the ground, let's talk about HAARP....

       Do you honestly think our government is dumb enough to release information on such a project, if it did exist?  It took what, 30+ years for anything to be released about the U2 spyplane?  Honestly this sounds more like a disinformation campaign.  Put people on a false trail of climate control and paranoia.  Just to keep you distracted while your political leaders turn you into wage slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you this:  our government doesn't just release these documents without a purpose.  Posts and theories like this are exactly the reason they were released in the first place.  What better way to cover up actual top secret projects with false trails and bullshit information?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did the same shit with UFOs.  Released fake stories about aliens to cover up actual national secrets.  Same thing here.

       You're being used and you don't even know it.  In fact you think you're getting somewhere.  But you're not.

      <p>
       Yeah, and it's because people with zero scientific background post a bunch of darpa research papers and call it proof.  How about you talk to some actual scientists and do some real research instead of spamming research links.  Just because you post a ton of semi relevant links doesn't really mean anything because your conclusions are separated from the facts.  *
       <em>
        You started with the conclusion, and found evidence you could warp towards it, instead of taking the evidence and deriving a conclusion from it *
       </em>
       You can even tell this by the way you wrote your post.  Started out with cloud seeding, then jumping right into HAARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       HAARP isn't used for weather manipulation, it's used for long range top secret communication.  It's great for bouncing a signal across the world, or blocking foreign communication.  What you're talking about isn't just impractical, it's borderline retarded.  Thank god our military isn't as stupid as you are.  Because they use it for actually useful things like encrypted communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that almost anything that happens in the upper atmosphere affects our weather.  *
       <em>
        Airplanes affect our weather far more than HAARP ever would, but you don't see people screaming about airplanes fucking us over do you?  *
       </em>
       Shit, cows affect our weather way more than HAARP ever could.  The fossil fuels you're using to make this post?  Far more destructive than any manipulation HAARP is capable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        That's the ultimate irony of this situation.  You're looking for some insane conspiracy when the truth is right under your nose, the glowing computer screen you're staring at is responsible.  Fossil fuels will destroy our weather, not some top secret communications project.  The amount of destructive CO2 and Methane you put into the atmosphere in a year is manipulating our weather on a scale that HAARP could only dream of...
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You might have numerous links, but your interpretation of them is completely fallacious and inaccurate.  If you had bothered to talk to some actual researchers they would have told you a completely different story, but I guess that's why your research is just limited to papers taken out of context.  An expert would set you straight but I guess that's why you didn't bother to talk to one.  Much better to keep your worldview alive that to realize the truth, which is that HAARP is an amazing top secret communications facility and nothing more.  There's a reason this wouldn't live on r/science, and it's because people there actually know what they're talking about.  Conspiracy theorists are the least versed on scientific matters, but the likeliest to talk about them like an expert.  I'm sorry this is coming out harshly, but this is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Nothing is worse than pseudoscience in my opinion.

       Making baseless attacks on me does nothing to strengthen your argument.  But you are right, it is used for long range top secret communication.  It is also evident that HAARP has an extremely
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program#Research">
        wide range of possible functions.
       </a>
       (really, check out that last.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your airplane argument, HAARP's operations are performed in a region far above the area planes and jets are flying in--the

       above the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot criticise my arguments for being fallacious, (A fallacy is usually incorrect argumentation in reasoning resulting in a misconception or presumption.) because I have not made any arguments.  The fact that HAARP has claimed the ability, through their publications, to be able to manipulate the weather is a fact.  I've simply researched a specific element of something that interests me and shared my findings.  There were no concluding arguments.

       I don't believe that HAARP has any practical application or capability to control weather. I think the vast majority of conspiracy theories out there are objectively retarded. That said, you're being a huge assclown.  1ndigoo started off with multiple cited sources, made very little in the way of specific claims, and all you've done is call names and generally be a dickhead to the guy.

       He posts old DARPA research, takes it out of contest, and everyone wants to pretend like a) They know what they're talking about and b) It's actually proof.  If you had any critical thinking skill you would have at least taken time to understand the papers instead of sucking his dick.  I guess there's a reason this is on r/conspiracy and not r/science, because this is where the college dropouts hang out.  Did you even bother to talk to a professional researcher or scientist about this?  My guess is you didn't bother because you know you wouldn't like what you would hear.

       It is a necessity to prove HAARP's capacity for weather modification before attempting to make further arguments (any of the conspiracy theories that you have assumed that I fall into).
      </p>
      <p>
       My 'argument' is: 
that weather manipulation has been talked about for a long time; it is still talked about today; it is done in some places today; HAARP talks about it today; HAARP is a powerful facility; HAARP has the potential to be doing it today.
      </p>

       That's it.  None of that is irrefutable.  None of that is fallacious.

       Hardly.  Stupid conspiracy theorist bullshit once again.  Pretending to be objective, while at the same time jumping to conclusions, taking sources out of context with zero scientific backing or knowledge to speak of...

       Like I said, you can't post this on
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       because you'd get torn apart.  This isn't science, it's pseudoscience at best.  It's bullshit masquerading as independent thinking.  Talk to some actual fucking experts before pretending to know what you're talking about.  You posted a bunch of old DARPA research and call it proof, hiding behind a cloud of bullshit and fair and balanced.  Just like Fox news right?

       <strong>
        I have old DARPA papers that say we could build a base on the moon to kill Russians...so obviously it must be the truth right?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can point to tons of ridiculous DARPA papers, it doesn't mean anything.  It's not proof, it's not evidence.  I mean hell DARPA just published a study on intergalactic space travel, but that doesn't mean they've gone a built a rocket.

        HAARP isn't used for weather manipulation, it's used for long range top secret communication. It's great for bouncing a signal across the world, or blocking foreign communication. What you're talking about isn't just impractical, it's borderline retarded. Thank god our military isn't as stupid as you are. Because they use it for actually useful things like encrypted communications.

       You're better off disputing the presented facts instead of introducing your conclusions.
