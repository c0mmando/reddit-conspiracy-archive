       Everyone should have the same reaction when I say 'December 21st, 2012'. How did such a specific date get into nearly everyone connected to the mainstream media's head? To me it seems that we are being conditioned to accept that the end of the world is coming, so that when the people in charge 'flip the switch' so to speak, everyone accepts their fate instead of standing up and fighting to stop it. Thoughts?

       The reason people know of the 21st, 2012 is thanks to the the blockbuster 2012 and combined with the Mayan calendar ending at 2012 and some scientist telling us that something big will happen in 2012 with the earth you got a mainstream reaction to the date.

       When the NZ government released their UFO files, there was some handwritten stuff entitled "ethology of light", there the writer mentions his personal contact with an alien race made of "light" he also writes about the re-encounter with the "great old one" to be something huge(global event) and to happen
       <em>
        approximately
       </em>
       30 years from the date the letter was being written, that would be 2014.

       Some scientist? lol Try again. The guy who came up with the 2012 claim also said that humans evolved from apes who secluded themselves in caves and tripped on mushrooms (Stoned Caveman Hypothesis). Said guy was told in a drug-induced vision that the end of the Mayan calendar meant the end of the world. Said shenanigans became mainstream.

       That is very similar to what I am thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all about preconditioning in their believe system. Freemasons, Cabbalists and Luciferians believe that they can tap the bad energy of the masses and that they can create or materialize bad incidents just by thinking of them. The masses must therefore have fear and expect something very bad happening to have all that bad energy happening that they will need. Those guys have plans for 2012 that go back for centuries and it has everything to do with the prophecies of different bibles. They use their scare tactics to make you believe something inevitable of natural origin will happen soon and kill large quantities of the population of this world. Those are the thoughts that they are planting in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me, it has nothing to do with earthquakes, solar activity, aliens, mayan calendars, gods, esoteric quackery, asteroids, volcanoes, global warming, global cooling or whatever they told you on the mass stupefy media. They are planning a man made incident to kill people and have their Armageddon type event. Just like in the prophecies they have conditioned people that are helping in make the wars happen to believe that they will somehow profit from Armageddon.  There is the enemy of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be wrong, but I think that they are planning next year this war in Middle East (most probably Iran vs. Israel) that will jumpstart WWIII. 
We have time yet to stop the madness. We can do that together if everyone does the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: Do not get distracted. Think positive and be calm and rational. Then you do not let them get away with their war agenda. Do not let anybody do any more warmongering in Middle East. You could be next if you let them start WWIII.

       Honestly? I think the opposite. The media focusing on and laughing at the Harold Campings and the 2012ers strikes me a lot like people scoffing at concerns that the Titanic could sink. They want the slaves working the machines as long as possible, like the band that played even while the ship was actually going under.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I don't believe the world will end in the cliched apocalyptic sense. Rather, that a catastrophic breakdown of human society worldwide is very imminent (famine, starvation, superbugs, disease, water wars, climate change, environmental disasters, crime, riots, etc etc). To make fun of the scenario is a great way to silence dissent/concern/alarm and keep the masses pacified.

       Yes, I think there's something to that. According to Carl Calleman, the Mayan calendar has an error that became known to them, and which they compensated for in their use of it; it meant too much disruption to correct it in stone though (it would be like moving Christmas). The event anticipated for Dec. 21, 2012 is actually to occur on Oct. 28, 2011, which also happens to be when the Earth encounters whatever it is that is following in Elenin's wake. The Illuminati know this, and are trumping the 2012 date for all it's worth, so they may prepare unhindered.

       That's a close quarters alignment, which is to be taken seriously as well. Every time Elenin aligns with the Earth and Sun there is a catastrophic, pole shifting earthquake. Oct. 16 is the closest proximity, though well off the ecliptic by then. The last alignment is on Dec. 21, 2012, with a distant Elenin. All those dates are approximate, however.

       OK, missed that on the line break.

      <p>
       So why would this matter if all three objects were aligned in a straight line?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I'd like to add that Elenin will be inclined to Earth, so you will not be able to draw a straight line from Earth through Elenin to the sun at any time during its pass.

       I don't see how it should, but the earthquakes really do defy coincidence. The effect seems to exist even with Elenin somewhat off the ecliptic, as we understand it, and at great distances. My own opinion is that Elenin's poorly reflective coma is more dust than ice, and results in a massive electrical charge which gives Elenin and its accompanying bodies unusual properties we have yet to understand. Another possibility is that Elenin has been snatched by the Sun away from its normal orbit around our sun's brown dwarf partner, and the dim star is following more-or-less behind Elenin (never to actually enter the inner solar system, of course); it may only seem to be Elenin that is exciting the earths core, when it really is the brown dwarf following in the distance. Perhaps there are gravity troughs, as well as wells.

       Glad you brought up electrodynamics. This is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       thing that could cause any kind of disruption. There will be no gravimetric consequences, as the Moon has a far more substantial impact on Earth than any fly-by comet ever would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I doubt this is the case, I would not be completely confounded if large, brilliant plasma discharges accompany Elenin (or other long-period comets.) I suppose thunderbolts.info could be predicting such things, or at least hedging their theories by suggesting the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I'd like not to witness large, ground-touching (and scarring) plasma / electrical interactions with a cometary body, it would be damn cool ...
      </p>
      <p>
       But the ignorant masses would almost certainly think the world is ending, and if you weren't electrocuted, you'd probably end up dead by some idiot.

       There's not. Elenin reaches perihelion near the 28th of September, but its perihelion is near Mercury's orbit. Elenin will be nowhere near Earth in September.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its closest approach is in October around the 18th, where it's projected to be about 2.8 million miles away (.03 AU), and slightly inclined to Earth's orbit of the sun.

       Hey didn't Harold Camping originally project the end of days for Oct 21, 2011? I remember reading about how that was his original date, which he changed to May 21, then back again to October 21 shortly before his rapturefail induced stroke. I'm sure you can work comet Elenin in there, too. I figure this is some sort of synchronicity. Is it a coincidence that a previously unknown stellar object reaches it's perihelion with the sun exactly ten years after 19 Saudi jackasses were allowed to board remote controlled airplanes bound for buildings designed by the bin laden family's fave architect? Is it also a coincidence that this orbital body reaches it's closest approach right around the time that Camping, Calleman and Lungold predicted major events? From this angle, December 21 2012 is a giant headfake to make you think potential doom is further out. What if TSHTF long before 2012?

       December 21, 2012 is the day we enter the new Age of the Aquarius. It has to do with astrology and the twelve signs of the Zodiac. This is the reason why the Mayans predicted this date.

       You might want to read more about this Age. The actual date of transition is highly contentious and few, if any, agree on the same century, let alone a single date.

       That's a human misconception.

       Most things change form enough for humans to classify them as something else, imposing an arbitrary "ending" to them.
