       Don’t Get Married, Exhibit #2,762: John Cleese Gets Fucked by the Long Strap-On of the Divorce Courts

       another story.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 51, Tippett is broken, bankrupt and bunking in the guest room of his parents’ Burlington home after a divorce settlement that’s left him $75,000 in debt and racking up $1,000 more each month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, he’ll appear in court at a default hearing to try to explain why he can’t afford to pay his ex-wife (the couple had no children) $3,300 a month, $16,000 in retroactive alimony and $42,000 of her court costs out of a complex case he himself still doesn’t understand.

      <p>
       Some ideas that occurred to me about what needs to change:(perhaps write your congressmen?)
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Child support and ex spouse support should never exceed ability to pay. Specifically should not be based on gross pay before taxes and specifically must leave paying man/woman with ability to support himself/herself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         child and spousal support payments should always be adjusted in cases of lost income. Even married families children suffer lost income when someone suffers a loss of income. divorced parent's families aren't magically immune from this reality of job firings or demotions or other losses of income.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Payments should be set aside for child care and not commingled with ex partner's personal income (like a child actor film industry Coogan trust fund).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Child support should be proportional to time the child spends with each parent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No debt should be incurred if unable to pay.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ex wives should not get alimony in equal rights society. If they were business partners and claim rights to income based on business grown during marriage then then their business agreements should determine business grow proceeds.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         no statutory common law marriage by state laws after passage of time. only marriage by mutual agreement.
It's unconstitutional. States shouldn't be able to force people into marriage they obviously have not made the decision to formalize themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         City state and federal law enforce ment should not have automatic arrest laws or a "second set of procedural books" that violate basic constituional rights against illegal arrest with little or no evidence as tom ball made us aware they do (even if exwife doesn't want to file complaints) .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All local law enforcement \should recieve a prompt letter form the US attorney general reminding them their policies may not violate constitutional rights.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Any federal department/agnecy regarding domestic issues such as divorce and child support issues should be gender free and run by gender neutral administrators rather than womens rights departments which currently exist.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         distinction should be made between what used to be known as rape which determined current harsh punishments still in place - violent rape at gun or knifepoint with pain and threat of physical harm _ and the "new" definitions of rape which are often blurred, mutual drunken statements of post coital regret and are NOT deserving of anywhere NEAR the same levels of punishment if any.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rape charges must have sufficient evidence before rights and freedom depriving arrests can take place. Accusing word of someone is not enough.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         False rape charges should be treated and punished as kidnapping attempts because loss of freedom of victim is the same.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Immediate federal medical research investments should be made to ASAP provide men with same level of contraception as women's pill or IUD. many things are currently being tested. They should be federally fast tracked. (no a condom is not the same. do women get forced to have sex while wearing a bag or not having sex at all?) Full sexual rights and control of reproduction should be a men's right as much as it is a woman's' right today.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Men sometimes default on their child support for no good reason, other than they don't want to pay. But more often, men are being financially raped by the system that supports the woman first, second and always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even where no child is involved, women almost always win out in divorce cases. Why should a woman get anything when there's a divorce? Other than what she owns before the divorce?
      </p>
      <p>
       The divorce laws were written during a time when women did not work, did not drive cars, and stayed at home doing housework all day. They were written to protect women -- but women don't need that protection any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a man, divorce often means financial ruin that can endure for decades. Is it any wonder that some men try to get out of paying what they are ordered to pay to women who now hate them, have secretly taken good jobs but don't declare their income, and are now living with another wealthy man? This happens all the time. I know of many cases from personal experience.

       What I thought happened
      </p>
      <p>
       His child support payments were $250 a month. He kept getting behind, and on his fifth "civil disobedience", the courts sentenced him to 6 months in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       While in jail, the amount of child support due increased to $5,700 and when he could not pay that, they sentenced him to 12 months in jail.

       No. 
You are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man left a 15 page detailed report discussing the problems with the system and your 3 sentence  trivial summary missed all the points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the fact you missed every other important point in the dialog concerning the amounts and ability to pay and the problems with the system that left him a slave in a broken family that didn't want to even be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       so instead of incorrectly summarizing something to minimize it which leaves readers with a false impression that this was about a trivial $250 a month debt (which it wasn't) why not actually just stay out of the discussion if you don't won't to talk about the actual problems associated with court awards in domestic issues?

       He didn't kill himself in protest for any of the trivial financial things you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first article some of the real problems are relayed. including his wife being threatened into calling the police on him, inability to see his children and being given his life back dispite being found not guilty of any offence, harassment by court ordered biased/financially driven"counsellors" and threats of jail time (which for a honourable person actually are a huge affront.)
      </p>
      <p>
       some quotes below:
      </p>
      <p>
       Karen had called Monadnock Family Services after the incident and was allegedly told that if she did not report the incident to police, that she would be arrested for child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       She called Jaffrey PD out of fear of what the government people would do to her family (steal her kids if they were both arrested) and because of their mandatory arrest policy in domestic violence cases, Thomas was arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was found not guilty of simple assault in Cheshire Superior Court, despite slapping his daughter multiple times and causing bleeding. The Jaffrey PD apparently admitted that pressing forward as a domestic violence case was a mistake. His wife’s testimony shows he did not have a history of violence. Thomas figured he’d get to see his kids again after the not guilty. He figured wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court continued to press for counseling at Monadnock Family Services (MFS) prior to allowing Thomas unsupervised visits with his kids. Of course, this is a huge racket for MFS, who likely is paid for every one of the cases they are sent by the court, either by the people involved or by the state of NH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas’ odyssey with Cheshire superior court’s “justice” system stretched for an entire decade of his life, and despite making child support payments and having unsupervised visitation with his young son, he was unable to have unsupervised visitation with his two daughters, not because he was considered a danger, but because he refused to attend counseling as ordered by the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did he refuse? Because the location of the counseling was to be Monadnock Family Services, the very same agency that he believed was responsible for escalating the situation and intimidating Karen Ball into calling the police in the first place. He wanted the decision on unsupervised visits to be made by the court, but the court kept passing the buck to MFS
      </p>
      <p>
       therefore he did not participate, as he felt the case worker had a vendetta against him, as she allegedly refused to meet with him until he “changed his attitude”.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2009 he lost his job and was unable to continue making child support payments. As a result, Karen filed for a hearing on contempt of court, which the court scheduled for 6/24, next Friday.
