       Mr Fulford seems to be very smart and certainly has worked with some powerful people or organizations. His claims are pretty far out there, but often make sense if you are willing to consider that there is a global conspiracy or at least things are not as they seem. I'm with you on this, this raises Fulford's credibility with me quite a bit. In my opinion, Fulford is either legit, or a disinfo persona.

       That's true, once things click into place you see that if certain other things are true, this most likely is as well.

       Take Libya. It is blatantly obvious why we invaded that country, and it wasn't to protect the people (who are arguably better cared for than we Americans). It was for oil and currency, yet here is this mainstream narrative saying we are liberators and many people buy right into it.

       Fulford has been quite accurate on a number of different things.  He believes in peace so I don't understand why so many are against his therories.

       He is a complete ass, in my opinion. Not only does he interrupt constantly to tell us how much he knows what Fulford is talking about, he is constantly asking irrelevant questions that Fulford then has to go off on a tangent to answer, making the updates hard to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem is Rense is trying to do an interview while Fulford is just trying to give an update.

       i did, I found it terribly uneventful because like you said, rense forces him into subjects that are old news.  His interview with david wilcock from last November, in contrast, was awesome.  I like it when fulford just gets to talk.

       It would be quite awesome.  One of my methods by which I verify information that isn't immediately 'mainstream verifiable' is when different figures in the conspiracy world independently corroborate with one another.  That's when I feel quite confident that there is some veracity to whatever that individual is saying.  For example; Fulford still has remnants of his mainstream career - he tries to keep everything on a strictly physical linear world.  He indicates in some interviews (project camelot) that he does believe in spirituality, extra terrestrials and that whole side of the conspiracy, but he doesn't make that a strong issue in his postings.  He focuses on identifiable semi-public figures and mainstream evidence to backup his claims but he doesn't stray towards the "positive thought = positive action" spiritual awakening like wilcock does. Part of this is that everybody has their own limits to what they may believe but are willing to publicly state.  Everyone, to some degree, tones down their concepts to fit into a level of 'fringe' they are comfortable with.  Nobody wants to be called a crackpot. Yet, both Wilcock's ideas and Fulford's claims coexist without contradicting each other while at the same time sometimes corroborating.  This why I really believe
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of what Fulford and Wilcock says.  This happens not just with them though, it can be extended further to include some of Alex Jones, Jordan Maxwell, David Icke to lesser or differing degrees.  The fact is, this thread of truth which began with rumors and "fringe" ideas have been becoming more and more mainstream. If I ever bring up like-ideas in conversation I am astonished at how receptive some people are - or even agree!

       I agree, the mainstream blending in of these concepts has been and is a very interesting thing to watch. 2012 awareness is where I first started noticing this, as even people in my close sphere of friends brought it up years ago and now look where we are. Everyone knows at bare minimum that 2012 is supposed to be a crisis point or awakening. People take these ideas that we have had for many years and bring them into their own reality in a way that works with their existing framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take Wilcock and Fulford, they are each contributing alot to what we know while appealing to people in different stages of evolution -- Wilcock to the spiritual/Et aware crowd and Fulford to us as well as the masses who see this situation from a worldly point of view and are put off by higher perspectives.

       Haha yeah I actually thought I was posting with this one before. No I'm not affiliated with Webre or Salla. I've always thought it would be cool to start a website called exopolitico.com though, where different people from the field could come write articles and give interviews etc, but tbh I don't know how much longer we have left with Ufos and ETs being a fringe subject...

       I have toyed with that idea.  I don't think I have a very good voice but I am in telesales and could maybe bring some production value to it.  I went to school for film studies and over my lifetime have collected some nice equipment.  I haven't been motivated to make anything in quite a while and I have been getting the feeling that what is going on is going to make me want to get back into editing and story crafting.  Throw some of your ideas out and let's brainstorm!

       It was always plain that Tesla's career withered because he had few friends in business, it's not a long jump that he had enemies in business as well.

       You have to admit, in spite of his crazy proclamations, that his credentials are spotless, if not exemplary (Reuters). Unless he's a hired disinfo agent, or under mind control, he's probably right on most counts, barring a little paranoia.

       Posting a conspiracy theory as fact. Yep, this is definitely r/conspiracy. Oh, and by the way, this guy also thinks that the US orchestrated the recent earthquake in Japan (see
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Fulford">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Fulford
       </a>
       ). This doesn't invalidate his other claims of course, but it puts some things in perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, you guys are aware that free energy is impossible, under our current understanding of physics? Nobody, especially not Tesla, has been able to create it, and it is the foundation on which a large number of physical concepts are built. Tesla was no magician.

       The energy we observe coming from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation is produced by nuclear fusion of hydrogen. This process creates more energy than is needed to start the process, and is therefore exothermic. You can read about it more at numerous places throughout the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This energy is only "free" in the sense of being created from nothing from the viewpoint of a naive person on earth.

       Depends on your definition of free energy. Something for nothing is impossible. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we already have free energy in places around the world. Wind farms. Wave farms. Turbines. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can find a way to tap the magnetic field of the earth, it'll be "free" power too. Doesn't mean it comes from nothing though.

       That's what free energy means. You can't just redefine the term. And I'm pretty sure that's not how Tesla meant it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Ok, perhaps free energy isn't actually the best term to use, since there are other concepts known by that name. The concept we're talking about is described in wikipedia as

       I thought tesla wanted to tap the Ionsphere when he realised that it could amplify (greatly) a signal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he would send up a signal, and when it returned it was stronger than when it was sent.

       Ok well that doesn't really make any sense, so I'll just assume you're talking about the free energy part.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are almost literally zero trained physicists who believe that free energy/perpetual motion is possible. It violates too many of the laws that we have derived over the years. Note that these laws are accepted as legitimate because they describe the universe accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Tesla not being a magician? Well, Tesla is certainly a common object of attention by crackpots. However, the fact is that Tesla didn't do anything that we don't understand today. He was being innovative for his time certainly, but it's not like anything he did still escapes our understanding.

       Also, the problem is not that it's "outside our [or my] comprehension". The problem is that there is absolutely zero actual evidence to back it up, and so it is therefore probably false.

       Depends on your definition of free energy. Something for nothing is impossible. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we already have free energy in places around the world. Wind farms. Wave farms. Turbines. etc.

       If we can find a way to tap the magnetic field of the earth, it'll be "free" power too. Doesn't mean it comes from nothing though.

       I agree, the mainstream blending in of these concepts has been and is a very interesting thing to watch. 2012 awareness is where I first started noticing this, as even people in my close sphere of friends brought it up years ago and now look where we are. Everyone knows at bare minimum that 2012 is supposed to be a crisis point or awakening. People take these ideas that we have had for many years and bring them into their own reality in a way that works with their existing framework.

       Now take Wilcock and Fulford, they are each contributing alot to what we know while appealing to people in different stages of evolution -- Wilcock to the spiritual/Et aware crowd and Fulford to us as well as the masses who see this situation from a worldly point of view and are put off by higher perspectives.

       Oh really!  I have noticed exopolitiko on here before and really enjoyed 'his' posts.  It's interesting also that I mentioned how everybody has different levels of conspiricism that they are willing to admit.  Are you in any way related to exopolitics the website?
