<p>Around May of 1983, approximately 4 months before being shot down in KAL007, Congressman Larry McDonald takes on Pat Buchanan and Tom Braden on Crossfire as they badger him about his new role as Chairman of the John Birch Society. He easily handles them and answers questions concerning the Elite&#39;s Conspiracy for a One World Government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRkCvubUGCM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRkCvubUGCM</a></p>

<p>This video highlights some of the more important quotes and passages taken from the books of former CFR archivist, Georgetown professor and Bill Clinton mentor, Carroll Quigley. This includes passages from &#39;Tragedy and Hope&#39; (1966), as well as &#39;The Anglo-American Establishment&#39; (1982). The books provide a look into the inner workings of the elite bureacracies that run the world today, from one of the conspirators themselves. This video is an excellent start for those unfamiliar with Quigley and are just waking up to the agenda, as these are irrefutable quotes from an insider and undeniable proofs of a massive, longstanding conspiracy against the people, not only of the US, but the entire world.</p>

<p>In all honesty, what the fed is doing right now is suicidal and unprecedented. When looking at the data for the last several years its hard to not think they are destroying the economy intentionally. </p>

<p>I guess I will just put these up now rather than later</p>

<p>These graphs depict the following from top to bottom:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Velocity of Money which is the frequency in which it is circulated/spent. Basically how much is just sitting around.</p></li>
<li><p>Federal Deficit: self explanatory and staggering. </p></li>
<li><p>Excess Reserves: How much money do the banks have deposited at the Fed.</p></li>
<li><p>Monetary base: Basically how much money is being printed. The circled portion is the dot com bust and what Greenspan did to ease fears and that action was criticized. Laughable when you look further down the timeline. Where the spike starts is where Tarp starts. Tarp ends at $1 trillion. The rest is &quot;too big to fail&quot; free money for the people that put us here in the first place. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Such is the way society has been run for thousands of years. The rich and powerful want to stay that way. It wasn&#39;t created like this; it is the natural progression of things. </p>

<p>In the wild there are leaders and there are followers. Alphas and Betas. The instinctual drive for power still very much exists in humans, at all levels.</p>

<p>The people pulling the strings in the US don&#39;t pull them for the Illuminati or whatever you want to call it. They pull the strings for the rich people and corporations. It sucks, but it isn&#39;t a NWO. It&#39;s the same shit we&#39;ve always had in a different form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im interested as well. In the last 5 years ago Ive heard about a 2 different engineering start up designed to take the need for oil out of the gasoline our cars use. One of them had success in fabricating a mixture that worked as efficiently as gas while only costing about $1.30/gallon. They sent in for a patent. Later they were contacted by someone who claimed to represent the interest of Exxon-Mobil. The conversation went along the lines of &#39;you will stop the fabrication of what you are awaiting patent approval for, or you and your company will disappear.&#39; </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t stop for a few months after I heard about the phone call, and then the founder of the startup had an investor meeting out of state. He was never heard from or seen ever again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t have the technology. It&#39;s that the mass consumers of the world(i.e. The G8) wont accept a car that doesn&#39;t perform to what they have become accustomed to. If someone comes up with something that can be mass produced cheap and perform to the same standards they would steal the technology or just buy the person off.It happens all the time.They have no need to &quot;knock off&quot; inventors.It&#39;s inventors with financial backing or money that they would delte.</p>

<p>How much of a conspiracy exists in an organized way to rule the world is entirely up for debate.</p>

<p>The new world order you hear Bush and Kissinger mentioning on youtube is actually a movement to strengthen international law through the united nations. It has nothing to do with a secret cabal of illuminati trying to take over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that depends on what you mean by a world government?</p>

<p>If you mean totalitarian rulers governing over a world of slaves. No.</p>

<p>If you mean a powerful elite that rule the world through debt. Yes.</p>

<p>If you mean an elected UN with some sovereignty over the decisions of nation states. Yes.</p>

<p>If you mean depopulating the planet and creating a master race through eugenics. No.</p>

<p>Men drawn to power will always exist in the elites of our society, there will always be those that seek to control the will of men.</p>

<p>Some will do it through military might, some economic, most through both.</p>

<p>The conspiracy hardcores will tell you that the jews are intent on ruling the world and punishing everyone.</p>

<p>People like myself who are students of international law will tell otherwise.</p>

<p>My point is that the NWO is as nebulous a term as &#39;democracy&#39;. Those that fear it will try to convince you that globalists want to enslave you. Those that see the potential for international law to make the world a better place will tell you a different story.</p>

<p>You yourself will have to figure out what it means for you.</p>

<p>I encourage you to check out all of the hype on youtube, some of it is credible, but if you form your opinion based solely on infowars and youtube you will be left totally misinformed. </p>

<p>You may well be correct but I&#39;m not sure there is sufficient evidence to prove/disprove this sentiment at all levels of the Global Elite.  I think that your background/knowledge of law and international relations has given you a more benign view of those in control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major conspiracy around the Bilderberg meetings is that it&#39;s not just the wealthy or people in positions of political power who meet there. Famous, trusted journalists are sometimes invited to these meetings. It&#39;s the utter secrecy about what these great powers and minds are discussing. That is what is so concerning. Why do they all get invited, but can&#39;t share what is going on inside.
Stay skeptical.It keeps you real, but don&#39;t dismiss anything without checking it out for yourself.Check it out properly. Don&#39;t just take it as a possible truth because some guy with a fancy website or video said all &quot;these things are connected.&quot; Good luck.</p>

<p>Is Builderberg a meeting of world governments and industries?  Or, is it a meeting of individual members, some who happen to be employed by the government, and have the ability to peddle government influence.  Believe it or not, there&#39;s a difference.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t elect representatives to make closed door deals with foreign bodies.  Members of the US government should not be selling influence to the government for personal gain.  They should not hold any allegiance to anyone other than the people that elected them.  You elect representatives to openly represent you.  In the US, there are laws that prevent government officials from attending private meetings like this.</p>

<p>Members of the US government should not be lying about attending these meetings.</p>

<p>You simply don&#39;t allow your elective representatives to hold secrete allegiances.  But, it seems that is what happens.</p>
