       By now, almost everyone is aware that Bill Gates thinks that solar power is "cute".  Just now, I read
       <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20110615p2a00m0na001000c.html">
        this article from Japan
       </a>
       , where the author makes a number of logically flawed attacks on solar power as a replacement for nuclear. It gives the impression that the author is aware that there is no reason to oppose solar power anymore, so he resorts to an entirely emotional argument, which basically boils down to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Just think about it. Could you catch rabbits using a solar-powered buggy? I would go for a car with a diesel engine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       With solar power scheduled to replace coal as the cheapest power source in 2 or 3 years, is there a conspiracy being put in place to prevent solar power from coming into widespread use?  What will the Bill Gates of the world do in order not to relinquish their centralized control of electricity generation?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       Solar is
       <a href="http://www.celsias.com/article/nanosolars-breakthrough-technology-solar-now-cheap/">
        already cheaper than coal
       </a>
       or according to other sources will reach that level within

       But licensing patents for renewable energy tech

       They just haven't figured out how to extract as much money from us as they do today with oil.. Solve that problem, and you'll see solar everywhere, regardless of how efficient it is, or how much oil is left underground.

       Don't buy a solar system from a power company.  Buy one from a local contractor/solar company that makes a living doing it.  Think of them as local energy artisans.

       What's wrong with the solar system from the power company?  They install it for you and you can make monthly payments to pay off the total cost, plus you can sell any unused energy back to the company, so everyone benefits.

       I just imagined ordering a Solar System (star, planets et al.) from the power company.  Funny...
      </p>
      <p>
       In looking at the ones I know about vs the systems that a smaller company can design and install it is about the flexibility of the business model.  The power company will create a payment system with a generous buffer to make the actual cost of the system comparable or marginally cheaper than staying on the regular power system.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you compare the end to end cost over say 10-15 years depending. it is a far higher cost getting into business with the power company than engaging a seasoned solar professional and paying them for the system and installation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not suggest you borrow money or purchase on credit. That is a fundamental control system currently being used en masse. It erodes your ability to be free of things you have no dominion over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power company will be just as happy to buy the excess energy from you regardless if you bought the system from them or not.  At least where I live. In the end spinning the numbers to see the true ROI of a solar system should be the deciding factor.  If you are building a new house or doing a large renovation to an older property this is the optimal time to install, as it can be folded into the big unavoidable credit block needed to pay for something of that size.  An excellent option if you have some open land you own is to build a solid base (cement/steel) and put panels on posts.  It would be comparable to having your own solar farm. Then it can be added to, or simply upgraded and there is no need to design the panel systems into your home. In theory...

       Well oil companies have been against it for simply business reasons. The control was clearly evident with an electric car that came out about half a decade ago. The EV, where they somehow disappeared from the market until the Prius that you know today came out(much later). Anyway, it is opposed by many people for many reasons.

       And look at the designs of the electric cars. They look so horrible no one wants to buy one. I wouldn't be caught dead in one, and I'm not much of a fashion guy.

       Nissan just came out with a full-electric car, and it

       About what I saw. So that takes it out of the majority of buyers. Think purchase price, loan coast (almost double what you pay for the car, usually) repair costs, maintenance costs, and insurance. Way out of reach of many people.

       I am heir (for lack of better words) to a 80 year old American MFG company. The electricity bill avg for our 350,000 sq. ft. facility is $30,000/month!! I have been researching solar tech. and the start up costs are astronomical...would be offset by not having to pay 30k a month but the upfront capital investment is huge...

       You don't need to do solar panels.. my understanding is that it's more cost effective and efficient to go with giant sunlight reflectors that concentrate the energy to boil water and drive steam turbines.

       They have to convince everyone we need these sources of fossil fuel by designing systems that are reliant on them.   I think we have been tricked into not using more solar power.   The sun actually provides 99% of our energy here on earth.   That is like saying coal wasn't made from the solar energy, bahaha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solar is the best form of nuclear energy, it takes fission particles(protons) and converts them directly into moving electrons.  The nuclear reaction takes place on the sun and there is no water involved.  But you would never hear that argument.

       Japan is home to Toyota, the world's largest auto maker as well as Honda, Suzuki, et al. A large part of the Japanese economy is dependant on the manufacture of complex internal combustion engines. If cars go electric, it hurts Japan. Especially if the relatively simple electric cars are made by China at wages that no longer can support Japanese workers. The electric companies also have big investments in power stations which they want to make profits from. Solar hurts their bottom line.

       I disagree with your idea. I'm half japanese and I lived in Japan for more than 10 years. I can assure you that Japanese are enviormentally minded, in fact, during the global warming scare, the only thing I remember seeing on TV was about climate change and how we can reduce it by using alternative energy. It would make sense for Japan to advertise solar energy because Japan is a very small country and has almost no natural resources.

       The only conspiracy about solar energy is that it's not very efficient. It doesn't deliver much power (try running a car on solar panels that are on top of the car), it only works while the sun shines, and the solar panels are expensive, fragile, and have a short lifespan. How do you store the solar power during the night? That is also expensive.

       There are these things called batteries that are pretty good at storing electricity, or so I've heard.  Also, excess power can be sold back to the grid.

       Batteries have a short lifespan, and are very expensive. You can only dump so much power back onto the grid at peak solar generating times before the grid can't use any more. Then what do you do with it? Nothing, unless you have a place to store it.

       Here is my experience.  Solar is a big link in a project I have been working on for some time.  I have spoken to people from universities, our provincial government, people in the federal government, city officials, builders, name it.  Every single time it's mentioned the response is very measured, negative and begins with, That technology is still decades away. They pat me on my head and send me on my way. I have planned to just build what I'm gonna build and use it. When it's working, If I can make it work, I probably won't care too much about their responses anymore. I'll be sharing the info and others can do it too.  There are so many people out there like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced this should be a decentralized technology adopted by those willing to learn how it works and how to maintain it for themselves. Most people want the result without the effort.  this opens them up to the whims of corporations who will try to figure out a way to make you pay for your solar energy by the month, take the extra power and sell it to the highest bidder. In Alberta the power companies are doing their best to lock this down like this and the province seems super good with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't even want to acknowledge solar furnace technology. I suppose any new technology has it's uphill battle.

       Similar with this, there is also a big misunderstanding in nuclear energy. Sure, the nuclear waste is difficult to place, but other than that, Nuclear power plants kill less people than coal and has less radiation. Also, one of the reasons why the Nuclear power plant in Japan had a melt down is becuase it was a 40-50 year old model and cheaply made. (it's kinda like trying to run you're 20 year old computer).

       Solar energy is unique in that it is subject to Moore's law, and it continues to get exponentially cheaper.  Nuclear cannot compete with that.
