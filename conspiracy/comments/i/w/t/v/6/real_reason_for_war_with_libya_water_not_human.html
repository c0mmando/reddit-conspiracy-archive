       There are lots of reasons the west is at war with Libya, whether they are warranted or not needs a lot more digging. Muammar Gaddafi has done many amazing things in his life, he has also done many horrible things. I still feel he should be removed from power based on his recent actions regardless here is some interesting info pointing to possible real reasons for the west's war with Libya:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya sits on top of one of the largest fresh water aquifers in the world.
         <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/03/libyas_water_supply">
          Link
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to this guy's
         <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CnwNyeSSm8&amp;feature=related">
          video
         </a>
         on yew tube they have completely financed the project internally with no help from the IMF or World Bank.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Ahhh sorry i'm on my way to work! Late, will update to finish when I can. Ekk, anyways just some more stuff to ponder over. If you have any more credible info please submit!

       Yes because they are already under zionists controlled central banks. But what if gaddafi kept bringing up the subject, then people would start to listen and demand change. They wanted to silence him.

       Ghaddafi trying to introduce a gold-dinar currency was probably the main reason, perhaps there were other reasons as well.

       Whether* And I think there is war because Libya wont accept a central bank and has had talks about setting up a gold based currency. This would drastically shift the power of the world both politically and monetarily. They're pissing off the IMF, World Bank, FED, etc, those currently in power.

       While the fresh water supply in the US is a concerning issue, this does sound a little crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if you just roll with the idea, there may be a lot of money to be made by restricting and selling water in the area around libya. War is NEVER about human rights. If it was we'd be at war with isreal, china, iran.. etc. It's about profit and extortion.

       Water by itself has very limited value, unless you are experiencing a severe shortage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real value of water is that with it you can grow crops for export and use it as a feedstock for industrial/consumer products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term that has best explained the value of water internationally is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_water">
        virtual water
       </a>
       . Check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a valuable commodity as many parts of Europe imports their fruits and vegetables from other parts of Africa (where water scarcity is becoming a bigger and bigger issue).
      </p>
      <p>
       The advantage for the US is mostly in oil and profits for US oil companies, as well as financial companies that may profit from the flow of petrodollars. Additionally, one of the common purchases made with petrodollars is to buy US government debt, something the 'rebels' might be coerced into doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would tie them to the international financial system in a way Libya has so far avoided.

       The conspiracy is that the IMF and the World Bank, put pressure on western nations to destabilize Libya. Libya was becoming a self reliant nation with the power of a debt free society and ability to export oil, food, and water to neighboring nations slowly building a stabilized Africa.
