<p>*That may not add up later, once things calm down in a few days.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: No where did I claim at anytime that this was an inside job, just passing along a message to save anything that you come across. If anything this may help find out who did this and why...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Setting your DVR to record a news station: Fox News would be the best for the most sensational coverage. Just a thought.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: This may be a stretch, but Fox News is obviously affiliated with Murdoch, which some people have pushed Oslo as a distraction from his troubles. </p>

Currently there are probably tens of thousands of eyewitnesses, some claiming one blast, some claiming two, some claiming gunshots, a plane etc. I&#39;ll bet even stations are reporting conflicting information. I remember when 9/11 happened, first there was a report that 3 planes flew into the Towers. Then no, wait, it was only two planes and 3 more were hijacked and shot down by the military. No wait, 5 planes, 2 hit the towers, 2 hit the Pentagon and one landed in Philly. It&#39;s all meaningless, because nobody has a clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was also apparently published in 2010, so I guess it is less significant than I thought it was, and standing alone (even if published last week) it isn&#39;t as suspicious until you start contemplating it with other things.</p>

<p>For me, the immediate implication of Islamic groups for this plot does make me suspicious for several reasons.  Indulge me for a moment:</p>

<p>1) Israel has been lobbying quite heavily for countries to vote against the Palestinian cause for statehood due for vote in the UN in September. There are HUGE implications for Israel if this measure passes. It puts them up against a wall--arguably it could mean embargoes and sanctions for them, and there would be no US Security Counsel veto to get them out of it (I say this because resolutions already voted on by the US like UN 242 which have remained unenforced because of the ambiguity of &quot;Palestinian&quot; borders, would now be completely unambiguous). Norway just announced it would vote for Palestinian statehood. They are a NATO country, they are highly regarded. This is very problematic for Israel. </p>

<p>2) Israel only last month insisted on its armed agents to be stationed in every European airport. A big stink was made of this in Denmark (Norway&#39;s southern neighbor) and Israel stopped flights out of Denmark. Many people (including myself) were speculating this meant Israel was either planning something for Europe or aware of something being planned in Europe. It&#39;s an extremely unusual thing to insist on out of the blue. </p>

<p>3) Apparently Israel has been engaged in an identity theft ring to acquire New Zealand passports for its Mossad agents to run operations overseas. They are known to use these passports because of their ease in acquiring and their universal acceptance by foreign governments as being innocuous identities to assume. </p>

<p>4) Norway would be an unusual target for an Islamic group. I get the whole issue with the publication of the Danish cartoons, but this in and of itself is a rather big leap to link a group like Al Qaeda to. There are far more attractive targets for Islamic extremists, and Norway tends to be perceived as being relatively Arab friendly, or at least neutral (certainly friendly with regard to the Palestine issue). </p>

<p>5) The bomb was a rather sophisticated device. Very powerful. Very well placed. &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; (whatever that means anymore) has fumbled with underwear bombs and shoe bombs since their capabilities have been diminished and their &quot;organization&quot; has been destroyed over the past few years. This looks much more like something a more sophisticated government sponsored agency would pull off--CIA, Mossad, MI6, etc. </p>

<p>6) No Islamic group has taken &quot;credit&quot; for this (which typically happens rather quickly), yet you have the typical American media propaganda talking about &quot;Islamic chatter on the internet cheering it&quot;... as though that means something... I can link you to dozens of twitter posts from Israelis cheering this event because of Norway&#39;s announced vote for Palestinian statehood. Here&#39;s just one of numerous I&#39;ve run across:     <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JerusalemOne/status/94419103799975936">http://twitter.com/#!/JerusalemOne/status/94419103799975936</a></p>

<p>7) The Jerusalem Post within an hour or two after the bombing publishes an article suggesting that Al Qaeda could be involved... again it&#39;s ridiculous at this point to make that suggestion. The related shooting involved a man that was described as &quot;Nordic&quot; in appearance.  I don&#39;t know of any Nordic looking Islamic fundamentalists.</p>

<p>There are just too many things that point in the Mossad&#39;s direction to at least not raise an eyebrow and wonder. Now if it&#39;s some kind of domestic terror, I suppose we can write it off to that. I am not aware of what sort of domestic terror organizations (if any) exist in Norway. But with all this pointing to the Mossad, and the immediate media finger pointing to Islamic terror organizations and &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; immediately sets off my bullshit detector.</p>

<p>Do you still feel that claim is accurate even though the suspect is a big, blonde, Norwegian native? While it might have looked like a setup if this had in fact been Muslims, but it&#39;s sound more like a Timothy McVey.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anyone trying to pin this on Muslims yet except the conspiracy community. Sounds like some homebrew extremism so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel less confident in the claim to be honest with you.  As I said below, I made a mistake on the date.  This article was actually published in 2010.  </p>

<p>There are other things that are bugging me about this now that we&#39;re learning more.  Logistically, I don&#39;t know how this guy pulls this off on his own.  Unless he had help, or was very well trained,  this lone nut theory doesn&#39;t really make any sense.</p>

<p>The timing of this is still strange, and I can&#39;t quite put my mind around it.  You have the issue with Norway announcing their stance on endorsing Palestinian statehood just a couple days ago.  Here&#39;s another thing-- the 65th anniversary of the King David Hotel bombing is today.  That was a huge Zionist/terrorist event.  This guy apparently is a staunchly pro-Israeli &quot;conservative&quot; Christian who&#39;s overtly expressed aversions against Muslims.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that are suspicious, and I really haven&#39;t been able to digest it all yet to come up with a cogent theory.</p>

<p>But something doesn&#39;t quite sit right.  (Just my honest take--take it for what it&#39;s worth).</p>

On one hand, you have mainstream feelings which will lead us into the conclusion that muslim extermists did this and we are well aware that they are capable of doing such an ugly operation but why, why would they do it knowing that Norway has and will always help the Palestinians and Muslims in general to acquire their rights. And on the other hand, you&#39;ve got the profile of the suspect, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14259989">Anders Behring Breivik</a> who is claimed to have right-wing views and the evidence is his facebook and twitter statements but the funny thing is, they were setup few days ago on July 17.

<p>The wikileaks cables show Norway felt &quot;immune&quot; from terrorist attacks and that groups such as Al Qaeda were ‚Äúnot a direct threat‚Äù, I feel the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of ways to answer this question. One is that the conspiracy sub as you would like it is just a circle jerk. Other opinions create balance, and balance is sorely needed by some posters.</p>

<p>Another answer is that its interesting that you presume to want to find the &#39;real&#39; reasons for events, (that are supposedly hidden from &#39;normal&#39; people, who are mere sheeple cannon fodder for the Illuminati or rogue secret societies), yet if those opinions don&#39;t fit your version of reality then you reject them.  You are just as blinded by your beliefs as you assume others are to the reality.</p>

<p>Thirdly unless you make this sub a closed shop, then other people will actually see your posts, and assume that you have the intestinal fortitude to be able to back up your opinions, instead of whining about being picked on and yelling that they go away.</p>

<p>Frankly, as regards this event, there isn&#39;t a &quot;real&quot; answer being offered by &quot;normal&quot; people.  The media seems to be doing it&#39;s routine circle jerk of blaming Muslims and pointing to unidentified &quot;internet chatter&quot; on &quot;Islamic sites&quot; whatever the fuck that&#39;s supposed to mean.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve outlined a pretty detailed theory on my suspicions of the Mossad&#39;s involvement on this.  Others have as well.  Perhaps rather than coming in here trying to engage in a pissing contest, why not critique those comments?</p>

<p>Your criticisms candidly thus far are rather adolescent.  You come in here with a laundry list of assumptions, point to nothing, advance nothing substantive, and engage in the very kind of cliche circle jerk you accuse people in this forum of engaging in.</p>

<p>You said you came in here to offer an alternative view.  Well for fuck sake, offer it.  And I&#39;ll let you make your cute little reply and let you have the last word, unless that is you actually want to debate some of the substantive points raised in this topic (and there have been many) in which case I would be more than happy to engage you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of ways to answer this question. One is that the conspiracy sub as you would like it is just a circle jerk. Other opinions create balance, and balance is sorely needed by some posters.</p>

<p>Another answer is that its interesting that you presume to want to find the &#39;real&#39; reasons for events, (that are supposedly hidden from &#39;normal&#39; people, who are mere sheeple cannon fodder for the Illuminati or rogue secret societies), yet if those opinions don&#39;t fit your version of reality then you reject them.  You are just as blinded by your beliefs as you assume others are to the reality.</p>

<p>Thirdly unless you make this sub a closed shop, then other people will actually see your posts, and assume that you have the intestinal fortitude to be able to back up your opinions, instead of whining about being picked on and yelling that they go away.</p>

<p>This is a total setup.</p>

<p>Do you still feel that claim is accurate even though the suspect is a big, blonde, Norwegian native? While it might have looked like a setup if this had in fact been Muslims, but it&#39;s sound more like a Timothy McVey.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anyone trying to pin this on Muslims yet except the conspiracy community. Sounds like some homebrew extremism so far.</p>
