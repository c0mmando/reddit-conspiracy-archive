<li> I&#39;m in my mid 30&#39;s &amp; can remember when mp3&#39;s were first introduced to the internet.  Do you know what a Midi file is &amp; what that sounded like?  I have participated in/learned almost every new form of social media since the 90&#39;s.  I first joined facebook when it required a .edu email to join.  Napster, morpheus, bearshare, then eventually bittorrent.  Its takes time to learn how to use new technologies but i usually learn how the designer intended for it to be used.  It used to take only 2 days to be able to comment on reddit subs after you create a new account.  When i created this account it was 7 days before i was allowed to post.  That was a new change in the last 6-9 months.  Its not always easy to figure out what the rules are but you gotta know the rules to play the game.  Does this help?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. So I looked some of this up, and I think I understand the economics behind it. My government has done similar things in similar circumstances. Could it not be argued that he was doing so to prevent economic hardship and further recession? ie: by providing liquidity to said industries and preventing disruption of credit? I mean, what was the alternative? To be honest, I don&#39;t think this fits the (rather dramatic) thread title.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t make fucking metathreads every fucking day. I fucking hate metathreas because they are fucking dumb and worthless most of the time. I despise people like skygirl or whatever the fuck his name is because I see him as part of the conspiracy to divide us. Rule 10 has prevented me saying more about him publicly, so I always just downvoted and reported him. </p>

<p>And YOU were the first one to make a huge meta thread where you were considering banning me because I was talking about the Trump/Russia conspiracy mostly and my username is TrumpRusConspiracy. I didn&#39;t even know about it until someone PM&#39;d me and gave me a warning that you were on the verge of banning me and talking shit about me.</p>

<p>And then you gave me warnings telling me to stop spamming Trump posts, so I did. I tried to respect your wishes and the wishes of the other mods and I drastically reduced how many posts I was submitting. </p>

<p>The whole time after that, I felt like you were just looking for an excuse to ban me so I had to be very careful about what I said even when tons of users like putin_loves_cats and woots and Grarglejobber were constantly attacking me and harrasing me seemingly without repurcursions. They were constantly accusing me of shit and I felt like I couldn&#39;t really defend myself because I was felt like they were trying to push me so that I would say something that would get me banned.</p>

<p>And it seems that has some logic behind it since Dronepuppet was caught trying to do the same fucking thing. </p>

<p>So, yes, I am sorry that forgot that you defended me ONE time, and I&#39;m grateful for when you did it that ONE time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hold you responsible for everything that happens in the sub, but I&#39;m sure you saw people attacking me and harassing me on a regular basis. Where were you then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My personal opinion on what to do that would restore Conspiracy to a conspiracy subreddit was to limit the number of current-politics posts any one user would be allowed to submit in a 24 hour period as well as limiting the account age of users who would be allowed to post politics at all (1 year old accounts or older for example). I&#39;m not 100% sure that these adjustments would have fixed anything at all but I designed the tactic to be tweakable and to effect both sides equally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, your posts are purely political in nature. They always have a question related to them like &quot; hey guys what do you think about this?  Should we believe it or not??? You only post in two subs.  I was much more active in the Reddit community until accounts like yours appeared more frequently.  I am reviewing wha you posts wondering what you are really trying to do here.  It is obvious you are sent here to get people to talk about certain things, but I am not clear on why.  I did see you post the same thing twice in r/the_donald over the course of two days back to back.   I admire whatever group you are apart of, they are definitely in another level of the propaganda machine.  big daddy bernays is smiling down on you </p>

But I live far from United States, and what I can feel about your country is that someone or something (organisations, group of people, industrial, idk) is trying to divide the country, spreading political stuff and controversial topics... It took form with a new way to make politics. A new way of extremism populism with a grain of salt of demagogy.
you&#39;re population keep getting lobotomies from medias and social medias, where plenty of little ants (like this dude) are constantly trying to shape the way they think, the way they vote, the way they hate.
I know the power of media, but it is far beyond that.
Maybe I&#39;m off topic but I got this steange feeling were </p>

<p>When Obama was president you only heard about BLM marches and cops killing black people now you only hear about white supremacy with Donald Trump .  The shit is getting deeper and deeper, I am an investor that pays close attention to geopolitics and how they effect the market.  Sites like these are great research or they were until the political money poured in to steer the conversation </p>
