    <div class="md"><p>im not a person of &quot;i need a guy standing next to an altar telling me what to believe and telling a story about a few doors with a key and knowledge behind one of the doors, handing out the key to a guy.. and whilst telling this story he is contradicting himself in the core of the &quot;story&quot;. nor am i a guy that needs an institution that writes down if you dont pay them taxes you go to hell for sure.
im also not a guy that needs to be told by any books that i have to kill or disrespect my fellow human beeings that dont believe the message what the books or prophets try to deliver. im not the type of human that ignores when a book gets changed many many times to &quot;defuse&quot; its cruelty or listen to claims like misinterpretations. do we believe in the book, or do we edit it as we like it and then believe what we want?
honey, i love you just the way you are!&lt;3 oh by the way babe, see you at the cosmetic surgeon tomorrow. why? because i scheduled an appointment to fix your nose, your teeth, your crows feet wrinkles and get rid of some fat i recently spotted on your hips!</p>

<p>why do u want me to say im scared of something?
if the world is scary, what has it to do with a conspiracy theory? you want to hear that conspiracy theories are causing discomfort? discomfort is that the CIA created the term conspiracy theorist over a &quot;theory&quot; that then was proven as a fact. now everytime the msm or anyone calls out a conspiracy theory if someone says something that might be uncomfortable for the establishment, you should be scared. not by the theory but by the fact the term got invented to discredit people that told the truth.</p>

<p>Indeed we can ... and that starts with <em>you</em> learning all you can about hot &quot;the elites&quot; came into being</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like all of your problems are with the Church and not the religion itself. Could you see yourself as religious if you did not need to associate with the Church? Just wondering...</p>

<p>I used to say and think very similarly to what you state in your comment. Funny thing is the more I looked at weird things, and tried to understand historical mysteries they all seem to circle back to the same place. We are at a weird time for humanity, where mythology, spirituality, and science are all beginning to weave together...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sort of true that my biggest problem is the church. but not only. i dont count &quot;prophets&quot; and hate praying imams as church.  i have a problem with the &quot;mainstream religions&quot; if you wanna say that. if you talk about science by &quot;scientists&quot; the only way its going to weave to is the garbage chuke sooner or later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I guess the science and the weaving together I was talking about can be seen in a couple of examples.</p>

<p>Quantum Physics and the Double Slit Experiment; Proving that observing an event has an impact on the result. Essentially, identifying that human consciousness has an effect on our reality and further experiments have been done to verify this.</p>

<p>Placebo Effect in Medicine; Faith in a solution can be enough to reach that solution. Positive energy and faith can have an impact on our own health and bodies. Also, the discovery of the loss of weight in a human body at death, possibly signifying the soul.</p>

<p>Development of A.I. and Data Collection; Technology is progressing at such a rate where there are many process that involve no human interaction. Including, posts on the internet. I just saw an article with A.I. posting on Yelp! that was indistinguishable from humans.</p>

<p>And I know you already discounted it but, the many different religions with similarities in their prophecies and overall teachings is hard to take as a coincidence. There are so many things going on in the world and allegations of elites participating in secretive societies displaying obvious esoteric symbols in our daily lives, that it really can make you think twice about it all. I am not trying to convince you in anyway, just sharing a viewpoint. Have a good night!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your Arc of Noah statement. I actually believe that the reason so many religions have similarities is because everything in human history is cyclical with variations in severity of events. </p>
