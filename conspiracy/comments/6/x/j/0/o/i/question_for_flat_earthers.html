<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrazano-Narrows_Bridge#Statistics">Because of the height of the towers (693 ft or 211 m) and their distance apart (4,260 ft or 1,298 m), the<strong> curvature of the Earth&#39;s surface</strong> had to be taken into account when designing the bridge—the towers are 1 5⁄8 inches (41.275 mm) farther apart at their tops than at their bases; they are not parallel to each other.</a></p>

<p>Look at the Suez Canal. It&#39;s Length: 120.11 miles (193.30 km)</p>

<p><a href="http://earthcurvature.com">~3000 <em>meter</em> drop of curvature over that distance.</a></p>

<p>The canal was built level. It should either have a noticeable (measurable and recorded/planned) bow in it (like the bow seen in the OP bridge) or it the water should move with the curvature of the earth and there would be a huge bend in the water level across the level canal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 5/8 inches is within any acceptable error rate with such a measurement, if the measurement was even taken.</p>

<p>&quot;Wikipedia&quot; cites two sources for this information:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-verrazano-narrows-bridge-50-years-after-its-construction-180953032/?no-ist">Smithsonian Magazine Article</a> and <a href="http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/veraz.html">the MTA</a></p>

<p>It simply claims they <a href="http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/veraz.html">&quot;compensated for the Earth&#39;s curvature</a> - they also could&#39;ve just built them 1 5/8 inches apart. </p>

<p>If they had built them perfectly level and then later realized they were 1 5/8 inches apart, and then used their theoretical model and it matched observation, that would be supporting experimental data.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.mta.info/bandt/images/02veraz.jpg">The bridge is bowed</a> - it&#39;s curved itself. So if there is even a slight angular difference it explains any tiny gap such as that which is within norms of error.</p>

<p>The bridge itself moves 12 feet depending on expansion and contraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seasonal contractions and expansions of the steel cables cause the double-decked roadway to be 12 feet lower in the summer than in the winter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a matter of Occam&#39;s Razor because you haven&#39;t provided any experimental or observable data to even prove the claims in the OP.</p>

<p>Contrary to that, the same claims are not seen or well known (easily accessible) with the other hundreds of thousands (millions?) of artificial structures. </p>

<p>If anything you could ask what is more likely: That the curvature is easily defined and accounted for in engineering, but no one has actually truly measured and defined that (besides in theoretical modelling), and those observations [histories and methods of construction] are not easily accessible for the multitude of artificial structures (except this one claim which doesn&#39;t even cite observable evidence)</p>

<p>Uh.  Actually they <em>totally</em> agree with me.  What are you talking about?  The very title of the article you linked is:</p>

<p>The Moon Is <strong>(Slightly)</strong> Flat</p>

<p>Hell, even according to the &quot;Round Earthers&quot;, the <em>Earth</em> is &quot;slightly flat&quot; - i.e. it&#39;s a sphere.  It&#39;s a &quot;round&quot; Earth that&#39;s flattened at its center - making it a sphere.</p>

<p>So...the example in your first link actually <em>buoys</em> a spherical, oblate planetoid idea - not &quot;disagrees&quot; with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And you know the shape of the moon in what way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I just said above:  The shaded gradation that occurs approaching the perimeter of the moon, as well as the observable distortion of the rounded craters as they approach its perimeter.</p>

<p>This is exactly what is observed on actual rounded objects here on Earth.</p>

<p>Independent of this, this question is actually shirking my initial question above:  Is <em>every</em> object in the universe flat too then? if the Earth is flat?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>by looking a single side that never moves away from Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It’s assessed by observing how its appearance matches EXACTLY the appearance and shaded gradation that <em>actual spherical objects</em> have here on Earth when one holds said rounded object with their hand and has it right in front of their face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if it is a sphere, that means the ground you are standing on is a sphere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the planet I’m standing on is <em>not</em> a sphere, then that means that this phenomenon is in all likelihood not singular or unique, which means that other objects - especially objects in its near vicinity - should demonstrate similar characteristics.  However, the planetary object closest to it actually <em>doesn’t</em> seem to exhibit such characteristics.  The other planetary objects in its solar vicinity also don’t seem to exhibit such characteristics either.</p>

<p>So the idea that the Earth is flat yet surrounded by a bunch of objects that certainly have the <em>appearance</em> of sphericalness is rather pointedly counter to even the most basic logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trying to understand the deductions you are using...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trying to help you understand them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you were you wouldn&#39;t know you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cogito ergo sum.  My thinking proves that there’s at least a “me” doing the thinking regardless of what that “me” actually is one way or the other.  With that in mind, I look at the world before me, including myself, and it certainly appears VERY not flat.  You’re saying that I am flat yet am interpreting myself and the world around me as having definite shape because I am somehow two dimensional?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice the orange ring just below the magnet.</p>

<p>Tell us if its flat or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The orange ring below the magnet is flat, as it is reflecting on a flat surface.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it have depth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has illusory depth, but not real or actual depth.</p>

<p>A better example you should have used is something like <a href="http://puassets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/businessman-looking-in-mirror-pan_12170.jpg">this.</a></p>

<p>Is the image in the mirror flat or not?  Does it have depth?</p>

<p>The image in the mirror <em>is</em> in fact flat.  It does not have depth.</p>

<p>At that point, however, you have cut off your nose to spite your face because you must account for the source of the reflection.  A reflection itself in no way proves any sort of Flat Earth theory because it presupposes that which is being reflected upon it - an object which <em>isn’t</em> flat.</p>

<p>And yet when you see depth elsewhere you are certain it&#39;s actual depth. Even though it cannot be measured directly [without using a theoretical model which dictates a priori the object is said shape].</p>

<p>Incorrect.  Depends on what kind of depth it is.  I gave you an example above of a time when “actual” depth is perceived, and a time when “possible illusory” depth is perceived.</p>

<p>If you see the world in 3 dimensions but the space around you is 4 or 5 just exactly how do you perceive what &quot;flat&quot; is in 4 or 5 dimensional space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re not attempting to assess “flatness in 4 or 5 dimensional space”.  That’s never been the issue or the argument.  Flatness in THREE dimensional space is what’s been at issue - which almost necessarily does not, almost <em>cannot</em> exist.  Flatness implies lack of breadth, lack of thickness, lack of depth - and this existence definitely has thickness, even if only illusory.</p>

<p>This is an argument in favor of a simulated universe.  This is all good and well, but this is entirely besides the actual point.  I have no problem with this being a simulated existence.  I myself imagine that it almost <em>necessarily</em> is simulated to at least some extent.</p>

<p>You’re assuming that the reality behind the postulated simulation is flat, however, and the argument you use in attempt to prove this cosmic flatness is actually the <em>very</em> reason why you don’t actually know - and at this rate, it seems pretty much <em>can’t</em> know - exactly WHAT is the actual reality behind whatever simulation currently exists, much less what its shape is…and VERY much less that this shape is in any way “flat”.</p>

<p>No. If its illusionary it&#39;s illusionary. You used the mirror example after all.</p>

<p>No because I never attempted to <em>prove</em> anything. In fact my entire point is that we <em>don&#39;t know</em> and any &quot;scientist&quot; that claims they do is full of shit. By definition not a scientist.</p>

<p>Illusory existence is still a type of existence.  It’s just not as “true” (whatever tf that means) as “real” existence (whatever tf that means).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it&#39;s not. By definition that is impossible [the only reality we know is this one, we simulate our reality in simulations - what we perceive | our creation is a simulation | our reality is our reality].</p>

<p>The bracketed statement shows that you don’t know what a simulated existence is.  You’re drawing conclusions from entirely faulty premises - making the conclusions you draw just as faulty.</p>

<p>There need be no “we” that creates the simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense that simulations reflect something in our underlying reality since <strong>we are simulating our reality.</strong>  It does not mean our reality is simulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bolded section is an assumption that is not known.  You are therefore incorrect in assuming it as being valid.</p>

<p>Independent of this, your second sentence, AGAIN invalidates your entire argument because if our reality isn’t simulated, then the universe ISN’T flat given that I and the world around me aren’t flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holographic universe it may be. But it&#39;s really observable evidence that would lead us towards that.</p>

<p>Observable evidence has led to that already.  Remote viewing is a real, testable, proven phenomenon.  That alone shows the holographic nature of existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact many things cannot be explained adds weight to holographic theory.</p>

<p>…I don’t know or see how, but if you are arguing FOR the holographic theory here all the sudden…then you are, again, arguing against your self and your very own “Flat Cosmos” model.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this - which ultimately AGAIN takes the flat cosmos model of existence you seem to have been propounding this entire time and entirely undermines it at its very foundational root.</p>

<p>Hasn’t part of the argument that you’ve made this entire time been that this whole thing <em>is</em> reality to us?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you create a computer game are the NPCs living in a simulation or are they in their reality.</p>

<p>Both.  It’s their reality - <em>and</em> it’s a simulation.</p>

<p>BOOM.  <em>Now</em> you’re starting to get it.  Exactly this.  What that reality actually is is another thing altogether, however, and to postulate that the underlying strata of reality is somehow flat is not only highly unlikely, but cannot really be assessed one way or the other from the perspective of the NPCs in the simulation (in this case, <em>us</em>).</p>

<p>To go back to what you were previously saying then…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense that simulations reflect something in our underlying reality since we are simulating our reality. It does not mean our reality is simulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the proven holographic model of existence it does.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know where you got the idea that I don’t consider the possibility of reality being multidimensional.  I never said or even implied anything like that.</p>

<p>Reality <em>is</em> multidimensional.</p>

<p>I just understand that there is no reason to assume that reality is <em>flat</em>.  That’s a far, far different thing altogether than “not considering the possibility of [a] multi-dimensional reality”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no model. I do not know. I never claimed to know. You are picking a fight with a ghost my friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m picking zero fight.  I’m just letting it be known that if you’re arguing for a flat Earth - which it absolutely seemed you were when you came on here - then either we’re in a simulation which would mean that A) humans can’t know since we’re currently NPCs in that simulation, or B) we’re not in a simulation and therefore existence is simply not flat since it is observably <em>not</em> flat.  Both A and B mean that a flat universe is either flat out wrong, or simply unknowable currently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Essentially my argument is, the Earth may be flat when we are on it, and curved when we are looking at it from another perspective. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you would have come here initially saying that, then we would have had literally none of this conversation because I would have simply said “Yeah.  Sure.  The Earth <em>may</em> be flat.”</p>

<p>“May” means “might be, might not be”.</p>

<p>I’ve no problem with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But outside of that even the &quot;scientists&quot; state the universe is flat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on which “scientists” you refer to.  Others quite validly show it isn’t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>perhaps that may be why we perceive its flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge, we don’t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you add in extra dimensions it allows for an entirely different interpretation. (e.g. when you enter &quot;space&quot; you are entering another dimension.)</p>

<p>Quite possibly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to mistaking my criticism of the standard model and my sympathy for flat earthers as a position that I support flat earth.</p>

<p>Rather in my mind saying the earth is <em>flat</em> or <em>spherical</em> has the same meaning. It&#39;s not something I can observe directly. Anything one cannot observe directly is something that can&#39;t be known. And to be honest, the direct observations [line of sight, perspective, horizon rising to level, etc] all suggest the earth is flat [doesn&#39;t mean it is].</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I <em>believe</em> the earth is flat. I just see the idea as valid as saying it&#39;s spherical. You cannot measure the sphere directly and it cannot be modelled with simple geometry (the Pythagorean system falsifies many of the spherical models).</p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t even contested in &quot;accepted science&quot; since by action they use geodetic systems to map the earth and it must contain error corrections for &#39;gravity&#39;.</p>

<p>So its not that I believe the Earth is flat, but only that it <em>appears</em> so in many ways, and to me thats as valid as creating a arbitrary theoretical model which is about as insightful as simply saying the earth resides on the back of a turtle.</p>

<p>Incorrect.  You don’t know you have an eyeball?  A nose?  Cheeks?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on what information one uses.  Just as much (actually more) data indicating direct observation suggests curvature.</p>

<p>Appears to be a lot more validity toward curvature as far as I’ve been able to asses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot measure the sphere directly </p>

<p>I don’t see why one can’t.  Flat or spheroid, it seems that one definitely can if they’re logistically capable of it.  In theory, it seems absolutely possible to measure the sphere directly.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> direct observation as to the shape of the Earth would be to leave the earth and <strong>directly observe it</strong>. </p>

<p>There haven’t been much if any ad hominem attacks here and the flat universe model has remained singularly lacking thus far.</p>

<p>You say you are not advocating for it, which is all good and well because the information you’ve shown only indicates that we might be living in a simulation.

<p>Things can get <em>extremely</em> deep at this point because we can get into various whistleblowers and the like whose information is A) not easy to refute, and B) all attest to a spherical model of the universe.</p>

<p>I’d sooner go with their testimonies before any current proponent of a flat earth/universe model.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That’s a completely different issue altogether - one that very likely has to do with a <em>lot</em> more than any possible “flat universe disclosure”.  We live on a prison planet nestled right in the midst of a cosmos that is <em>very</em> populated by intelligent beings - some/many of whom are far more evolved and advanced than Earth humans.</p>

<p>Whatever astronauts may have been privy to this fact likely A) freaked that <em>fuck</em> out, and B) were told to STFU or else.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s all a hologram.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you’re saying “All of existence only <em>seems</em> to have depth and breadth.  It’s really flat.  We’re really living in a simulation that tells us everything is round and has shape.  Everything’s really flat though.”</p>

<p>Okay wait a minute…do you even know what a hologram is?  Do you realize that a hologram is a device that projects the whole of a thing into every part of the very object?  In other words, if this <em>is</em> a hologram, then that actually works AGAINST your argument because in a hologram, every part <em>mirrors</em> the whole - which would mean that if we’re living in a hologram, then the <em>actual</em> source of that hologram is ALSO three dimensional (i.e. NOT flat) because <em>this very existence</em> is three dimensional and not flat.</p>

<p>Your argument is literally logically self-defeating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The visible/palpable dimensions are not real, they just seem so, just as if you were wearing 3d goggles and a &quot;multi-sensory&quot; suit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your argument basically has its foundation in <a href="http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/2908.html">Descartes’ “evil genius” argument</a> in logic.</p>

<p>Descartes himself soundly dealt with that argument with his “Cogito ergo sum” counterpoint, however.</p>

<p>You’re essentially saying “It doesn’t matter how things <em>seem</em>.  I’m telling you we live in a simulation where everything’s in reality <em>flat.”</em>  So existence only has depth and breadth in <em>seeming</em> then is your argument, right?</p>

<p>Listen, even if existence is three dimensional in <em>seeming</em> only, then within the context of this “seeming”, this illusion (not “hologram”.  What you meant to say is that existence is an <em>illusion</em>, not a hologram) then existence - and the planets, stars, and other stellar objects, etc - is still three dimensional/round/spheroid/has depth and shape.</p>

<p>Your argument is essentially an evil genius argument - saying that it doesn’t matter how things <em>seem</em> here, they’re REALLY something else.</p>

<p>Okay.  I understand that much.</p>

<p>There is almost no sound evidence or argument that I’m aware of, however, showing or indicating that this “something else” you say existence “really” is…is flat.</p>

<p>That’s just as well as putting any random, arbitrary description on what things really are.  You’re saying “We live in an illusion.  Therefore the way existence <em>really</em> is…is [wait for it]…FLAT.”</p>

<p>Hell, if we do live in an illusion (and I wouldn’t necessarily argue against that) then the reality could be really ANYTHING - flat, rectangular, hexagonal…or <em>whatever</em>.  Or it may simply be of a different quality within the context of what actually <em>already is</em>.</p>

<p>Either way, you don’t/didn&#39;t provide a good argument <em>at all</em> in terms of accounting for whatever validity may exist in this flat <del>Earth</del> universe model of existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And as I already stated elsewhere in this OP, if it’s a mirror, then, even off of your very own argument, it’s reflecting something.  What is it reflecting?  Do you know?  Is <em>that</em> flat?  Is what it’s reflecting flat as well?</p>

<p>And if what’s being reflected isn’t flat, then YOU and existence around you are therefore <em>not flat either</em> regardless of what the reflection indicates.</p>

<p>Do you look at yourself in the mirror and say &quot;Yep.  I&#39;m FLAT.&quot;?  No.  You don&#39;t (or at least hopefully you don&#39;t, if you&#39;re of even mildly sound mind).  You realize the mirror&#39;s only a reflection of the <em>real</em> you - who ISN&#39;T flat.</p>

<p>Don’t say the Earth or the universe is “flat” then.  Simply say “Real and true existence in this universe is a reflection of something we do not as of yet know the source of.”</p>

<p>See?  How hard is that?  Nothing wrong with saying that.</p>

<p>However, to go from “it’s a mirror” to “which means it’s definitely FLAT”…is just…not. good. logic.  Not even a little bit.</p>

<p>So you start off saying “Wrong” in here…but then you go on to prove the very argument <em>against</em> yourself.  Are you like…not seeing this?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If that’s the case, then the universe is DEFINITELY not flat - because I’m definitely not “flat” and everything around me definitely isn’t - as I’ve already said.  How is it that you can say A) the universe is flat, yet B) the universe reflects itself, when C) things are OBSERVABLY NOT FLAT??</p>

<p>&quot;It only <em>seems</em> to be flat&quot; is your argument, right?  Okay...</p>

<p>Again, this is the very Cartesian argument I already addressed above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a mirror juxtaposed against another effectively infinite array of mirrors, all phenomena in the universe are themselves mirrors that reflect off of each other and that create the effect of each other, their apparent existence and movement, appearance and disappearance in a movement that is purely optical and dimensionally illusory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this does absolutely nothing to the notion that the original object that’s reflected may or may not be flat.  Doesn’t matter if it’s one or one million mirrors all reflecting one thing.  The argument I made above in the previous post still applies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The human mind, that is brain, is itself a mirroristic instrument, reflective and projective of what it was formed to observe, it is the mirror par excellence that hides the reality of all other mirrors, that makes possible the illusion of the whole and seeming dimensional reality of all its seemingly infinite parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A) The brain and the mind are not the same thing.</p>

<p>B)  Nothing you’ve said here undermines or contradicts the fact that a mirror reflects an object, and you don’t know what the original composition of that initial object is.  As such, alleging “flatness” on an object that can be <em>any</em> shape or size is…not intelligent.</p>

<p>The bracketed statement shows that you don’t know what a simulated existence is.  You’re drawing conclusions from entirely faulty premises - making the conclusions you draw just as faulty.</p>

<p>There need be no “we” that creates the simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense that simulations reflect something in our underlying reality since <strong>we are simulating our reality.</strong>  It does not mean our reality is simulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bolded section is an assumption that is not known.  You are therefore incorrect in assuming it as being valid.</p>

<p>Independent of this, your second sentence, AGAIN invalidates your entire argument because if our reality isn’t simulated, then the universe ISN’T flat given that I and the world around me aren’t flat.</p>

<p>Observable evidence has led to that already.  Remote viewing is a real, testable, proven phenomenon.  That alone shows the holographic nature of existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact many things cannot be explained adds weight to holographic theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…I don’t know or see how, but if you are arguing FOR the holographic theory here all the sudden…then you are, again, arguing against your self and your very own “Flat Cosmos” model.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seems to me like you’ve been trying to prove the existence of a flat cosmos this entire time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact my entire point is that we don&#39;t know and any &quot;scientist&quot; that claims they do is full of shit. By definition not a scientist.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this - which ultimately AGAIN takes the flat cosmos model of existence you seem to have been propounding this entire time and entirely undermines it at its very foundational root.</p>
