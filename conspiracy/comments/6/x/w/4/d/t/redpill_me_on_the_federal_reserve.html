It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."

       No it doesn't. Annually all profits are sent to the U.S. Treasury. Last year they received $92 billion.

       Hello I'll answer some
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It depends on the type of cryptocurrency, which, like ordinary currency, can be bullion or fiat.  Bulleon currencies, ones with intrinsic value, is the best way to avoid the never ending debt cycle.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Debt in a fiat reserve currency has be considered as a totally different beast than debt of  a non reserve currency nation. If the latter defaults, one could print money, but inflation would eat the value. however if the reserve nation defaults printing the money to square the debt results the inflation being exported to all non reserve currencies.  The short answer to why the US has so much debt is because they can, knowing full well non us citizens will work to square the deficit.  Challenging the dollar hegemony has been at the root of all 21st century conflict.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It is also of use to point out that, in a fiat system, money is created by creating debt then charging interest on it.  So it's a mathematical impossibility to completely pay off the debt, since there's always more debt than credit
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bitcoin is bullion, so it's a step in the right direction.  Taxes cause deadweight loss in markets, less taxes generally help economies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No idea, but it seems the deep state had every incentive to.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, fiat currency is absolutely a ponzi scheme, designed specially to force a society to endenture itself to itself.

       While tangible value is a good layman's way of approaching bullion, it's actually too strict, all thats needed for a bullion system is a scarce good.  Since only 21 million bitcoins will be allowed to ever exist, bitcoins are truely scarce, unlike fiat, which can be produced with less effort than what it took to write this

       Until Satoshi the only bullion system ever used has been in precious metals like gold and silver.  However, all you need is a fixed quantity of a scarce good so one can offer commerical paper at a fixed rate to that good.  One could decide a bullion system out of meteorites for example

       How is it perfect? Online wallets get hacked, local physical wallets can be stolen, lost, bricked, hacked, etc...it has what seems like endless competitors, the price is very unstable.  Bitcoin is far from perfect.

       This is false, we can pay down he debt in relatively short time without cutting any spending.  Your premise is based off of current US income.

       This is false, while all of your things would increase the wealth of the nation leaps and bounds the debt will still be there.  This is because in a fiat currency all money is debt, that paper in your pocket is in fact an i.o.u issued by a person who borrowed money at interest

       I'm not going to go and say your wrong, if your refering to nominal rates at zero Friedman would agree with you. but this is an area of contentious debate, with other big fish like Krugman being critical of it do to deflationary pressure and the increased vulnerability to liquidity traps.

       The U.S. has been in debt since the 1830's. It's not a big deal. It never has to be payed off.  It's not like personal debt. It can just be "rolled over" in perpetuity.
      </p>

       That doesn't mean you can let it spiral out of control, but simply always having a debt is not a big deal.
