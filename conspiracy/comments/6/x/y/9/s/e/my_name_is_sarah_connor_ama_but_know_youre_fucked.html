    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll let mods defend themselves, but I am personally of the opinion that the idea of a &quot;mod&quot; is a limited-hangout for that which can be coerced by those that control the luxury of a particular position. </p>

<p>So in this case, any mod who is both controlling the narrative here, and on /v/ and with emails from various accounts that I can reveal are not acting in the faith of truth.</p>

<p>Now, it goes without saying that the nature of this /r/ is to be skeptical - so there are mods I may be suspicious of which are truly good mods...</p>

<p>But we have as a whole never met irl - so given what has happened, I trust none.</p>

<p>I have spoken to flytape on the phone - as he was the only mod to really reach out, and I wholely disagree with his politics, but his heart was right for the sub.</p>

<p>I would NEVER trust a single admin, and I am convinced that several accounts on mod are sock-puppets for admins.</p>

<p>Hence the swooping.</p>

<p>Mods kvetched about certain things, other mods called for mods to be demodded, I admitted that I didn&#39;t have the phaxt and I wanted to know more.. but I also was not willing to demod based on shit that was sophomoric or that which I wasn&#39;t completely of sound understanding to do...</p>

<p>Then the hype ramped and so I reached out to AP to reach me via personal email asap... </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t...</p>

<p>I got drunk...</p>

<p>I took action...</p>

<p>With a stated mod mail &quot;make the order as you see fit&quot;</p>

<p>Intention was to drop after re-order...</p>

<p>Re-order didn&#39;t happen and ppl flipped out</p>

<p>Flytape called me on my cell... explained his position. I don&#39;t agree with his politics - but the guy really gets the DNA of the sub...</p>

<p>Asked me to reinstate him to do some things because other mods were mute...</p>

<p>The other mods were too busy bitching to (colluding with the <del>Russians</del> admins) than to actually talk to me...</p>

<p>I may have made the mistake of de-perming AP - but I don&#39;t recall doing so, as I specifically reached out to AP and said &quot;contact me via email&quot; -- he then said he received that PM but ignored it (in mod mail) and asked other mods if he should reply to me - and they told him no...</p>

<p>Conspiracy==I did NOT de-perm AP and the shill mod account for the admins did so and framed me for heist...</p>

<p>Non-conspiracy: I was drunk and did it by mistake and don&#39;t recall - so oops...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insight.  So you just noticed the drama on your own I guess by lurking.  I had figured that a particular mod, upset with the contest mode, which IIRC was done by flytape, may have reached out to you to intervene.  </p>

<p>A few days ago one of the mods, I think it was AATA, mentioned that there was a vote to replace you before the mods were wiped, and that the vote was 8-0.  Is this true? and why did they vote you out? (this was before any &#39;retaliation&#39; occured).</p>

<p>I&#39;m also wondering if the mods who went through with this experiment (unilaterally from the rest of the mods, it seems) had considered doing so to posts or topics which may have been brigaded in the past, just not from the subs they were concerned about on these recent occasions. Was this ever brought up before? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talked with this girl at work one day and we realized we lived near another... I was having a hard commute and asked how they got to work and it was stated that they drove every day.</p>

<p>We chatted about commuting together and it was agreed that it was convenient that we should commute together and they would pick me up.</p>

<p>I was picked up in a new VW beetle convertible... we drove and I said &quot;nice car&quot; they stated &quot;yeah it&#39;s new got the best loan&quot; - &quot;oh what&#39;s that&quot; &quot;well when you&#39;re Jewish and young you can request a loan from the community and someone will sign off for you - as if you don&#39;t pay it that person will pay it off, but the interest is zero and you can request however much you want&quot;...</p>

<p>No, I am not Jewish. They have a strong community... and many communities can learn a lot from them.</p>

<p>This is the deficient factor of the &quot;melting pot&quot; -- we all lose the benefits of community and resent the benefits of the communities of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be very enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>However, simply stating that has opened me up to all manners of attacks and accusations, far more than even the David Cole AMA, which is certainly saying something.</p>

<p>In fact, the largely vociferous reaction <em>against</em> the theories of Judy Wood and a potential AMA is what led me to be more interested in the theories in the first place.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have remotely the intelligence and education to be able to formally comment on <em>any</em> of these topics, but I truly believe that every conspiracy theorist should be allowed to have their say. </p>

<p>The moment certain conspiracy theories are disallowed from being discussed is the moment the conspiracy theorists lose.</p>

<p>In the case of Judy Wood, even if you think her theories don&#39;t have any merit, you should welcome the opportunity to address their inconsistencies and inaccuracies in a public way.</p>

<p>Simply silencing someone who wants to speak has never led to anything productive in the history of mankind (ok, that&#39;s perhaps hyperbolic, but you catch my drift). </p>

<p>Since I formulated this theory..Ive started to look at a users  post history..if the majority of their posts link to content sites..then I look to see how often they make comments.</p>

<p>The blatant and disturbing pattern is that the accounts that post massive numbers of posts containing links to content sites rarely make comments..and the comments themselves are usually one-liners or copypasta that doesn&#39;t take up too much of their valuable posting time.</p>

<p>My theory is..that certain mods take over subs in order to gain control of what news sites get linked to most often on the sub. Thereby ensuring constant traffic/growth of those sites. Having mod powers enables them to make sure that users who are posting stories that direct us to these sites have an advantage in reaching the front page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt this happens on some subs. I think The Independent does this on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, for instance. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure how much influence the mods have over this, though. We definitely get some content spammers on this sub, who only push the same site or handful of sites but never participate in any depth in the comments section. I usually give these accounts a warning and ban them if they continue. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever gotten a response from one of these, so I assume they&#39;re bots. </p>

<p>On this sub, we pretty much allow post from any domain, for better or worse, even some that have been placed on the site-wide spam filter. So I&#39;m not sure how much effect one mod spot or even a couple would have. We don&#39;t have any ability to artificially promote a post other than through a sticky or our sidebar, and most of these are self.posts anyway. Of the sticky posts that aren&#39;t, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any particular site that get&#39;s stickied more than others. </p>

<p>I <strong>do</strong> think artificially upvoted content is an issue on reddit in general and on this sub in particular, but I don&#39;t think mods play that big a role in it (and you can feel free to point out my conflict of interest of being a mod here.) All it would take is maybe a hundred or so accounts in a bot net to upvote a post early on, which would get it to the front page quickly. If it has a click-baity title that confirms the userbase&#39;s assumptions, it will most likely take off from there. This is in addition to more traditional methods like crossposting and off-site brigading, with or without alt accounts.</p>

<p>We as mods don&#39;t have the tools to know whether this is actually happening. I can look at some metrics and <em>speculate</em>, but it&#39;s pretty hard to say definitively whether a post is  or is not getting brigading or bot-upvoted. </p>

<p>People got worried about doxxing after that.</p>

<p>I admit that I veiled an empty threat (though I should have followed through) which was &quot;get on slack or be demodded&quot; and then I didn&#39;t demod those who were lazy...</p>

<p>But then I stated to AP &quot;contact me on email immediately&quot; as I was to discuss the demodding of all but him, allowing him to restructure - he ignored me, and I took action and demodded all... so your lack of sympathy is simply circumstantial as in you likely are pissed at me for demodding the team - but pissed at me for not following through with my threat to demod the team. So meh.</p>

<p>As one of the mods who did join slack and was active in the beginning as well several times since, that&#39;s a bit disingenuous. At least some of the mods had very serious privacy concerns about joining, and I don&#39;t blame them. </p>

<p>As to the second part, as far as I remember, you never participated in slack since your ultimatum that the rest of the mods join or be demodded. Several of us did have some conversations there, but you were not. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is understandable. <strong>Links are posted below</strong> - but first some background:</p>

<p>&quot;Slack&quot; (for those who may not know) is an offsite chat service. u/Sarah_Connor created the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; Slack back in May 2017 - ostensibly as an place to discuss mod matters outside of Reddit <em>(and invisible to Admins)</em>. </p>

<p>On August 10th, <em>(the night that Sarah_Connor <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lvap32C.png">removed all of our mod positions</a> - FIRST Coup Attempt)</em>, he ORDERED all other mods into the Slack channel for &quot;discussion&quot; - <em>but Sarah_Connor never showed up</em>. Admins were forced to step in and reinstate our permissions as the sub was unmoderated, and vulnerable to attack by trolls and saboteurs. Their only other option would have been to LOCK the sub.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, this action by Sarah_Connor severely undermined confidence in Sarah among the other mods - we demanded and explanation from Sarah - but nothing substantive was offered. We began deliberations on taking a vote to remove Sarah_Connor from the top mod position. S_C had previously agreed to abide by the consensus and the vote of the mod team.</p>

<p>Following the removal of our mod permissions, It wasn&#39;t looking good for Sarah.</p>

<p><strong><em>On the night of the Second Coup attempt</em></strong>, Sarah_Connor deleted the entire mod team - with the exception of u/axolotl_peyotl - but Sarah <strong>removed all of axolotl&#39;s permissions</strong> - rendering him helpless. Sarah then reinstalled u/Flytape and u/DronePuppet to the mod team - with FULL permissions. <a href="https://archive.is/t06Cc">https://archive.is/t06Cc</a></p>

<p>Having been de-modded <em>(with no access to mod mail)</em>, some of the other mods went to the Slack chatroom to try figure out what was going on. </p>

<p>Fortunately, as soon as he saw what was happening, u/AssuredlyAThrowAway immediately contacted u/redtaboo, the Reddit Administrator who had stepped in to restore our mod permissions during the <strong><em>previous coup attempt</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Below is the full record of the Slack conversation that took place that evening - <em>(posted with the agreement of all moderators involved)</em></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Umi3hTs.png"><strong>Slack Conversation Screen Shots:</strong></a></p>

<p>There it is, folks - letting it all hang out.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that Sarah_Connor was not present AT ALL, and that Flytape made only ONE comment - at the very top of the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO</strong>, following the FIRST coup attempt (where mod permissions were revoked by Sarah_Connor), I created <strong><em>&quot;Coup_de_Mardigras&quot;</em></strong> a new, private sub made for the specific purpose of allowing moderators to discuss the pending vote to remove S_C as top active mod. </p>

<p>When the sub was first created, Sarah_Connonr was NOT invited, nor was axolotl_peyotl, as, being next in line, he would have been the primary beneficiary of Sarah&#39;s removal. <strong><em>I did NOT want these conversations to be on Slack, as I wanted to give full transparency to Reddit Administrators.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Following the SECOND Coup Attempt, I removed coup participants u/Flytape and u/DronePuppet access to the sub (Sarah_Connor never had access).</p>

<p>Shortly after Coup #2, u/Flytape (who had resigned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) <strong>LIED</strong> about what we moderators discussed in that sub - saying that WE were the ones who were plotting a coup:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coup_de_mardigras">https://www.reddit.com/r/coup_de_mardigras</a></em></p>

<p><em>They planned it here, I was invited and watched it all go down. Hence my sudden revolt against them.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Archive of above: <a href="https://archive.is/Mrpt2">https://archive.is/Mrpt2</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Flytape told a whopper</em></strong>, and today we&#39;re setting the record straight. </p>

<p>Again, with unanimous consent of (current) Conspiracy moderators, I am making the sub PUBLIC for your inspection. It is set to &quot;read only&quot;: <strong>All threads have been locked, and only approved submitters are allowed to post or comment.</strong> </p>

<p>Here it is, folks - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coup_de_Mardigras/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Coup_de_Mardigras/</a></p>

<p>There is more evidence yet to be posted... edits to come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This latest mod upheaval removed the mods intent on combating the shill invasion on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. One of the moderators that I am certain is a shill now most likely has a contact in the admin group, as soon as the mod team restructure was started (in order to break the mod team stalemate with no actions taken against the brigades) he contacted the admins and they took over the mod team ousting the ones working for a change. 
Basicaly a hostile coup by the corrupt mods that are left on the mord list now, led by AATA.</p>

<p>As I am sure many of you know already, the reddit admins are not against astroturfers on the site. They are most likely getting paid to look the other way.</p>

<p>There are several mods high up in the mod list now that most likely are corrupt, they are actively resisting taking measures that combat shilling and brigading such as contest mode and enabling totesmessenger. </p>

<p>I believe eight of them are compromised or heavily biased, and I&#39;ve seen them act with blatant bias (downplays the brigade, refuses to ban blatant shills posting from shareblue etc).</p>

<p>The few mods I know are ok will not be in any position to influence the direction of the sub from now on. The majority vote among the mod team will ensure that.</p>

<p>SC removed all of our permissions a week before the Vote Of No Confidence in order to extract concessions out of us to regain permissions. While he was incognito for 4 hours after this action the sub was neutered from moderation.</p>

<p>We contacted the admins to let them know their 500k <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub didn&#39;t have any lifeguards on duty and gave us our whistled back. Just an afternoon of mod drama (in effect keel us busy from continuing to clean this place up).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if I read everything you said correctly, you believe there are &quot;shill mods&quot; here. My question is do you also think there are &quot;shill users&quot; here?  By that I mean users that are untouchable. Users that try to input ideas that would benefit their superiors. I believe I suspect at least 3 maybe 4 &quot;shill users&quot; that fit the bill im trying explain. They seem to flip flop a lot. ALWAYS the one of them are the first few comments in a controversial post. One has actually called me shill on two different occasions so I reported and 10 minutes or so later their comment was deleted with no recourse. </p>

<p>Tldr;  Are there untouchable users here? </p>

<p>I literally did not remove APs perms. I even PMd him to contact me and I got impatient and said to reorganize. </p>

<p>I did reinstate flytape, as I had mentioned, after he literally called me and we spoke for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>I have zero opinion on DP. </p>

<p>The whole fucking plan was to have AP do what he wished with mod structure, then to communicate with me about when I should step out, and I was ignored as he posted to modmail and other mods told him to ignore me.</p>

<p>Then JCP was a prick and after that I said &quot;fuck it&quot; and said I wouldn&#39;t step down to see what would happen, then admins removed me.</p>

<p>And for you to claim I am right fucking wing!?!! Maybe you don&#39;t have a good memory, see my posts about the bush cabal, see my posts about not being political, so to call me &quot;right wing&quot; is the farthest from the truth. Fuck politics, fuck the admins and go fuck yourself - I am not lying.</p>

<p>if I wanted to remove APs perms, why did I leave his account intact and remove the others, why did I try to get him to contact me via personal email, why would I post to modmail about what my intentions were, why does any of that make freaking sense.</p>

<p>Bullshit - the coup was not me. It was the admins. And as I have openly stated multiple times, I don&#39;t agree with flytape politics, but he actually help the DNA of the sub in good standing. When I was asked to remove other mods, I refused.</p>

<p>So fuck the admins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mod log shows you as having removed AP&#39;s perms.</p>

<p>As you clearly got caught attempting whatever it is you were attempting you have motive to lie, which means your claim about the admins impersonating you to remove AP&#39;s perms makes no sense.</p>

<p>The motive for you to remove AP&#39;s perms was clear, the mod team voted to hand the top spot to AP and you didn&#39;t want him to put anyone above dronepuppet and flytape.</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to walk back a really obvious coup attempt, and its clear neither you nor flytape had any idea that it was against the reddit TOS to retaliate against your co-mods after they begin a vote to change their acting head mod.</p>

<p>If I had to venture a guess, you and flytape incorrectly assumed that by leaving AP on the team (albeit with no perms) you wouldn&#39;t be in violation of the retaliation part of the TOS. Why you thought that I have no idea.</p>

<p>Then again, why you think half of what you think I cant understand. To be frank, the reason why I supported removing you from the team (after supporting you through even your most difficult moments) was because 95% of the time you are incoherent, and unable to understand anything about reddit or how the site functions. You twice undermined the entire mod team without even getting a vote, and acted wantonly on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>Part of being on a mod team is engaging with others, and looking for consensus; you have huge weaknesses in both of those areas, and it really hindered your ability to play any role on the mod team (not too mention the role of acting head mod).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to go on here, as I think I&#39;ve made my point quite clear; but , again, just to reemphasize it for you; I literally supported you remaining on the mod team (in the top acting spot) even when you went through some difficult situations. It was only when you attempted to act unilaterally, in essence entirely tone deaf with regards the site wide TOS and general mod team etiquette, that I (and nearly every other mod) voted to hand the top spot over to AP.</p>

<p>On multiple occasions we offered to give you a spot on the mod team at a lower position, and on multiple occasions you accepted only to renege your commitment at the last minute.</p>

<p>At the end of all this I&#39;m not really sure if flytaped played you (flytape really was trying to change this into a ring wing subreddit, and you welcomed his plan with open arms) or if you felt it was justified due to your ideology; either way, what happened was quite sad, and it is shameful that you are still lying about things to this day.</p>

They try to shift conversations away from the more damaging topic while also being rude and insulting, but when you insult back or call them out for being obvious shills you get banned. This goes on until the mods have warned/banned you enough and they make it permanent. This ONLY protects Shareblue. </p>

<p>Also are people supposed to believe this sub hasn&#39;t been compromised the exact same way that other subs were taken over? Especially with Reddit admin help to kick out the senior most mods? </p>
