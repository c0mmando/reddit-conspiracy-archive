      <p>
       Yesterday I attended David Icke's talk in Vancouver. Totally worth it, would go again in a heartbeat. Was quite riveting despite the bum numbing pain that a ten hour lecture can create, glad there were breaks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't see any protesters at all, the mayor of Vancouver looked into his work and couldn't find anything racist and personally gave his okay. Almost everyone I saw attending seemed like compassionate, spiritual people - like Icke himself. The message was often hard to take, if the human race doesn't realize the deception in time we are in for an untenably harsh existence of enforced slavery or perhaps extinction. And yet the lecture ended with a positive note, the solution, according to Icke, is for each one of us to awaken to our loving spiritual nature and realize our potential is quite literally infinite, we are expressions of infinite love.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always been a ConsPiracy buff, it just seemed likely to me that given human nature the most ruthless and cold hearted people would be driven to acquire power by any means necessary to ensure that they ended up running things. So reassuring to know that I'm not the only one to realize this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a lot of familiar material, of course, I've been following Icke since the late 90's. Being present in person was quite invigorating, though, there were few times that I felt my attention lagging. Icke draws from many sources to extrapolate from and carry a proposition through to a conclusion and in book form it can sometimes be a difficult slog, but attending his lectures live, relating to current events and feeling the buzz of the crowd was enough to keep me attentive and focused in spite of not getting much sleep the previous night. I wish I could have felt this way in school. No I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend attending one of his events to anyone who is interested or on the fence considering doing so.

       I was there. Could not always keep my eyes open, due to not getting enough sleep, but listened the whole time.

       I think it was his best organized presentation and he cut stuff out I would usually skip through in the books, while making it more relevant to right now.

       He talked about the Nag Hamadi gnostic library and how they talked about the Archons, then brought it back to the reptilians. Apparently the gnostics knew about them and described them in detail.

       That's not always a valid argument though.

       I actually dont know his stance on spirituality. Ive already learned the real payh is to cleanse urself. Open your chakras. Raise your christ oil/kundalini up your 33 vertabrae (jacobs ladder) and completr the electric circuit in your body by connecting your spine to your brain with the kuchari mudra which will csuse your pineal gland (third eye) to produce seratonin and melatonin (land of honey and milk/living waters/become dust/holy grail)

       Well I could say that from my perspective you are going down a new age path which is created to service yourself through hours of meditation and ego masturbation, so no he doesn't advocate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fully aware of everything you reference but I keep full awareness that the Luciferians subverted the new age movement for the specific reason I mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your masonry nods line up perfectly with Tool's Holy Gift of Masonic knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think maybe you're following a path set up long ago for you to blindly follow due to the allure of new "truths?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the fact that I'm able to play devils advocate to your belief system make you upset?
      </p>
      <p>
       If yes, you're still growing.  Helping others understand reality and come to terms with truth is far more rewarding than milking your pituitary gland.  You can also dildo your ass but that is t the intended unction of that either.

       I know where you got your metaphors.  Who brought you to the realization of the function of the word?

       How easy it is to fool your mind.  The bible encodes reality because reality is metaphor.  If you stop to smell the flowers you won't ever see the field.

       You're just trying to get a rise or something. I never even mentioned left hand or right hand.  I objectively pointed out the path you described as being controlled by hose with a dark agenda.

       Ok you seem overly confident in your position. I will humble myself and read yhrough our convos and think on it. I do think you are speaking some truth i myself am skeptical and the only reason why i follopw the body steps is because we were born with it.

       There have been numerous accounts of ppl reaching enlightenment without doing anythijg im not seeking enlightenment. I am seeking the living waters and immortal life. But really i want to meet G-d and ask myself.

       We were both fools. I have realized now that God is responsible for all reality, events, existence and we choose (based on our egos) which God represents good and evil but we need to realize that it is all one God divided, to teach us how to transcend duality and understand the mechanics of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no comparison for good and evil we aren't able to grow from experience and choice.  This is a school and we were both right the entire time.

       I am aware of that mudra. There is only one surefire way and that is to realise you were never born in the first place. If you take yourself to be the body you will try to liberate the body and its self identity. If you know what you are beyond the body you are already free having never been bound. The body appearance is not real as in its not a solid physical body made of matter. They call it matter but they dont know what it is.

       All spiritual traditions talk of this same thing, there are many different mudras and techniques and practices. I never did these techniques, I did self enquiry and practiced being aware of being aware. Only later after the energies that had been activated by awakening started to move in the body I started to do sitting meditation to look at what was going on.

       Yes, although the I is the veil that hides the reality. Or what is taken to be I. Identity based on bodymind. So that I is not going to experience it since it not real I.

       To die but to not perish means for the veil to drop and then there is a recognition of that which is boundless and eternal.

       Really there is only one non attainment that matters, its non attaining the false I which leaves the real. The powers are nice but they wont help if the one who is using them is deluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why many traditions say that dont chase the powers, they will bind you to the ego since if the ego gets a hold of these powers it wont let go. Its better to see the ego is not real before so it wont get in the way. First free yourself and then if you want you can get into attaining any powers you wish.

       I dont care about any of that. Its interesting but the book details how john chang actually met G-d and this is the closest to our timeline of an account from someone still alive that matches accounts in history and the great works. So my single mission is to cleanse myself and meet G-d to find the true true.

       You will never find the true as that which is not true. The true is already here. Its in front of your face and all around you interpenetrating your whole being.
      </p>
      <p>
       That which is looking for the true is the true looking for itself. The reason why you wont find it is because it is already everything. The I that is looking for it has separated itself from everything in its own dream of being a separate self.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the separate self is like a fish in the ocean looking for water.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is what is looking. Right now. From the invisible the visible comes into being. God cant be seen, God is the seer.

       There is no need to detach from the body since the body is not a problem. Trying to change what is is a problem. The body is only a problem if there is an I that is taken to be real that feels like it is bound by the body. This I is just a thought and a bodily sensation, its not real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the most direct way to penetrate this thing is to know who is this I that I take myself to be? Who is this I that has driven me to try all of these things without me ever even questioning if it is real in the first place? Do I even know what this I is? Its driving this body vehicle but where is its seat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some wise words from the indian sage Ramana Maharshi:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First set about to enquire and know yourself, and after knowing yourself, if 'you are still in need of anything (God, liberation, happiness, etc.), let us look to it then', advises Sri Bhagavan !
The 'I am   the body'-consciousness (dehatma-buddhi) is the individual soul (jiva); in other words, the nature of the individual soul is nothing but the wrong knowledge 'I am the body'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the body is insentient, it has no 'I'-consciousness; hence this consciousness (which rises as'I am the body') cannot be said to be the body! Can we thencall it Self (atman), since it is an 'I'-consciousness? No, we cannot, for rising and setting is not the nature of Self. The nature of Self is existence-consciousness (sat-chit), shining ever as 'I am' without rising and setting. thus, this
consciousness 'I am the body', which has a rising and a setting, cannot be said to be Self either. It is neither Self,which is consciousness, nor the body, which is insentient! It is a ghost-like false appearance, taking the size of the body as its own size, being limited by time and space, being a mixure of the quality of the body (i.e. rising and setting) and the quality of Self (i.e. shining as an 'I'-consciousness), but at the same time alien to both of them, and rising as a knot (granthi) between Self (chit) and the insentient body (jada)? chit-jada-granthi. This is the ego, otherwise called  bondage, soul, subtle body, samsara (the mundane state of activity) mind and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Presupposing the existence of a non-existent thing and then wanting to get salvation for that imaginary 'I', you have to start and try to do so through the above-said four paths of yoga. When your sadhanas themselves become a means of giving life to the non-existent ego, how can they destroy it? To do any sadhana except Self-enquiry (atmavichara), the existence of the mind (jiva) is indispensable.
For, how to perform those sadhanas without the mind? To try to destroy the ego by sadhanas other than Self-enquiry is to be just like a thief turning himself into a policeman to catch the thief who is none but himself. Only Self-enquiry can reveal the truth that the ego (mind or jiva) has no existence whatsoever!
       </p>
       <p>
        So do not accept this ego, the truth of which you have not yet found out by scrutiny; deny it by giving no importance to its existence, root it out and burn it to extinction by attending to how or from what (whence) it rises! Instead of doing so, if you accept it as a real entity even before enquiring and finding out what it is (i.e. before finding out 'Who am I?'), it itself will be a fetter to you and will create many non-existent obstacles (such as lust, anger, etc.) for you, and will then involve you in the aforesaid unnecessary efforts to overcome them' ? thus says Sri Bhagavan.
       </p>

       If he was controlled opposition he wouldn't be telling the truth about spirituality and consciousness. The cabal does not want us to know our spiritual truths and power and thus, if he was dis-info, he wouldn't be speaking about those powerful truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only dis-info about him is others trying to smear his work and the facts he puts out.

       You do you mate but I personally believe he is far, far away from controlled opposition.

       Also if you know anything about spiritual warfare their goal is to make you believe ANYTHING that isnt the prisca theologia. So the minute you settle on someones belief you hold yourself prisoner to their deity (if theirs is not yours).

       Not true. Sharing opinions and beliefs doesn't automatically mean you worship someone else's opinions or beliefs, that's kind of silly in my opinion. Also, this stuff is out there, but the cabal doesn't want it spread around. If he was true dis-info, he wouldn't be putting out this kind of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything he does and says flies in the face of the cabal and exposes their bullshit. I'm sorry, but he's not dis-info in my opinion. I also believe his stances on spirituality but that doesn't automatically mean I worship his God, whatever the hell that means. We are all apart of God anyway. There's no need to worship anyone or anything because we are already God, because we are all one and originate from God or source consciousness.

       I heed your warning because I'm all too familiar with disinfo and limited hangouts. I do appreciate it though. However, it's easy to spot the disinfo agents and discernment and intuition can help anyone arrive to that conclusion with anybody. I just personally believe that David Icke is legit, but again, that's only my opinion mate.

       Cool. Gl man. Just to note. The way disinfo works is by telling you some truths and some lies. They ALSO omit truths. Just like alex jones doesnt talk about israel david ickes not talking about something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know ickes spiritual stance cuz ive come to learn its a journey you take alone. But if he doesnt tell you to meditate and raise your christ oil/kundalini up your 33 vertabrae(jacobs ladder) and complete the electric circuit in your body by connecting your spine to your brain with the kuchari mudra which will cause your pineal gland to activate and secrete seratonin and melanonin (land of milk and honey/living waters/turn to dust/holy grail) then hes disinfo for sure.

       Yes I'm aware of that practice, as it's usually pretty effective. That's why full awareness and discernment is key.

       Yes he touches on all of that. But also, that's not the only way to "enlightenment" and there are many ways that causes someone to go within and seek the truth. Your understanding is one of many that allows people to flip the trigger inside of them that begins their awakening journey.

       The awesome thing is now more than ever people are waking up in hordes to these truths and we have a bright future ahead of us all when a good portion of the population is awakening to spiritual truths.

       I actually dont know his stance on spirituality. Ive already learned the real payh is to cleanse urself. Open your chakras. Raise your christ oil/kundalini up your 33 vertabrae (jacobs ladder) and completr the electric circuit in your body by connecting your spine to your brain with the kuchari mudra which will csuse your pineal gland (third eye) to produce seratonin and melatonin (land of honey and milk/living waters/become dust/holy grail)

       He does, but avoids the ancient terminology for the energy body, instead focusing on modern scientific research and concepts for those and work from groups like the heart math institute. He emphasized heart consciousness being superior to purely mental consciousness. Reducing your spiritual experience to the mental level can cut you off from compassion and empathy, something you want to avoid.

       Personally I find the Taoist model superior to the Hindu energy work. I would recommend the healing Tao book series by Mantak Chia and the books of Bruce Frantzis for balancing spiritual energy, but at the end of the day it's whatever works for you.

       Got a link? This Icke fellow interests me. I don't believe in reptilians or whatever but I get the feeling he uses it to create the impression that he's a 'nutter' so the establishment doesn't censor him too much.

       There are other controlled opposition ppl in the spirtiual game. All the religious structures. Mr graham. This new age wave of "woke" ppl. Look if you dont want to heed my warning then dont but dont come back with blind faith to support your belief.
