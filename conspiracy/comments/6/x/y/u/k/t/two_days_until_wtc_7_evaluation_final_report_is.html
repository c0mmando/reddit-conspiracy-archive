        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is..what are the chances it&#39;s going to get completely buried by the US governments response to North Korea having hydrogen bomb technology?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m telling you right now..We are going to watch it happen. While it&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>Many of us will do our damnedest to give the report some visibility..</p>

<p>But it won&#39;t matter..we will get completely buried...and the report will get completely buried by the media shitstorm that they are literally cooking up as I type this.</p>

<p>And all we will be able to do is &quot;suggest&quot; the possibility that it was more than a coincidence.</p>

<p>And even when we do that..we will be attacked by brigades of new accounts and accounts that rarely post or comment in this sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to go down exactly how I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s going to go.</p>

<p>In the end..even after the North Korea media blitz dust settles it will come down to this pathetic one line sentence as a reply to anyone who tries to bring up the report...</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really think that&#39;s important at a time like this&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I pointing out is the fallacies in the u/Zarathasstra reply. Everyone is not aware of the lie. This report will make an impact, it already has for me. I already knew about the unclear situation and this definitely sheds light on the hypocrisy in the official statement. We need to learn from history in order to stop the perpetual cycle of elaborate schemes to gain control of human natural laws for profit. At its base it will delay the tyranny potentially giving people more opportunity to grow in the light direction.</p>

<p>It was originally going to happen in August and include releasing all their models and data necessary to recreate their simulations.  Now it appears that only a report will be released, a report isn&#39;t all the data.</p>

<p><em>That’s because, over the course of the next two months, Dr. Leroy Hulsey will be releasing the findings of his two-year computer modeling study on the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7.</em></p>

<p><em>Though originally scheduled for release in August, a draft report of the study is now on course to be issued in mid-October. A six-week public comment period will follow the release of the draft report, allowing for input from the public and the engineering community. The final report, which will incorporate constructive comments and will be vetted by peer reviewers, will then be published in early 2018.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forensic Structural Engineer Dr. Leroy Hulsey has already presented preliminary findings of his WTC 7 Evaluation study to a panel of attorneys at the Justice in Focus 9/11 Symposium in New York on Sep 11, 2016. </p>

<p>Using finite element modelling, Dr. Hulsey and his team found that the official explanation by NIST for the collapse of WTC 7, which is that ordinary office fires brought the building down, is wrong.</p>

<p>After his presentation, when asked by Public Interest Attorney Daniel Sheehan;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;On a scale of 1 to 100, what is the possibility that WTC 7 could have collapsed simply because of fires?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Hulsey replied;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Zero&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also said that if any of his Ph.D. students had submitted the explanation for the collapse of WTC 7 that NIST has given us, he would have failed them.</p>

<p>The attorneys on the panel - who sat alongside guest panelists Daniel Sheehan, Barbara Honegger and Judge Ferdinando Imposimato, the Honorary President of the Supreme Court of Italy - were Mick Harrison, David Meiswinkle, Mustapha Ndanusa, Andrew Kreig and Bill Veale</p>

They are breaking the bill of rights from the 1st and 2nd to the 9th and 10th.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/o0Myg4w.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/o0Myg4w.jpg</a></p>

<p>Why and how can they do all this?  The federal reserve is the answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png">http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png</a> Federal income tax goes solely to the owners of the federal reserve, it pays for nothing.  Federal reserve is a private corporation which loans what is nothing more than monopoly money to banks at interest.  This debt is impossible to pay off and a total falsehood used to make people believe they owe someone something.  The federal reserve is a misunderstood form of slavery which makes the federal reserve owners unimaginably wealthy and powerful turning them into the unseen oligarchy/dictators of the USA.  </p>

<p>Pair this yearly sapping of all wealth, their power of selection on loans, taxes on inheritance and inflation and now you can see why the bottom 80% of people in the USA have merely 16% of total wealth in the USA, the wealth distribution is massively skewed.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s why bank runs are so deadly.  The total amount of money that is trying to be withdrawn from the bank is orders of magnitude greater than the amount of money the bank can access to give to the people.</p>
