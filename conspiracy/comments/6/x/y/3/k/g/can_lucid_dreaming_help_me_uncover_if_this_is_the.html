       Can  lucid dreaming help me uncover the secret if this is the matrix. I've had strong suspicions that the world I am in isn't real, perhaps if I lucid dream I might be able to escape or at least get answers? Anyone else tried this? What are the results?

       Yep.  This.  Too many of us have allowed ourselves to become convinced that this world is nothing but the superficial; the conscious only and that's it.  Little could be further form the actual truth.

       Imagination may interact with the subconscious mind, but dreams have a much deeper connection to functions below your consciousness. The conscious mind is great for creating a narrative that explains perceptions, but it is no more true than the unseen happenings that surround us and the subconscious desires.

       Definitely feels like stepping out of the matrix sometimes. Information is the key. The more you learn the more apparent things become.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're definitely in the matrix though, a reality that's completely manufactured. Fake news, fake politics, fake medicine, fake science, fake food, fake online discussions, all fake...

       You are the one carrying on about culture being fake. I never mentioned culture. What does culture being fake even mean? I also said almost everything, not everything.
       <br/>
       So of the things I did mention, what is not fake to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       News is definitely a given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics? This last election made that one pretty obvious. Read wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medicine? Do any bit of research on the vaccine industry. Maybe it's just me but I'm good with injecting
       <a href="https://archive.is/kRNH2">
        human protein and DNA
       </a>
       into my body among God knows
       <a href="https://worldmercuryproject.org/news/metals-debris-found-in-vaccine-supply/">
        what else.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Science? Sadly
       <a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2013-09-science-crisis.html">
        profits come first here too.
       </a>
       In this age of disinformation, do you you think it's probably gotten better or worse?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about food? Any health conscious person would agree the crap the general public shovel into their mouths is anything but actual food. I bet the closest bottle of maple syrup to you doesn't even have any maple syrup in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just a couple examples but start looking into any one of these topics and you will find much much more. People have just become too desensitized to it all now and can't even see things right in their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now combine this with the deliberate dumbing down of society and you get maximized profits with little to no risk because the blind sheep will just hand them fistfuls of their money as they're being booted in the ass off the cliff to their watery graves.

       No kidding! Sometimes I feel like I'm just here talking to myself while a bunch of robots argue back and forth. It's all good though, I enjoy the learning experience. Happy to make others happy in our quest for the truth :)

       I have lucid dreams every night and I have sleep disorders.  I want to keep a journal so I don't forget these dreams.  I think a lot of comes from what you experience during your day.

       What I've learned from vivid dreams is that my emotions can be a lot more powerful than in waking time, and it's amazing how it feels (in these dreams) to flow with my heart. Have you watched the movie Paprika? It involves  a similar idea about the greater reality and the more vivid self that sometimes exists in dreams. (It's soundtrack is by someone who is just right for the theme.)
If your thinking about this being a computer simulation like in the movie The Matrix, I think exercise could help clear your mind better than dreaming. But I guess I'm not the person who can answer your question. It just got me thinking a lot.
I also was reminded of something that came up today. Nietzsche has a quote about the man who asks, What is existence? and then blinks. The point is, I guess, that our emotional response to our experience is what makes us human, and we should be sincere in our encounters. (I remembered this quote when I heard a boy at the cafe say something offhanded about the universe, and I thought he is like the man who blinks.)
Anyway, your question is very thought provoking.

       I think the "computer simulation" is a metaphor.  We are carrying out programming and so to us it is a simulation but we have the option to objectively see the programming if we use our intuition and individual doubt.

       People are becoming the AI because they aren't using their innate human consciousness to calculate.   They are using impulsive reaction which keeps the level of society perpetuated.  The majority rule is the trap.  If they can keep that under containment then the rest of the world stays asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is simply about the awareness of what is happening in our reality.  All of the stories of it being a dream or video game are dangerous slopes into fantasy that keep us inactive.

      <p>
       Our language is one of metaphors that keeps us trapped from communication of truth and the controllers get to use the language as they see fit in the court of law to ensure our perpetual situations.

       Our operating system has been subverted and controlled.  The more you are able to explain it the crazier you sound.

      <p>
       It's a design. We are living the simulation but we relate to it through the only devices we've known and we can't see it yet for what it is.

       The journey to discover what matrix means is the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's real but only until every individual topic of study converges into a coherent plan at keeping you from picking at anything, will you be under the spell of the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matrix is understanding that everything exists on bubbles or fractals.  You can dig in any direction and gain more information but as you get close to truth the system is set up to detect you and turn against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information never ends and we exist in a bubble of a balance of all of the surface information available that keeps reality happy and ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matrix is basically a giant subconscious ego that everyone's ignorance helps to build.  This ego doesn't want to be told it's wrong.
