       I think its more of a kind of stockholm syndrome.  We know but we don't let ourselves know.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people point out uncomfortable truths the vast majority has this secret wish that they aren't even aware of to believe that person is a liar or crazy.  So TPTB media feeds them what they want.  They discredit the source and refuse to follow up on the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average family wants to go about the business of raising kids and having a comfortable life.  They don't want to hear about how their kid died fighting the enemies of wealthy corporations and European bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people get ready to look around and try to figure out whats really happening the information they need is there.  all we can do is make sure it stays that way.  When I was 30 you couldn't have convinced me of anything other than the USA was the forces of light working to end tyranny and oppression and bring freedom to the world.  I'm older now I've seen more things and when I started seeing my country spying unapologetically on its own people and trying more and more to limit real freedom was when I decided to start digging.  Don't worry about the rest of the people.  Just keep yourself woke and do what you can to keep information available to those who want it.

       He's very bad and also has a lot of media attention. Any team that he is better than the starting QB, isn't going to suddenly compete with Kaep. If people thought he was good enough to win games they would bring him in, because people's very good jobs are on the line every Sunday.

       If you can't win games and create a media frenzy you will not have a job in the NFL.

       The U.S. is supposed to be a democratic republic.
But of course, we're getting a crap version of it.
I.e. it's not a true/proper democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine someone heard that honey can help
improve cold symptoms but they bought crappy
fake honey (or impure honey)
then may not feel the effects that much
and claim the whole thing is nonsense.
But then a friend gives him pure honey
the next time he's got a cold, he gets better faster
and realizes it does work at least to an extent,
if you have the pure/real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people wrongly think democracy is a scam,
it's not. We've just been given a POOR product.
Some establishment shills will claim
"democracy is just mob rule"
but they're bullshitting.
The elites are a tiny group (maybe 8K people compared to 7 BILLION people)
and they are pushing tyranny against the entire planet.
Hence I don't sympathize with their hypocritical complaining.
We've always suffered at the hands
of a minority of secret society socio/psychopaths.
Been like this for thousands of years, war lords, unethical royalty, 
corporations screwing the workers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A true democracy would have a fully honestly informed population to allow them to reason for themselves (corporate media propaganda destroys this)
and primaries and other elections have been rigged (partially), also reducing the quality of the democracy dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't have to pick and choose.
The U.S. is both a democracy and republic but
the democracy part is severely lacking in quality.

       So true regarding the corporate media. 5 companies control 90% of media within the USA. Until that ends we're stuck with a public that has opinions and views fed to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They believe their making their own informed decisions, but those 'decisions ' were merely placed in their head by the paradigm. Their not thinking for themselves. Media leads them to whom they must vote for.

       Exactly. Some people even subconsciously cherry pick.
E.g. some scream "MEDIA IS CORRUPT/DISHONEST!!!" (quite rightly)
but then they don't realize that their WHOLE politics education
comes from the TV/other brainwashed friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think the whole lib/con thing is "common sense"
that the media couldn't possibly lie about or frame dishonestly.
As if it's like "the grass is green".
But it's not.
You can go outside and prove to yourself the grass
is green (well you know what I mean).
But how can you prove to yourself that
there are only two choices, Liberal and Conservative???
It's not written in the clouds. It's not taught in schools.
It's lied about on the media and (some) of the internet
and even some American books (other countries aren't not quite as brainwashed
with the lib/con marketting but some are).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people just trust the main narrative
and go straight to so called "liberal/conservative" biased websites,
usually partisan garbage.
They don't realize that the establishment and corporate media
have narrowed the political spectrum to just
a tiny area. Exactly what Noam Chomsky said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media claims the spectrum is like this
with "communism" on the extreme left and fascism on the extreme right
of the lib/con nonsense:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rpNC1Et.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/rpNC1Et.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's actually like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SbTuADn.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/SbTuADn.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal doesn't even have a concrete definition,
it's pretty vague.
The "causes liberty" part can refer
to "liberty for the elite" (e.g. NEOliberalism)
or "liberty for the people" (e.g. left libertarian type ideologies).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lib/con via the media is just corporate marketting.
If they didn't use it,
just imagine it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine one day you were so annoyed with
the DNC AND the GOP
but you "identified" as a "liberal" or "conservative"....
you would eventually come crawling back to the either the DNC/GOP again and again
because according to the media, you have no other choice.... :/
      </p>
      <p>
       And also has this sort of "forgetting" effect
like "I can't stay mad at you, GOP/DNC, I'm a liberal/conservative!!!" yikes.
It gets that politically religious.
Hence successful marketting. They're trying to get people
to choose a stupid box (lib/con)
so they can attach them to a party permanently.
Liberal/Democrat party and Conservative/Republican is just rebranding.
If people rejected lib/con, then they would see
the two parties are the same corporate filth.

       Thanks. :) Just trying to spread the truth about the two party system and end
the divide/conquer misunderstandings that stop the people uniting against the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The antifa vs neonazi psyop seems to have held us back a bit as shills have used it as cover/an excuse for their divide/conquer tactics
like using oversimplified hive mind generalized terms like "the left" "the right"
(stuff straight out of the corporate media, ironically).
Nothing good comes of it.
This sub never used to use those divisive terms much
until the psyop hit.
Putting everyone into two boxes is backward thinking. :P

       It was founded first as a confederation then as a constitutional republic though our rights don't hold up as well as they used to.  I think most of us are taught the Bill of Rights.  Yet, it is more common to hear our government referred to as a democracy when talking to the average American.  Maybe I just don't remember whether we are taught that it is a republic and not a democracy.

       It was never a constitutional republic. When the Rockefellers financed public schooling the planners invented American civics which was all "muh constituzions".  Then Hooverites became enemies, then Nixonites, then "rebupilcans".  So now the idea of a constitutional republic is out of favor, but the origin of the idea was just the elites' BS from three geberations ago

       Greg Palast is a good investigative reporter to check out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, he exposes in great detail the vast amount of election fraud which occurred during the 2000 election, almost 17 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, nothing has changed since then, because our vulnerabilities to election fraud greatly enable those pulling the strings.

       I fully disagree with this.
The problem is that voters
       <strong>
        are offered poor choices
       </strong>
       .  The candidates we have to choose from are hand picked by those in full control, and are guaranteed to be puppets.

       I agree that something may have gone wrong with their plans this election.  This is the first time a candidate was able to finance their entire campaign by themselves.  It certainly doesn't mean that our past presidential candidates hadn't been hand picked by the establishment.

       This is the dumbest fucking approach I've ever heard from anyone in this country and I hear it a lot.  You want to say that about your country and be telling the truth, move to fucking Russia or China.

       It's 100% the wet dream of the elite few who are perverting, stealing, exploiting and corroding democracy for every last one of us to believe that America is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a democracy, but the fact that it is means that just by getting off one's ass, informing oneself and engaging in the process, we can subvert the will of those very same elite few.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how the fucking elite engineered the system this way and it's a long game, not something that happens overnight.  And guess what, that's how we fucking take it back.  I see people with your mindset as clueless or worse - utter sellouts.
