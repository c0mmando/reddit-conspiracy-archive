<p>This is a legit discussion and some of your fellow mods know that it is.</p>

<p>Who voted him in as a mod? was he nominated by anyone?</p>

I have been in this sub since the beginning and my concerns about &quot;professional&quot; moderators like <a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a> have been known. i have stated this before.</p>
