       I have seen countless posts, including ones on the front page right now, stating something to the tune of "the DNC emails were downloaded in 80 seconds so Trump didn't collude with Russia" or the "DNC didn't let authorities investigate their servers so Trump didn't collude with Russia." Seriously read those statements (which are being heavily upvoted here) and stop and think about how ridiculous they sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think there is truth to the DNC leaks, in particular with Seth Rich - though IMO it doesn't necessarily have to be him or even if it was there could be additional leakers too. But it would be insane for me to say "Trump-Russia" is made up because I believe that SR was a leaker.  In fact, just because the emails were leaked (again, I believe they were) doesn't mean they weren't also hacked. It is always possible the Russians hacked them and had them and then they were also subsequently leaked by SR or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nonetheless, there is plenty of other evidence corroborating the Trump-Russia conspiracy. What about the Don Jr. / Kushner / Manafort / et al. meeting with the Russia agents where donations were discussed? That is totally unrelated to leaks. I won't get into the other evidence here because it isn't what this post is about but clearly there is more evidence behind the conspiracy other than simply "the Russians hacked the DNC servers" - hell if that is all they had done there wouldn't be collusion anyway, it is the other stuff that was done that shows collusion. As one last note, please don't come in here with your "what exactly did Trump's team do that was illegal?" crap. First off, I don't give a shit if it was illegal or not, if the campaign worked with Russia to get Trump elected that is a conspiracy to me regardless of whether or not it was technically illegal. And second, there is an ongoing criminal investigation anyway so it is obvious some crimes may have been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, my point is that I believe TPTB are pushing this divisive narrative on us. Sadly, it seems like many on this sub have forgotten about the illusory Democrat-Republican divide. TPTB are pushing this whole you must either side with the RNC and the "DNC emails were leaked" theory or you must side with the DNC and the "Trump colluded with Russia" theory; and then you must constantly discredit the other "side" while bolstering your own "side's" argument. This push is a further attempt to reinforce partisanship among members of this sub and citizens of this country. It is making people pick a team and pick sides. When in reality, it is just an illusion and the fact remains that both theories absolutely can, and IMO are, true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: stop buying into the TPTB's attempt to push partisan bullshit that "DNC leaks" or "Trump-Russia collusion" are mutually exclusive. They are not. Don't fall into the Democrat-Republican trap and allow for further division.

       I believe the narrative being pushed is that the investigation will all be over once the pro-Russian contingent proves these false stories.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They claim it is all illegal because Trump was illegally wiretapped.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They claim it is about the DNC leaks and once it is proven the Russians were not involved, the investigation is over.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They claim the private dossier is all false and illegal evidence and
since it is false there is no collusion.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       An entirely false narrative based on 3 issues that are only a tiny part of the investigation.

       There's plenty of smoke but I understand where you're coming from as well. My assumption is that hard evidence would be kept under wraps so that Trump &amp; co. wouldn't have a chance to guard against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the investigation has only been going on for a handful of months. There's already evidence of shady, undisclosed meetings that Trump Jr. felt compelled to lie about not just once, but twice. Even if there is no evidence thus far, I wouldn't view that as a barometer for what this investigation will bring in the coming months, one way or the other.

       What makes you so confident that it would have leaked? There are people on this sub who believe the 400,000+ people involved in the moon landings never leaked the fact that it was fake, so Mueller and his team being professionals and keeping stuff tight to their chest doesn't sound
       <em>
        that

       unreasonable to me.

       I'll grant you that we are in a murky place when it comes to knowing the actual timeline and events that took place but you do know that the Watergate scandal took years right? I get that you don't trust the groups that are emphasizing the story the most but it does seem like you are being awfully impatient with the results.

       Watergate was also before our media became consolidated into giant corporations that work hand-in-hand with the Intelligencia to promote war propaganda and misinformation. This was back when NYT and WaPo were actually great outlets with investigative journalism that placed the politicians' feet to the fire.

       Bob Woodward is still an associate editor with the Washington Post. I get your mistrust of the media and I'm not saying you're wrong but just because they push a narrative doesn't mean they are always factually wrong. I really don't want to try to defend the mainstream media because I don't trust it either but at this point you either trust Trump's narrative of the story or theirs. Not a great choice.

       Oh I agree. It's never 100%. I have seen good articles by The Guardian, BBC, and occasionally NYT and WaPo. But you have to wade through disinformation and propaganda to get to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that aren't aware of this, the propaganda distorts their worldview for the worse. That's why the MSM is toxic. If you're aware of their bias and agenda, you can wade through the shit to find the gold.

       Exactly. Hell the election was like 300 days ago and you STILL see people bringing up "But Hilary" on every single Trump thread. Look, Hilary is despicable don't get me wrong, but that is just further evidence of this push for a partisan divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump v. Hillary. DNC leaks v. Trump-Russia Collusion. RNC v. DNC. All just shams to divide us.Why can't both Trump and Hillary be scum? Why can't both DNC leaks and Trump-Russia be true? Why can't both the RNC and DNC be corrupt? The reality is that both people are both scum, both theories are true, and both organizations are corrupt. But TPTB do such a good job of pushing this partisan crap that so many pick sides and remain absolutely loyal to their side and remain committed to attacking the other side. It is really sad.

       Not the same by a long shot. Breitbart is a right wing news organization.

       Share Blue engages in mass forum / sub / social media manipulation

       Maybe Cambridge Analytica does have a presence on Reddit, but no information has
been posted that I can see which confirm this.

      <p>
       David Brock has a long history of being a total piece of human garbage. Just look at 
what he did to Anita Hill in the 1990's. He ruined her life, all to protect a judge from 
prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Mercer has not done anything controversial that I can see.

       Kock Brothers are pieces of shit too, but they don't fund violent groups
like George Soros does.

      <p>
       The "Alt-Right" is an ambiguous term, not aimed at a specific group
and is not defined.

      <p>
       Antifa is an anarcho-communist black block group that promotes the 
use of violence against others, is funded by BAMN, which is funded
by 3 groups created or funded directly by George Soros.

       Not really, I'm just calling a spade a spade. Right now all the vitriol

       From what I understand, for the Trump-Russia story to be true, Russia would have had to approach a candidate with a reportedly zero chance of winning the election and offer to help him by providing the American people with entirely true information about the DNC candidate. This is confusing because it's basically saying that Russian involvement led to a better informed American voter base, allowing the electorate to avoid a potentially criminal candidate thereby strengthening the democratic process.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its difficult to claim that both sides are equally as bad by saying you don't care whether or not Trump has done anything illegal. This means that if Trump was found to have broken no laws and Hillary was found to have broken several, they would be equally as guilty in your opinion. I'm not saying this will turn out to be the case, but whether or not someone has broken the law is a fundamental factor when comparing the conduct of two people and insisting we ignore this and instead condemn both sides only serves to discourage  debate.

       Agreed. They've managed to turn conspiracy theorizing into a zero sum, binary, team sport situation. Which is what always happens when tensions are high and people get tricked into taking oppositional sides, and objective reasoning turns into which "side" you trust more due to your bias. Reminds me of what I've read about the Bircher years, and Alex Jones' shift into partisan gatekeeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is when one theory gets deliberately framed as a reaction to another, allegedly real conspiracy being covered. When in reality, all possibilities are on the table and may run in conjunction with one another, and until we find out for sure that must be the way this is all viewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theories you've highlighted and essentially every theory from the election era are full of holes, logical leaps, lack of concrete evidence, coincidences, propaganda promotional efforts by various players and factions. Unless we're skeptical of everything, we become cultish drones incapable of the task we're supposed to be doing.

       Oh I agree. It's never 100%. I have seen good articles by The Guardian, BBC, and occasionally NYT and WaPo. But you have to wade through disinformation and propaganda to get to it.

      <p>
       For those that aren't aware of this, the propaganda distorts their worldview for the worse. That's why the MSM is toxic. If you're aware of their bias and agenda, you can wade through the shit to find the gold.
