<p>I have been here since this sub started, a lot of you know me and a lot of the moderators have known me for years. I know the rules here and I like this sub and have always tried to have it&#39;s interests at heart. So I am not being malicious with this question. </p>

<p>I am concerned with what is going on here and un-elected, un-nominated, full-time reddit power mods are not a good sign. It is a backward step and a horrible precedent.</p>

<p>I think people often use a person&#39;s post history as a way to skirt the issue at hand and not address the issue. If you are delving that far back in someone&#39;s history you are more than likely looking for some ammunition to attack me, the messenger, and not address my concerns about un-elected, un-nominated, un-discussed full-time redddit power mods coming in to moderate this sub. I guess I was hoping you would just address the issue and discuss your thoughts about my concern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a slow boil. We have resisted for a long time, they couldn&#39;t come right after r/conspiacy immediately after they had co-opted r/politics, r/wikileaks, and shut down r/pizzagate. Too many refugees fled here. But that has worked to their advantage. Slowly, but surely, they have turned up the heat. The shitposting shills have taken a noticeable leap in activity in the last 3 days alone...taking &quot;advantage&quot; of the mod drama...and now we are all congregated here, with nowhere else to go but the depths of the chans and scattered forum communities. To all the real ones- stay and fight. Fuck the shills, read through /new, and sort by controversial. Wear the downvotes with pride. Because there is nowhere else at this point, no place as large or coordinated. If we lost here, they have broken a major line of resistance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the new que- I was exactly the same. In the last week I&#39;ve had some of the best conversations I&#39;ve ever experienced in r/conspiracy by checking /new and being one of the first to engage. It&#39;s one of the ways to fight the shills. Jump in when the thread is young to stop the immediate derailing.

<p>SUGGESTION: Here&#39;s Something to share with new users -- maybe something like it will even make it to the sidebar:</p>

<p>&quot;...welcome, new-ish participant to r/conspiracy. I see by your comments your account is new and/or you haven&#39;t been here a lot recently. </p>

<p>The results of a flame-skirmish on content, purpose and netiquette in this sub move some of us to make the following recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sort and view the sub by &quot;new&quot; to see everything</p></li>
<li><p>sort by &quot;controversial&quot; to know where opinions are wide and haven&#39;t settled yet. </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t hesitate to comment early on something meaningful to you -  it sets the tone to something of interest to you and gets dialog going</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on the content and not the commenter</p></li>
</ul>

The logos of places like Besta pizza. The all out attack on any and all parts of the investigation. The scrubbing of the wiki. The scrubbing of r/pizzagate. The creation of the term &quot;Fake News&quot; at exactly the time pizzagate began trending. The silencing of Ben Swann. The Dutroux Affair, the Franklin Scandal, Dennis Hastert.

    <div class="md"><p>Back when I first saw this happen to r/politics and r/wikileaks, and watched r/pizzagate get scrubbed, I did. But with time I have come to accept these things. I know that as they push us off the the Internet forums we must advance the battle to real life, talking to friends and family and never giving up the fight. But I am beginning to worry about the health of r/conspiracy in general. We seem to be well into step 2 of the program, where the shills start flooding in after step 1, Mod shake ups. But r/conspiracy is different, it&#39;s got a very strong, critically minded community, and has resisted longer than any other sub its&#39; size on Reddit. The battle can still be won, imo it&#39;s not over until we get official ban lists and comment sections getting nuked. </p>

<p>What does &#39;critically minded&#39; mean to you? I still come here because I occasionally find nuggets of gold, but they are few and far between. Most regular users of this sub have not been trained in critical thinking. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP98ZKt709A">That is not what school is for</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it means there can still be good conversation had. It is an amorphous term, to be sure, since most wont agree on one definition of critical thinking. But I can still come here and find good conversation on the Occult, Magick in general, Princess Di, machinations of the Deep State on both sides of the political aisle, things like that. Browsing /new is pretty nice for finding good discussion. </p>

<p>I agree, school for the common citizen is not designed for critical thinking, it is made to create obedient cogs in the machine of capitalistic society. Yet the elites still learn the Trivium at the Ivy Leagues- Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar. These help to produce critical thinking. For me, critical thought also begins with questioning everything, especially authority, which must be taught at home as much as at school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  am sort of taking the &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude also. My primary concern before was just the sheer amount of repetitive, agenda-driven political slap fighting on the front page and in the comment sections. It was not even really looking like a conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>I  think it is going to take a bit of time and effort to clean up the battlefield that the shills left behind here. </p>

<p>That said, I am still not a big fan of career power-mods being on the mod team. This would get many sideways glances here in earlier days. Now with all the gamemanship, it is hard to rely on how the voting plays out on a given issue. Voting on reddit has become almost completely unreliable these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a culture among them for as long as I can  remember, a mindset of superiority over users. Because of this built-in sense of power that permeates in the moderator community, and among the admin community and the commercial sales community, and among the IT Community, the code-level community, the network admin community. Everyone thinks <em>they</em> understand things <em>better</em> than the other. It is this built-in sense of competition instead of cooperation that limits the way someone understands how self-limiting that can be. I left moderating years ago and knew I would never go back among them. My days among them has been over for a number of years, and that is all by my own choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a post from <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Assuredlyathrowaway/">on this subreddit</a> from the user that moderators 92 subs. (To be clear a lot of them are not very populated subreddits.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm, where do I start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this account started because <a href="/u/hueypreist">/u/hueypreist</a> and <a href="/u/kn0thing">/u/kn0thing</a> pissed me off one time after I was fighting with <a href="/u/drunken_economist">/u/drunken_economist</a> over some petty bullshit.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll skip the details on both sides please. Don&#39;t go there and I won&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I saw a reddit back in 2011 (when I made this account) that was fucked six ways from Sunday.</p>

<p>Mods had complete free reign to do whatever they wanted (mass banning users from 100&#39;s of subs for having a view with which the mod disagreed, censoring topics, manipulating the hot queue to make sure only &quot;certain&quot; stores got to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> (this was really bad with the I/P conflict in particular. Only on the fucking Hasbara side. And don&#39;t tell me shit about anti-semitism, I&#39;m Jewish.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I embarked on a bit of a project I guess; to bring about a cogent understanding of the reddit power structure in the minds of it&#39;s userbase.</p>

<p>I felt that if I set that as an end goal, I could remedy the problems with regards to evil elements manipulating the free flow of information behind the backs of regular users.</p>

<p>Of course, the admins fought me at every turn.</p>

<p>Making it harder and harder to track removals by changing the way comment&#39;s work so that when a mod delete&#39;s a comment with no &quot;child comments&quot; the deletion does not even appear in the thread. You can only discern the amount of comment deletions by virtue of looking at the total number of comments listed at the top of the string, and comparing it to the number of comments rendered in the thread.</p>

<p>Things like this are but a small microcosm of the shit the admins tried to pull to thrawrt what I was going for.</p>

<p>When things got really bad on the site itself (aka, I had no moves left to play); I decided the only option was to bring in the press.</p>

<p>So I started seeding contacts across all major newspapers and online publications and began using printed media to act as an external check on mod behavior.</p>

<p>I did this because I felt the mod power structure on reddit was in desperate need of reform.</p>

<p>I feel bad about some of the people I hurt by my behavior; because I inculcated an ethos whereby users eat mods alive for the slightest transgression.</p>

<p>There are good people in the reddit meta and in control of the site, who stay silent only because they need to feed their families. The ethical indiscretions of their counterparts must not blind us as we approach a dialectical solution to reddit&#39;s most pressing problem.</p>

<p>So, when even I say &quot;remember the human&quot;, please do it.</p>

<p>This is a community for friends, where information can engender the will of the human spirit in the annals of public consciousness.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fuck with that. Because I&#39;m watching. Always and forever.</p>

<p>-AssuredlyAThrowAway</p>

<p>Just posting so we have a bit of backstory here.</p>
