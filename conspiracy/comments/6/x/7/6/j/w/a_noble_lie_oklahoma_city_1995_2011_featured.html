       Interesting fact about Timothy McVeigh, "the Oklahoma City Bomber," he was executed exactly 3 months prior to the September 11 attacks, nearly to the hour (7:14 am for his execution and the first plane hit the tower at 8:46 am). The Luciferians love their numerology, so I doubt this is just a coincidence.

       So basically Holder enabled  the bombing/ an undercover operation by authorizing actual explosives being given to Nichols? But isn't this going on in many FBI undercover terror operations/ arrests to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings up other questions besides facilitation and coercion. Are many of these target suspects and organizations exploiting this going off on their own with any related activity being explained away as part of the undercover assignment.

       Funny - the same company that did cleanup after Oklahoma City bombing also did cleanup at WTC after 9/11. Their name? Controlled Demolition, Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also hold the world record for controlled demolition, at 33 stories. And they work with Hollywood.

       It's so frustrating that if people just took the time to do the research on their own they would come to the same conclusion. I've come to the realization that most people just don't want to know the truth. It's easier to not take on the added stress and just laugh it off as crazy. But you're right we should still do our part and keep trying.

      <p>
       are exactly the opposite of coming to a conclusion. Most 9/11 truth guys gained their detailed knowledge about the event through that biased lens, and anything that might go against that idea is somehow made to fit. Some of the same criticisms truthers make to skeptics. Just keep in mind that some people have financial interests in creating conspiracy theories, too.

       I get what you're saying and I see why you would do that, but by doing so you ruin your investigation before either even starts by making a broad assumption before you see any real evodence.  By doing so it will color any evidence you come across and derail your investigations due to bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, one can easily see why you could assume from the get go that it was a controlled demolition.

       i get what you are saying, and that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps if i re-phrase it might be better
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are researching 9/11, and you have become sufficiently convinced that the WTC were brought down in a controlled demolition, then that would be a good time to start your research over starting with the assumption of a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       what i mean by that is to start with the WTC complex, and to assume that one day in the future the WTC building will need to be demolished. how would these buildings be demolished, if they were merely being demolished to make way for something new?
      </p>
      <p>
       then ask yourself which methods of controlled demolition would be most suitable for the WTC application, and who would do the work, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       then ask yourself if the collapses we saw on 9/11 closely match what we would have expected to see during our controlled demolition
      </p>
      <p>
       here is a video of a so-called "top-down, progressive collapse" controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prwvj-npt5s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prwvj-npt5s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       at first, this video may upset you, because it basically debunks the myth that a small part of the top of the building can't crush the larger bottom part of the building, which has been claimed by 9/11 skeptics
      </p>
      <p>
       however, the more you watch that video, the more a few things become apparent
      </p>
      <p>
       1) "progressive collapse" was not a newly discovered phenomenon on 9/11, and was in-fact a tried and true method of controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) "progressive collapse" would be the method of choice for the WTC1 WTC 2 application.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) "progressive collapse" is what we saw on 9/11 at WTC1 WTC 2

       after looking more closely at the evidence, i had to admit that i was wrong, and had to change my opinion.

       Well, they needed someone to haul away all the rubble. Demolition companies demolish buildings and then haul off the rubble, so doesn't it make sense that they'd hire one? It's not like there's other companies that specialize in hauling off parts of buildings. And if they're going to hire one, they might as well hire the best one.

       I mean, a demolition company being involved in cleanup isn't a stretch. And if they have the record it makes sense that Hollywood would want to work with them.

       Why hire the world record holder for cleanup? Indeed wouldn't that be who you'd hire for demolition? A bunch of Israeli art students or intelligence agents aren't going to be able to handle a job such as this.

       They're probably the best for a reason.

       What all does cleanup entail? It seems like cleanup is a big part of demolition, so hiring (were they hired or did they volunteer?) a demolition crew would make sense.

       Perhaps his death was faked. Mcveigh appealed to the system to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be autopsied:

      <p>
       And a witness to his execution said he was still breathing after lethal injection:
      </p>
      <p>
       "SUSAN CARLSON: No fear – no fear whatsoever. No, no statement, no verbal statement – nothing to say. They, they did offer him the opportunity to speak, and I think everybody was waiting with bated breath… for what he was about to say, and he remained stone cold silent, stared directly at the ceiling, stoic, stoically, after he had made a point looking at all of us, he looked at the ceiling, he laid back down, and from that point on, he had no expression whatsoever. In fact, it was hard to even tell when he had passed on, because, of his shallow breathing – or what appeared to be shallow breathing – continued, even after they pronounced him dead, and his eyes remained open the entire time – I don't even think he blinked – and he died with his eyes open."

       One of the things that frequently gets overlooked is that Terry Nichols went to the Philippines several times in the early to mid 90s.  Abu Sayaff and other Muslim groups were starting to become a force/trouble for the Philippines at the sametime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Nichols 'accidently' wind-up meeting with these individuals and/or groups. Did he seek them out?

       The Peter Lance book/s or The Third Terrorist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have good points but theoretically it would take experienced improvised bomb makers to do OKC. Especially big improvised bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of things I've read over the years is most improvised bombs are tough to build in that there are safety concerns(I think the Barcelona terrorists had problems with fire &amp; explosions in their bomb making residences) and getting the explosives to go off in the desired fashion. That takes experience and/or product testing which means money resources for two devices. Also have seen stories of bombs going off prematurely and/or the dentonator/person setting them off accidentally. Knowledge and manufacturing product takes training and resources. Where did the OKC bombers get theirs?

       The Peter Lance book is a good reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of things to keep in mind is the cost of all those trips. Yes he had a wife from the Philippines but that's still requires a lot of money. That area; Philippines, Australia has always been an expensive and time consuming flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I saw the reports of Abu Sayyaf /Al Qaeda activity in the Philippines after 9/11 it made me think although I was already suspicious of the official OKC story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically Abu Sayyaf also has it's roots in Afghanistan from the Soviet occupation.

       Nichols has also become more forth coming about the bombing over the years basically pointing towards somekind of operation or secondary plot.

       Check out Jayna Davis's book on the middle eastern connections to the bombing...very eye opening...there is also evidence that Eric Holder was tied to this by providing the materials that were used in the bombing... The whole thing is so fishy and the government won't release any information and politicians that tried to reopen the investigation got shut down and their careers ruined. The people's commission that investigated "others unknown" was published and released only 2-3 weeks before Sept 11th, 2001. Never really took much stock into 9-11 conspiracies but after doing much research into OKC it makes me really question things

       yeah I wonder if they were trying to set up a "muslims did Oklahoma city" false flag but then US military agent timothy McVeigh got caught by some legit law enforcement officers or someone not in on it so they had to arrest him and make up a whole new cover story.

       tbh i haven't spent a lot of time on OKC bombing, but in general if you want to know the motive for a false flag terrorist act, just make a list of all the actions that were taken because of it. any actions taken, supposedly in reaction to an event, are actually the real motive behind the action.
      </p>
      <p>
       or to put it another way, what good does terrorism bring to the terrorist? did Tim McVeigh accomplish anything with a terrorist act, other than to alienate everyone from the cause that motivated him to act.

       theres something sketchy about rental trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       for one, the former (Special Agent in Charge) SAC of Boston FBI Richard Deslauriers "retired" at age 53, (supposedly because the FBI makes agents retire at age 57) and then went to work as corporate security for Penske. yeah, that sounds like a logical way to end your career and shrink your pension.
      </p>
      <p>
       but whats even more sketchy is that Richard Deslauriers replaced a man at Penske who was also a former FBI SAC.
      </p>
      <p>
       so it looks to me like if you are a FBI SAC, and you are forced to resign under duress, then TPTB have a golden parachute waiting for you in the form of a no-show job chasing stolen rental trucks
      </p>
      <p>
       the truck that was used for OKC bombing was a Ryder truck, iirc.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       also, i very, very seldom see Penske trucks on the road, but i always notice them when i see them. they have a strange usage pattern, like you won't see a Penske truck for 6 months, then one day you see 10 of them traveling in a caravan.
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect that rental trucks are used for smuggling drugs and human trafficking. they would be the perfect vehicle. big enough to carry a heavy load, yet small enough to avoid weigh stations. if the truck breaks down or is impounded by local police, the smugglers can just walk away, and Penske can probably get their truck back by sending former FBI SAC to get it.

       Chandra Levy might have been investigating OKC before her death.

       A former journalism major, she was an intern for the Bureau of Prisons in Washington in 2001. She was getting her master's from USC. She started sleeping with her hometown Congressman, Gary Condit. People who sleep together sometimes discuss secrets. Gary Condit was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Levy was known to have worked on matters related to McVeigh's execution while she was at BOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2001, it's likely that a highly intelligent intern would have had significant access to computer data systems at BOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalism majors are sometimes curious, and snoop around.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day of her murder, she visited 30 web sites. The FBI said it wasn't impotant, and said she was going to a site about travel to France, (GoFrance and about.com). Sometimes people who fear for their lives think about fleeing the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       During her disappearance, Condit was at Vice President Cheney's office to talk about the California energy situation. This alibi was revealed in Issikoff's column, often covering intel agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       After her disappearance, which immediately shot to national attention due to the revelation of her affair with the Congressman, authorities and regular people conducted an extensive search in the area near her home, including Rock Creek Park. A year after her disappearance, her body was found in Rock Creek Park.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her murder is unsolved. They prosecuted a man. He always maintained his innocence. His legal defense claimed she was killed elsewhere and the body dumped in the park later. The jury convicted him. After a few years, his conviction was thrown out. He has been freed and deported.  Authorities have no leads in Levy's disappearance.
      </p>

      <p>
       To me, it sounds like she stumbled into some important facts, and then an agent of the secret government waited until Condit had an alibi, whacked her, then dumped the body a year later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Condit was still head of the House Intelligence Committee through 9/11. He was never able to regain his career.

       It sounds like he played ball with the secret government, and then they started to freeze him out after they got wind that he let secrets go to a DC intern.

       One of my favorite documentaries of all time. This and Waco: the rules of engagement really helped push me further down the rabbit home and have opened my eyes to what the US government is capable of.

       Quite the red pill.  Very revealing documentary.  The first 35 minutes are a little slow, but it strongly holds your attention from there to the end.  Very glad I watched this.

       I'm at work and can't watch this atm, but I'm wondering: does it go into the fact that Joe Biden wrote
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Counterterrorism_Act_of_1995">
        the precursor
       </a>
       to the PATRIOT act
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the OKC bombing, which was the catalyst for the act getting passed?
