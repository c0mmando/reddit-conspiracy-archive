Yeah I'm sure that's a real account not a troll or paid account......
Go to the Donald there constantly condemning KKK. Any group that has to were mask is pathetic (ISIS, ANTIFA, KKK) 
Stop doing your part to divide. It's time to unite as a country.

       Nope, we are being politically incorrect because that's the trend wanted by Trump supporters. And here is another one:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        'It doesn't bother me that they got hurt at all': North Carolina KKK Grand Dragon says he is GLAD that Heather Heyer died in Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' violence
Justin Moore said he was 'not bothered at all' that protesters were killed 
Heather Heyer died on Saturday after she was struck by a car driven by accused white supremacist James Fields
'I'm sorta glad that them people got hit and I'm glad that girl died,' Moore said
        <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4796016/KKK-Grand-Dragon-says-GLAD-Heather-Heyer-died.html#ixzz4rLSJ4gMe">

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's be honest, if some ISIS supporters were making those comments you would have blamed it on all billions of mainstream Muslims and wanted the American ones out. By the way, Trump's own father was a KKK member. He finds the nazis fine people. You can't unite the country by attacking almost anyone who attacks Trump or who goes against your ideology.

       Hahahahaha wtf comparing Isis supporters to trump supporters !!! Wow kid your literally crazy. If you support ISIS that's sad. You see the shit they do??? I don't know all the details on that woman's murder and find it very suspect no answers for the downed chppper that day; news remains silent about that. Your always gonna have a few bad apples. And I doubt the people that say those things even voted, probably just low life trolls. I really hope you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you believe what you believe. Two wrongs don't make a right man. To much hate in this world without you adding to it.

       Plenty of mainstream Muslims feel the same way every time there is a terrorist attack by ISIS in the west.

       Mainstream Muslims and Jews have been saying that also. But all of them are always blamed for the evil of few from their groups. The interesting thing is that those who are committing the evil do so in secret so that not all from their groups can protest or stop it. But Trump supporters do so freely.

       What I believe does not matter. Remember one has to be politically incorrect now and that we are supposed to be fighting terrorism? This is what Trump supporters wanted and we are just following their trend.

       Fair enough. No one will listen. I already proved the mother (who is jewish) didnt birth him. Us Jews keep impeccable birth records. If you have a Jewish mom you can migrate to israel with almost zero formal process. She did not birth him. Also her interview was done several times. That wasnt one take that was live.

       Yeah... that kid doesn't live in a country run by literal Nazi. Soros was an opportunist who was just going for the "winning side" and bailed when it was obvious he chose incorrectly.

       What proof do we have that Seth Rich is dead?  Or Podesta wrote any of those emails?  Or that Donald Trump didn't rape a 12 year old girl on July 17, 2006?

       Yes they can! Though when they're not, the doctors end up dead also. Didn't the same thing happen with Andrew Breitbart?

       Lying about both.  Prove to me John Podesta wrote those emails and prove to me the autopsy report in Seth Rich wasn't forged.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the alleged rape.  I have absolutely no evidence (nor have I ever heard) that Donald Trump ever raped someone on July 17, 2006.  But I'm just asking questions.  I just want to know what proof you have that he didn't rape someone that day?

       Also, I can't prove that Trump isn't a time traveler nor that he has existed his entire life on this plane. I also can't prove gravity.

       I can't prove that Seth Rich is dead. As a matter of fact, I hope he's alive and in protective custody, being hidden until the investigations turn into trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta has behaved as if they're real, and considering what's in them and what they represent... I don't know how that would pooooossibly help him.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you made a mistake by picking when the dismissed in 2006 when you meant the incident happening in '94. Even when Trump is giving a live speech, I can't prove that's Trump, and even if he is Trump, I can't prove that he's not currently raping someone at the moment.
