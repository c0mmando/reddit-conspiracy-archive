    <div class="md"><p>Nope, we are being politically incorrect because that&#39;s the trend wanted by Trump supporters. And here is another one:</p>

<p>&#39;It doesn&#39;t bother me that they got hurt at all&#39;: North Carolina KKK Grand Dragon says he is GLAD that Heather Heyer died in Charlottesville &#39;Unite the Right&#39; violence
Justin Moore said he was &#39;not bothered at all&#39; that protesters were killed 
Heather Heyer died on Saturday after she was struck by a car driven by accused white supremacist James Fields
&#39;I&#39;m sorta glad that them people got hit and I&#39;m glad that girl died,&#39; Moore said

</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest, if some ISIS supporters were making those comments you would have blamed it on all billions of mainstream Muslims and wanted the American ones out. By the way, Trump&#39;s own father was a KKK member. He finds the nazis fine people. You can&#39;t unite the country by attacking almost anyone who attacks Trump or who goes against your ideology. </p>

<p>Nope, I do not. But I do see ideology of Trump supporters and ISIS is quite similar. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Plenty of mainstream Muslims feel the same way every time there is a terrorist attack by ISIS in the west.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your always gonna have a few bad apples. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mainstream Muslims and Jews have been saying that also. But all of them are always blamed for the evil of few from their groups. The interesting thing is that those who are committing the evil do so in secret so that not all from their groups can protest or stop it. But Trump supporters do so freely. </p>

<p>What I believe does not matter. Remember one has to be politically incorrect now and that we are supposed to be fighting terrorism? This is what Trump supporters wanted and we are just following their trend. </p>

<p>Podesta has behaved as if they&#39;re real, and considering what&#39;s in them and what they represent... I don&#39;t know how that would pooooossibly help him.</p>

<p>And you made a mistake by picking when the dismissed in 2006 when you meant the incident happening in &#39;94. Even when Trump is giving a live speech, I can&#39;t prove that&#39;s Trump, and even if he is Trump, I can&#39;t prove that he&#39;s not currently raping someone at the moment.</p>
