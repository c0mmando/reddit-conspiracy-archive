    <div class="md"><p>Moving through throngs of people, none of which you know, that is the most common aspect of living in any big city, produces a far greater sensation of loneliness and feeling alone, isolated and alienated than actually being genuinely alone in the middle of nowhere way out in the countryside. </p>

<p>In fact there&#39;s often a far greater natural sense of &quot;belonging&quot; to that natural world itself and not a little regret at having to leave it to get back to where we&#39;re supposed to belong but that has all kinds of things in it we don&#39;t like or actually feel belong in or to it but nevertheless still have to put up with.</p>

<p>There&#39;s very old piece of advice to remember when it comes to that which is... &quot;always take time to smell the roses.&quot; Or re-connect with nature wherever and whenever it is possible to do that along your way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most likely culprit was undoubtedly TV that gave people a shared experience without them actually having to be together to experience it. </p>

<p>One that they&#39;d then talk about and discuss with each other later, instead of all the more ordinary experiences they still had and used to share, but that no longer seemed to be quite as important, interesting, amusing, or worth mentioning as what the TV now provided them with to talk about, instead. </p>

<p>Although the same thing dominates much of our own conversations here, TV and the major mass media has lost most of our trust and confidence, not that it actually ever deserved it, but because we were all simply too trusting and naive in regards to that in the first place. </p>

<p>We simply inherited that from a time when it was far more locally produced and community centred... driven from the bottom-up when it came to what any community&#39;s likes, dislikes, needs, etc. were, rather than dictated by a few nameless and faceless executives and producers in New York or LA trying to maximize their profits any way they could. </p>

<p>We seem to overlook how and when the mainstream media&#39;s rise to power actually began and the kind of undue influence it&#39;s achieved over vast numbers of people. </p>

<p>It also had a huge &quot;homogenizing&quot; effect dictating fashions and styles and telling people what&#39;s in or out, hot or not, that they subsequently followed no matter where they were and made those a reality. </p>

<p>If the TV said something was true the general consensus would become that it must be so. It was always a lot of power invested in a relatively few hands but nowhere near the kind of concentration and extremely few hands that it&#39;s virtually ALL in now.</p>

<p>Without that individuals were far less inclined to let go of their own thoughts and ideas about any subject or not personally investigate and research things they became interested in any way they could think of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The advent of industrialism has been a pretty big stumbling block for humanity too. Also technology and even more especially the internet has been too. Humans have not evolved for these constructs and are going through some serious growing pains. We live in possibly the most unique time to be human thus far...I know life will inevitably prevail, and consciousness is ever-evolving and we are ever-adapting. But it&#39;s no surprise that people feel lost. It&#39;s been an interesting education on psychology for me, because you see so many people whose subconsciouses are in turmoil but they still put on a face of contentment. It is not socially acceptable to say modern society is toxic, or to say that humanity is not living up to its full potential(even in the most &#39;advanced&#39; societies). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely relate to this. My current views on US politics are formed so much by information that, although true, is being actively suppressed by the mainstream media. I feel like I can&#39;t even talk politics with close friends who have similar values anymore because they&#39;ll think I&#39;m nuts unless they&#39;re willing to dig through a semester&#39;s worth of recommended reading first on geopolitics and economic imperialism, on CIA psyops and manufacturing consent, on newsworthy leaked information the mainstream media has declined to cover, etc...</p>

<p>The media has done such a disturbingly good job at making fact-based, reasonable views outside their artificially unanimous narrative seem like &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; material -- hence why I find myself browsing places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where deviating from that consensus is still permitted...</p>

<p>Like you said, there&#39;s a lot of information to take in to form these kinds if views. If you start arguing with someone who has general good faith in the government about something like the potential of 9/11 being orchestrated, you&#39;re not arguing against the facts of the matter, you&#39;re arguing against the massive wall of bias that is their happy little worldview.</p>

<p>Both were proponents of the &quot;headshrinker&quot; dictum which meant their patients were there to be abused as well both adhered to the methodology of physical violence, see the following excerpt from Jungs 1910 correspondence with Freud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 June 1910: Dear Professor Freud, I was amazed by your news, the adventure with Schöttlander is marvelous, of course the slimy bastard was lying. </p>

<p>I hope you roasted, flayed, and impaled the fellow with such genial ferocity that he got a lasting taste for once of the effectiveness of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>I subscribe to your final judgment with all my heart. Such is the nature of these beasts, since I could read the filth in him from his face I would have gone for his throat.</p>

<p>I hope to God you told him all the truths so plainly that even his hen’s brain could absorb them, now we shall see what his next coup will be.</p>

<p>Had I been in your shoes I would have softened up his guttersnipe complex with a sound Swiss thrashing. <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6lfZCwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA51&amp;amp;lpg=PA51&amp;amp;dq=Carl+Jung+believed+in+thrashing+his+patients&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DNvqwRJNVd&amp;amp;sig=lH1k6ev0thfgqQT9VMBIBqP6LY4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Carl%20Jung%20believed%20in%20thrashing%20his%20patients&amp;amp;f=false">Carl Jung, Wounded Healer of the Soul, by Claire Dunne</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sodd the two of them, stay as far away from psych doctors as you all can .. be happy and if you are not happy make it look as though you are, and everything should be ok.</p>

<p>Study astrology .. loneliness can be identified in the horoscope of the sufferer by hard aspects to planet Pluto, when the Moon or the life&#39;s ruing planet turns up by itself in a quadrant or worse still a hemisphere it will bring emotional isolation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole concept of &quot;man is a social animal&quot; is just propaganda. Truth is that the need for social interaction can be completely satisfied by one person. Be it a true friend or partner.</p>

<p>If this interaction is not enough, it is a sign of incompatibility. The less you are able to connect on a deep level, the more you substitute it with the quantity of shallow interactions.</p>

<p>The way modern society is organized makes it improbable to have many deep connections in life, since it is almost a necessity to live in close contact for that. &quot;hippie&quot; communities are the clearest examples i can think of something that resembles the natural state of tribalism where you have a large amount of close social interaction. And of course the military. A large reason for PTSD is the isolation one can feel after the experience of living as one closely-knit unit is over. And this is why MDMA is so effective in treating it. It teaches empathy, to connect on a deeper level, satisfying the social need by quality, not quantity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Children who have been cut off from meaningful interactions can barely speak. If you literally have seen only one person in your lifetime, your self identity, your self concept, will be warped by that one person. I&#39;m talking early childhood.

    <div class="md"><p>What you call warped is actually how it works in any case. Just that instead of being warped by one, they are warped by many. The way you turn out is highly dependent on the environment you exist in.</p>

<p>I would love to see what kind of research you refer to, since i am almost certain it involves study of some kind of neglect and outcomes from that. Not a deep emotional connection with a mentor.</p>
