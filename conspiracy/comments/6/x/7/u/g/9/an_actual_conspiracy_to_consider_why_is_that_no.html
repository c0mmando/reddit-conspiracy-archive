    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families. (Applause.) That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes -- and I&#39;m speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you. And I might be speaking against Mr. Cook, and we&#39;re both okay with it, is that right? It&#39;s crazy. We&#39;re speaking -- maybe we shouldn&#39;t be doing this, you know? (Laughter.) But we&#39;re doing the right thing. (Applause.) True. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.</p>

<p>Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Itâ€™s time to give American workers the pay raise that they&#39;ve been looking for for many, many years. (Applause.)</p>

<p>But this administration is going to fix that. One by one, we&#39;re fixing it. We&#39;re working right now on NAFTA -- the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we&#39;re working on it. Let&#39;s see what happens. (Applause.)</p>

<p>we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent</p>

<p>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks. </p>

<p>Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that&#39;s parked overseas. Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all the relevant info in the speech about taxes, just control f taxes and this is the only things he said that matter.

    <div class="md"><p>He specifically said he wants to make the wealthy and corporations pay less. His entire speech was about exactly that. Closing loopholes while lowering corporate tax rates and tax rates on the highest earners, only hurts the average American while enriching those on top. And that was literally the main theme of his speech. It&#39;s based on the same trickle down reagonomics that&#39;s already failed spectacularly, and led to the rapid decline of the middle class. My panties are twisted because ignorant people like yourself think he&#39;s reaching his hand out to help you, when he&#39;s literally telling you it&#39;s to take money out of your pocket. </p>

<p>He may not possess the same vibes as Obama did but many of his speeches seem to be very carefully composed and well paced. He uses simple words and i won&#39;t fault him for that. Most numbers and statistics make me think of that quote about drunkards and lampposts. I&#39;d hope there&#39;d be public documentation about the specifics that anyone could find if they wanted more numbers.</p>

<p>All in all i find it hard to say if i like Trump but my uninformed opinion would say i find him more honest than Obama; someone who exudes honesty and integrity loses my trust quickly.
I&#39;ll entertain the thought that Trump is a good and bad president in my mind until he&#39;s proven what he can do with his term.</p>
