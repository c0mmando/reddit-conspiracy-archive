<blockquote>
<p>Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality.”—Bashar</p>

<p>Anka claims that he began to communicate, through trance-channeling, with an extra-terrestrial entity called Bashar in 1983. He describes Bashar as existing in a parallel reality, in a time frame that we perceive as the future.</p>

<p>Everything is here and now, but in various states of visibility and invisibility depending upon the frequency that you are operating on, and that means the belief system, the definitions that you buy into most strongly.</p>

<p>Everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way. This is physics.</p>

<p>It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing — a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read threads on vibration, frequency, and energy. I&#39;ve read threads on crop circles being produced through frequency. I&#39;ve seen videos of salt moving on a plate when given different frequencies, vibrations in Hertz. People say some levels of frequency make them feel different. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to learn more on the world around us, how frequency alters our reality and how fear and pain cause us to output different frequencies that the <em>elite</em> channel. I&#39;ve read threads alluding to keeping populations in constant fear produce negative energy that the elites need to continue on. I want to read more about it. The game of life is played between the ears</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean, if you want to give credit to mathematically significant and predictable outcomes to a closed system. But imagine if you ignore that and just pretend that not one of us is responsible for anything and that imagination will fix concrete palpable realities then you can literally just imagine a safe space where we all sing kumbaya and all things will be fixed and we have to exert zero physical and intellectual effort than we can all jerk each other off in a paradise because goody gum gum drop feelings will prevail!! Then all I have to do is believe I&#39;m not subject to the human condition and can change the world from my laptop screen then all will be saved! What don&#39;t you get about that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when people talk about relativity like it has just explained the entire universe for us, when in reality it predicts a rediculous amount of energy all around us in empty space all the time. They call this dark energy because they have absolutely zero idea how to explain it with the current theories they are working on. Relativity explains and predicts a lot of things, but it is not the final theory for how the universe works and if we let it be, we may never understand the universe fully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not quite haha. I almost edited to make that clear, cause I thought you might get that impression. I think you were pretty right you just seemed a bit dismissive I think though. So I guess my only point is that even the scientist don&#39;t understand right now so it doesn&#39;t really do any good to dismiss any ideas. Wasn&#39;t really directed at you, more just hoping some people would read it and understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is giving anyone the impression that science has sooo much of the cosmos figured out. In reality scientists are pretty forthright about their limits. What they have been giving us the impression of however is that Newtonian and Einstein physics are not mutually exclusive. They are different but they both accurately predict things in our reality Einstein&#39;s math predicts a wider scope but is also harder to work with. They are used in different ways but one doesn&#39;t disprove the other.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why the gravity of black holes attracts photons, even if photons do not have mass? Because gravity attracts energy, and mass is energy.</p>

The result of breaking uranium is 2 atoms. Let&#39;s sum the mass of those 2 atoms. WOW what happens? The sum of their mass is less that the mass of the original uranium atom? What happened?</p>

<p>Smoked ~40-50mg of dmt on three tabs of lsd</p>

<p>Had two particular peak experiences during the trip. One where I became a golden light that connected my ego with everything, producing what I thought was the pinnacle of consciousness. The other was becoming the void, after the godlike entities stripped me of all earthly knowledge, thought and almost all of perception as a whole. I was a single point of observation in a black hole, but again i was everything, as I had no division of self to separate me from the void  </p>

<p>I was everything and nothing at different points of the trip, but they both had the same meaning. We are all everything and nothing, and every little thing in the universe is inextricably connected</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! If you&#39;re going to smoke dmt, I&#39;d personally recommend pairing it with a psychedelic, as it can be hard to break through with just dmt in the beginning.

<p>My only advice is that you don&#39;t cling to your ego or anything in this world. Let it all go and fully accept whatever mother deems is going to throw at you. You can feel like you&#39;re dying sometimes, don&#39;t worry about it, just let it happen. It can be the most exhilarating experience imaginable if you don&#39;t cling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psilocybin mushrooms would be a great pairing for dmt. They&#39;re both in the tryptamine family of psychedelics, and the effects of high doses of mushrooms can be very similar to dmt. </p>

<p>Take a light dose that you&#39;re comfortable with, so maybe 1.75g of mushrooms depending on the potentcy, and then load up some dmt and get ready to blast off. Breaking through is significantly easier once you&#39;ve done it the first time. You may even find yourself breaking through on &quot;normal&quot; psychedelics like mushrooms or lsd.</p>

<p>I would recommend trying LSD first. And if you haven&#39;t tripped hard enough on a psychedelic to experience ego loss, which is separate from ego death, I would also recommend a few relatively high dose trips to familiarize yourself with the concept of acceptance and really letting go.</p>

<p>I will say, dmt is extremely intense, and somehow the chemical can sometimes strongly imply that you need the proper mindset and preparation for its experience</p>

<p>This is truly horrible advice for anyone who isn&#39;t already extremely experienced with both psychedelics and DMT. Just having the wrong type of song come on your playlist while tripping on shrooms can be utterly terrifying, I dread to think what a DMT trip might do to you if it didn&#39;t all go well.</p>

<p>People forget that a bad trip can have long-lasting negative effects. Psycadelics are not the carefree harmless drug they are made out to be, they must be treated with the utmost respect. It took me about 2 years to recover from my last shroom trip</p>

<p>Never combine drugs unless you are already very familiar with both. Even then, it&#39;s often a terrible idea.</p>

<p>My first shroom trip went fun at first but I feel I wasn&#39;t &quot;mentally prepared&quot; for the peak. I had eaten about 5grams of Golden Teacher Caps. It turned out to be a pretty bad trip and I couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t want to smoke anything and I felt like I was here but was missing not a piece but a whole chunk of me was just gone. It took about 3 days for me to get &quot;normal&quot; again and get my thoughts and mind straight. I do still experiment with many psychedelics still though and the trips are getting better now that I feel I am more &quot;mentally prepped&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To cut a long story short, I had a gigantic dose of liberty caps, estimate about 100 - 150, but I&#39;m just guessing, it was a huge pile that me and a friend boiled up into tea. I have lots of prior experience with doses up to a max of  60g wet of Mexican/ Indian shrooms.</p>

<p>Within minutes of drinking the tea, another friend who we weren&#39;t expecting turned up, loud, drunk and irritating. Because of this, I tried to fight the shrooms and cling on to my usual state of consciousness as they were kicking in, which I soon learned was a really  bad idea.</p>

<p>I dont remember anything specific that would have triggered it, but after the trip I was convinced I was a weirdo / creep, or that other people thought this of me. I suffered with really bad paranoia and anxiety for at least a year. After the first year, I would still have frequent bouts of this, but not 24/7. I would almost &quot;flashback&quot; to the unpleasant parts of the trip whenever I got really tired. I felt like I had broken my brain.</p>

<p>Finally got my shit back together now, and ready for small dose so I can come to terms with my last trip and get over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of ways to make sure you&#39;re at least eating a lysergamide. And at that point, it&#39;s close enough to lsd that any differences in the experience would be negligible.</p>

<p>Most all research chemicals that can be laid onto a blotter have very strong tastes or sensations. A tasteless tab verified by an ehrlich test kit will almost certainly be a lysergamide, at the very least. most likely lsd.</p>

<p>You can also buy 1p-lsd off the clear net, as it&#39;s unscheduled, and it is in fact a prodrug of lsd.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is truly horrible advice for anyone who isn&#39;t already extremely experienced with both psychedelics and DMT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained in a post below that it&#39;s advisable to have a good amount of experience with the compounds you&#39;d be pairing with dmt.</p>

<p>Some people find it almost impossible to break through on dmt otherwise. That being said, if you&#39;re going to go for an all out dmt break through, it&#39;s good to have a solid history with psychedelics in general. It&#39;s also a good idea to smoke some low doses, or even near break through doses of dmt to see how you react.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re considering breaking through on dmt, you have to come to terms with the fact that the experience may be soul shattering and utterly horrifying, regardless of whether or not you&#39;re already on a psychedelic. Having said that, generally that&#39;s only if you have a strong ego and cling to it, based on my experience and reports from others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People forget that a bad trip can have long-lasting negative effects. Psycadelics are not the carefree harmless drug they are made out to be, they must be treated with the utmost respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, psychedelics demand respect. They can turn on you very quickly for any number of reasons, and the experiences can produce lasting negative effects. That&#39;s why I suggested in another post that the person have at least a handful of medium to heavy mushroom trips under their belt before considering dmt. Ideally, before trying dmt, you&#39;d want to be familiar with all classes of psychedelic drugs, meaning multiple trips with tryptamines, lysergamides and substituted phenethylamines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never combine drugs unless you are already very familiar with both. Even then, it&#39;s often a terrible idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I agree that you should definitely be familiar with each drug independently before combining them, there are plenty of combinations that are much, much better than the particular drugs by themselves. lsd and mdma would be the most striking example.</p>

<p>I was just sharing what I had found to work for me, I couldn&#39;t break through on dmt otherwise. It took the comedown of an lsd trip to fully push me over the edge. And I did acknowledge the potential negative effects of dmt in general, you may actually perceive yourself dying. But like I said, if you&#39;re smoking dmt you have to be okay with that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever someone brings up energy I get geeky. </p>

<p>Energy is everything you see, feel, or can fathom in your life. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. That means that all the energy that we have in this universe came from the same place in one giant explosion. </p>

<p>Taking this a step further, energy, or vibrations, are real ways to change ones perception on life. </p>

<p>You wonder why people say karma is real? Energy. 
You wonder why people say smile, it will make you feel better? Energy. 
You wonder why people experience natural phenomena that science cannot explain? Energy. </p>

<p>Its all energy. What you are and what you do is radiating outward from your inner being constantly. You may not notice it, but its there. I promise. </p>

<p>You are one big ball of energy, choose wisely how you spend that energy, for it is finite in your existence. </p>

<p>Spread love, not hate. Energy is what rules this world. Release the positive energy within, not that dark hatred for whatever you choose. Its not worth it. </p>

<p>Enjoy this life and the energy it has brought you, you never know when your energy will be transferred...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add some sort of anecdotal evidence for your post.   </p>

<p>Animals can tell when you&#39;re tripping.   I don&#39;t know why.   But I will say that they seem to really stare at you when you&#39;re tripping.   Sounds ridiculous but my friend&#39;s dog gets very anxious around me when I trip.   </p>

<p>He stares with utter confusion upon seeing my body at all and will rarely avert his attention from me when I&#39;m like that.   </p>

<p>From my perspective and going off of all modern accepted science,  unless that dog is smelling the ug of lsd in my body than he is perceiving something we cannot.  He reacts like this even when I&#39;m sitting on the couch staring at a screen like what he&#39;s used to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate this frequency talk because it&#39;s so nebulous it has no concrete meaning.  Frequency is simply how frequently something occurs.  So &quot;frequency&quot; means nothing unless you name that thing that occurs.</p>

<p>Energy is energy.  It is not frequency.</p>

<p>Reality does not have a frequency.  Reality has many things, some of which do things over and over again at a certain frequency.  You can&#39;t match all of reality, and you can&#39;t alter reality.  You <em>can</em> change how you interact with real things, but name what are you altering?</p>

<p>Everything you talk about is new age hocus pocus.  You can&#39;t point to an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to act like you already have the thing in mind. This also requires extensive training to unlearn the harmful paradigm that education taught us that &quot;everything is seperate&quot;</p>

<p>When you see everything as energy, the borders around objects fade withing your mind as you realise you can do anything.</p>

<p>Also your subconsious must know this not just the consious. You do this by repeating the statement 24/7 (if you want £1000( i have £1000)) and visualisation. </p>

<p>Its unfortunate people die of hunger in a world where there is a surplus of food to go around however you must recognize that these things do not happen instantly- ive heard the first time you attract anything it takes 30 days. This gets faster with practice.</p>

I promise that quantum mechanics does not mean that you can wish things into reality, or that you can attract the things that you want. That&#39;s not what quantum mechanics means, and maybe if modern science wasn&#39;t so similar to the tricks of the charlatans of the past, people would know better not to trust in this &quot;the secret&quot; garbage.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean, if you want to give credit to mathematically significant and predictable outcomes to a closed system. But imagine if you ignore that and just pretend that not one of us is responsible for anything and that imagination will fix concrete palpable realities then you can literally just imagine a safe space where we all sing kumbaya and all things will be fixed and we have to exert zero physical and intellectual effort than we can all jerk each other off in a paradise because goody gum gum drop feelings will prevail!! Then all I have to do is believe I&#39;m not subject to the human condition and can change the world from my laptop screen then all will be saved! What don&#39;t you get about that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when people talk about relativity like it has just explained the entire universe for us, when in reality it predicts a rediculous amount of energy all around us in empty space all the time. They call this dark energy because they have absolutely zero idea how to explain it with the current theories they are working on. Relativity explains and predicts a lot of things, but it is not the final theory for how the universe works and if we let it be, we may never understand the universe fully. </p>

If a cabal can control the people&#39;s belief to not have sex, they have an easier time controlling them on other ways.

    <div class="md"><p>And maybe the way they taught you wasn&#39;t right for you?  Meaning, what if it wasn&#39;t your capability that failed, but the teaching that failed?  </p>

<p>Maybe try it from a different angle that you know you know of.</p>

<p>One other thing: our brains are probably hardwired to be able to do all this stuff without even thinking of it.  What if all the people we learn from are just able to output that intrinsic knowledge to others in a way that some can understand.  Almost like a mirror recognition.</p>
