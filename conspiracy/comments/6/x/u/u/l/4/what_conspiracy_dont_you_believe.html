    <div class="md"><p>Icke coined the lizard people conspiracy and you&#39;ve never looked into what it promotes yet are postulating a theory about him good enough for 10 upvotes? Don&#39;t give the guy credit but using a great accurate metaphor because that is not what Icke means. Icke means literal shapeshifting reptilians. I was a long time follower and student(in so far as I read his materials and loved/love his forum) of Icke. He&#39;s not the worst, hardly the best, but this is truly what he believes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I wasn&#39;t intending to propagate David Icke, or normalize the lizard people theory with my comment, but in retrospect I can see that metaphor as doing just that to myself and anyone else who reads it and hasn&#39;t looked into the specifics of the conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>There are two versions of the conspiracy depending on who you ask.</p>

<p>One claims that Hillary Clinton and Co. ran a Satanic pedophilia cult in the basement of a D.C. pizza shop named Comet Pizza.</p>

<p>Ridiculous, right?! This one has been &quot;debunked&quot; but only in a way that the entire thing seems to be much more sinister and that does not even begin to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>The other claims that there is a global Satanic pedophilia cult that, through mind control (MKULTRA and any derivatives) essentially breaks children&#39;s minds from an extremely young age (ages 1-8, apparently.) The implication is that there are many, many fronts that tie in with ritualistic sacrifice, human-trafficking and pedophilia. It bleeds into our nation&#39;s governments, it bleeds into our educational institutions, it bleeds into our religious ideals, it bleeds into our police! It&#39;s sick. It&#39;s beyond the imagination of a good mind. </p>

<p>It is also the one that I believe. The first reaction is to shun it; I&#39;ve been there. Please, please I ask this of you: Try not to immediately dismiss this. People are being killed (journalists, investigators, etc.) and children are being tortured. They have no one to turn to because the &quot;authority&quot; is who is torturing them. They need help... real help. I do not yet know how to help them, but this needs to  be brought to light.</p>

<p>Articles, comments, etc. in relation to this topic are being scrubbed. Major news organizations barely touch the information that is freely available. This is bigger than America. This is the time for people to stand together to take our humanity back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two versions of the conspiracy depending on who you ask.</p>

<p>One claims that Hillary Clinton and Co. ran a Satanic pedophilia cult in the basement of a D.C. pizza shop named Comet Pizza.</p>

<p>Ridiculous, right?! This one has been &quot;debunked&quot; but only in a way that the entire thing seems to be much more sinister and that does not even begin to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>The other claims that there is a global Satanic pedophilia cult that, through mind control (MKULTRA and any derivatives) essentially breaks children&#39;s minds from an extremely young age (ages 1-8, apparently.) The implication is that there are many, many fronts that tie in with ritualistic sacrifice, human-trafficking and pedophilia. It bleeds into our nation&#39;s governments, it bleeds into our educational institutions, it bleeds into our religious ideals, it bleeds into our police! It&#39;s sick. It&#39;s beyond the imagination of a good mind. </p>

<p>It is also the one that I believe. The first reaction is to shun it; I&#39;ve been there. Please, please I ask this of you: Try not to immediately dismiss this. People are being killed (journalists, investigators, etc.) and children are being tortured. They have no one to turn to because the &quot;authority&quot; is who is torturing them. They need help... real help. I do not yet know how to help them, but this needs to  be brought to light.</p>

<p>Articles, comments, etc. in relation to this topic are being scrubbed. Major news organizations barely touch the information that is freely available. This is bigger than America. This is the time for people to stand together to take our humanity back.</p>
