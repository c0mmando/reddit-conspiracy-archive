       So, let me start by giving y'all some information about the season, for those who haven't seen it. I'm a big fan of AHS, as I love horror. But Hotel has always been my least favorite season. It came out 2 years ago, 1 year before Hillary's emails were leaked and PizzaGate came to light. 
   The season focuses on Hotel Cortez(Comet Pizza??? sounds similar, doesn't it?) and the woman who owns it. She is called The Countess, played by Lady Gaga. Yes, Lady Gaga, the woman who was so actively and passionately campaigning for Hillary during the Elections.The same Lady Gaga who has mocked Christianity over and over again. The same Lady Gaga who said 'I swear in the name of Lucifer' on National Television. The same Lady Gaga who won a Golden Globe for her performance in this season, even though her acting in it was ABYSMAL and anyone who knows anything about acting, can confirm. 
  The Countess(Lady Gaga) is a 2017 version of a vampire of some sorts. She has lived for many centuries, thanks to drinking blood mainly extracted from children(sounds familiar? wasn't there a scientific paper that suggested children/infant blood is very beneficial?). So, this Countess is abducting children in L.A, and giving them a room full of video games, candy e.t.c to entertain them, while extracting their blood for her to drink and remain young and alive forever. They sometimes also abduct other guests of the Hotel and place them in a basement(yes, A BASEMENT. Ring a bell?), keeping them there, also extracting their blood for The Countess.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we've got a place called Cortez(Comet), abducting children and draining their blood in a BASEMENT, and the lead actress is Lady Gaga, who actively supported and campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the Elections and also won a Golden Globe for a very, VERY bad performance in it. And this season came out 2 years ago, 1 year before the Elections and the leaked emails and Pizzagate. 
  I decided to start re-watching all of the seasons of AHS and I just got to this season now and with the Pizzagate knowledge that we have now, everything just clicked. I couldn't make these connections when the season aired because I had no idea about Pizzagate. No one did. But now, it just feels like it's literally RIGHT THERE, in front of our faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think? Have you guys seen Hotel? If not, I highly suggest you give it a go and start observing things. I do have to warn you that it's a bit TOO far, without any boundaries and it does get too much at times. And the overall season is BAD. But I just can't help but feel that it's somewhat connected to Pizzagate. Giving it right in front of our eyes, and adding the sci-fi element so that you won't be able to make a connection because you'll be ridiculed.

       I agree- Lady Gaga did not deserve a Golden Globe! It's not like a stretch for her: "Now, act
       <em>
        regal
       </em>
       , can you do that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I liked the Hotel. A place built with evil intent, and haunted with ghosts! Kinda MKULTRA with the detective blacking out. Your P-G theory not far off, the Power of the Virgin sought by dying elites...

       I started AHS hotel when it came out, but I stopped watching it because the acting that season was just too superficial for me. I think I felt that way because Lady Gaga was the main character. 
Now thinking about it, it's actually a really accurate connection to the child trafficking/pedophilia that goes on in the inner circles.
I don't necessarily want to watch it again though to find the details but I think you are right.

       And to think she even won a Golden Globe for that abysmal performance. Sounds like the Elite awarded her for normalizing pedophilia/child trafficking or something. Lady Gaga is what made me create the connection. She has always been involved in some serious occult shit. She even attended an art gallery with Marina Abramovic before she became famous, where the 'art' was dead bodies leaking blood or something.

       after i posted earlier, a thought occurred to me that the show and its characters are like MKULTRA/monarch archetypes.
      </p>
      <p>
       the junkie, suicidal, past her prime, 30 year old ghost with the frizzy perm and cheetah print coat that she always wears is a pretty good archetype for the beta kittens that finally break, usually around 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       gaga, the hotel owning vampire and grand damn of the hotel, who controls everything is the perfect archetype of the high priestess. her character pulls all of the strings, but with an invisible hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       the transvestite character is the successful graduate of monarch, who was transformed by gaga, given everything she wanted from gaga, and who became the loyal, adoring facilitator of gaga's entire system (represented by the hotel), she literally checks in the new victims and inebriates them as the bartender (like how MKULTRA/monarch slaves are drugged).
      </p>
      <p>
       kathy bates' character is the mean nurse who attaches all of the elctrodes..
      </p>
      <p>
       the cop/serial killer character is the perfect archetype of the MKULTRA slave. he has fractured alters that are unaware of each other being programmed through trauma by his handler, the ghost of the serial killer who created the hotel and was gaga's former husband. the cop/serial killer's mother figure keeping him from snapping is the beta kitten ghost (MKUKTRA/monarch slaves often graduate to facilitators).
      </p>
      <p>
       the hotel is the system. people enter willingly with high hopes of a good time, then are quickly confronted with the horror. one of two things happens, they die and have a tortured afterlife, unless they relent and abuse the new, living guests (that's the only way for them to feel whole), or they are hand picked by the high priestess or the hotel owner ghost to join the inner circle and perpetuate the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       that the whole thing started with the murder hotel owner serial killer in the early 20th century during silent movie age, maybe is a tell about when it started in hollywood and the individual who started it.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, just a thought.

       Yeah that season was dark , the others were too, but this one especially because it was focused around children. Obviously vampires don't exist, but I've been thinking the reason the the vampire craze won't die is because its a perfect analogy for the fucked up shit the elites are involved in. The victims are smitten with the vampires while the vampires continue to exploit them and benefit off their victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       By using Lady Gaga, they really wanted to "glamorize" it. And sadly, it worked.

       Really? Cortez is not similar to Comet? Both 2 syllables. Both 3/5 letters the same. Same flow. They wouldn't just blatantly call it Hotel Comet lol. But definitely something similar.

       It's based on a real hotel in California that still exists to this day and housed at least two serial killer (Richard Ramirez from the show was one). It's real name was Cecil Hotel and the most infamous was the girl found dead in the water tank (which was the inspiration for the first season of How To Get Away With Murder)  All of the seasons are loosely based on actual events. I don't think there's a connection. It's a show.

       however, gaga is def a monarch graduate and possibly being groomed for grand dame.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most blatant announcement of her beta kitten programming was this video with pervert/rapist/mind control/imprisoner r kellyv, is this video, maybe he was her handler, shot by rapist photographer, terry richardson:

      <p>
       and she follows the classic beta kitten career path--out of no where, instant fame, highly sexualized, occult and esoteric images in every video, even to obilgatory cheetah print beta kitten uniform:

       she also repeatedly uses images of shock treatment abd involuntary intitutionalization her videos, both of which are manarch 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       she seems more in control than other kittens, including the most famous, marilyn monroe. shes more like modonna--out of nowhere, instant fame, hyper-sexualized, and appearing with ubiquitous feline, a lion, in most sexualized song, like a virgin. madonna went on to show the classic monarch slave "tells:" creating a very distinct new persona every album, cutting off all of her hair and bleaching it blond, even all of a sudden speaking with a british accent ala brittany spears when she went off the rails. i think madonna was groomed to be a grand dame, which is why she didn't end up like marilyn, brittany, mylie, katie etc.

       This one is really grasping at straws. I have seen a fair amount of 'normalizing pedophila' and the ever present subliminal undertones in lots of television. One of the main reasons I no longer watch television is because of the mind-numbing hypnotic garbage. That being said, this theory seems like a stretch to me personally.

       Could be. But the similarities between this season and what Pizzagate is suppose to be, are quite disturbing tbh.

       I see the assimilation between child trafficking and the elite power. I'm just stating that I have seen more obvious messages in television and media hiding in plain sight, whereas the connections here are a little muddled.

       AHS Hotel was about the Elisa Lam case, in which a woman was murderered and put into a water tank in a hotel in LA. There is a video of her in the elevator prior to her murder and it seems like she is running away from somebody. Conspiracy 101...

       The concept of the Hotel, yes. What about Elisa Lam's case had blood drinking, ageless 'vampires' and children being abducted and exploited for their nutritious blood?

       And to think she even won a Golden Globe for that abysmal performance. Sounds like the Elite awarded her for normalizing pedophilia/child trafficking or something. Lady Gaga is what made me create the connection. She has always been involved in some serious occult shit. She even attended an art gallery with Marina Abramovic before she became famous, where the 'art' was dead bodies leaking blood or something.
