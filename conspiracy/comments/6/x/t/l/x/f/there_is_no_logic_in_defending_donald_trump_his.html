       I like many of you have been watching this presidency closely, for many reasons it has the value of a trainwreck. When Trump was first elected I was concerned but I thought he is a novice politician, more than likely his plans will stall and he will come to his wits because their are still smart people in washington that can direct him the right way. Nope, the train is off the rails yet it is still furiously moving. I want to put forth a couple topics for people to discuss, I want to hear Trump supporters opinions and I want an actual discussion. No name calling, no shill marking, hopefully brigading is kept to a minimum. Lets discuss these points like concerned citizens and hopefully we can all gain some insight on the opinions of the reddit conspiracy community.

       Trump from day one has lied or stretched the truth to fit his narrative, some are harmless some are destructive and most rile up his base and is used as propaganda. Some are harmless but some are so blatant and stupid that you have to wonder if he is sane. For example he said We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare “quickly,” easily, on “day one.”
Sounds pretty stupid right?

       Not only has trump devalued the office of the president but he has put people in place that are actively seeking to destroy the offices they hold. Betsy Devos is a great example, not only is she the rich sister of Erik Prince but she has 0 qualifications to be education secretary. She has pushed hard to eliminate student loan programs and push for profit schooling and hires the last person you would want to head a fraud task force for colleges

       He is also nominating a climate denier who has never held any position of engineering or sciences to be the head of NASA. How does this make any sense at all?

      <p>
       Remember the wire tap fiasco? This exemplifies Trumps stupidity, it was a claim that was baseless, unsubstantiated and could have been simply proven true by his own actions! He could have called the fbi, asked for the wire taps and poof there is his evidence. But he picked the one thing that could be instantly proven right. Then not learning from his mistakes he does it again, threatening Comey that he recorded their conversation. And this takes the cake for stupidity for multiple reasons. 1. The recordings could back up comeys testimoney. Once trump said this the senate immediately wanted those tapes to make sure Comeys testimoney was true. 2.Trump then admits he said that to make sure that comey said the right thing! He just admitted to intimidating a witness! 3. They dont exist and now he has egg all over his face, how dumb of a plan was that!

         Fake news. This sub loves to call out the media and play the holier than thou card when it comes to their choice in media. My point is Trump relies on news sources that are just plain devisive and straight wrong. Sites like breitbart, the daily caller, the federalist have no shame in producing news that blatantly skews information to fit their narrative.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Trump has access to the most sophisticated intelligence services in the world yet he relies on fox and friends for his news. The intelligence agencies have gone so far as to create documents that say his name asany times as possible to keep him interested and staffers have said they stick around simply to try and shutdown some of his crazy ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Well the trump supporters have decided to insult me rather than debate the topics. Offer still stands Im willing to debate anyone on the issues. Or sling insults doesnt matter to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: got through as many comments as I could, most were insults. Only 2 people actually posted a worthwhile comment. Thanks for the insults. I expected Trump supporters to try and do a better job at defending him. Most people just wanted to tell me my sources are propaganda,  as is tradition. I wish people would attack the argument and not the source. I'm disappointed.

       all corrupt and we wanted to make their lives harder by giving them an asshole like Trump to deal with. The other reason was fuck Hillary. She belongs in prison.

       Not at all. If you cant get past the name of a media outlet for sources then your bias will get in the way of your truth seeking. Dont be so quick to follow the heard. Good info can be found in even the most unlikely places

       Which sources you have listed is actually independent source? they are totally anti-trump whatever he has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont like trump for a few reasons, none of your propaganda are on my list and your thread will only makes more ppl to jump on his train. His slogan and policies are making too much sense. If you want to fight against him (whether you dislike him personally or something) you should start with the fiscal policies and sustainability of them. Even Obamacare is a disaster, his repeal is not much better, middle class familiies will still suffer. etc. Please stop the MSM non-sense. They blash Trump 24/7 for EVERYTHING he has done. 2 scolds of ice creams? is that a news? spin everything he has done. MSM should blash him when he did wrong and praise him when he did something right, otherwise, fewer will believe what they say. I dont want GOP to become too powerful and dominate, dems, please dont suck. they knew they are going to lose more seats but still keep their policies and slogans. God!

       Trump deserves tons of criticism for actions he is wholly reponsible for. His response during charlotsville is a good example. What he said was an example of avoiding condemning his base. The media did take it too far, they labeled him this and that and put words into his mouth. But it was his choice not to condemn the actions of a white supremecist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The office of the president is the most scrutinized office in the world. If you make a weird face someone will call you out, if you put dijon mustard on your hot dog fox news will cover that for 4 months. If the president releases gas any where near a mic he will get flak for a week. Its not a position for an amateur politician and Trump is learning this the hard way. You chose to avoid talking about the points i brought up because they are undeniably true. Trump makes more mistakes then any president in history and has the worst approval rating in history. Its not a conspiracy against him he is just comically outgunned.

        white supremecist.
this is propaganda that does divide up the nation. please, use your common sense here. when is this actually bought up, it is a racist ideology. left is using nazi to end any argument and use racism to advance some elites aganda. whites do like blacks and blacks do like whites. Please unit up and fight against the 1%, elites just years ago instead of fighting each other. you know why dems keep losing, they keep pushing the agandas that nobody cares or even understand or remotely related to their every day lives.  Russia, russia, russsia, naziziziziz, now, both size of MSM are lying and no1 knows how his presidents is actually doing. CNN /MSNBC lies, now foxnews, breitbart. Freedom of speech is under threats, lefts thought they are suppress, if google turns around and censor lefts as well rights. there are so much you need to worry about than Trump and you seems know little bit about it. censorship is now everywhere. I'm anti or pro trump, but dont know either side to get censor, so we can debate and know what actually are happenning. but this is getting harder and harder. stop believing MSM, and your sources. take a bigger shot at the nation and see the real threats, so from there, you know the real aganda of elites. remember the only time MSM(CNN) and hillary, MCcain praise about Trump? when he fired the missiles. know you know why more ppl are jumping in Trump's train? there are so many things are happening, whether true or false, when you get the bigger pictures, its easily for you to do the research. you cant just cite the sources from the lefties media outlets, its not credible to your claims. God bless America.

       It's not an opinion. It's a direct observation. He knows nothing but the business world. He doesn't know what it's like outside of it... IE: the effects of it on the consumers and low-tier employees, he may know it
..academically, but experientially nothing. He doesn't even try. He deregulates corporations not because it's his political opinion, but because he's a PART of it. He even plugs his products in his position! What. The. Fuck. He only wants more money. More power. Screw the long term. Let's get there on the backs of other human beings. Let's make healthcare expensive and wages cheap. Let's keep the cost of living up and minimum wage down. Let's let the corporations have more rights than humans.

       Its an opinionated post yes, with sources. What makes this different from all of the other posts we see on here daily? At least i bring the main flaws with our president, describe my opinion about them and provided a reference. Im not here to debate my writing style, Im here to debate the character of the president.

       Hey, u/skralogy, remember that time you asked for a discussion about Trump and u/Bern_The_Joo walked in here, provided no sources, added no new information to the discussion, and then walked away with an "lol bye"? What a great waste of time.

       Well, regardless, I am for your attempts at opening discussion with others on these subjects in any way possible! It doesn't always turn out great, but every now and then something wonderful happens, so its worth a shot every time. I do think that the title brings people that are "ready to fight" rather than discuss, but maybe next time it can be worded better. I just found my way here on random and wanted to let you know that I appreciate the attempt. Cheers, dude!

       Thanks really appreciate it. The argument that it is badly written is true. This morning i woke up after sleeping in 100 degree heat and got no sleep at all. Then the first thing i see is Trump wants to hire a climate denier for NASA. I just started writing, didn t even proof read. Now I'm doing my best to respond to everyones comment even though Im facing alot of toxicity.

       Your post articulates idealizations about the power of the president, and the capability of the intelligence service.   The current situation should be an empirical case study that confirms the case that political power does not rest in the institutions of elected officials, but in the deep state, and the networks that govern it.

       I agree Clinton was a terrible candidate. But trying to blame this failing administration on the deep state is just a tactic to take the blame off the ones in power. The gop have to own the Trump failure, if they dont we will not be able to learn from our mistakes and heal as a nation. Calling this deep state ignores all of the terrible decision trump alone has made and the deep state had no control over.

       The administration is not where the power is.   Moreover, Goldman Sachs, and the rest of Wall street, that are actually running the administration have been very successful.

       Nations do not heal.  Not only is this an anthropomorphic metaphor, it is cheap campaign rhetoric.  The only way to restore the balance of power is to smash the MIC and the intelligence community.   The guard dog has been running the house too long, it is time for a choke color.

       Here we go a conversation! Thank you! I dont philosophically believe in your points about the deep state, but I do understand them. The fed is a disgusting abuse of our nations funds and has to be audited. The CIA is guilty of crimes in the past and Im sure are doing some dirty things now.

       However our population of people is like a bland substrate. They arent inherently good or evil but are able to be swayed to put their effort towards great things or not so great things. Trumps lies, propaganda, and general leadership or lack there of do not instill the power in the population to do great things.

       Yes.  Just a couple of years ago, Brennan for example was caught lying about the CIA spying on the Senate.   You know Brennan? one of the architects of the Russiagate narrative.

       In modern political life lying is seen as a virtue. Everyone does it. Either you are against it on principle, in which case you oppose modern politics as such, or you are not opposed to it, but rather see it as an opportunity to push campaign rhetoric... something that does not belong on this sub.

       Not only are the NYT and WaPo organs that disseminate CIA, and MIC propaganda, (WaPo was specifically created as a mouthpiece of the deep state), these institutions are responsible for  deceiving the American people into multiple wars based on lies.  If you don't believe that corporations even ones in the media business should be shut down on treason charges, you should at least adopt a more skeptical stance on what their function is.  They do not inform the voter.

       Haha, even you're using it as an insult. No argument. No counter points. Not even any anecdotal evidence that he actually gives a shit about you, not even you saying he's the right man for the job but here you are. Using it as a way to insult someone. You're way the fuck off, you crazed fool. Until you relax a bit and have an actual point on something instead of resorting to personal attack, I have no more to say to you.

       He is the worst rated president of all time, has failed to pass any meaningful legislation that isnt a obama roll back and has lost the support of world leaders.

       Tpp is a good move by him and I give him credit for that. However the markets are a result of the last 4 years not the last 9 months. Trump has not released a budget or a tax plan that can be responsible for growth or fall of unemployment.

       One thing I never understood is when people point to economic growth or decline as part of our ongoing business cycle and attribute that to the president currently in office. Obama "leading America out of the recession caused by bush" or "trump creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in his first 6 months as president". They are both bullshit statements as fiscal policy has little effect on the economy outside of massive infrastructure investment which is typically carried out at the state level these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this false attribution of credit, I feel, is currently being applied to North Korea, which has been a pot dangerously close to boiling over for quite sometime. This narrative that trump is causing a crisis in North Korea is pretty comical, and I don't think his actions toward NK would be any different than Obama, although his words probably are. The main difference though, is the media's reaction and the propaganda being put out around it. We can either accept NK as a nuclear state, or we can put them down with massive consequences. No one has accepted NK as a nuclear power, so it's clear where we have been heading for the last 20 years, and I haven't seen any change to that except for the fact that NK went from a joke who couldn't get a missile of the ground to having ICBM capabilities with a miniaturized hydrogen bomb on it all in less than a year (do you believe that?). The only thing I know it's that our government keeps us completely in the dark until they have an agenda to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I don't support Ds or Rs including trump, I'm just telling it how I see it.

       4 percent unemployment. 3 percent growth. Less ilegals crossing the boarder. Sweaping changes to infrastructure laws paving (hehe) the way for quicker improvements to our failing infrastructure. Pulled us out of the awful TPP

       I'm a nationalist. What's good for my country is good for its citizens. It's good that we have less illegal citizens taking our tax dollars. I'm sure they suffer, but people here suffer. Think I could drive down to Mexico and get free healthcare?  I'm sure you'd use all these same arguments to say we should have "utopian" one world government run by the same puppet masters.

       The US is ran by puppet masters, nationalism is a direct conflict with reality. We are not isolated. We are no separate. We do, in fact, rely on the rest of humanity for existence. So does everyone else. It's the interconnected nature of reality. Simple. Why do you think it will never ultimately succeed? Never has. Never will. Just a xenophobic dream to chase.

       No. You would probably be killed and beheaded by cartels, but if ISIS beheads people they're evil terrorists and we need billions to kill them.

       We need to break out dependence on oil. To pursue and allow a highly contested

       -renewable resource is completely illogical. But.. protip. If we only use our oil, well run out much quicker.

       I personally think that countries should continue to exist. I don't think one world government under the current forms of leadership will succeed or benefit the people, rather it would erode our constitutional rights and freedoms, and turn us all into slaves. 
You're so sensational. We can have a sovereign nation and not isolate ourselves. I would argue that the opposite is true. Globalism and multiculturalism has yet to succeed. Brexit is a great example.  The people don't want it. The slave masters want it

       It's because the powers that be don't give a shit about the citizens, the health of the society. Only increasing their own material benefit. That's why they do these things, now if people actually gave a shit about people and wanted to benefit all humans then we have a different system entirely. People wouldn't want to wall their selves off or say "you're not allowed". They'd
       <em>
        want

       to come together and it would be grand. But we're a long, long ways away from that.

       It'd just make more sense if each individual was sovereign. You can be from a certain place, and enjoy that way of life but when it interferes with others, it becomes an issue of disrespect.

       Interesting thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that people and cultures are different. We like to stick with our own, and it doesn't necessarily make you racist. It's in our nature to form groups.

      <p>
       Throwing these cultures together in confined spaces and expecting it to work is a recipe for disaster.

       It should be willing, that's only fair. Not using ones opinion or pride in their own area of origination as a reason to hate with vehemence and attack or kill verbally, with slander or physically, with weapons would be paramount, however. Logical discourse is always an option if there are two willing parties. It's simple.

       You can be a nationalist without hating other nations. You can be proud of your nation and origin without thinking all others are inferior. Nations have had discourse for centuries while remaining independent. There are many fantastic examples still today of nationalistic countries that seek peace and set a good model to follow

       Pride can be troublesome, it's can be the starting point for how nationalism has been used for in the past and current societies, the aforementioned violence. It can even cause violence and dehumanizing when an individual is too prideful about something. Not every nationalist uses nationalism peacefully or rationally, so it's not the quality of nationalism itself, but of something deeper in the mind.

       Trumps jobs and market numbers are good, and have been on the rise for the last 4 years. Trumps talk of deregulation and tax breaks have given business confidence and has had a positive effect on the markets.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is the only effect Trump has had on the market. Trump has not passed a budget or a tax plan, it is uncertain exactly his plans are and the effect on the markets they will have. One thing is certain and that is Trump was elected during a time of growth, the markets have been trending upwards since 2009 and unemployment has fallen to its lowest points before he took office. Most of the growth is inhereted and it is too soon to tell the effect that trump will have on the markets and unemployment.

       Here's some more bills Trump has signed to law that are morally justifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 calls for a $19.5 billion budget for NASA — an increase from $19.3 billion in 2016 — and also asks that NASA create a plan for getting humans “near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also signed the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, which The Washington Post described as “the first major weather legislation enacted since the early 1990s.” This bill aims to increase research into improving weather forecasts and modernize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. David Titler, professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University, said, “Improving weather-related safety of our people and our assets is not political — it’s just common sense.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bipartisan law Trump signed was the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This bill allows for greater ease to punish wrongdoers and gives whistleblowers more protections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump signed the legislation on Friday, and an injured Army veteran, Michael Verardo, said at the ceremony, “Today is a new day. This administration has fulfilled its promise that the veteran is empowered and the veteran is in charge of his or her own care.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The other bills, while not as consequential, still involve Trump carrying out his agenda. The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act prioritizes giving federal grants to law enforcement agencies that hire veterans. The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Improvement Act works to reduce the time families of fallen officers have to wait to receive survivor benefits.

       I applaud your effort, but you're going about this all wrong. Instead of shoving left wing media in supporters faces, you should be trying to understand how we see things.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, stop with the CNN/MSN vs Fox bs. You're only going to bring about more division with this. I'm not speaking for all but I assume that the majority of supporters don't trust any of our national media outlets for many reasons. We have been falsely labeled racists and nazis for almost 2 years now. During this time we have been assaulted constantly just for having a opinion. The media normalized these actions up until now. They're the reason for the division you see not Trump. If only democrats took the time and actually did some research into the DNC's emails you would see this. The DNC were in charge of the media and had to approve things before they were aired or printed. Googles Eric Schmidt was even involved in all of this. I bet you can remember Trump supporters claiming we were being censored, these events really did happen. You can find all this information at WikiLeaks, but I know that you don't trust their 100% credibility since you think they're Russian. Don't take this as a insult, democrats and the media have been brainwashing you for sometime by constantly plugging Russia into news feeds. Constant repetition is how we learned while growing up and they're just repeating the same technique over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that I have noticed about the left is that they tend to heavily rely on emotion when it comes to politics. This is another technique that is used to brainwash people. They try to emotionally attach you to buzzwords. This is probably why half our nation still believes we're all nazis. In reality there is about 10k nazis, kkk and white supremacists across our nation. Our media never gave any attention towards these groups that were dying out prior to 2016 why now? The media has now given these people a platform to build upon. I don't suspect their numbers will grow significantly since Charlottesville exposed them and their backwards ideals. Trump handled that situation as hew should have, denouncing both sides that brought hate and violence. Supporting communist extremists is equally as bad as supporting the groups that organized this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that I really haven't addressed much in your post, but I feel that understanding one another on this type of level would do our groups better in the long run. Realistically both sides share the same ideals, we just have our own opinions on how to go about these things. This whole left vs right thing is working wonders for the corrupt politicians. I don't know if you see this but both Republicans and Democrats are in on this game together. This is how Trump supporters see this. That is why we voted for a outsider that no one on the inside wanted. This is also why many are sticking beside him today. I've have grown weary and believe that we all have been played. We're at the brink of civil war and WWIII at the same time and I believe that this is intentional. They're trying to increase their control over us with a larger police state. I don't know about you, but I do not want that. If only we could put aside our petty differences and unite, we would notice that there's no better time for a peaceful revolution than now. We need to reinvent democracy for today's times and get money out of politics, since that is the source of most of our problems today.

       Thanks for your contribution to the discussion.

      <p>
       I understand the argument you make of liberal media marking republicans as racists. The white privledge argument is ridiculous and painting broad strokes in regards to racism is a flawed concept. I cant stand watching cnn and their rage panels. They just get people riled up and looking for fights. My dad is actually a Trump supporter so I have heard his arguments and we share our beliefs. He believes in Trump solely because he thinks he can be good for the markets. I disagree with that point and see that Trump has inherited most of the markets growth from the last 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly I wanted to see how Trump supporters defend him on the topics I covered, since they are glaring inadequacies that should be addressed.

       Sounds like you have made up your mind that Trump is bad. All politicians lie. I like Trump. I hope he keeps being bold and brazen. He wants to make America great again. He wants us to be strong and look strong.  Our last president was a pushover apologist.

       That would be nice however reality is far from what you have said. Trump has not made us stronger he has made us weaker. Remember the g20? Trump had to be told 10 times how he couldnt just make a deal directly with germany and had to be taught by Angel Merkel how trade with the Eu.

       Also since he leaked classified information to russia from israel, foreign intellegence services have been picky on what they share with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps realtionships with mexico and canada, our 2 trade partners that rank 3rd and 4th in exports have soured as well. Talks of renegotiating nafta or abolishing it all together has worried leaders and governors in america. Texas, california, arizona and new mexico would be devasted if nafta was abolished as well as many other states.

       President Trump is a good president. You do not know anything other than lies. Education is important. You can spout nonsense all day, but when you are trying to be taken seriously, it just makes your argument fall apart that much easier. So try this on: go get an education and then I'll take the time to read another response from you. Until then, I guess you will just have to be illiterate.

       In skralogys statement "So because someone sees politics different than you thats makes them illiterate? " is an incorrect use of the term. I called him illiterate because of his poor spelling and inability to run a spellcheck for a problem he is undoubtedly aware of.

       Explain what he has done to be a good prez? His party is turning on him. He has worsened trade  with many countries with his rhetoric.  All the job #s and growth have been steady with that of the previous administration. Now, he wants to bring us into another bs war where the enemy will fight till the end because that's what they've  been brainwashed to do. He is a child born into wealth who can give two fucks about you, I, or anyone not in his world or that circle.

       It's one thing to play the politician game and say one thing behind closed doors, but to do so in public as a representation of 323+ million people is just as dangerous and disrespectful as Kim Jun baby face. We're all going to loose with this mentality.

       We have different political views. I see President Trump as being bold, and strong and not backing down. I think forcing a war on North Korea should've been done sooner, rather than later. I believe that balance can be achieved through war and death. Change takes risk. The USA has stepped in and taken control in various situations in the past and we have prevailed. I do not care what other world leaders think, and what other country's citizens believe about America or Trump. I care about the USA dominating and controlling the world so that my family and friends can live safe and happy and with greater luxury. This country is new and founded on the backs of hardworking men. Everything we have is because we fought for it.

       The drone program is terrible, it was started by bush and ramped up by obama. It has been extremely effective but indiscriminate to children and non combat individuals. I wouldn't say this makes Obama worse than Trump though.

       I feel you, I have repeatedly asked for a FACT BASED non hearsay based in reality conversation on wtf you support him. Not one, not ONE answer other than the usual unimaginative "libtard" comment. (I am not even liberal!- Independant at best) But that is the thing, they can't. Not only that they cannot, as there is NO redeeming factors but their brains are literally wired differently. Harvard did a study (UCLA did as well) and they were able to show, scientifically, that the brains of conservatives are in fact different. When shown conflicting images (ie. pictures of church then a picture of a homeless person) they neurological centers that control sympathy and empathy were non-reactive to the latter. In comparison, Liberal's were more "balanced" in their "beliefs and acts". SO I am sure that they will say this is fake news too but as a scientist and neural engineer, for the Government, I believe it. Also, if science is just a bunch of bullshit, don't take medicine then. Do not go see a doctor-under the AHC you despise so (wait until you don't have it anymore then we will really see how bad it was) Argh. But what really gets me is these "conservatives" and "christian" people are the 1st to hurl insults and resort to name calling, which I am sure Jesus totally approves of...just sayin..

       100% agree with you. Education, lack of exposure to other cultures and rural environments cater to the conservative way. When people group into high density communities they tend to be more liberal because they understand what is necessary to support a large scale population. Conservatism is not a one size fits all philosophy, government needs to scale to its populations needs.

       You will go insane if you try to understand this- I call it PTPTD (Post Traumatic President Trump Disorder) and it is Very,Very yuuuge.I can only resort to levity or I would rip my hair out. I cannot for the life of me, try as I might come to any rational, non-delusional conclusion as to why now, laws do not apply, order is no longer a thing, and blatant racism and hate are the norm. I, like you, was worried about his "win"... and I, like you also thought he would fail and it would be a passing phase, people would take the reigns and we would be OK. Wow was I wrong. I told my husband that he could possibly start WWIII but now I am certain he will. He is a disaster and a megalomaniac narcissistic psychopath. But it's Obama's fault dontcha' know? AHHHHHHHHHH I cannot believe this is happening...I just saw this Alt Right video of a "church" chanting "Heil Trump" while using the Hitler salute. YAY fucking kidding me??

       Interesting thought.

      <p>
       I think that people and cultures are different. We like to stick with our own, and it doesn't necessarily make you racist. It's in our nature to form groups.

       Trumps jobs and market numbers are good, and have been on the rise for the last 4 years. Trumps talk of deregulation and tax breaks have given business confidence and has had a positive effect on the markets.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is the only effect Trump has had on the market. Trump has not passed a budget or a tax plan, it is uncertain exactly his plans are and the effect on the markets they will have. One thing is certain and that is Trump was elected during a time of growth, the markets have been trending upwards since 2009 and unemployment has fallen to its lowest points before he took office. Most of the growth is inhereted and it is too soon to tell the effect that trump will have on the markets and unemployment.

       You will go insane if you try to understand this- I call it PTPTD (Post Traumatic President Trump Disorder) and it is Very,Very yuuuge.I can only resort to levity or I would rip my hair out. I cannot for the life of me, try as I might come to any rational, non-delusional conclusion as to why now, laws do not apply, order is no longer a thing, and blatant racism and hate are the norm. I, like you, was worried about his "win"... and I, like you also thought he would fail and it would be a passing phase, people would take the reigns and we would be OK. Wow was I wrong. I told my husband that he could possibly start WWIII but now I am certain he will. He is a disaster and a megalomaniac narcissistic psychopath. But it's Obama's fault dontcha' know? AHHHHHHHHHH I cannot believe this is happening...I just saw this Alt Right video of a "church" chanting "Heil Trump" while using the Hitler salute. YAY fucking kidding me??
