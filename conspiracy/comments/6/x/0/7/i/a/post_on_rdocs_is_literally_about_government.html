    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was me.  I deleted it.  I made a statement about how I think both sides were probably infiltrated, Antifa and the neo-nazi/right supremacists.  Needless to say, it didn&#39;t go well.  I probably should&#39;ve kept it up, but whatever.  Got tired of the PMs. Fuck &#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was definitely engineered. Giving an event a benign (at least without much deep consideration) name like Unite the Right and then inviting a bunch of far right, it was obvious. Some moderates there, the ones that stayed were stupid and not considering the optics of standing around people reppping racism orgs and flying nazi flags, but the moderates that stayed were sucked in.</p>

<p>On the other side there are funded leaders and a bunch of ignorant followers. They will regret being branded and assaults the joined on when something horrible happens and antifa is exposed.</p>

<p>The media turned on Antifa to give the right some moral highground back hoping they will eventually act out emotionally. The right can never react like that or the agenda works. They have to only defend and use logic. Both sides have to participate and be frenzied for the agenda to succeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally question if these events aren&#39;t manipulated by the media and government.  The 1st thing you need to realize is the FBI has infiltrated most groups with informants.  Hell, the month before the Charlottesville protest, a known <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kkk-leader-seeking-charlottesville-rally-has-history-as-fbi-informant/article_d4f743b0-4b0b-11e7-9b0d-bf585dde11ff.html">FBI informant setup a KKK rally in Charlottesville</a>.  My question is, how did most of the Neo Nazi/white supremicists get to Charlottesville?  I&#39;m not saying it wasn&#39;t a organic rally, but maybe the FBI&#39;s informants helped to get a lot of those people there, could have even covered their costs.  I don&#39;t know, but what I do know is the FBI is heavily involved in this kind of shit and have a long history of it.     </p>

<p>Even with this past weekend&#39;s even in San Francisco &amp; Berkley, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Prayer">people who were supposedly Neo-Nazi/White Supremacists apparently denounce racism and are a libertarian group who rally for free speech</a>.  </p>

<p>I think a lot of this is social engineering to a certain extent.  I do believe there are racists and neo nazi&#39;s, but I also wonder how many of them are being helped by the FBI or other groups trying to use them as useful idiots.</p>
