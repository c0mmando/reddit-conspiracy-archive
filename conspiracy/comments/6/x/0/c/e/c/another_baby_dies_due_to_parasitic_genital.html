       another baby has lost its life in the demonic parasitic practice known to sleepwalkers as "circumcision."

       this savage ritual is a conspiracy dating back thousands of years, concocted to depower, reprogram, and control men, and feed the negative energies of this world. the corrupt medical industry still uses it to this day as yet another way to turn a profit from human suffering. hundreds of babies are being murdered by "doctors" in hospitals across america every year:
       <a href="https://www.circinfo.org/USA_deaths.html">
        https://www.circinfo.org/USA_deaths.html
       </a>
       this is a blacklisted topic in msm.
      </p>
      <p>
       these babies are mutilated and murdered by doctors who lie and claim there are health benefits and the uninformed parents accept this doctrine (coincidental etymology? pft) and believe it is for their child's own good, when in fact, the practice have never helped anyone in any way shape or form. many men suffer emotional trauma lasting the rest of their life and others have taken it upon themselves to regrow their foreskin, as it serves an important function in sex and in protecting the penis:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/
       </a>
       the procedure is sometimes performed on adults suffering from "phimosis" but this is actually malpractice because the condition can be cured through other methods, freely, without cutting off a piece of your body.
and of course, after charging for the procedure itself, the murderous, parasitic "doctors" turn around and sell the stolen organ, and as far as I know, body trafficking is supposed to be illegal:

       I'll upvote this. It's a barbaric practise that could only be carried out by those who want to bring harm to children. Why else would you take a knife and cut at the most sensitive part of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck explanations and theories, every person who voices a preference due to cleanliness and aesthetic earns my absolute disapproval but because i'm not barbaric i wouldn't wish mutilation on any of them.

       Sort of, yes. You can stretch what's left into a foreskin of sorts. From what I've read people usually say that its a lot better than being circumcised but not as good as being naturally intact.

       Gone off meds is a shitty thing to say.  Meds are used to control people, keep them stupified, and generate other side effects for other meds.  By saying "off your meds" you're showing support for Big Pharma and the use of pills to control the population.  Most of the folks I know who have stopped taking Big Pharma are much happier for it.

       Just an expression, I am in no way an advocate for psychotropic drugs at all in fact I am staunchly against them. How about I say you sound as though you have an 'untreated or improperly treated mental illness', would that be better?

       Assuming somebody has a mental illness when they express a knowledge base that is different than yours is problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the OP used language you felt was... too dramatic?  overly whatever?  You said as much "coming at things in a more even-keeled manner will gain you more listeners" and if you had just stopped there you're in your power.  You don't actually know or feel or think the OP is mentally ill, so you've debased your (very valid) thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many normies, including my ex-wife (an MFT), have called me various names alluding to a mental illness.  Psychic break, psychosis, whatever.  It's laughable because I come at them from a position of dramatically more info, so it's a lot like a little kid telling Daddy he's silly.  Don't be the little kid.

       not followers per se but changing people's minds on the topic. coming at it screaming and wrapping it in a grand world wide multi century conspiracy tends to put people off. Coming at it from a grounded, centered place of maybe we shouldn't be cutting off parts of babies or children would be a strong rallying cry by itself. we have to remember this practice has been sanctioned by the medical profession for a hundred years and by religions for over a thousand (more depending where you are). So this should be approached from a practical stand point - in the 21st century, in civilized countries there is no need to cut off pieces of a baby's genitals, adding more mysticism and hocus pocus isn't going to sway people IMO.
