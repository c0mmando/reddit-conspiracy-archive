       It is my opinion that shilling has evolved. Most of us that have been here for a few years are well aware of the site wide/national and social media propaganda machine socially engineering us to follow certain agendas/narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe because of this machine, shilling has turned into something more than just a paid influencer of thought and conversation. I think shilling is now rampant among everyday, non-paid posters across reddit and other social media who actually believe in what they are following and subsequently passing along beliefs that were not theirs in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as a community we need to recognize this and be able to effectively expose this trend without being banned. Thoughts?

       Disclaimer: I am not conservative nor liberal in my thought process. I have been here long enough that my worldview is shaped by my own opinions.

       The one good thing about rule 10 is that it protects us from the shills calling us shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       These shills are weird. There are always a few shills but they sometimes come in heavy and heard with some kind of new battle plan to take over this subs belief system but they end up failing and retreating every time. When they come in heavy, they are on every post with some sort of mission like protecting Antifa and Soros. It's annoying but the only way to stop the shills is to stop the cabal otherwise we will be dealing with this our whole lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the best strategy against a shill is to unmask them as a wolf in sheep's clothing. They tend to lose their argument once that is done. It is best to unmask them by establishing that they are protecting very evil people when they defend cabal members like Soros or whatever it may be.

       Oh right. The shills aim to alter the belief systems of the masses thereby spreading the poison so that ordinary people shill for them for free. The only way to stop this is through education.

       So how do you plan to determine if someone is talking about something like Trump/Russia (or any other theory) because they've been "brainwashed" and not something they've looked over and came to their own conclusions?

       I could see me being grouped in with people who "shit the bed", because I'm more skeptical of most theories, but that's also because some people here don't actually care about evidence, but I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about 4chan LARPers or people like Kim Dot Com trying to sell CDs and get his name publicity again, so I do generally shit on those kinds of posts.  But I think those kinds of things need to be questioned.  I'll entertain any theory though if it actually has convincing evidence.

       I can see you being put in that group too. I only remember you as the type to dismiss conspiracy theories instead of discussing them. You say you're into evidence but don't ever seem to be into conspiracies, which is what this sub is about. I'm not calling you a troll or shill but that's what the trolls and shills do here.

       That's because I think the most common theories here have just become lazy and partisan attacks.  Not based on evidence that led to the conclusion, but from having the narrative and continuing it on whatever new story comes along.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example...I think Soros is a piece of shit, but I don't believe he's the controller of every event in the world.  And that seems to be something pushed here a lot.  And when "Soros" is the constant boogieman, I'm going to call those lazy theories out as just more partisan bullshit.

       Soros is a piece of shit and has a long history of profiting while causing human misery all over the world. With that type of history, people come up with
       <em>
        theories
       </em>
       about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were proof to the theories then they wouldn't be theories anymore. What's the harm in discussing conspiracy theories? Why interject to keep people from discussing them?

       That's something I don't get. Why worry about what other people think or believe? It's like going to the NFL sub to tell people that football sucks and people should quit discussing it.

       That's a great analogy.

       People should be free to use their own thoughts and reasoning to believe what they want. But I guess many don't like that and try to be the thought police here.

       Going on your analogy, if the nfl sub was overrun with nfl-sucks types, the nfl fans would stop going there. That seems to be where we are now.

       Yeah, I can't really think of another reason to spend time going to r/NFL and engage in threads telling them how stupid NFL is
       <em>

       </em>
       to hopefully make them give up and quit participating in discussing the sport. It seems like an odd expenditure of time.

       there arent any. the issue is rarely people saying 'conspiracies suck! stop looking into it'

       the issue here is 'dont talk about trump russia, talk about sethrich' and vice versa

       however...
      </p>
      <p>
       we shouldnt be carpetbombed with duplicate shit posts on the same topic attempting to dominate the front page, we shouldnt have certain topics labeled 'unverified allegation' then REMOVED, we shouldnt have selective enforcement of contest mode to fight perceived brigading (with no transparency on methods of determining brigading)
      </p>
      <p>
       they should be allowed to flourish or fail on their own merits. we've seen heavy mod involvement on 'accepted topics' while getting gaslit on what 'shills' are doing on this sub. complaining about shareblue while the front page is all about hillary soros and antifa. why bitch about shareblue if theyre so impotent?

       You are 100% correct. I got an idea for a total shit storm. Once a month we hold a vote to kick people off the island lol. Take the top 10 upvoted accounts, using contest mode of course just to make the shitstorm even more intense...this is a terrible idea. Oh man, we should have a friday terrible idea thread.

        I think shilling is now rampant among everyday, non-paid posters across reddit and other social media who actually believe in what they are following and subsequently passing along beliefs that were not theirs in the first place.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Can it even be considered "shilling" at that point? The word "shill" has already been so watered down and overused that it doesn't even really mean anything anymore. Now you want to include users who aren't being paid, who don't work for any particular interest, and who are just posted based on their misguided beliefs? Why not just call them what they actually are: gullible and easily manipulated people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what exactly do you want to do about them? Just not get banned for calling them out? If don't call them shills (which they aren't) and instead address how they are wrong and where they might have gotten misguided then you should be fine. I've told plenty of people that their arguments are bad and their facts are wrong without breaking rule 10.

       Thats great! That is exactly the feedback I am asking for. I was not trying to group misguided people into the shill category per say but rather saying that unknowingly, they are doing the shill work without realizing it. In a broad sense, I think mass manipulation of thought is winning out over people thinking for themselves. Idk does that make sense?

       Yeah, I think I get what you are saying. I'm just not sure what you want to do about it. People are stupid and fall for all sorts of crap. The only way I can think of to combat it is to educate people and provide the information they need to make up their own minds. And I suppose we could crack down on users that are clearly here to push an agenda and nothing else, but that's a slippery slope that could lead to more censorship. Personally I fall on the side of only doing that in the most extreme cases and let the users sort out the rest on their own.

       So I get called a shill or insinuated as one once a week here for numerous organizations, including WaPo, the DNC, and the Pharm industry (which was my favorite one by far).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them have one thing in common:  When someone disagrees with the narrative here (which coincides with most conservative/T_D talking points, but I digress), they're labeled as a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post clearly wants to call people shills when they don't have a counter argument.  Who are you to judge what people believe?

       No I get it completely. You feel like this sub is an echo chamber of Trumps sub. I disagree with that because I was here before 2016. You also believe that as a liberal you are more inclined to be labeled a  shill. You sir missed the essence of this entire post by making it a right vs left issue.

       The mod who banned him for allegedly being an alt is the same mod who bans people for shilling, then when questioned about it accused me of being an alt of the banned user (because why else would I stick up for someone) and reported me to the admins for it which obviously didn't go the way he wanted. I'm inclined to believe it's more of that mod just banning people he doesn't like, he's given me no reason to think otherwise.

       Rule 10 does more to protect shills than anything else. If someone is name calling, devolving the conversation away from substance then it's obvious to any passerby who is who. Why am the word when its existence is a fact? Is there fear of naming what is taking place?  They exist. They're here. They're dangerous. Why can't we call them out? It makes no sense imho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, I think at this sub who are awake to certain obvious facts about true geopolitical goings on should follow in SOMEWHAT SIMILAR footsteps as T_D and instaban any account that apologizes for Israel which is pretty obviously a terrorist state. Their criminal behavior toward the Palestinians and all of their neighbors in the region as well as America - their involvement in 9-11, dual citizens in our government constantly pushing war - that should be enough to preclude anyone from defending them in a sub like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like starting a sub dedicated to exposing MSM corruption and not only allowing MSM paid operatives a voice here, but protecting them by enacting rules that disallow you from exposing them to the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine going to a protest against builderberg, and when undercover FBI scum show up to provoke violence so the protest gets shut down, the organizers made it impossible for you to point out the undercover provocateurs!
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is blatantly naming calling without evidence , harassingly following someone from comment to comment - ok. They've left the arena of ideas. Shut em down. But what about when you conclude someone is disingenuously defending a criminal enterprise and you back it up with a logical argument or evidence from previous postings?
      </p>
      <p>
       This post might be a waste because you can always use different words to express the same sentiment, right?  Still wanted to voice those ideas.

       you want an enforced echochamber? this doesnt sound like a great idea for a general sub such as this. if you want rules like start some anti israel anti msm sub.

       the issue with this is obvious. people quickly resort to calling anyone who disagrees a shill. shills are in the eye of the beholder. if someone has a point you dont agree with, argue and explain why.

       if theyre just name calling, theres already rules against that.

       You would literally have to delete every single comment that doesn't provide a full argument, and force all posts to follow academic standards to some degree. Word-limits, premises and supporting statements, along with citations.

       Unfortunately, this is a SubReddit, not a classroom. You can't quality control the local Internet pub just because it's a hotbed of discussions about conspiracies.

       If the conversational air is constantly being tainted with disinformation or misinformation it becomes the job of every single person to learn how to differentiate for themselves what is and what is not sound, valid, reasonable, or convincing.

       I've mentioned this before, but there's a second phase to propaganda where the propaganda becomes "self-propagating". No further energy input is needed once it reaches this critical popular mass. Indoctrinated individuals will perpetuate the untruth themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the third phase would be when the propaganda then becomes widely regarded as absolute truth. We're probably seeing this third phase in the vaccination arena.

       I'm at a point where I'm so tired of it. I advocated to be a mod for this sub but they didn't choose me. That's OK but I really really wanted to make some changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime I started my own sub.

       The fact that the majority of the comments on this thread are defending the shilling says a lot.

       I think there is a lot of good here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But user after user complains of shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are constantly linked to top minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how bad that sucks to write a thoughtful post and wake up to see hundreds mocking you on another subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, if they really cared, there would be rules about shilling and topminds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But come on now, they can't do that. They won't let them. It's not the mods. It's Reddit.

        I think shilling is now rampant among everyday, non-paid posters across reddit and other social media who actually believe in what they are following and subsequently passing along beliefs that were not theirs in the first place.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That already has a word and you said it: belief
      </p>
      <p>
       Shilling is shilling, belief is belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is NO such a thing as a belief that is yours in the first place. How many beliefs did you have when you came out of your mothers womb?
