<p>See for yourself: <a href="http://archive.is/zdfMG">http://archive.is/zdfMG</a></p>

<p>My comments with sources explaining Bill Gate&#39;s motivations for funding vaccines and birth control were initially at + 5, then they quickly dipped below -5. </p>

<p>Downvotes don&#39;t really matter unless they are used to reduce visibility. In this case, my comments were downvoted below 5 and hidden from view, so the narrative they want in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that Snopes is a great source of information. Strange times. </p>

<p>Bonus: A user is upvoted to +23 (and counting) for saying &quot;the facts were mostly pro-Hillary.&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/7q4pK">http://archive.is/7q4pK</a></p>

<p>Taking over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was fine, but we are now seeing very obvious manipulation of this sub. It was subtle before. When we saw all of those really shitty (almost too shitty, as if it was a set up most times) pro-Trump posts, the top comments would debunk the post, then they would claim this sub is overrun with Trump shills, but this pro-Hillary and pro-Snopes stuff is a new development. Perhaps they believe we are ready to fully accept the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> worldview? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s follow that line.</p>

<p>So JFK - was that a political conspiracy? 9-11 - political? Yes. And both brought to you by the right. Do we consider those political attack posts? I daresay a huge number of posts on this subreddit for years have aimed at those two biggies. Rightly.</p>

<p>This current situation is different. This is a direct backlash from a specific &quot;weaponization&quot; of conspiracy theory, first by a fishy right-leaning outfit that somehow parlayed a bunch of stupid emails into a serious undercover wedge issue in the 2016 election, and then by a completely ruthless left-leaning counterforce of wall-to-wall disruption on any conspiracy discussion that touches the previously mentioned pizza-faced situation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like - wait at least two years after a major conspiracy, then we might let you talk about it. But DO NOT talk about conspiratorial situations as they unfold or we will blanket you in toxic smoke.</p>

<p>That&#39;s full-out censorship. That&#39;s what I thought we would never have to face here. Stupidly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After looking at your archive, it seems people were downvoting you because they agreed with the redditer who was arguing with you.  You were saying:  Bill Gates is interested in depopulation techniques, and that&#39;s why he supported vaccinations.
Since you were attacking snopes&#39; credibility, people were probably hearing that negativity at snopes as an attack on what Bill Gates and vaccines were doing as a bad thing, reducing infant mortality.</p>

<p>You were saying he&#39;s doing a good thing for the wrong reason, and when people criticised him for it, snopes called them liars, and therefore snopes can&#39;t be trusted to give you the whole picture.</p>

<p>tl;dr:  I can see why you were downvoted, and why you felt those downvotes were unfair because it was an effort post that contributed to the post topic but which got dismissed without any evidence to contradict what you said.  However, I believe in this case it&#39;s just reddit being reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same shit that has happened to every other sub on reddit. We are the last stand. And the final battle is upon us. The Admins, <em>THE ADMINS</em> for gods&#39; sake REMOVED 3 of the oldest mods on the fucking team. Then the shills poured in, EVEN MORE than they had been before. Step 3 is ban lists and comment deletions- I&#39;m waiting for the other show to drop. Until then stay strong and keep fighting. When it does happen, there will be no major forum left, only smaller communities. I invite you over to r/conspiracyundone, if you care. It&#39;s modded by a respected member of r/conspiracy and isn&#39;t against any major conspiracy (I&#39;ve seen some &quot;conspiracy&quot; alternative subs say in their sidebar that 9/11 is debunked and not allowed, LMAO).
