       My comments with sources explaining Bill Gate's motivations for funding vaccines and birth control were initially at + 5, then they quickly dipped below -5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvotes don't really matter unless they are used to reduce visibility. In this case, my comments were downvoted below 5 and hidden from view, so the narrative they want in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is that Snopes is a great source of information. Strange times.

      <p>
       Bonus: A user is upvoted to +23 (and counting) for saying "the facts were mostly pro-Hillary."

       was fine, but we are now seeing very obvious manipulation of this sub. It was subtle before. When we saw all of those really shitty (almost too shitty, as if it was a set up most times) pro-Trump posts, the top comments would debunk the post, then they would claim this sub is overrun with Trump shills, but this pro-Hillary and pro-Snopes stuff is a new development. Perhaps they believe we are ready to fully accept the

       How hard is it to understand that upvotes and downvotes are entirely subjective? Just because you think a comment you wrote is quality content for this sub, it doesn't mean anything when it gets downvoted except that other users don't agree with you.

       It depends upon the kind of post it is. The political attack posts are the most heavily brigaded followed by political related conspiracy posts that are very partisan  and or ideologically slanted.

       Let's follow that line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So JFK - was that a political conspiracy? 9-11 - political? Yes. And both brought to you by the right. Do we consider those political attack posts? I daresay a huge number of posts on this subreddit for years have aimed at those two biggies. Rightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       This current situation is different. This is a direct backlash from a specific "weaponization" of conspiracy theory, first by a fishy right-leaning outfit that somehow parlayed a bunch of stupid emails into a serious undercover wedge issue in the 2016 election, and then by a completely ruthless left-leaning counterforce of wall-to-wall disruption on any conspiracy discussion that touches the previously mentioned pizza-faced situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like - wait at least two years after a major conspiracy, then we might let you talk about it. But DO NOT talk about conspiratorial situations as they unfold or we will blanket you in toxic smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's full-out censorship. That's what I thought we would never have to face here. Stupidly.

       Because this is the last place on reddit both ideologies can rub up against each other. So everyone in the middle just gets ground up in the competing astroturf campaigns. It sucks, and if you say anything about it both shill teams gaslight you.

       After looking at your archive, it seems people were downvoting you because they agreed with the redditer who was arguing with you.  You were saying:  Bill Gates is interested in depopulation techniques, and that's why he supported vaccinations.
Since you were attacking snopes' credibility, people were probably hearing that negativity at snopes as an attack on what Bill Gates and vaccines were doing as a bad thing, reducing infant mortality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were saying he's doing a good thing for the wrong reason, and when people criticised him for it, snopes called them liars, and therefore snopes can't be trusted to give you the whole picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr:  I can see why you were downvoted, and why you felt those downvotes were unfair because it was an effort post that contributed to the post topic but which got dismissed without any evidence to contradict what you said.  However, I believe in this case it's just reddit being reddit.

        THE ADMINS
       </em>
       for gods' sake REMOVED 3 of the oldest mods on the fucking team. Then the shills poured in, EVEN MORE than they had been before. Step 3 is ban lists and comment deletions- I'm waiting for the other show to drop. Until then stay strong and keep fighting. When it does happen, there will be no major forum left, only smaller communities. I invite you over to r/conspiracyundone, if you care. It's modded by a respected member of r/conspiracy and isn't against any major conspiracy (I've seen some "conspiracy" alternative subs say in their sidebar that 9/11 is debunked and not allowed, LMAO). Stay strong, fight the tides of darkness.

       are you really
      </p>
      <p>
       you seem sad that bannon and flynn are out of the white house
      </p>
      <p>
       you seem anti dnc (because of what they did to bernie im sure, i get it, same here)

      <p>
       but you also want to defend trump from criticism

       I'm a realist when it comes to Trump...if you want to criticize him, focus on his real faults- like warmongering in Syria and NK, Healthcare "reform",  tax reductions. Attack him for his failures as a president, not trumped up bullshit concerning Russia. My pointing out of Flynn and Bannon is my realization that they represented change, even if it wasn't good change. The Establishment has completely co-opted the administration, how is pointing this out defending Trump? How is basing my criticism in his actual failures defending him?

       you honestly think anything different is a positive? anything at all?

      <p>
       youre a left side of the aisle guy who is also into white nationalism
      </p>
      <p>
       and im curious what change you thought flynn would bring thats a positive for the american people? foreign lobbyists as national security advisor certainly is different, but i guess im too simple to see the upside?

       I'm not into white nationalism...nice straw man...I said they represented change, even if it wasn't good change, but go ahead and ignore my words, that's cool. Flynn represented diplomatic change to the Republican base, Bannon represented the Nationalist base. This isn't hard to understand.

       if i misrepresented you, but these seem like conservative views. im failing to see the left in bannons brand of nationalism, or flynns version of 'diplomacy'

       is there more noise in this sub as it used to be? sure

       is this the trend everywhere? sure

       are there still media where this happen? probably. will it happen there too? sure.

       I think it would be better to leave out politics period. At the top level they are all the same anyway so there is fighting here about things that ultimately don't matter and eyes are taken off the actual conspiracies.
