        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hiroshima looks firebombed. No gradients from one large blast pictured.<br/>
Nukes were used by the military industrial complex to stoke fear and military spending for nearly a century. Post cold war they&#39;re used as a pretext to invade countries.<br/>
Mushroom cloud explosions look like hydrocarbons burning. Like dynamite, TNT, gasoline.<br/>
Films of the H-bomb look like a fast motion zoomed in video of the sun rising.<br/>
In old videos of nukes blowing up houses the camera doesn&#39;t shake. Suggesting it&#39;s a model.<br/>
After the USSR collapsed to an economy of organized crime no refined uranium was sold to anyone who used it. With all the genocides and state terror that went on since then, this seems in violation of Murphy&#39;s law.<br/>
The bombs designs don&#39;t really make sense. You refine uranium then you smash it into more of the same uranium and this breaks open atoms in chain reaction?<br/>
Another atomic bomb design is plutonium. Much more easy to get your hands on but this will only rip open atoms if you set off explosives all around it?<br/>
Einstein was a plagiarist who wrote his papers with no citations.<br/>
All warfare is based on deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here you go. This is the line of thought to start pursuing. For instance, tritium was detected at 9.11 and we saw 3 buildings fall into their footprint. There are also pictures of melted bedrock around the site.</p>

<p>The tritium tests are falsifiable and really near impossible to fake. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-15/one-man-asks-why-was-tritium-found-911-ground-zero">Link</a></p>

<p>Does that mean Hiroshima happened as they say it did? No. Ever heard the term <em>fake it till you make it</em>? It&#39;s quite possible Hiroshima was nothing more than dirty bombs. Leftover or current ordinance from the war with nuclear materials strapped into it, but it didn&#39;t produce what was expected. Besides low level radioactive fallout. Which even that was not bad given the survival rates of some of the claimed victims. Not to mention the Jesuit group near ground zero that suffered no injury.</p>

<p>The above ground nuclear tests [video] all seem to have some element of fakery or are clearly composites. Yet, in the 80s they were doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjratvNGmo">underground nuke experiments</a> and these tests are entirely different. In fact, there is a delay between detonation and collapse below. Firstly, if its an explosion the Earth should rise or there should be a concussive zone above ground, yet at detonation, there&#39;s a 10 second delay and then suddenly the earth collapses.</p>

<p>It seems like &quot;nuclear&quot; weapons (whatever they may be exactly), are <em>implosive devices</em> and that is if the later 80s era videos are legitimate. It&#39;s curious that if NK was actually developing these world ending &quot;nukes&quot; as the media would like us to believe, why they would film it in high speed and show off to the world.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with creating Dr. Evil - archetype bad guys, when they don&#39;t do the obvious, something is wrong.</p>

<p>Ever notice how they have a specific day to commemorate that? August 6th. I remember hearing about it on what seems like a regular basis.</p>

<p>There are clearly THREE different dome like things shown here that are spliced together. The first one has a sharp edge and looks like a drop of oil on water. Whatever it is it is something actually getting bigger.<br/>
The second clip is what looks like a sun rising. Look again. This has the soft edge.<br/>
The third clip just looks like the projector melting the film in some planned way.<br/>

<p>You can&#39;t answer the question. So you call me a troll?</p>

<p>If you dont know what a nuclear reaction is then say so.</p>

<p>That was my point in asking you. You try to avoid the the question because you don&#39;t know what your talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not a physicist. Everything I know about nuclear reactions I learned in high school, and that was a long time ago. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking whether you believe that nuclear power plants exist and work as physicists say they work. If yes, then that calls into question why the physics would stop working as predicted when it comes to nuclear explosions.</p>

<p>I think the questions were very clear. You seem to be trolling, but I would be interested in your answer if you&#39;d care to have a conversation.</p>

<p>They say that the sun produces energy through nuclear fusion. But then they say that nuclear fission is used in power plants to produce energy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying water can release energy when it phase changes from gas to liquid, And also at the same time saying that it releases energy when it phase changes from liquid to gas.</p>

<p>Well you can&#39;t have it both ways. So now we know they are lying about both the sun and nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>Everything is vibration and frequency. It&#39;s all simple to understand. But the government and powers don&#39;t want you to know the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;Nuclear reactions&quot; occur they say from subatomic particles hitting each other and splitting apart.
But then they say that the atom is mostly empty space so as to be essentially massless.
And what about the electron? They say that electricity is electron transfer. Is that not nuclear fission? But it&#39;s perfectly safe and stable?</p>

<p>Too many inconsistencies. Their lie is so big they can&#39;t keep track of the details anymore. They don&#39;t even need to try anymore to keep up the deception. Because people are so fucking dumb that they don&#39;t ask basic questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they know. The atom bomb was theoretical, I think for a long time, before they allegedly set one off.<br/>
I&#39;m sure what they&#39;re learning, if it is fake, is constructed to be something like paradigm. War propaganda has a lot of time, money and care behind it.<br/>
Like a mistaken bit of truth that has no way of testing if it&#39;s true since the tests have been banned for generations.
I don&#39;t think most military or politicians would know either.<br/>
Just like most bankers and even Federal Reserve workers know exactly how central banking works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. Obama seemed to think nuclear power was very different from nuclear weapons concerning Iran.<br/>
They say there are nuclear powered submarines but there are no nuclear powered spacecraft exploring machines like rovers are there?<br/>
There&#39;s no nuclear power plants on Hawaii or Antarctica.<br/>
But it could be real. There&#39;s never been a nuclear blast at a nuclear power plant.<br/>
I won&#39;t say nuclear power is real for sure because the energy industry seems to be monopolized. Big oil controls everything and lies all the time. Oil and gas didn&#39;t come from dead plants and animals. They make up this and the peak oil lie to make their product seem more scarce than it is to get away with charging high prices for it.</p>
