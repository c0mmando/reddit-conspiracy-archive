The BS that the rest of the mod team is handing the subscribers is all too obvious.

<p>OK - A_Q, I am going to actually give you the benefit of the doubt on this comment...</p>

<p>I think TMOR is abhorrent cunts. I have told the entire mod team MANY FUCKING TIMES that I have other shit outside of reddit that is way more important to my IRL than my reddit persona... and while I have a deep passion for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - I literally had minutes on a regular basis to try to absorb what was going on and respond - and it pissed me off to no end that diatrabes were written against me with no freaking context of what was going on with me, my time-balancing etc....</p>

<p>So Yes, I got PISSED and thus my expletives - but:</p>

<p>I was asked outside of reddit to remove mods (on multiple occasions) and I refused to do so.</p>

<p>I agreed, on multiple occassions to step down for Mr.D</p>

<p>I agreed to AP taking, and I PMd him telling him to discuss with me over my IRL persona email. He failed to do so. I brought that to modlog.</p>

<p>I 100% refute the authority of some ignorant admin &quot;redtaboo&quot; -- as (she) is DOUBTFULLY not one who has had her mind in the space of this /r/ for literally the 35 years that I have - nor been on fucking reddit for 11 years!</p>

<p>The calling out TMOR IS characteristic!</p>

<p>Pre-your-tenure, I called to ban ALL TMOR mods and participants with a bot... that idea was shot down.</p>

<p>Fuck anyone that thinks that I am a trump supporter -- but fuck anyone who thinks that I am an HRC supporter, fuc anyone that thinks that I was anti-semetic -- because Bernie Sanders was our only hope Obi Juan Ken-obi!</p>

<p>This is a fucking problem that is WAY THE FUCK OLDER than a couple of weeks here in this sub...</p>

<p>I have written entire articles against the buh cabal, worked in tech for my entire career and written here about that and the spying - the issues of the NSA since the 70s, the cia&#39;s bullshit - etc, etc, etc...</p>

<p>I supported the onboarding of every single mod on the fucking list! I was democratic, open and transparent with all of you..</p>

<p>I tried to herd you guys off reddit into slack - as the admins can read all our shit - that failed. even with threats.</p>

<p>I am convinced that one or several of you are an admin&#39;s alt.</p>

<p>Dont walk into the room acting like you can tie a brief period together with some stupid links when there is a LITERAL decade of daily viewing of this sub by me to see the trends and patterns.</p>

<p>and I was doing this shit since 1984 - my first woke moment was Iran Contra - then I have tracked and watched and learned.</p>

<p>I am completely positive I messed AP perms by accident, OR (and imagine this; a conspiracy!!) it was done by someone else! (Or I was drunk and I dont recall... ) -- But I reached out to AP to gmail me, crickets. People were banning shit left and right and bitching in mod mail and my fucking posts about being NON FUCKING POLITICAL were a clusterfuck of bitching - so I took action.</p>

<p>As top active mod it was my perm-right that allowed me to do so... then ppl bitched to the admins after you didnt listen to my AT LEAST FIVE FUCKING REQUESTS TO STOP BEING POLITICAL -- fuck I even made (I believe it was two) posts about this - and other mods swooped in and removed them saying &quot;whoa whoa whoa -- wait we cant just post this&quot; -- yet refusing to having an actual discourse in mod mail resulting in nothing</p>

<p>Have you ever worked on a high functioning, yet technical team - and LEAD one? At the end of the day you have SMEs in their respective disciplines who will not fucking agree on shit, and you make a decision as the leader of that team and execute - but you give everyone the opportunity to tell you &quot;what is wrong with this plan&quot; first -- and if they dont speak up at the design sessions, dry runs, etc -- they they cant bitch after - no matter what... and ESPECIALLY if it was their domain-of-expertise that caused the failure, they are to blame for the failure if they didnt speak out.</p>

<p>so ---</p>

<p>While Yu have some fair statements in your post - this is a far bigger issue than me telling you all to shut-the-fuck-up and restructure as you see fit...</p>

<p>ITS THE SAME PATTERN AS BEFORE -- I propose solutions, get ignored so I take action and you all bitch to mommy</p>

<p>And the admins are fucked for interveneing -- who the fuck are they? If they &quot;know whats best for the community&quot; -- then WHY ARE WE EVEN MODS????</p>

<p>I never agreed with Flytape on his politics- but the guy made a great effort to communicate. and I never removed any mods even when he was really pissed off at some of you -- but I re-added him after a 45-minute call and he made a good case for doing something - and I kept reminding him tokeep his fucking politics out of this.</p>

<p>So, at the end of the day, you all belong as exampes of <a href="/r/iamverysmart">/r/iamverysmart</a> because you dont even have a decade of context on the complexities of this /r/ and some millennial little SEO-Community-manager who hasnt built shit in silicon valley is going to &quot;evaluate&quot; me...</p>

<p>Good bye <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

I still don&#39;t fully understand the context but either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People who think they are the &quot;top minds of reddit&quot; post things that other people posted with the intent to laugh at them for their &quot;stupidity&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>People post the &quot;stupidly overreaching&quot; things people say and mock them for believing they have any intelligence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems shit either way. You know that book, Lord of the Rings. 
The good people were the ones who were always creating stuff and living in harmony with each other. The bad guys were always marring the creative stuff that others were doing. </p>

<p>I struggle to see how anyone on that subreddit thinks there is any value in the conversations they have and it leads to shitty bias in other threads when those people leave the subreddit to mock the people directly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! It looks like the original comment is still visible on the stickied thread and was never deleted. I just never saw it because it was so far buried.</p>

<p>I actually think I agree with a lot of Sarah Connor&#39;s ideas, but that doesn&#39;t really change the actions of the last few weeks. I think there must have been a better way for everyone involved to work this out, because if Flytape, DronePuppet, and Sarah Connor had actually succeeded with their takeover, I seriously doubt the sub would be better off now as a result. </p>

<p>Also, I do think the impact of TMOR is way overblown by some people while the actions of certain other subs are way underestimated by those same people. They get tunnel vision when they see one threat and ignore all of the others. </p>

<p>You might be right, but that doesn&#39;t mean the admins should have been summoned to override a mod. The admins are not our friends here. I may not know S_C&#39;s intentions 100%, but I trust his over theirs any day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I sound like a broken record, but I think the real comspiracy is that Trump and his political strategists have been using conspiracy theories to attack their enemies for years now. It all started with the Birtherism conspiracy, which Trump fanned the flames of for years right up until a few weeks before the election. Why did Trump pardon Sheriff Joe? Could it be because Joe Arpaio also loudly and publicly promoted Birtherism?</p>

<p>People need to realize that this community, this sub and conspiracy theories in general are being used by the Trump administration and its supporters as political weapons. It&#39;s no coincidence that many members from TD come here to spread politically based conspiracy theories.</p>

Sweeping changes to infrastructure project requirements, stock market at all time highs, withdrawing from TPP.

<p>So they had video of Bush pushing the plunger to blow up the world trade center?   They didn&#39;t just make that shit up?  More Democrats believe Bush was complicit in 9/11 than Republicans are birthers.  Not to mention birtherism was started in the 2008 primaries by Clinton supporters.   And what about conspiracy theories on the left about the assassinations of JFK, RFK, MLK, Lennon, Reagan, etc.?  Do those not exist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This latest mod upheaval removed the mods intent on combating the shill invasion on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. One of the moderators that I am certain is a shill now most likely has a contact in the admin group, as soon as the mod team restructure was started (in order to break the mod team stalemate with no actions taken against the brigades) he contacted the admins and they took over the mod team ousting the ones working for a change. 
Basicaly a hostile coup by the corrupt mods that are left on the mord list now, led by AATA.</p>

<p>As I am sure many of you know already, the reddit admins are not against astroturfers on the site. They are most likely getting paid to look the other way.</p>

<p>There are several mods high up in the mod list now that most likely are corrupt, they are actively resisting taking measures that combat shilling and brigading such as contest mode and enabling totesmessenger. </p>

<p>I believe eight of them are compromised or heavily biased, and I&#39;ve seen them act with blatant bias (downplays the brigade, refuses to ban blatant shills posting from shareblue etc).</p>

<p>The few mods I know are ok will not be in any position to influence the direction of the sub from now on. The majority vote among the mod team will ensure that.</p>

<p>Many don&#39;t know but Reddit is not a &#39;for fun&#39; site. ~90% of mod activity in popular subs are Reddit admins actings as &#39;users&#39;.</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> sub has some too, I knew <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> did as well.</p>

<p>The way these people act is /way/ different than a normal users. Effectively they troll the mod team until others quit and keep adding new mods until you got a shit rest of admins on the mod list.</p>

<p>Likewise they always have the option to win a war of words by &#39;appealing to the Reddit Admins&#39; (themselves).</p>

<p>The best thing to do is just leave Reddit, etc. it&#39;s a piece of shit site. Not useful for much to be honest at this point.</p>

<p>TL / DR : ~90% mod activity is some paid shit bag pretending to be a &#39;casual user&#39;. They forced Sarah out because she supported Bernie and wasn&#39;t going along with their Trump / Hillary polarization agenda.</p>

<p>As a mod, it&#39;s easy to tell &#39;what&#39;s up&#39; and easy to fix.</p>

<p>But if the Reddit admins remove all those that attempt to fix it, what&#39;s the point in trying?</p>

<p>I should mention, I think this whole SJW weirdo shit is some kind of long term and sophisticated cointelpro operation of some kind. It has nothing to do with politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can add a little bit of info since I was one of the people who noticed DronePuppet&#39;s alt accounts in the mod logs. He had approved the troll account MAGABolt and was protecting it from bans as it went around spamming pro-Trump messages. He would use the account to clutter up any thread that was put into contest mode so that it was harder to find actual discussion amongst all of his top level comments. When users pointed out how disruptive and suspicious this troll was, DronePuppet would ban them for violating rule ten. At least twice another mod attempted to ban MAGABolt but DronePuppet overrode them each time. He also did the same thing with the troll account WarmBacon a few months earlier and probably other accounts before that.</p>

<p>Now as for this ferf guy, that&#39;s a whole other story. His original account sent out phishing links to regular users to try to get their IP addresses. When the Reddit spam filter blocked these links, he saw that it returned an Amazon IP address and immediately assumed they must all be shills using the same network. His account was suspended for this attempted doxxing. He came back with a second account and lurked around here calling everyone shills for a while. Then when <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a> was created, he started posting there. Just a couple days ago he created a post attempting to organize a brigade and vote manipulation scheme that would pose as left wing shills. His idea was to disrupt a bunch of threads and make it look like the left was doing it. He even admitted to doing something similar in the past. His second account was banned for this as well. He started posting on the same thread with a third account, but this was soon banned or deleted as well. </p>

<p>I think these guys were on a shill hunt.

    <div class="md"><p>I said he was banned for attempted doxxing, which I don&#39;t think is disingenuous. He was posting IP addresses and usernames. Just because he was dumb and didn&#39;t realize the IP addresses were from the spam filter doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t still trying to post identifying information from other users. Some of the mods here and the admins must have thought it was enough to suspend him for. I don&#39;t think he ever quite accepted that his data was wrong though, because he kept posting it with his alt accounts. </p>

<p>And he absolutely was on a shill hunt, but the problem was he thought that everyone who disagreed with him was a shill. He threw out accusations any time a thread was critical of Trump. The irony is that he missed the obvious one right under his nose (MAGABolt) and then went on to try to form his own shill brigade. It&#39;s like the Bigfoot hunter who can&#39;t find any evidence of Bigfoot so he goes out in a costume to leave footprints and fool other people into believing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to know a lot when it comes to one part of his shill hunt but not when it comes to his other actions. I prefer to use evidence over intuition, and it hasn&#39;t steered me wrong yet. And the evidence against ferf is pretty rock solid. He set up a shill detector that didn&#39;t even work, then continued to lie saying it was proof. He admitted to brigading and framing the left. He was fabricating his own evidence to prove there were left wing shills here. He also denied that the right ever shill and claimed that Cambridge Analytics do nothing suspicious and don&#39;t need to be looked into. All of this paints a pretty accurate representation of who this &quot;shill hunter&quot; was. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not denying that the left (and right) both have forces trying to influence online discussions. You&#39;d be crazy to say that they don&#39;t. The problem is, this so called shill hunter was nothing more than a phoney and partisan hack. </p>

<p>I think posters like that are the reason the ex mods felt the need to take drastic measures. COINTELPRO makes me sick.

    <div class="md"><p>I can add a little bit of info since I was one of the people who noticed DronePuppet&#39;s alt accounts in the mod logs. He had approved the troll account MAGABolt and was protecting it from bans as it went around spamming pro-Trump messages. He would use the account to clutter up any thread that was put into contest mode so that it was harder to find actual discussion amongst all of his top level comments. When users pointed out how disruptive and suspicious this troll was, DronePuppet would ban them for violating rule ten. At least twice another mod attempted to ban MAGABolt but DronePuppet overrode them each time. He also did the same thing with the troll account WarmBacon a few months earlier and probably other accounts before that.</p>

<p>Now as for this ferf guy, that&#39;s a whole other story. His original account sent out phishing links to regular users to try to get their IP addresses. When the Reddit spam filter blocked these links, he saw that it returned an Amazon IP address and immediately assumed they must all be shills using the same network. His account was suspended for this attempted doxxing. He came back with a second account and lurked around here calling everyone shills for a while. Then when <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a> was created, he started posting there. Just a couple days ago he created a post attempting to organize a brigade and vote manipulation scheme that would pose as left wing shills. His idea was to disrupt a bunch of threads and make it look like the left was doing it. He even admitted to doing something similar in the past. His second account was banned for this as well. He started posting on the same thread with a third account, but this was soon banned or deleted as well. </p>

I still don&#39;t fully understand the context but either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People who think they are the &quot;top minds of reddit&quot; post things that other people posted with the intent to laugh at them for their &quot;stupidity&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>People post the &quot;stupidly overreaching&quot; things people say and mock them for believing they have any intelligence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems shit either way. You know that book, Lord of the Rings. 
The good people were the ones who were always creating stuff and living in harmony with each other. The bad guys were always marring the creative stuff that others were doing. </p>

<p>I struggle to see how anyone on that subreddit thinks there is any value in the conversations they have and it leads to shitty bias in other threads when those people leave the subreddit to mock the people directly.</p>
