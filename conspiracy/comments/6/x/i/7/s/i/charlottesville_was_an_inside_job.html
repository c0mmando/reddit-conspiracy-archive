    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Just. Ok. </p>

<p>So many questions. </p>

<p>But I understand the tactic here. Any proof whatsoever can always be explained by a wild hypothetical. Tptb don&#39;t need petty escalations when they want control of something. </p>

<p>They fucking crash jumbo jets into buildings and fire missiles at the pentagon. Not crash cars into crowds. </p>

<p>Like it or not there are individual independent people out there who do crazy things all by themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying it was a broadscale event like 9/11. I am saying the mom in that interview 100% did not birth that driver. The records Jews keep of jewish mothers is impeccable. If you have a Jewish mother you can go to israel without process and be a citizen. Its extremely important and well kept. She didnt birth him. Nor was he driving. You wont see much from him,her or the &quot;dead&quot; girls mom. Not on news shows or at all really going forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about what&#39;s wrong with his birth records so I will just give you the benefit of the doubt on that I guess. </p>

<p>But I just agree to disagree on the single idea that TPTB don&#39;t need to plan this shit. They know it&#39;s going to happen and they love it when it does but they spend their time using literal weapons of mass destruction, and overthrowing entire governments. </p>

<p>9/11 - inside job. </p>

<p>Libya - inside job </p>

<p>Iran contra - inside job </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that sometimes crazy people do crazy shit. Im from chicago. I know people need zero reason to kill. Some will kill for a pair of jordans so i know folks will for their beliefs. But on here .. this sub... this is where we have a outlet to vent on news we just dont believe is factual. Its where we post what we think we know but maybe cant entirely prove but hope others will chime in. I remember right after 9/11 that truthers risked physical harm to question the narrative. Now i think most people doubt it. I also think most dont want the truth on these things. They dont wanna believe pure evil exists in our borders. In our govt. in those who control our leaders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I get it buuuut it&#39;s also the primary method of disinformation (like CIA sanctioned disinfo) to label everything a conspiracy and so when a relatively obvious event like 9/11 happens everyone just says &quot;oh you idiots just say everything is a conspiracy and this is a huge tragedy and it&#39;s insulting you would say the same old shit about horrible things like this&quot; </p>

<p>So I kind feel like you feed into the reason why the masses refuse to question obvious events like 9/11 and as you stated it becomes dangerous to even do so. </p>

<p>Thanks for that I guess.  </p>
