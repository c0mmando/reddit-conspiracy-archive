    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;melting pot&quot; concept is a ludicrous psy-op, and anyone with a brain can see that racial diversity leads only to anomie and resentment. Different tribes have different group interests and societies will always stratify to reflect this. </p>

<p>Harvard political science professor Robert Putnam discovered this to his dismay, as he reluctantly recorded in his book Bowling Alone, which illustrates that ethnic diversity directly correlates with lack of trust, lack of willingness to contribute to the commons, and general unhappiness. </p>

<p>Only through nationalism - the self-determination of <em>all</em> peoples - can the world&#39;s  racial diversity truly be preserved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s something to the fact that racial diversity is harmful to a society, but the important factor is really culture. When you have people that assimilate to the new culture, these effects are far less pronounced (although not zero), and especially when you have things like economic growth, they are relatively unimportant.</p>

<p>Also, why were you literally arguing like a blatant disinfo agent in the other thread (telling me to stop talking because I disagreed with your argument), and then making an actual, reasoned argument here?</p>

<p>You need to quit fucking doing that. Either make rational arguments like this, or don&#39;t comment. I literally almost added you to my &quot;naughty list&quot; it was so horrifically bad.</p>

<p>The reason why there has been so much more fighting is because hate groups are getting covertly funded, aided, and abetted while the anti-hate groups are getting cointelproed by agent provocateurs serving to antagonize the message more than unite people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what &quot;kind&quot; are you? I guarantee that I can find someone of that &quot;kind&quot; that you don&#39;t fit in with. </p>

<p>And THAT is where your argument completely falls apart. </p>

<p>For example I am a white Northern European. I do not automatically &quot;fit in&quot; with all other white European people. I think a lot of them are assholes that I would like to ship off to some island and keep separated. But this is the real world where solutions of this kind do not work. </p>

<p>Human beings are complex and so are the problems we face when trying to get along with each other. </p>
