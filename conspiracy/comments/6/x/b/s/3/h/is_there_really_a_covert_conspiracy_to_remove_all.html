       I keep seeing more and more of these"tap and pay" systems appearing as well as endless advertisements on YouTube for something called "Android Pay".  In my mind cash is the way to pay for something because, quite frankly, I don't need an endless electronic trial of everything I do being made. There seems to be less and less concern on the part of younger people who are now the most tracked and endlessly documented people that have ever existed. Am I the only person concerned with the possibility of a world where some corporation somewhere can simply "switch off" a persons ability to buy groceries or pay for a burger or gasoline or anything anywhere?

       You speak of the now. But there is all the incentive for a centralized entity to wish for this. India is already pushing towards it, China has suggested it. Hell, VISA is now offering to give stores cash in exchange for no longer accepting cash and installing apple-pay and other software.

       Definitely. Mom and Pop stores are the best, often better quality as well as the fact that you are supporting members of your community. Sometimes you pay a premium but the quality is far better than chains, especially with restaurants.

       I have one huge one... and when I'm feeling cheeky I dump it all into a Coinstar in exchange for an Amazon giftcard and then go buy something I normally wouldn't waste money on.

       Yeah me too (well not loonies and toonies cause I need those for laundry) - last time I did it it was well over a hundred bucks, and I sort of consider it mad money. I don't think there are any coinstars left in my city, and I hate hate hate rolling change. They don't even sell penny wrappers here since we got rid of the penny, and for fifty cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, in Canada we don't get the Amazon gift card things, so it's cash voucher and they take whatever percent as a convenience fee. It's still more money than it'd be if I just leave it sitting on my dresser but death of a thousand cuts, you know?

       Oh... they take like 9% off the top here, unless you get a giftcard... plus then I get to see all the pennies I put on the railroad tracks again when they come falling out of the reject chute.

       Just to clarify for you, NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range technology that allows devices to communicate small amounts of data - I have a 'smart' ring which I use to unlock my phone, for instance. I can also store bits of code or a Vcard (constact info) etc. This is the basis of Android Pay, which I do NOT use.
      </p>

       Cash is king. I doubt we'll ever eliminate some form of token based currency. It's interesting that tracking for marketing purposes has been a thing since before all this tech was available, in the form of loyalty cards and AirMiles etc.

       No there isn't. RFID chips have been a boogeyman for Christians who think that it's the mark of the beast or some such bullshit but it's not going to catch on. We've already developed more effective ways of cashless shopping.

       RFID missed its chance. Technology has progressed beyond the need tor it.

       When they state "computer vision", are they meaning traditional eye-scanning systems, to identify a person in which to charge the items to?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the case, eye-scanning system/computer vision system, to me, it still seems cheaper and more efficient to utilize a RFID implant to identify individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The passive RFID system is cheaper I'd imagine (but no proof) then an eye-scan system (initial cost and replacement parts), as well as a passive RFID system can potentially identify more beings that pass through at one time rather than a one-at-a-time eye-scanning system could handle (although multiple eye-scan system stations would help pass more people through at one time, it still wouldn't be more efficient as identifying people via RFID implant walking through, say, a gated area).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 100% sold we're past RFID implants yet, for the purpose of  identifying a human.

       The computer isn't scanning you. It is scanning the items you pull off the shelves. The shopper is identified through the Amazon app on their phone.

       This means every shopper must have a smartphone.  Current estimates are that 80% of the total world mobile-traffic is smartphones - that leaves 20% of phone traffic from non-smart-phones, meaning not everyone will have a smartphone to be scanned.  For the remaining people, a RFID implant to scan would allow that human to shop, as a smartphone user would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, what happens if you lose or forget your smartphone?  Yes, it is replaceable, but if we're aiming for the most efficient system possible (time and money, as well as ease-of-use), having an embedded RFID implant is the most efficient ("never leave home without it" kinda thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other aspect to the RFID implant is not a strictly commercial use, but government control (thinking of a tyrannical/dictator/authoritarian style government).

       It's slowly integrating into society.  Now it is a choice, but as more and more companies move to a RFID implant to pay or verify payment, it will become a standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then government will get involved at some point as well.  They'll point to its benefits, such as aiding crime fighting, census taking, voting procedures, etc.

       I just saw a Swedish rail company is starting a biometric/RFID implant verification system:

       The elimination of physical money suits governments (monitoring your behaviour, and assessing your tax dues), it suits central banks, commercial banks and retailers. It would be logical to assume they are all colluding towards this objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some might argue that this isn't a "conspiracy" because the various parties are not colluding in an explicitly criminal endeavour, but a cashless society would be very bad for individual freedom and it would also make our very civilization more precarious. A catastrophic event (eg solar flare or weaponised EMP) wouldn't just take out all electronics, but all means of payment too, meaning no food, no water, no fuel and in a densely urbanised society that would be apocalyptical.

       Definitely. Mom and Pop stores are the best, often better quality as well as the fact that you are supporting members of your community. Sometimes you pay a premium but the quality is far better than chains, especially with restaurants.
