In my mind cash is the way to pay for something because, quite frankly, I don&#39;t need an endless electronic trial of everything I do being made. There seems to be less and less concern on the part of younger people who are now the most tracked and endlessly documented people that have ever existed. Am I the only person concerned with the possibility of a world where some corporation somewhere can simply &quot;switch off&quot; a persons ability to buy groceries or pay for a burger or gasoline or anything anywhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah me too (well not loonies and toonies cause I need those for laundry) - last time I did it it was well over a hundred bucks, and I sort of consider it mad money.

<p>Plus, in Canada we don&#39;t get the Amazon gift card things, so it&#39;s cash voucher and they take whatever percent as a convenience fee. It&#39;s still more money than it&#39;d be if I just leave it sitting on my dresser but death of a thousand cuts, you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify for you, NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range technology that allows devices to communicate small amounts of data - I have a &#39;smart&#39; ring which I use to unlock my phone, for instance. I can also store bits of code or a Vcard (constact info) etc. This is the basis of Android Pay, which I do NOT use. </p>

<p>Cash is king. I doubt we&#39;ll ever eliminate some form of token based currency. It&#39;s interesting that tracking for marketing purposes has been a thing since before all this tech was available, in the form of loyalty cards and AirMiles etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No there isn&#39;t. RFID chips have been a boogeyman for Christians who think that it&#39;s the mark of the beast or some such bullshit but it&#39;s not going to catch on. We&#39;ve already developed more effective ways of cashless shopping. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazon Go works by using computer vision and sensors to detect what items you’re taking out of the store. You start by scanning an app as you enter the Amazon Go shop. You do your normal shopping, and the sensors throughout the store identify the items in your cart and charge them to your account when you walk out the door. </p>

<p>RFID missed its chance. Technology has progressed beyond the need tor it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they state &quot;computer vision&quot;, are they meaning traditional eye-scanning systems, to identify a person in which to charge the items to?</p>

<p>If that is the case, eye-scanning system/computer vision system, to me, it still seems cheaper and more efficient to utilize a RFID implant to identify individuals.  </p>

<p>The passive RFID system is cheaper I&#39;d imagine (but no proof) then an eye-scan system (initial cost and replacement parts), as well as a passive RFID system can potentially identify more beings that pass through at one time rather than a one-at-a-time eye-scanning system could handle (although multiple eye-scan system stations would help pass more people through at one time, it still wouldn&#39;t be more efficient as identifying people via RFID implant walking through, say, a gated area).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% sold we&#39;re past RFID implants yet, for the purpose of  identifying a human.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The shopper is identified through the Amazon app on their phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means every shopper must have a smartphone.  Current estimates are that 80% of the total world mobile-traffic is smartphones - that leaves 20% of phone traffic from non-smart-phones, meaning not everyone will have a smartphone to be scanned.  For the remaining people, a RFID implant to scan would allow that human to shop, as a smartphone user would.</p>

<p>Additionally, what happens if you lose or forget your smartphone?  Yes, it is replaceable, but if we&#39;re aiming for the most efficient system possible (time and money, as well as ease-of-use), having an embedded RFID implant is the most efficient (&quot;never leave home without it&quot; kinda thing).</p>

<p>The other aspect to the RFID implant is not a strictly commercial use, but government control (thinking of a tyrannical/dictator/authoritarian style government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s slowly integrating into society.  Now it is a choice, but as more and more companies move to a RFID implant to pay or verify payment, it will become a standard.</p>

<p>Then government will get involved at some point as well.  They&#39;ll point to its benefits, such as aiding crime fighting, census taking, voting procedures, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elimination of physical money suits governments (monitoring your behaviour, and assessing your tax dues), it suits central banks, commercial banks and retailers. It would be logical to assume they are all colluding towards this objective. </p>

<p>Some might argue that this isn&#39;t a &quot;conspiracy&quot; because the various parties are not colluding in an explicitly criminal endeavour, but a cashless society would be very bad for individual freedom and it would also make our very civilization more precarious. A catastrophic event (eg solar flare or weaponised EMP) wouldn&#39;t just take out all electronics, but all means of payment too, meaning no food, no water, no fuel and in a densely urbanised society that would be apocalyptical.</p>
