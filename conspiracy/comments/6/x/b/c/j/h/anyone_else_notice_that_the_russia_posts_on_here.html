       AstroTurf needs billions of dollars worth of water, nutrients, and faux-rage, to sustain it.  It withers and dies if it goes a few days without attention.

       It's not just the astroturfers. The corporate media has clearly shifted their focus and is telling us to focus elsewhere as well. Rather than being afraid of Trump being a Russian spy, now I'm supposed to be afraid Trump is a Nazi.

       It's interesting how the investigation has zeroed in on Manafort, huh? The guy who came into the Trump campaign way late (March iirc?), explicitly as a long-time Washington establishment Republican who could help against the "#NeverTrump" Republicans, and left early, months before the election (in August I believe). And the guy whose "Russian ties" are strongly connected to the
       <em>
        Podesta group
       </em>
       who he was working for in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet people still keep talking like any dirt on Manafort is likely to implicate Trump by association. It's at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       as likely to implicate Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I despise Donald Trump. I just think this whole Russia thing is a giant red herring even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       Manafort is convicted of something shady.

       Some investigations, but this one's been leaking like the Titanic from the beginning. Of course there could be important stuff we're still in the dark about, but that doesn't mean we should fill the gaps with wild, politically motivated assumptions. The best information we've got right now seems to suggest that Manafort is in some deep shit, but that Trump himself is not under investigation. There might be more going on, but until there's evidence actually implicating the president in some way, I personally think people should focus on all the terrible things he does and has done that are firmly established facts. It's not like there's a shortage.

       That goes both ways.  We can't assume that he isn't implicated in anything just because we don't have enough info.  Everybody needs to wait for the investigation to end before telling everyone else what he did/didn't do.  There's way too much speculation and assuming.

       We can't assume Trump isn't implicated, but there is no evidence that he is, despite people taking it as a given. They announced the grand jury and started issuing subpoenas last month, and raided Manafort's home, and those publicly known developments give us some idea of where they're actively digging. None of it has yet involved Trump himself. I'm not jumping to any conclusions myself, but I think it's telling how many people eagerly jump to the conclusion that Trump is guilty of conspiring with Putin himself despite the total lack of evidence to justify their certitude.

       No wishes here. Donald Trump can fry and I'll revel in it. I just happen to think he's more likely to fry on non-Russia-related charges like corrupt business deals and financial conflicts of interest -- but those could draw attention to the crookedness of many other people in DC who'd rather not have corruption and conflicts of interest be the topic of discussion, since it would make them vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy -- hence the red herring.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I haven't seen evidence connecting Trump to Manafort's shadiness in any way besides the fact that Manafort was his campaign manager for awhile in the middle of the campaign -- takes
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       leaps to get to from there to "therefore Trump personally conspired with Russia".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm intrigued by the part about them "plotting together since forever", though. Have a link to back that claim?

       By contrast, the Manafort daughters and their mother seemed much more unsettled about Paul Manafort’s work as a political consultant for Yanukovych’s Russia-backed Party of Regions, which is a subject of renewed interest among investigators probing possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one March 2015 exchange that appears to be between the two sisters, Andrea Manafort seems to suggest that their father bore some responsibility for the deaths of protesters at the hands of police loyal to Yanukovych during a monthslong uprising that started in late 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Don't fool yourself,” Andrea Manafort wrote. “That money we have is blood money.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In another hacked exchange a few months later with someone else, Andrea Manafort wrote that her father’s “work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort acknowledged that his daughter Andrea had been hacked and corroborated the authenticity of at least some of the texts between him and her, but declined to comment on most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a text exchange in early April, Jessica Manafort tells her sister that her father, who maintained an apartment in Trump Tower, where the campaign is located, seemed to be thriving on the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Dad and Trump are literally living in the same building and mom says they go up and down all day long hanging and plotting together,” Jessica Manafort wrote. “Gross,” Andrea Manafort responded, prompting Jessica Manafort to come to their father’s defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Its really amazing opportunity at 67 years old. And he is basically running the campaign now He is so happy,” Jessica Manafort wrote.

       Ahh, I thought by "plotting together since forever" you might have meant preceding Manafort becoming Trump's campaign manager. This is a lot less interesting in terms of Trump's hypothetical involvement in anything Russia-related. The presidential candidate and his campaign manager "plotting together" and living in relatively close quarters during the period when we
       <em>
        already knew
       </em>
       they were working together on the campaign itself doesn't imply at all that their "plotting" had anything to do with Russian collusion or with Manafort's shady dealings in Ukraine.

       so much for extreme vetting by mr trump. seems most of his cabinet has to leave for lying about weird foreign ties.

       What exciting news? I still haven't seen any "exciting news" tied to Trump Jr.'s meeting. Just assumptions. And hiring someone doesn't mean you're retroactively involved in everything they've ever done. It takes a lot more evidence than "they worked together" to spread one person's crimes to another person. So many assumptions being drawn here. Please try to look at the case you're making from a critical, skeptical perspective. Like the sort I've seen you apply many many times here against counter-establishment narratives that involve similar unjustified leaps without evidence.

       I'm not forgetting that. It's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       Mueller will shock us all with revelations none of us have even predicted. But there's a big difference between hypothetically possible speculation and evidence-based inference. We've been getting a constant stream of dribs and drabs for months -- and recently, they have been heavily focused on Manafort, with no indication that anyone in Trump's circle is incriminated in anything illegal related to Russia. It's reasonable to infer that Manafort could be in deep shit. But his ties to Russia go wayy back before he had anything to do with Trump. I'm not saying it's impossible Trump could be implicated -- I'm saying there's no evidence or logical rationale to justify that assumption at this stage. It seems more like politically motivated wishful thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why I think people should be more focused on what we actually KNOW Trump is guilty of or implicated in already. There's so much of it. Like his insane, unconstitutional financial conflicts of interest -- I'm amazed that everybody just kind of stopped talking about that in favour of speculating about "Russian collusion". Investigating is one thing, I'm all for that. The more investigation of the powerful the better, as far as I'm concerned. But devoting hours upon hours of media coverage to baseless speculation about that investigation, connecting dots wildly when there's so much meaty, fact-based stuff to cover instead -- it's bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I have my theories about why. Focusing on "Russian collusion" lets his attackers go wild without worrying about accusations of corruption and dishonesty being turned back around on them -- since most of Washington is guilty of that behaviour to at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       extent. And so Trump's unprecedented levels of corruption and dishonesty get buried behind the one conspiracy theory it's now socially acceptable to endorse and run wild with.

       My bad I thought you were asking why Manafort being guilty could implicate Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort has had the FBI raid his house pre-dawn in connection to the 2016 Russian interference of the election and has a number of incredibly dubious connections to Ukraine and Russia. There's no concrete evidence available to the public and likely won't be until the investigation concludes.

       , but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that Trump himself is implicated in the investigation. Of course it's hypothetically plausible that something will turn up, or that it already has and they've just been very very good at keeping it under wraps, but people are acting like any guilt on Manafort's part is automatically transferable to Trump, and it's getting a bit silly.

       I agree Manaforts crimes =/= Trumps crimes and there is ZERO concrete evidence available to the public that Trump is implicated in this but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would Trump, a populist, go completely against the GOP and DNC platforms on the Ukraine/Crimea conflict and urge for a softer stance on Russia? It came completely out if the blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was before the whole Russian collusion story took place and left analysts scratching their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to argue that Manafort was colluding with the Russians and Trump coincidentally had an inexplicable soft spot for anything Russia/Putin without putting 2 and 2 together.

       This will probably get me called a Russian shill (nope, just a Canadian grad student), but I thought that was one of Trump's sanest stances amid a platform I found horrific. A better question IMO is why the US political establishment seems determined to stoke tension between nuclear superpowers even though that presents the single greatest existential threat to human civilization. Better relations between the US and Russia -&gt; lower chance of nuclear apocalypse. Not killing us all should generally be a goal of foreign policy, IMO. It's the aggressive stance of the GOP and DNC I find incomprehensible....

       Russia is not a superpower anymore, and going by that logic why not take a softer stance on China? He has no issue with antagonizing the hell out of that nuclear power.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day Trump, for whatever reason, might truly believe in better relations with Russia - but it's one hell of a coincidence that it happened to coincide with his campaign manager, National security advisor, son in law,and son all had very conspicuous ties to Russia that they decided to lie about.

       Russia isn't an economic superpower or a military superpower, but it is beyond dispute that it is a nuclear superpower. It is the only country with
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#Statistics_and_force_configuration">
        more nuclear warheads

       than the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US, including Trump, isn't antagonizing China to anywhere near the degree they are antagonizing Russia. For good reason -- it would be devastating to the US economy if they applied the kind of sanctions they do against Russia. That's not to say there are no good reasons to sanction Russia -- but the goal should be ultimately to negotiate and compromise on those issues and move toward better relations between the two countries. That's not an intrinsically bad thing like it's being portrayed lately -- quite the opposite.

       This will likely collect lots of downvotes but when he spoke positively about Russia, that was a major factor in my decision to vote for him.
      </p>

       The Cold War is over.  They are capitalist.  Our goals conflict, but more often they align.  They are cousins, not enemies.  Plus, any world where the two biggest nuclear super powers decide to be friendly is a safer world.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I heard Trump speak in favor of Russia, I realized wow, maybe despite being a total Establishment shill, maybe he really is doing this to make America great.  And at the same moment, I saw the DNC assemble this cross of "collusion" on which they have attempted to crucify him ever since.

       It's an odd thing, but the MIC has run the country very reliably through a system of propaganda for at least the past 60-70 years.  It works.  Pull lever X and Y happens.  The problem here is that someone else pulled the levers and Z happened.  The DNC/MIC are raging because someone else pulled the propaganda levers and they don't have any defense for that.  However, they can't reveal the details without revealing their own use of propaganda to run our society.

       See Edward Bernays if you want to learn the levers for yourself.

       You're minimizing a severe threat to the continued existence of humanity, potential military conflict between the US and Russia, by minimizing the fact that Russia could destroy literally the entire planet if they chose to and still have nuclear weapons to spare. Russia isn't the economic/political/military superpower it once was, but 7000 nukes are 7000 nukes. The fact that the technology is aging honestly just makes it worse because it leaves more room for error. This is not a risk to take lightly.

       I don't "live in fear", but rational decision-making in international affairs demands acknowledging that the potential for nuclear war between the US and Russia is the single biggest threat to the continued existence of human civilization. That's just a scientific fact. It's extremely irresponsible to ignore that, like it's extremely irresponsible to ignore the threats posed by climate change or global pandemics (except neither of those are likely to be anywhere near as destructive as nuclear war). Possibly the most concerning thing is that unlike during the Cold War, no one seems to take this risk seriously anymore, even though it hasn't diminished.

       You really don't understand the situation in Ukraine. It's so much more complex than that. Just for starters, the US was involved before Russia annexed Crimea -- they backed the Ukrainian nationalist faction to overthrow the pro-Russia Ukrainian government. Crimeans are majority ethnically Russian and by-and-large rejected the new non-elected government and their anti-Russia stance. There were legitimate reasons for Ukrainians to reject the preceding pro-Russia government, but the issue is not black and white. The Ukrainian revolution put Russia in a very difficult diplomatic position -- but none of that nuance is included in the discussion of sanctions against Russia. Of course you can't expect effective diplomacy when one side refuses to even acknowledge the perspective of the other side.

       Oh fuck off. I used the word "scientific" because the risks posed by nukes are rooted in concrete science, not hypothetical speculation or "boogeyman" fearmongering. Try not getting caught up in trivialities like word choice and sticking to the actual substance of the discussion.

       was light on Trump/Russia stories for a couple weeks there, because there really weren't that many. My theory is that the news cycle was more focused on Charlottesville, and the media doesn't want to drop a big story unless they can cause maximum damage to Trump.

       It's hilarious.  Any even shallow investigation of the objective facts about Russia reveal it to be one of the most low energy places on earth with rampant corruption and a pathetic 14k per capital GDP despite having more natural resources per person than any other county.

       It's also kind of rich when it comes from someone who supposedly supports right-leaning ideals and/or Donald Trump's agenda (which aren't always the same thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       The War on Drugs has been one of the most costly failures in U.S. history, but economically and more importantly when it comes to eroding our freedoms. It has been used to justify ever more intrusive law enforcement and surveillance tactics, to spent huge amounts of money on para-military hardware and prisons, and so much more..
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person who says they believe in less government and great individual freedom and who
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       supports the War on Drugs or mocks those who criticize escalating the war on drugs is a raging hypocrite of the worst sort.

       If you read the actual intelligence agency report, they detail a lot of hacking into state election machines.  I suspect rather strongly that the Russians were watching the actual machines in real-time during the election for shenanigans.  Yet they touched nothing.  I suspect rather strongly we owe them a big fucking thank you.

       It's possible that they would use one of the unstoppable nuclear torpedoes to generate a tsunami that wipes out an American city, as well.  There are many possibilities.  Some have a shred of likelihood, others do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts remain that people from Russian IP space hacked many of our election systems.  It could have been the FSB, it could have been the CIA, it could have been Israel, it could have been a corporate 3rd party.  We don't know.  The fact also remains that they didn't touch anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theories are either (1) they were ensuring the success of their work with Cambridge Analytica, (2) they were watchdogging the American election process to ensure no shenanigans, or (3) it was a financial hacking operation to profit from knowing the results of the American election before it was announced.
      </p>
      <p>
       A further fact remains that the DNC email leaks (which is what this whole Russian collusion thing was originally about) did NOT happen through Russia but rather someone in the domestic US who then framed the information to make it look as though it had been hacked by Russia.  So that's interesting, and it means one ought to look at any other "Russia!" accusations with some suspicion because it means someone is actively framing Russia.

       Wait, so you think the DNC hacked their own servers, the personal email accounts of several staff members, the email of the head of the campaign of their presidential candidate, and the email of Colin Powell and then proceeded to hand those emails over to WikiLeaks and other websites? Why the fuck would they do that?

       I was not talking about the emails. I was talking about the robbery of a chance at election for Bernie Sanders. You know, corruption and manipulation in the highest process an American can participate in. Though I can see why you'd bring up the hacked emails. You realize that the original company that analyzed the hack and announced Russia was the culprit has since backed down and distanced themselves from those claims? Turns out disgruntled members of the DNC may have hacked those servers from the inside.  Though it could've really been ANYONE. You have to consider the fact that Hillary Clinton smashed some 23 devices so that they could not be searched and seized... That makes all of that data she just had out in the open VERY lucrative, regardless of it's exact nature, because it's obvious she was trying to hide something.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the government that cleared her of destroying that evidence was not responsible for the hack. However, disgruntled employees within that very government, or anyone who was looking to expose crimes of treason and election manipulation might have been behind it. I personally commend the individuals or individual that was behind those leaks, as they gave anyone who took the time to read them confirmation of manipulation and corruption. We need more truth in the world.

       Why did you respond to my statement about the Russian election hacking issue saying that the DNC was the real perpetrator when that isn't what you meant? As far as I can tell the whole thing you just typed is completely unrelated to my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that the DNC server was not the only thing that was hacked so even if it turns out that that one was a leak by an insider there are still plenty of others that were hacked (potentially by Russia). In addition to that, hacking wasn't even the only thing that was done, there was also the proliferation of bogus news stories that were spread on Facebook, and the possibility that some of the states voter rolls were hacked making it more difficult for some people in key states to vote.

       There is no attribution or nonrepudiation in Crowdstrikes findings. Crowdstrike has a history of false attribution as well. They also missed the actions of Guciffer 2.0 while they were supposedly monitoring the DNC for threats.

       No, either you don't get it, or you're purposely trying to misdirect.  The DNC hack is one thing.  The Russia collusion investigation is more than just the DNC hack.  Even if the DNC hack had nothing to do with Russia, that doesn't dismiss everything else.

       That would be like going to the doctor to check your throat for cancer, and he says you don't have throat cancer, so you're assuming you're cancer free.  But, you have testicular cancer, so you're wrong about being cancer free.

       Nobody is telling you to take the Russia word as gospel.  They're saying stop trying to dismiss it while there's an ongoing investigation.  At least wait till that's over for fucks sake.

       There are a

       of trump supporters going desperately with the "Russia is a nothingburger!!!!" or "Russia story is completely debunked!!!" narrative. At this point it sounds more like they're trying to convince themselves that it is totally a non-story. To any objective observer it looks increasingly desperate.

       So you don't find all of this Russian hysteria even slightly suspicious? The DNC got caught rigging the election against Bernie, yet the only thing you'll hear on the news is "Russia this. Russia that." It isn't weird to you that information about a party rigging an election isn't being televised and is in fact, being covered up by the Russia narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, as a Ron Paul supporter, I find it highly suspicious that the Red Scare 2.0 appeared right after Hillary Clinton lost the election... Especially after all of the deals she made with them.

       What does the Russian narrative that keeps getting played have to do with the findings that the DNC rigged it's own election against Sanders? There's an easy answer: Russia is the distraction. While you're distracted by the old boogeyman, the real monsters are getting away with murder once again.

       I personally want peace in the world and can recognize a media spin narrative when I see one. There is a bike spinning madman by the name of Kim Jung that we should be all working together to stop. There are humvee driving, m16 toting, and tank operating members of ISIS that we should be working together to stop. (Whom were originally armed and funded ourselves in a disgusting repetition of history.

       lol no idea what all this was about. yes there are multiple things in the world to worry about. active measures are one of them, considering the embarassing and potentially dangerous situation it has put our country in (and NK + trump is a complete shit show exacerbated by the fact that our president is just as crazy and possibly MORE implulsive than the leader of NK)

       This reasoning doesn't make any sense. Because we fought with Russia in the past it's supposed to be ridiculous to believe they would do anything against us in the future?

       We fought with Britain in the past but that is all behind us because we pushed forward and made peace. That is how politics is meant to work. The Russians can't make peace with us if half of the country thinks they're comparable to Hitler. We can thank the media and the billions going into spinning this narrative for that though.

       Russia only stopped being our enemy a little over 25 years ago, while the main conflict with Britain played out hundreds of years ago. I agree that peace between the two countries is an important goal but that still doesn't take away from the fact that potential collusion with the country by our leaders is something we should be concerned about, as the Russian government doesn't seem to have the best of intentions towards us.

       I think men say a lot of stupid shit that they don't mean I see it all the time. If you disagree then you either have never hung out with a group of guys or you grew up in a bubble. Honestly Hillary has and would have done worse and her husband did as well. The problem with your argument is that the left used to love donald trump, black people used to put him in rap songs, but now bc he ran as a republican they hate him even though they know how rigged the dnc is and trump probably knew it as well and thats why he ran as republican since he is a classical liberal.

       He has been used in rap songs, but not in a good way. You are so out of touch, black people have hated Trump since the central park 5. Yeah Ive been in locker rooms and around young guys that try to brag about their sexual prowess and make things up, those were all young guys, Im 40 nobody worth knowing talks like that at this age. You grow out of that when you realize every woman or girl is a mother, or a sister or a daughter. I wouldn't let anyone talk to any woman in my life, I certainly don't expect any man to let me talk to any woman he knows like that.

       No you are discussing something so far off topic bc you can't give any actual evidence of trump being a tyrant or that he was running as the tyrant president. All you say is he said grab em by the pussy, i dont like it it makes me feel things, trumps bad for saying that, i choose someone who talks like a robot but behind closed doors has disdain for all their constituents and makes fun of them in emails.

       Show me where I said or implied that woman CANT defend themselves. Because I said no such thing. I said a man doesn't let other men disrespect or in this case, talk about sexually assaulting woman.

       Depends on what you consider "evidence". Personally, I think repeatedly lies and misdirection are indicative of a cover up and a cover up is indicative of a crime or conspiracy to commit a crime.

       Come on man, seriously? I know that your belief system rests upon the fact that the russia story doesnt exist but now your just putting blinders on. In the last week their was a flood of new information, some that contradicts Trump jrs interview, some that revealed more links to the dossier, some that showed more links to russian banking and a whole brand new avenue of collusion has sprung up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia conspiracy doesnt exist platform is so fragile and it cracks just a little more every week. Yet you ignorant, self serving sudden government besties have been peddling fake goods that have been rotting in your hands as you peddle them. Throw that shit in the trash, your pushing an agenda for a man a majority of the country despises, who hasnt done a damn thing for you or your family and who doesnt care how many times he lies to you. Stop being a political push pin, stop shilling for absolutely nothing.

       But Trump helped Republicans to allow ISPs to sell our internet history and as a woke unemployed coal miner that's the sort of thing I was thinking about when I voted for him!!

       Uh not at all, actually.

       What I DO notice is that whenever more things come out (oh another secret meeting that trump lied about, oh their teaming up with state AG's offices, oh they are teaming up with the IRS crimes unit, etc etc) that this sub gets plastered with posts that are trying to claim it's all fake news.
