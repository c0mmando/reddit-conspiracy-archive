<p>In his essay, <em>industrial society and its failure</em>, he outline almost exactly what we see today with current technology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kaczynski states that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling and has caused widespread psychological suffering. He argues that because of technological advances, most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits which he calls &quot;surrogate activities&quot;, wherein people strive towards artificial goals. Examples he gives of surrogate activities include scientific work, consumption of entertainment and following sports teams. He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa. He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike others who he says understand some of its negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable,and calls for a return to &quot;wild nature&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Unabomber may been part of a false-flag psy-op. He implies as much. When asked what his favorite novel is, he said &quot;The Secret Agent,&quot; by Joseph Conrad.</p>

<p>That inspired me to read it. I was shocked. It&#39;s all about a provocateur sent in to frame a group by setting off a false-flag attack. The provocateur [Verlock] has a foreign handler (named Mr. Vladimir) who explains that the bomb has to be coordinated to destroy something connected in the public mind with &quot;science, progress&quot;.</p>

<p>He explains that &quot;Science is the new fetish,&quot; the new unquestioned good. The current dogma.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t understand it, but they vaguely associated it with material prosperity (which, in our materialistic age, we worship).</p>

<p>&quot;Simply blowing up a museum or a church won&#39;t do,&quot; Mr Vladimir says. &quot;It won&#39;t shock the public to its core. It has to be a building associated with science or money. Something associated with material prosperity.&quot;</p>

<p>(Sound a lot like the World Trade Center?)</p>

<p>At any rate: The whole point of the book is that the bombing is fake. It is NOT perpetrated by the group the public is told did it. It&#39;s done by government agents framing them &quot;to get repressive legislation passed&quot; on the people.</p>

<p>(Sound like the Patriot Act?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it sounds more likely that he simply got the wrong message from the book and hyperfocused on the &quot;blowing up a museum or church won&#39;t do&quot; angle and that he felt that he needed to &quot;shock the public to its core&quot; in order to draw attention to his cause.</p>

<p>The fact that in the novel the acts are false-flags probably has nothing to do with his actual situation, apart from maybe some post-event wishful thinking on his part that people might think he wasn&#39;t acting on his own accord, thus exonerating his memory through attributing his acts to a greater power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a double-whammy; having his cake and eating it, too. A true sign of a narcissistic psychopath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No OP, the unibomber&#39;s statement there is only validating a personal opinion that you are conveying.  It is fundamentally communist anti-capitalist propaganda, and you OP are very well a antifa </p>

<p>Your praising of the communist rantings of a domestic terrorist is transparent.</p>

<p>Your assertion that his rantings are &quot;almost exactly what we see today&quot; is nothing but a twisted and abjectly false worldview that you have, or are at least trying to spew on social media for what could be nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>The anti-technology lunatics in society are merely repeating the mantras of Marx.  Marx asserted that there was an inherent oppression and &quot;alienation&quot; from capital (technology), that would magically disappear once technology was monopolized to collective ownership, I.e. government ownership, of the means of production, after which the technology will no longer be oppressive nor &quot;alienating&quot;, but liberating.  </p>

<p>Kazinski was not informed about the &quot;real world&quot;, he was a victim of a mental disorder which included deep psychosis regarding &quot;alienation&quot;.  Kazinski was very likely suffering from a similar ailment that plagued Marx.  Their inner conflict and inability to find solace and peace in human body form that they necessarily are, instead of being almighty genius Demi gods, which they wanted to be, caused them great distress and damage.  </p>

<p>They both projected their inner feelings of self-alienation outward into the world and falsely perceived a cosmic clash and conflict just like what they felt.  They imagined a great two sided battle between two monolithic armies, classes, us and them.</p>

<p>You are in a little bubble OP.</p>

<p>Looks like from what you wrote, that what is <em>NOT</em> &quot;up&quot; is the fidelity to reality that your post is supposed to represent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  Marx believed that the prime motive force in the universe, well, for all human society and all of what it can be, was what he called &quot;productive forces&quot;.  Now, to be sure, he did not use the phrase &quot;technology&quot;, but from our present day language that is perhaps the closest word to what he was referring to.  </p>

<p>Now, this technological force is totally uncaused in Marx&#39;s schema.  It is, as mentioned above, the prime mover.  As such, it is responsible for the tremendous oppression and struggle and victimization and whatnot that Marx perceived was inherent in all fixed income contracts, oh woops, sorry, I used present day terminology, Marx used the phrase &quot;wage labour&quot;, or, the &quot;proletariat&quot; class, that occurred when individuals are free from coercion and able to mutually agree with each other to trade for mutual gain.  Drat, did it again, Marx phrased this as (well, at least paraphrased) &quot;capitalist exploiting laborer by withholding surplus value&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, the result of all this is supposed to be that all the means of production, all the capital, what can be phrased as &quot;crystallized&quot; technology, become tragically detached, &quot;alienated&quot;, from all mankind, yes, including the capitalist as well, and stand as a fetter, an absolute prison and torment, relentlessly draining and sucking the life out of humanity and all of our &quot;spirit&quot; gets trapped in the capital and cut off from us.  The whole universe is in a conflict in this way, you see, according to Marx.  He was actually envisioning a cosmic rift in the fabric of space time.  After all, Marx was a follower and highly influenced by, Hegel, even if he later criticized his former mentor.  He still carried over the Hegelian schema of the universe, he just &quot;turned Hegel on his head&quot;, meaning instead of spirit and mind resolving itself over time, and improving itself in the form of physical matter evolution and social change, Marx said no, the physical matter is primary while mind and spirit are outgrowths.  The productive forces supposedly cause repeated dialectical syntheses in the universe, or at least for humanity, which by the way Marx&#39;s writings strongly suggest he held was the only true reality in the universe, as an unintentional nod to Feuerbach, so that when the pressures and distresses supposedly build under industrial progress finally become big enough, there is an inevitable change, a revolution, and we humans, all we can supposedly do is either join in with the inevitable and celebrate it, or try to stop it, be labelled countless names, such as a reactionary, and many others.  Marx did not explain how it makes sense to both believe that a particular future is inevitable, while at the same time calling on people to rise up and bring about a revolution in order to get to that future.</p>

<p>Marx was notorious for never describing his own system in detail, but rather constantly wrote about all the problems he &quot;perceived&quot; in the world, and wrote vitriolic attacks about his intellectual contemporaries characters.</p>

<p>In summary, it is perhaps not so much technology as such that Marxism has a phobia for.  It is that technology which results when individuals are free to develop it as private owners of the means of production.  That is, the technology supposedly specific to capitalism.</p>

<p>The anti-technology, romantic view popularized during the 1700s and 1800s, longed for a return to &quot;the wild life&quot;.  This view also influenced Marx.</p>

<p>Whew, that didn&#39;t take long at all.  If you are against technology, you are a howling at the moon madman?  Hardly.  There are plenty of facets of technology that people don&#39;t have to deem acceptable, and that is their prerogative.  Technology =/= progress.  Technology can AID progress, for a person or for a society.  If you have such strong views, go teach technology to indigenous natives or Amish that are &quot;lunatics&quot; apparently.  </p>

<p>and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even today individual values are expected to conform with the needs of society. You&#39;d think that social values would evolve out of natural individual values. They do, but only up to a point.</p>

<p>When a society gets big enough, there&#39;s a sort of equilibrium that starts to shift away from the values of individual to those of the group.</p>

<p>e.g. Nice people just want to get along with their neighbors vs America wants to stop communism in Vietnam... nice people who wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly end up getting drafted and sent overseas to fight a war.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take much more of a shift towards the needs of the group before crazy shit starts to happen. Just look at examples like Stalinist Russia, Mao&#39;s China or Nazi Germany and you can see what happens when the individual is commanded to conform to group values.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think his attacks on technology were too pessimistic, but I think the quote above is generally true.  As populations increase and economies become more interdependent and complex, it seems fairly obvious that need for ever more social stability, homogeneity and regulation is inevitable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even a power conspiracy per se, but a kind of practical choice to keep civilization functioning and to prevent irrevocable system failure.  This is why most people go along with incremental regulation and decreasing choice.  Not because they want them, but they sense that the whole mess is marginally sustainable and at risk of collapse.</p>

<p>That guy who experimented on Ted at Harvard was a complete prick but even he should have known that Kaczynski was not somebody you want to fool around with. The most incredible part is where Kaczynski wants a sex change operation because &quot;that is the only way he would be able to ever touch a woman&quot; or some other really weird shit. Chase &quot;reports&quot; <em>some</em> stuff there is just no way he could possibly know it, in other words.  </p>

<p>Also a good fraction of Chase&#39;s material is online in his Atlantic article.</p>
