<p>Let&#39;s look at the indicators.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Every ancient civilisation leaving writing and legends about cosmic cataclysms being a regular thing. Some of them even going so far as to have their whole society revolve around tracking them. </p></li>
<li><p>NASA going from &#39;Planet X is bullshit&#39; -&gt; &#39;There might be a planet x&#39; -&gt; `There is a planet x we just don&#39;t know where it is yet&#39; - &gt; &#39;Our sun might have a binary twin&#39;. </p></li>
<li><p>Compelling evidence from whistle-blowers and investigators that <strong>billions</strong> have been spent over the last few decades building underground bases/cities in the USA and all over the world. </p></li>
<li><p>Revalations, Mayan astronomy, The Law of One all indicating that the next one is around this time. </p></li>
<li><p>Solid archaeological evidence continuing to surface of previous cataclysms (Hancock) </p></li>
<li><p>Increased erratic behaviour of natural disasters and climate change, with evidence that the magnetic field of large celestial bodies influences these things. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now one of these points isn&#39;t cause for concern. But all of them, when viewed together, seem to indicate that this threat is real and it&#39;s coming. And here we all are arguing over bullshit, calling each other shills, and labelling everything a psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And maybe that&#39;s the point. So many times have people heard this that it now gets thrown into the same bag as flat earth and such. But is it really as inconceivable? I don&#39;t think ignoring the warnings of every ancient civilisation,  based on information given to us in an age where disinformation and manipulation are paramount, is the most sensible thing to do. So much of what we are told these days is either wrong, manipulated or has an adgenda behind it. And yet in spite of knowing this, we feel it is OK to cheery pick the portions of that information that we agree with? I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;d put much more stock in myth written in stone thousands of years ago than I do anything put out by our current society of disinformation. </p>

<p>Absolutely a possibility. Seeing as it&#39;s supposed to be getting closer, though, it would be increasingly difficult to hide. Hell, some are saying Sept 4th is when Nibiru is supposed to pass us. We&#39;d see it by now. </p>

<p>And maybe that&#39;s ultimately why I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s some celestial object out to get us. There&#39;s a new prediction every other week about some space thing that&#39;s going to cause grave danger to earth. It always turns out to be wrong. </p>

<p>I am too, but maybe that&#39;s why there is always hysteria? I wouldn&#39;t put it past TPTB to do that. Hell, look at 2012, and all the hysteria behind it (online and in Hollywood films). Truth be told, the end of the Mayan calendar was merely the ending of one age and the entering into another age. A great awakening/unveiling of human consciousness. Same with the &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. It was never really about a destruction of the Earth, just an unveiling of knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you know enough about astronomy to know what is bright enough to be seen in our sky?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I do :) Or, more accurately, I know how to determine if something would be visible from earth based on its size/brightness. </p>

<p>I also own a lot of high-tech star gazing equipment. I&#39;ve seen nothing. But that doesn&#39;t mean shit, because it could be way out beyond the Kuiper belt (or farther!). I do not have any equipment to see that far, and I don&#39;t think any personal stuff exists for that. It&#39;s also possible that something I attribute to being a star is actually Planet X heading towards Earth. Then again I haven&#39;t noticed any objects in (relatively) the same spot, every night, that&#39;s been getting bigger and/or brighter. </p>

<p>Again, this is just shit I&#39;m doing from home. It&#39;s entirely possible NASA has seen it and is hiding it. Then again, if this whole &quot;Death by Nibiru&quot; on Septh 4th were true, we&#39;d absolutely be seeing it in the sky with our naked eye by now. </p>

<p>The meteor over Russia a few years ago was a total surprise, and though it was small, it wouldn&#39;t need to be much bigger to cause trouble.</p>

<p>Of course, this is random, basically, so it doesn&#39;t pay to worry about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is always a threat of death from space, but it&#39;s almost impossible to protect against.</p>

<p>The sources are different, but they cause GRB, gamma ray bursts. These can strip the Earth&#39;s ozone layer and the gamma radiation will cause mass extinction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A hyper-nova with it&#39;s north or south pole pointed at us could wipe out all planet life with a GRB if it&#39;s within 65,000 ly(light years)</p></li>
<li><p>A crack on a neutron star within 3,000 ly will decimate half the ozone with it&#39;s GRB. In 2004, a neutron star 50,000 ly had a crack and it&#39;s crust shifted 1 centimeter, giving off about 25 million years of our sun&#39;s energy production. It blinded satellites(the energy burst lasted 200 milliseconds so it was mostly unnoticed by us) and ionized the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>A supernova within 3,000 ly will wipe us out with it&#39;s GRB</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah GRB will pretty much fuck us up if it&#39;s close enough. Some non GRB events</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A visit by a neighboring brown dwarf that is invisible to us wrecking havoc in our solar system(this one is more hit or miss if it&#39;ll wipe us out).</p></li>
<li><p>Ye Ole Asteriod</p></li>
<li><p>Aliens bent on galactic conquest or just wanting us for pets</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent assessment.  When you see how many bodies are flying around us, how often things fly in between earth and the moon, how often those things pass by and we&#39;re unknown until they passed - I&#39;ve given up assuming we would have any warning before a terrible strike.  It used to bother me, and now I just assume it could happen, so just enjoy the time we got.</p>
