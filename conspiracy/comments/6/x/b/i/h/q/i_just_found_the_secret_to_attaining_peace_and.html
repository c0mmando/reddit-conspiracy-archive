       I just unsubbed from ALL my political subreddits. I gotta tell you, it's really a weight off my shoulders. It was basically just a horrible waste of time and energy being active on any political subreddit. Reddit is and likely always will be controlled by the establishment. My views on freedom will never be allowed to look good on their own turf. They know that, and gain much from it. They want us to bicker and complain on here so that it feels like we're making a difference, when we really aren't. The only way for people to actually hear me, and anyone free-minded, is by going outside talking to anyone who'll listen. That's what they don't want us to do, they want us to sit idly in front of our screens and trick us into thinking we're accomplishing something, when all we're doing is trying to beat them at their own game. Quit wasting time on here with endless political debate and make your time on the internet something to enjoy.

       I don't know. A lot of the people I argue with are very thick headed. I show them evidence of my argument and they dismiss it as propaganda or irrelevant. It just annoys me how so many are no willing to even entertain any opinion different from theirs.

       For me, it's all about identifying where the disagreement is. If I disagree with someone on a fundamental level, then there's no point arguing about it. I'm a Bernie voter, and I have a close friend who falls somewhere between ancap and classical liberal. I can't argue with him about raising taxes on the wealthy when he believes that income tax is altogether immoral.

       Oh see that is the problem, you feel your thoughts are valid and must be accepted but you think the thoughts that differ from yours must be changed by your brilliant arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To have a rewarding experience on the internet political discussion threads, accept that not everyone will agree with you.
But that each of those people are as sincere in their beliefs as you are. 
Stick to voicing your ideas and be willing to say when you disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think you must be obligated to change another view or gain acceptance for your own view?

       I normally try to do that, but there seem to be more people today that will completely disregard your argument even though it is backed with legitimate evidence and logic, and use long worded speculations to back theirs. That or they'll try to go off track and shame me for my political beliefs, like this guy likes-to-use-italics right near this comment, and act like that automatically validates their argument. I'm just over it now. At least in a face to face conversation there's more respect and consideration, instead of getting to talk like an animal on the net with practically no repercussions.

       True, I sometimes take it all to seriously. And getting angry doesn't really help my argument either. Still, I need to take a break from politics on reddit at least for a while.

       Yeah I've definitely noticed that online political discussions are toxic to my mental health. That's the main reason I deactivated my Facebook, and sometimes I'll take a few days break from Reddit if it gets bad. I tried to quit altogether, but I guess I enjoy it too much.

       Sounds like the internet in general. I mean really, how often do you see people in online debates admit they were wrong, and adopt a new position? Very, very rarely (if ever) is the honest answer.

       So how can I talk to open minded people when they have been programmed to believe the fiction of a reality they live in. I once was explaining pizzagate to one of my friends and they were literally filling in pieces of information that I didn't even know about that proves how real pizzagate was and then didn't believe it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't think massive mind/thought control was a thing until I discovered people straight up denying the truth. It's very frustrating but getting fustrated does nothing but make it harder to change the world. Good thing Reddit still has a hint of some free speech in subs like this... even though it's compromised.

       Tbh, The_Donald and SJWhate attracted me with their constant exposure of ridiculous political correctness, but their Islamophobia made me unsubscribe. The rest of my political subreddits were just capitalist or anti-socialist.

       Oh it does. They just made it a crime to use the wrong gender pronouns in Canada (there's impending legislation to pass a law fro that in California too). Just go on SJWhate, there is A LOT, of PC today. Don't get me wrong, skinheads like to call not being allowed to say the N word PC, but that definitely doesn't mean PC is no longer a problem. I've been called a racist many times for voicing my opinion on immigration, and I'm Mexican.

       Hah, what a load of horseshit. Are you aware of hate speech laws that are being passed? What about internet censorship of so-call "bigotry" when people are speaking about against hostile cultures? Have you heard about people being arrested and IMPRISONED for their "Islamaphobic" posts on Facebook? I'm guessing that you live in America, where freedom of speech is a constitutional right. Newsflash, in other places voicing your opinion can put you in a cage.
