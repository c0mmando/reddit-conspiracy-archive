       I'm not a big Facebook guy.  I just moved to another city and reactivated mine for dating app purposes. I don't really check it that often.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today I was at a bar with my boss and we were talking about interior design for a restaurant we were opening.  My computer was in my car and our phones were on the bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed me pictures from a website on HIS cell phone.  We are not associated with each other on ANY social media.  No FB, no IG, LinkedIn, twitter...nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just moved from Houston, TX and I got on Facebook to check in and see who is safe from Harvey and an ad pops up from an online store and not only is it it the exact same store he was showing me on HIS phone, but it's the exact same picture he was showing me that he wanted for the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way this is coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could my laptop show me EXACTLY what we were looking at through HIS cell phone?  I don't have a FB app on my phone (except for messenger) but the store and picture wasn't said allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is tracking data sent through proximity phones (Bluetooth maybe) to gather more data?

       It's not magic.  I'm not a "everything is a conspiracy" guy but I'm not naive enough to think I'm not being listened to and tracked.  My problem is that I don't know how I'm being tracked of no words were being said.

       I read the wiki about the book. Pretty sweet.  Sadly that's just the beginning to my insanity. I'd explore deeper and darker answers, but I don't want to be killed by someone for finding out something I shouldn't know. Lol

       I don't know what to tell you, but this sub gets these posts all the time with surprised people wondering how this could be possible.  Your phone now tracks what you do, as you saw for yourself.

       Did you know that some newer generation TVs can even turn themselves "on" now, and use their technology as a listening device, while looking like they are turned "off"?  It's all true.  That's the world we live in now.

       I get TVs, echos, phones, prob even the smart refrigerators and anything people are using to make life "easier" are constantly monitoring voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       My confusion is that my phone picked up something from his phone which relayed that to a social media account that I opened on my laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see online ads it's something that I googled on my laptop and I see the same ads on my laptop.  This is an ad from something that someone just told me to look at on their phone. My phone wasn't open (albeit it's always "on") so something data got transferred from his phone to my phone by something other then my microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kinda of bothers me more than the camera/mike on my phone...this is something totally different

       You are probably right about the proximity blu-tooth or location settings.  They have ads in large public squares that purposely scan peoples devices in the general area and try to blanket advertise.  No reason to believe they are not doing that en-mass with the general public.  I.e.  You coworker is shopping for something, good chance another coworker might buy the same thing so hit them with ads.

       Your boss and you work in same field, get many of the same targeted advertising.  Your boss got this one first.  Then you went back and saw it on your phone.  Odds are not infinitesimal, given you have the same career.  To be sure, you can ask your boss how he found the website.  If company advertises on FB, they advertise on Google and Twitter too.

       That's crazy, but very interesting.  Is there a name for that or something that you experienced? I'd like to read more about it, but then again it may just pop up as a "recommended" article next time I open my computer

       We are in the restaurant biz.  He's looking for stuff to help our interior designer.  It's nothing that I'm involved with.  I'm a chef and have never looked at this website( I  still don't know this artist's name) or looked for art online, much less Latin American/Mexican Tattoo art prints.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in the same field but this isn't related to our field at all.

       This would be like two accountants sitting at a bar in South Dakota and one showed a guy a picture of a porterhouse from Peter Luger's in NYC saying, "here's what i ate when I went on vacation.  I forget the name of the restaurant but this steak was amazing" and the 2nd guy going home and getting an ad from not only Peter Lugers, but a picture of a porterhouse, not a filet, a strip, or ribeye, but a fucking porterhouse when the name of the restaurant and cut of meat was never mentioned.  That is infinitesimal.

       Yes.  At work.  Not when we were having the discussion at the bar.

       This is kinda the correct answer. He's wrong about targeting public squares. That's way too static, and we usually focus on being dynamic. Both of you were in the same general area for a similar period of time. One of you looked at a shop/artwork that was paying Facebook for advertisements. The next time you opened Facebook, it compares the data it had gotten to the data it had gotten from everyone else around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone else probably saw the same ad, but didn't think anything about it.

       That makes sense.  It still bothers me though, but I guess that's the way it is
