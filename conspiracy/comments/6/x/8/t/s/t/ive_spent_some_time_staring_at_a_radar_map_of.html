        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so I saw this tweet from the National Weather Service:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NWSEastern/status/902710394250244097">https://twitter.com/NWSEastern/status/902710394250244097</a></p>

<p>Then I stared at it for a long time. To me, it seems like there are bursts of blue that come from a dozen or so different points. These 12 points seem to have 5 or 6 bursts come from the EXACT SAME SPOTS over the course of this radar video/gif thingy. And I remember a post on this board about Super Storm Sandy (SSS=666) where the guy said they shoot water/vapor into the air from huge stacks/towers. Or at least I think I remember that.</p>

<p>So I wanted to know what was in these spots. I thought it could possibly be huge stacks/towers that shoot clouds/mist into the sky. I was speculating that this was why there was so much water dumped on Houston and why the storm was fixed over that area. </p>

<p>Hurricane Harvey Houston HHH = 888.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hhh">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hhh</a></p>

<p>So I tried to map these spots on google maps. Take a look. Am I on to something? Or am I seeing things where there is nothing there?</p>

<p>Coordinates:</p>

<p>25.914884 , -97.426537 ---&gt; Corrected to 25.916001, -97.418929 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>34.352976 , -98.984822 ---&gt; Corrected to 34.353496, -98.994490 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>32.461138 , -93.841439 ---&gt; Corrected to 32.450814, -93.841258 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>29.539244 , -98.262054 ---&gt; Corrected to 29.703966, -98.028494 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>27.778066 , -97.687829 ---&gt; Corrected to 27.779332, -97.504955 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>32.319444 , -90.077298 ---&gt; Corrected to 32.318875, -90.079991 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>30.684701 , -88.243612 ---&gt; Corrected to 30.679506, -88.239792 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>31.033398 , -93,185241 ---&gt; Corrected to 31.155723, -92.976093 (NEXRAD dome)</p>

<p>Obviously I tried to make the pattern I thought I saw fit. I really want someone to take a look at these and tell me if anything seems weird to them too. I didn&#39;t get to all blue burst spots. Some of these are more interesting than others. All are airports. I think it&#39;s possible to find an airport near anything (probably) but these seem like too big of a coincidence to me. Especially the circle flag pole landscaping or whatever.</p>

<p>ANYBODY CARE TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER????</p>

<p>Please!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so basically I was searching one of the blue burst areas to see if there was anything weird there. I was hoping to find big smoke stack like structures. Anyway, it seemed like almost immediately I conclude that it was small air strips or airports. Then after my third or forth one I saw one of those circles and was sort of shocked because I had seen one previously. So I went back and, sure enough I found a bunch!</p>

<p>To me, it looks like it could be a flag pole. With a weird circle landscape around it. Like, do airports have these? Or did I stumble onto something?</p>

<p>Another thing that I noticed was that several of these areas had a big water reserve (rectangle pond) near by. Which would make sense for my theory that they are shooting water vapor into the air.</p>

<p>kind of like this:</p>

<p>Anyway, I just started looking for those circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things that look like flag poles in the center of the segmented circles are called wind cones: <a href="http://www.ascentgroundschool.com/%7Eascentgr/images/stories/PvtOGS/PPL310.jpg">http://www.ascentgroundschool.com/~ascentgr/images/stories/PvtOGS/PPL310.jpg</a></p>

<p>Did you actually narrow down the blue bursts to these wind cone areas or was it just in the general area of the airports?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not dismiss your investigations because people in this thread currently and in the future may say to do so. Always investigate what you find interesting but make sure not to let yourself start seeing things you want to see. The way we really find out what is going on is people getting interested in areas and investigating them. You have a good start so keep it up! I should note that I do think /they/ have done some kind of control or manipulation for Harvy, as they have for the other devastating hurricanes. Whether this means seeding them, making them stronger, diverting them, etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seen someone else talk about this.  If you are interested, I can find the link.</p>

<p>Basically, they can use radar to breakup the storms.  That&#39;s those burst you see.  They use this specific radar overnight, and it destroys the storms.</p>

<p>But, when they want a strong storm to form, they just don&#39;t turn on the radar in that location.</p>

<p>Basically, look on YouTube for Nexrad weather manipulation.  That&#39;s what you are seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dutchsinse broke these down on youtube and gave hundreds of examples, basically these coordinates are likely all near radar towers, these towers are capable of making scalar waves, like mini haarps.  Weather radar used to show the bursts way more clearly because these cause quite a big anomaly on the screen, but they have gotten better at fuzziness / blending the distortions out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so basically I was searching one of the blue burst areas to see if there was anything weird there. I was hoping to find big smoke stack like structures. Anyway, it seemed like almost immediately I conclude that it was small air strips or airports. Then after my third or forth one I saw one of those circles and was sort of shocked because I had seen one previously. So I went back and, sure enough I found a bunch!</p>

<p>To me, it looks like it could be a flag pole. With a weird circle landscape around it. Like, do airports have these? Or did I stumble onto something?</p>

<p>Another thing that I noticed was that several of these areas had a big water reserve (rectangle pond) near by. Which would make sense for my theory that they are shooting water vapor into the air.</p>

<p>kind of like this:</p>

<p>Anyway, I just started looking for those circles.</p>
