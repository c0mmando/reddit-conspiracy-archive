       Ok, so I saw this tweet from the National Weather Service:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSEastern/status/902710394250244097">
        https://twitter.com/NWSEastern/status/902710394250244097
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I stared at it for a long time. To me, it seems like there are bursts of blue that come from a dozen or so different points. These 12 points seem to have 5 or 6 bursts come from the EXACT SAME SPOTS over the course of this radar video/gif thingy. And I remember a post on this board about Super Storm Sandy (SSS=666) where the guy said they shoot water/vapor into the air from huge stacks/towers. Or at least I think I remember that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wanted to know what was in these spots. I thought it could possibly be huge stacks/towers that shoot clouds/mist into the sky. I was speculating that this was why there was so much water dumped on Houston and why the storm was fixed over that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurricane Harvey Houston HHH = 888.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I tried to map these spots on google maps. Take a look. Am I on to something? Or am I seeing things where there is nothing there?

      <p>
       Obviously I tried to make the pattern I thought I saw fit. I really want someone to take a look at these and tell me if anything seems weird to them too. I didn't get to all blue burst spots. Some of these are more interesting than others. All are airports. I think it's possible to find an airport near anything (probably) but these seem like too big of a coincidence to me. Especially the circle flag pole landscaping or whatever.

      <p>
       ANYBODY CARE TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER????

       maybe they were using combined weather data from the airports? no airports in between the blue = no weather data, so they can't/won't report it since they technically don't know what's going on there.

       These are tiny airfields in tiny towns. And the blue bursts seem to shoot out of them periodically in 360 degree blasts. No?

       What are those dotted circle structures you've put the markers on?
What time frame is this animation covering? 
I'd like to point out that the blue flashes don't move with the surrounding weather so this is interesting stuff.

       Okay, so basically I was searching one of the blue burst areas to see if there was anything weird there. I was hoping to find big smoke stack like structures. Anyway, it seemed like almost immediately I conclude that it was small air strips or airports. Then after my third or forth one I saw one of those circles and was sort of shocked because I had seen one previously. So I went back and, sure enough I found a bunch!
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it looks like it could be a flag pole. With a weird circle landscape around it. Like, do airports have these? Or did I stumble onto something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I noticed was that several of these areas had a big water reserve (rectangle pond) near by. Which would make sense for my theory that they are shooting water vapor into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       kind of like this:

      <p>
       Anyway, I just started looking for those circles.

       The things that look like flag poles in the center of the segmented circles are called wind cones:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you actually narrow down the blue bursts to these wind cone areas or was it just in the general area of the airports?

       I found the airports then looked for the circles. I didn't assume it was anything...just started finding them so then I started looking for them and marking them.

       I'm open to the idea of something underground near the airports causing this. You know of the underground military bases and tunnels running from Denver airport, Dulce Base, NORAD and the like? If I lived anywhere near those small airfields I'd try to sneak a peak.

       I like the suggestion of NEXRAD radar causing the weather manipulation. That seems to make some sense. Do you know the location of the NASA vapor exhaust release in the video you posted? Is it NASA in Houston?

       These are tiny airfields in tiny towns. And the blue bursts seem to shoot out of them periodically in 360 degree blasts. No?

       You are correct about the radar stations. They are NEXRAD radar stations. However I am pretty sure they are used for weather manipulation. YouTube has a bunch on it.

       I can assure you there is not much going on at the Jackson MS airport. The NEXRAD radar dome is actually east of the airport, on the north side of I-20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the blue areas be the morning dew and the moisture related to that. Would explain the wide spread effect.

       Do not dismiss your investigations because people in this thread currently and in the future may say to do so. Always investigate what you find interesting but make sure not to let yourself start seeing things you want to see. The way we really find out what is going on is people getting interested in areas and investigating them. You have a good start so keep it up! I should note that I do think /they/ have done some kind of control or manipulation for Harvy, as they have for the other devastating hurricanes. Whether this means seeding them, making them stronger, diverting them, etc..

       Basically, they can use radar to breakup the storms.  That's those burst you see.  They use this specific radar overnight, and it destroys the storms.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, when they want a strong storm to form, they just don't turn on the radar in that location.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, look on YouTube for Nexrad weather manipulation.  That's what you are seeing.

       very interesting, indeed.  the video you linked to the guy talking about nasa and with what your noticing has me on-board.  im going to do my own digging on this.  even when scientists explain the types of civilizations and the different classes/levels the second one is when a civilization can control the weather of the planet.  seems as if we are trying to achieve this while simultaneously carrying out political agendas.  thanks for opening this door to me my dude

       Dutchsinse broke these down on youtube and gave hundreds of examples, basically these coordinates are likely all near radar towers, these towers are capable of making scalar waves, like mini haarps.  Weather radar used to show the bursts way more clearly because these cause quite a big anomaly on the screen, but they have gotten better at fuzziness / blending the distortions out.

       Okay, so basically I was searching one of the blue burst areas to see if there was anything weird there. I was hoping to find big smoke stack like structures. Anyway, it seemed like almost immediately I conclude that it was small air strips or airports. Then after my third or forth one I saw one of those circles and was sort of shocked because I had seen one previously. So I went back and, sure enough I found a bunch!
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it looks like it could be a flag pole. With a weird circle landscape around it. Like, do airports have these? Or did I stumble onto something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I noticed was that several of these areas had a big water reserve (rectangle pond) near by. Which would make sense for my theory that they are shooting water vapor into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       kind of like this:
