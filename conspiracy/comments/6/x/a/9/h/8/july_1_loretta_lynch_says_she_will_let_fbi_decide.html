        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This shit doesn&#39;t match up. FBI is the investigation branch, not the judgement branch of the government, FBI only had to collect evidence and deliver it to the attorney general. Under ordinary circumstances the attorney general would be the one to decide whether to seek charges. A judgement from FBI to seek charges or not was only needed starting with July 1. April/may comes before July, why would Comey start to draft a statement before there was a need for one? Hell during his Senate testimony Comey himself said the tarmac meeting was why he decided to anounce the decision himself. Smells like perjury to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether he gave his results to the DOJ, private testimony to Congress, or public testimony to Congress it still requires a statement. It would probably need a few clerical changes depending on each, but it wouldn&#39;t be uncommon to make multiple drafts for each situation. It was probably expected he would have to testify to Congress anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under usual circumstances the decider would have been Lynch, so only she would have needed to prepare a statement on why she did/didn&#39;t decide to indict Clinton. The only statements congress could have needed from FBI could have been about the evidence and the investigation process BUT not about the final decision itself, because FBI wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with the final decision and would have no way to know what it would be, because Lynch would decide that. Why the fuck would Comey started to draft a statement exonerating Hillary Clinton if he had no way to know what the decision of Lynch would be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where does it state the original statement exonerated her? It&#39;s normal procedure for the FBI to recommend or not recommend criminal charges. It wouldn&#39;t take much editing to switch recommend to exonerate and the corresponding fluff text.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems they are just using it in the title to refer to &quot;we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.&quot; The wording of that would not need to be changed with Lynch&#39;s statement of deference to the FBI. Neither does it say he didn&#39;t change the statement after July 1st/June 29th.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that he didn&#39;t preemptively have recommendations of no charges, just that it does not imply he knew ahead of time that Lynch would recuse herself.</p>
