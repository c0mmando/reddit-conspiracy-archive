       We are having gas shortages in Dallas right now (I think other cities in TX are experiencing this too). It seems to be caused by issues with refineries in Houston coupled with a self-fulfilling prophecy of people fueling the shortage because they believe there is no gasoline and are filling up every container they own full of gas. Labor Day gasoline demand probably isn't helping either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the gas stations are saying they may not have gasoline until next week while others have some to offer. People are waiting in massive lines to get gas- if they can find a place with fuel. I've had former students tell me that they have seen fights in gas stations. Posts from some Dallas friends on Facebook show extreme concern and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home depot is currently out of gas cans and my husband saw a few people pushing their cars on the highway because they ran out of gas and couldn't fill up anywhere. Others have seen large groups of people filling up multiple containers, cutting people off in lines and becoming aggressive- near collisions in gas stations. It's not full on Mad Max mob mentality, but damn, it's really making my SHTF spidey senses tingle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, while r/dallas has removed most of the posts related to the shortage, the comments were full of people who had no concept of basic economics- it was super disturbing. I'm totally convinced that if we were in a real grid-down scenario of some kind (or if gasoline was simply unavailable for an extended period of time) most people would have no clue how to cope and would likely become very desperate, very quickly. They would probably become mob-like quickly and would likely fall prey to shady government 'solutions.'
      </p>
      <p>
       While I am prepared to handle a crisis scenario better than most people, I admit I have some work to do. This is a huge reminder that our normal lives are highly dependent on a few industries that, if disrupted, can turn our unprepared neighbors into a desperate mob and our highways into deathtraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy this community greatly and hope everyone here strives to make themselves as independent of the system as possible and has a plan to evacuate from a high-density population area if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: one of my former students says he's seen convoys of vehicles hit up multiple gas stations all at once to fuel up and essentially push everyone else waiting out of the way. Damn.

       This may sound harsh, but people that did not prepare adequately for this have only themselves to blame.  Its not like this hurricane came out of no where.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should have stocked up on fuel weeks ago.  I have 25 gallons on hand at all times and rotate through it as it ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people dont plan anymore.  They think everything will always be fine and if it isnt, the government will take care of them.

       I agree. But Dallas wasn't directly hit by the storm. It was overcast and we got some rain, but nothing to write home about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that people need to have more of a preparation mindset for sure. It's still sketchy to see people turn so fast.

       It just takes a lot people deciding they need to fill up, just in case.  All those people at once getting gas 3-10 days earlier than they normally would, will cause problems in areas without a supply problem.  Thank God it's hard for average person to hoard gas.

       I see what you mean, but a lot if people in Dallas have some big commutes. If they hear that there may not be gas until Tuesday, then they will act on that information and get it while it's available.

       As someone living Dallas who works on the other side of town, with traffic here even 25 gallons only goes so far. If seen gas shortages but this one is definitely wacky.

       Yeah, this isn't very practical for apartment dwellers. Long term food storage would be an issue too. But it seems wise for people under normal circumstances to maintain a full tank of gas and have some kind of plan.

       I don't know. I'm not sure how much of an impact this will have on the US at large. However, if gas prices are up for a while, we can most likely say goodbye to the Trump recovery.

       In NC, gas prices have gone up 20 cents or so just today.  A few gas stations I passed were packed. Saw a guy in Walmart buying 3 gas jugs.   I just read the governor issued a state of emergency because of the gas issue.  The way I read this is done so more tanker trucks are allowed to travel into the state to make up for pipelines and such not working.

       You know who else thinks of that? EVERYONE. Go watch the movie

       . Instead of "bugging out" people should be getting to know their neighbors and planning to STAY in place. Heading out on the highways is a sure way to get killed.

       Just seeing how crazy people are acting over a bit of a gas shortage, I do not want to be around a high density population. I already live in the country a ways away from the urban areas precisely to avoid this problem in advance.

       It depends on the scenario. Will they be able to get out? Will they be on foot or have a vehicle? Will the roads be safe for travel? Will there be government distribution of resources?

       People can do what they want but I don't trust people to not panic and not do stupid shit in an emergency. Most people do not have a good amount of food stored or anything that could help them ride out a situation for a week or more. I prefer a lifestyle that's more self sufficient.

       Of course self defense is a critical part of being prepared. Still, I believe that independent minded people who have some space are better off than the unprepared masses. I'll take my chances in the country.

       Also, people out here are definitely armed. Dove hunting season started today and I've been hearing gunshots since 6:30am. I don't think country people are simply sitting ducks ready to be picked off by desperate urban dwellers.

       Here in Louisiana this is pretty par for the course. Also, amateur hour. You fill everything up a week ago, you don't wait till the day of, freak out, and take gas away from emergency services.

       I think a lot of people did fill up last week but people drive a lot in Dallas. Many have a large commute. I do think a lot of this is panic driven but it's still crazy to see how people are acting about this.
