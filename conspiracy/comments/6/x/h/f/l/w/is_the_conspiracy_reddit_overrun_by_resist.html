<p>I was under the impression this Reddit was for &quot;free thinkers&quot;; ostensibly it is as long as your thinking is leftist.</p>

<p>I am, for the most part, a centrist. Centristic thinking anymore is not free thinking, it is, for all intent and purpose, inhibited by those with indefatigable thinking. Sadly, that is not free thinking at all, it is the constraining of logical thinking individuals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this post will receive the same lash back, but I wish you all Godspeed:) 
(and that post script is part of the problem also, atheist hate it:)</p>

Plus having a conspiratorial worldview in which white civilization is the constant victim of Jewish manipulation and control (sub in Zionist, Khazarian, &quot;not real Jews&quot; etc) is like point #2 in their general doctrine. </p>

<p>Suspicions of Zionist imperialism/critique of the Israeli state are different, there is a fine line but from what I&#39;ve seen, they exploit it every time. Now we&#39;re seeing straight up &quot;race realism&quot; posts appear here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t take everything in it literally.  Some parts of it are figurative (parables), some are literal.</p>

<p>Zion (Sion) is here on Earth, and another name for Jerusalem, where Israel is located.  Psalm 48 verse 1-2: &quot;Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, 2 beautiful in elevation,is the joy of all the earth,Mount Zion, in the far north,the city of the great King.&quot;</p>

<p>As well as Joel 2:32 &quot;And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of these passages are literal.</p>

<p>a good portion of that is tongue-in-cheek. a lot more of it is focused on Israelis and not jews in general. </p>

<p>there is, however, a hardcore group of supremacist goofs that talk a lot of shit about jews in general (along with other races), but there usually easy to spot and ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s as simple as looking at someone&#39;s Reddit comment history. I just ran into one who was a month old account with 9 pages of comments and not a single solitary one outside of this sub. And take a wild guess which political alignment they endorsed. That was just one of a handful this week alone. We could compile a list of these accounts and post them for everyone to see, but that would cause an utter shit storm and we&#39;d be called Nazis.</p>

This brand of anti-fascism/anarchy only burns shit down when conservatives come to town.  They hate large corporations &amp; the Orwellian government but you never see them upset at all those NSA/CIA companies located in their back yard.  The CEO of reddit has edited conservative users comments.  The plantation owners of this website are livid their creation/investment was used by conservatives to dissent against their ideology.  Which is why the quarantined T_D.  You cant claim most of your website majority liberals when a new sub like that attracts a large following in a short period of time then continously hits the front page of r/all so you keep adjusting your algorithm to prevent a free exchange of opinions &amp; ideas.</p>

<p>TL:DR - censorship is her to fuck us all.</p>

I blocked Bush&#39;s limo during his inauguration. I worked for Howard Dean&#39;s campaign in 2004. I am a strong supporter of environmental regulations. I believe abortion is a woman&#39;s choice.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I own a gun, support your right to be homophobic and despise Clinton and DNC for blatantly corrupting a system meant to represent us all. They failed us, crippled the party and caused severe if not permanent damage to the reputation of the American political process (and it wasn&#39;t spotless to begin with).  So I&#39;m suddenly an enemy persecuted by mindless drones with zero education, less dignity and a negative balance of independent thought all claiming to represent me on the echo chambers of their twitter feeds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only strengthened my resolve to see their architecture burn to the ground.</p>

<p>clinton, the DNC, the unresistance, the democrats, antifa, bernie sanders supporters who insist no matter how many times we correct them that socialism is not social capitalism/kenysianism/social democracy, and is infact antithetical to them, are all in the facist top-right quadrant of the political compass, right along with the people they hate. some may be closer to the x or y axis than others, but all are on the right. at best they are the near left, most are the vichy left (lead by bernie sanders), and at worst they are the false left (clinton et al).</p>

<p>as an anarchist, just as a heads up, black bloc are tactics not people. there is no such thing as a black bloc anarchist or any other type of person. any who say so bely their anarchism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak from my own experience.  I began using reddit about 20 months ago because news stories were being poorly covered and heavily censored from other sources.  The_D happened to be doing a bang up job in terms of covering non political and conspiratorial news.  Thus, I would be one of those &quot;good ol&#39; regular users&quot; that you insinuate is more elusive than supposed bots.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice the left side likes to mention CA (Cambridge Analytica) in the same breath as SB (ShareBlue) and its predecessor CTR (Correct the Record).</p>

<p>But nobody as far as I know claims that CA uses the same tactics as SB. Any solid info on that? Does CA hire people to disrupt anti-Trump discussions on reddit for instance? Does CA target specific discussion subjects and flood them with distracting, irrelevant, insulting and useless comments? I&#39;d love to be a fly on the wall.</p>

<p>What I have heard about CA tactics is this: They have AI political demographic software that can assist a campaign to deliver a politically charged message to exactly the intended victim/household. They are expert meme-instigators.</p>

<p>Pretty cool I guess. But it isn&#39;t like chewing up subreddits like this one for persistently following damaging leads into their paymaster&#39;s shady deals... </p>

<p>However, in the Hillary vs Trump election, those with graduate degrees were widely more likely to vote democratic and those with only partial college educations or less (this includes high school drop outs) were even more likely to be Republican.</p>

<p>Thus, you are statistically more likely to find more high school drop outs in T_D than in any of those subs. (And since those subs not only divide the anti_D groups but also suffer overlap, you will likely find more high school drop outs in T_D than all 50 of those subs altogether)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to weigh these claims alongside suggestions that high IQ people are not attracted to academia. Apparently within unversities, IQ results fall off a cliff around 128. This is surprising since a child with 130 and above would be considered in the gifted category and considered a prime candidate for uni. I imagine IQs in maths and physics streams would be higher than the general but they&#39;re probably not enough of them to drag up the average significantly. 
I&#39;m only thinking out loud here, but this may explain why many people who have gone through the uni system or know plenty of graduates are underwhelmed to hear they are mostly Democratic supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The smarter you are, the easier it is for mundane repetitious problems to bore you - like teaching kids following a syllabus. Like jumping through the same political hoops day in and day out. So much so that when someone jokes about job security in solving the same problem day after day after day, that you want to shoot them in the head because there are so many problems in the real world that having people MAINTAIN a status quo for a paycheck are just holding back progress, binding your ability to FIX things.</p>

<p>Some people get so stressed out they start vomiting every morning before they start work, and when they vomit up blood because of an ulcer, they quit.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t be surprised about the sudden drop off of people in academics with IQs past a certain point - they are sick of the shit and want to actually make a better world than the &quot;pink boys&quot; want to maintain, forever, for a paycheck.</p>

<p>these people mock those who care about any of those. they mock this sub for their being discussed here. they insist ridiculously that objections to discussing trumpgate is suspression, jesus fuck that is orwellian. they create a false equivalency with clintongate(s) posts--you can&#39;t discuss clintongate(s) everywhere and never could. in dact, you can discuss tgem almost no where. and unlike trumpgate, the media is silent on them. </p>

<p>those of us who point out any of this and object to trumpgate posts on the grounds it is an open, well publicized criminal investigation, thus in no need of illumination by us tin foil hatters, are downvoted by the dozens. am i to believe that r/conspiracy regulars have such hatred against those of us arguing for maintaining r/conspiracy as a safe space for discussions of the undiscussable?</p>

<p>disagreeing with trump, being offended by him, wanting him impeached, and being pissed off doesn&#39;t give one carte blanche to ruin a sub just because you petulantly insist on discussing it here, as opposed to the dozens of subs committed to discussing it. </p>

IIRC this was explicitly spelled out in the reddiquette--downvotes aren&#39;t meant for disagreement, they are meant for shitposting and trolling. reddit used to be beautiful, until john stewart and steven colbert ruined it when they outted it and all of the youtube, tweeters, and facebook assholes flooded the site.</p>

<p>you didn&#39;t used to need to navigate subs to learn something new and have great discussions on every topic under the sun, you just had to peruse the front page. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t downvote. i upvote solely for visibility and as solidarity for those being downvoted to hell who are contributing substantively, whether i agree with them or not.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t care about clinton, despite she and all around her reek of corrupt, undemocratic, cronyism conspiracies. it&#39;s a sisyphian obsession, and boring at this point. i don&#39;t read those posts and wish there were less, but at least they do involve discussions of the undiscussable. my wish is that a clinton conspiracy sub could be created for them. that alone would draw away the trumpfate (s).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. But let&#39;s drill down a bit:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The subject-of-the-conspiracy is the US Government and allies, as in most versions of 9-11. Said conspirator produces a laughable report (9-11 Commission) and then sits silent. Conspiracy proved by massive research and analysis by independent researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>The subject-of-the-conspiracy is elements of the US Government, the Mob, Castro, and Russian double-agents as in JFK assassination. Said conspirators produce a highly suspect report (Warren) and then sits silent. Conspiracy proved by massive research and analysis by independent researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>The subject-of-the-conspiracy is the US Government as in the suspicion that the government knows certain facts about UFO&#39;s and aliens that it does not tell it&#39;s citizens. Said government produces a highly misleading report (Bluebook) and then sits silent for 30 years. Conspiracy proved by massive research and analysis by independent researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>The subject-of-the-conspiracy is one particular political party of the USA political system, as in gross mismanagement, possible high crimes and misdemeanors, being covered up so the party leaders do not have to explain their actions and become subject to consequences. Said conspirators organize and unleash a massive campaign to out-shout and out-comment everyone who is interested in pursuing leads and confirming or denying any such illegal activities. Conspiracy proved by excessive backlash.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I wish that last one would just write a silly report and sit silent! Then we could get on with a massive research and analysis by independent researchers. </p>

<p>Any idea why this particular conspirator can NOT just write a silly report and sit silent? They don&#39;t have that option. Public opinion actually matters in this last case. Whatever was going on in the others, public opinion did not matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL like this post. Doubtless I&#39;ll get downvoted for pointing this out. To be more pointed: the top comment states &quot;by obviously shilling to attempt to control the narrative they make the core free thinkers despise them even more&quot; but I think it&#39;s clear to a lot of people that what <em>you</em> think is an &quot;obvious shill attempt to control the narrative&quot; is not going to be the same as what <em>I</em> think it is, and likewise different people will perceive &quot;free thinkers&quot; differently.</p>

<p>Basically, the poster here is implying that anyone who pushes back against wild accusations when they happen to be against &quot;the left&quot; is a frustrating shill getting in the way and the top comment agrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you have to understand that this sub is suffering from BOTH
shareblue shills (fake left shills) AND T_D extreme right wing trolls/shills/idiots (not saying ALL of them are like that, but there are some REALLY bad eggs
freshly brainwashed and flooding here from there).
T_D is a zionist anti-left proud echo chamber so it&#39;s literally brainwashing people and I&#39;m not ok with that.
Someone there told me that dissenters are banned because it&#39;s a 24/7 rally for Trump fans
especially as they&#39;re scared other subs will demonize them for being Trump fans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sympathetic to that view but it&#39;s still an echo chamber and encourages hate against &quot;leftists&quot;,
and extremely zionist. So it&#39;s pretty hypocritical and dangerous.
I speculate that there are some powerful people as mods there
otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be pushing pro-war, pro-divide/conquer, anti-left stuff like that
and they wouldn&#39;t ban people for the smallest of reasons possible
like questioning Trump (even in a completely innocent manner).</p>

<p>People have to understand that they&#39;re going to be criticized for
spouting divide/conquer stuff, e.g.
I see some T_D followers come here and say hateful shit like
&quot;ITS THE LEFT&#39;S FAULT&quot; or &quot;THE LIBERAL DEEP STATE&quot;
which are both incorrect and push divide/conquer, angering EVERYONE.
Some might be shills trying to screw this sub up
and some are probably idiot shitbags that deserve a good heckling.
But they&#39;re a BAD influence on other Trump fans (the more moderate/reasonable ones for example) and people in general in this sub.</p>

<p>A while ago, people were saying &quot;AW MAN, this sub has turned into T_D 2.0&quot;
and I thought &quot;nah we can redpill T_D people, the more the merrier,!!&quot;
and wanted to welcome them with open arms
but I&#39;ve changed my mind since because too many T_D people
are coming here to shit on all leftists and fake leftists and that&#39;s NOT OK.
Especially as my research suggests left center and centrist policies are
pro-people/anti-establishment, NOT far right crap as that&#39;s what
the establishment thrives under (e.g. full deregulation, NEOliberal economics, anti-welfare for the people, 
pro-corporate welfare, etc. are far right economic concepts that favor the establishment).</p>

<p>Hope you understand what I&#39;m saying.
Apparently there was a coup on the mods,
and some shills claimed it was full of &quot;lib shills&quot; or &quot;shareblue shills&quot;
in order to diguise the T_D coup (when actually I believe
both are brigading /conspiracy but I believe some T_D bad eggs are brigading much harder).</p>

<p>Everyone should be critical of both Trump/Clinton, they&#39;re two
sides of the same corporate coin IMO. Neither are left wing. The corporate media is full of shit.
Lumping Bernie types and Clinton types into one box called
&quot;the left&quot; or &quot;the libs&quot; is not correct and shills/trolls keep doing it
to enrage people.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply.
Just to clarify, there is no dominant left wing or centrist force
in mainstream U.S. politics (Bernie got rigged against and he was almost centrist, Jill Stein/Green party had little/no media coverage and barred from the debates)
and the truth is that the GOP/DNC are just two flavors of
far right corporate economics (NEOliberalism) and authoritarian warmonger foreign polic (NEOconservativism).</p>

<p>I personally thought he was controlled for at least a year, maybe even a decade
but you could also be correct in that he may have had some anti-establishment
bones in his body before finding the murderous deep state in his office.
There were signs (such as zionism, flip flopping even in the primaries, using scapegoats rather
than actual political points, behaving like a lying/deceptive wild card, etc.)
to suggest that Trump was already controlled at that early point but who really knows
since the world isn&#39;t black and white.
Maybe he was innocently pro-Israel but not to an insane level
until they twisted his arm on his first day or something.</p>

<p>I wanted Trump to introduce universal healthcare and get
people to see that we need to improve the socialism-capitalism ratio of
mixed economics and go centrist but sadly either Trump 
was already compromized or became compromized due to the deep state.</p>

<p>I appreciate your polite reply bro.
Do you know where I can find a clip of Trump&#39;s face
after he spoke to Obama?
Asking so I can analyze it myself,
it reminds me of when Bernie was forced to endorse Clinton,
his face said it all (and there were rumors around the same time that
he was probably punched in the face as he had a mark on his cheek).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was a speech of some sort.
Anyway, I&#39;ve had one Mandela Effect flip flop.
The Apollo 13 movie used to have Tom Hanks saying
&quot;Houston we HAVE a problem&quot; and then it changed to
&quot;Houston we&#39;ve had a problem&quot; and then changed back to HAVE.
I&#39;m not talking about the NASA mission, I mean the movie.
And I even watched a YouTube video where a guy
showed his DVD of it and said &quot;yesterday&quot; it was X and today it&#39;s Y.
So I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure of the flip flop (memory can be fuzzy like that)
but I also remember an alternate filming angle when it was &quot;we&#39;ve HAD&quot; and others reported the same thing. Either quantum/parallel universes stuff might be legit or our memory has gotten really bad from everyday toxins or something lol.
Still, it&#39;s fun to entertain, even if it might not be a real phenomenon. I&#39;m open minded to it, personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah could be microwave radiation (cell phone towers and stuff?)
affecting the brain&#39;s memory/processing functions.
Maybe sleep deprivation and other factors amplify it so perhaps that&#39;s why different people experience it at different times.
The Apollo 13 flip flop for example happens to people at different months lol.
I prefer the parallel universes theory (more fun)
but I consider all possibilities and the one you posted is an interesting one.
I used to suggest that wifi (type of radio wave frequency I think?) and stuff are causing it but
it could also be affected by microwave radiation, toxins, stressful lifestyle of a 9-5 job, etc.</p>

<p>But damn, wasn&#39;t it &quot;the lamb lies with the lion&quot;
not the wolf??
I&#39;m considering all possibilities though.
No one&#39;s really sure of what definitely causes the ME effect.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#39;s a guy on this sub</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/</a></p>

<p>who says corporations have targetted microwave radiation at him
and that he&#39;s definitely not insane or anything like that.
He seems convincing as he even speaks about the biochemistry difference between
someone who is suffering from schizo/other mental illnesses VS microwave torture from
some malicious entities. We live in a screwed up world man.
I think the dude went after corporations like Amazon and now there&#39;s retaliation.
Some interesting stuff like documents and radiation shielding info
in his post history.</p>

If anything Harvey has taught us, is that people are inherently good.  Only when throwing in politics does it become my vs your side.  I think part of the problem is that the left is looking whiney and nitpicky, while the right just keeps driving the wedge.  Instead of the rational seeing it for what it is.

1. I&#39;m trying to keep my Facebook a little less political

It had gotten so bad I felt compelled to be more active here, because as a liberal fan of conspiracy theories I got tired predominately seeing liberal theories and liberal skepticism maligned. </p>

So you&#39;d expect them on the frontpage everyday, same as with pics and whatever. I understand that is annoying and I agree with implenting certain controls on that.

<p>Sorry, but I don&#39;t believe it for a second.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of evidence that t_D is botting. I&#39;ve seen their mods get caught samefagging multiple times. And I&#39;ve seen them fail to get 100K signatures on Whitehouse.gov petitions in spite of pinning them to their front page and in spite of the fact that they supposedly have over 6 million subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are rather conspiratorial explanations for the petitions. The site was created and presumably maintained by a firm (Blue Digital) handling the IT business of George Soros. This has changed I think because we now get one petition after another. I&#39;ve watched myself hundreds of signatures disappearing in the span of a few minutes before that. Not that we didn&#39;t manage to fill them back when we only had a 100k subs, but that suddenly changed. I never agreed with most of those petitions and didn&#39;t sign them so that should be considered as well. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have 6 million subs but it should be around 1.5million. What we do have is site activity, which you can look at somewhere, we&#39;re only behind askreddit I think. I really don&#39;t think we use bots at all. The upvote patterns are just different, they seem organic. If you look at the opposition the will get a steady stream of upvotes irrespective of how many people are online at any given time. That doesn&#39;t happen at all on T_D. They also time their stuff to reach maximum exposure, if they&#39;re not reacting to some emergency.</p>

<p>Of course I can&#39;t be certain with T_D but I never noticed anything strange. I&#39;ve never seen the duplicate stickies either but I believe you here. Then again we do have a lot of mods, not sure they&#39;re always talking to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have left wing views, but since I am not pro establishment, I get lumped in with the label they try to brand everyone as. The number of times, I have been called a Nazi Trump supporter is absurd. Realize that millenials are the major representation of reddit, by a large volume. They are the most anti establishment demographic, weather they lean left or right. Pro establishment politics being the majority is very suspicious on its own, just by the data. When you add that to the mix with all the direct observations. It becomes difficult to ignore once you see the same patterns again and again. For many this isn&#39;t their first rodeo.

<p>So what&#39;s being overrun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two variables here.</p>

<p>First, there are threads being created. These are largely based on some sort of source, so you need to have something to work with in order to push them and make them seem important. In this context, you are right - there is not an overabundance of posts pushing far-left thinking at the moment, but that might be more a function of not having much to work with in terms of the news cycle.</p>

<p>The second variable is the voting and comment patterns. I think this is where much of the &#39;overrun&#39; is happening... all it takes is a small team of users that use technology to their advantage to manipulate opinion. Go into the threads you mention and see where the energy is being put in. If all these people are spending so much time throwing shade in these comment threads, why aren&#39;t they posting anything themselves? Do they have anything to post? Or do they take advantage of exactly what you bring up and use that to make themselves into victims while they still drive the discourse in comments?</p>

<p>I think you are valuing the two aspects in the wrong order. Comments are what really matter, not posts. Even the shills want certain posts to get upvotes if they control the comment narrative once people get in.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t manipulating posts be easier than manipulating comments? It&#39;s easier to comment than post, but it&#39;s also easier to vote on posts than to manipulate comment scores, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>That was what was always so confusing to me. Upvoting a thread is way easier than upvoting specific comments. </p>

<p>Also, no one has ever made it clear how they can tell the difference between an organic opinion that disagrees with their belief system, and something that&#39;s been &#39;shilled&#39; to the top. </p>

<p>If you control the comments, you want the post to be popular regardless of it&#39;s content.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course, but controlling the narrative on a popular topic is the goal. You don&#39;t want to capture &#39;fake attention&#39;, you want to steer actual curiosity into the right directions (according to your priorities). So they do both - they care less about thread upvotes, and instead try to control narratives. Even if a topic is popular, if they control the comment narrative, they are doing their job.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why do you feel that something like that would be &#39;clear&#39;? It&#39;s manipulation and it&#39;s deception - of course it isn&#39;t &#39;clear&#39;. I think you are asking for impossible things. You have to decide for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that shit is real. They changed tactics, but up until a month or two back, i get instant downvotes, i am talking several. And then standard approach to argument destruction. Instead of focusing on answering my Qs, they are much more interested in trying to destroy my argument by destroy parts of it. Some even make up their own strawmen. Then a few weeks would pass, and I get my votes back? Basically my comment karma rises. I was confused by this and then I checked. Most of the comments that were from this type of discussions pretty much had minimal downvotes (the sheeple effect, where users tend to vote based on current karma standing of content, so like -7 votes down to -22, and then come back to check its like -2...I am guessing accounts were deleted. Some even had gone positive....</p>

<p>I just enjoy the arguments, so I continue until they give up. I just find it hilarious that I got insta downvoted, and then get the votes back. </p>

Have received inbox replies from them here.  It may have been a tactic used by legit anarchists that arent dumbfucks but even anarchists groups get infiltrated by democrats to promote neoliberal agendas &amp; are really good at subtly using anarchist movements to protest things like oil pipelines for environmental issues which benefit neoliberals like Warren Buffett.</p>
