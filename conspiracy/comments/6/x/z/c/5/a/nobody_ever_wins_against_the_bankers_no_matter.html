        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is something much more sinister going on behind the curtain. I have warned that you really are taking your life in your hands doing business in New York City with a bank because NOBODY ever wins against the bankers no matter what they do. This begs the question about why are banks paying huge fines, yet nobody goes to jail, and there is never a trial while class action suits are summarily dismissed? </p>

<p>An inside source coming from a lawyer who worked internally at a bank, explained that the New York Attorney General simply walks into his office and informs them they will hand over $1.2 billion in fines and he does not care about defenses or the rule of law. It is plain criminal extortion.  The bankers pay these fines because they cannot afford to go to trial and lose for then class action lawsuits from depositors and shareholders will bury the institution. So the judges are in on the scam and class action lawsuits are dismissed with absurd reasoning and the government makes billions in the process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Soviets rebuilt the concentration camps, they think that they were not concentration camps at all but was an elaborate plan to paint the Germans in a horrible light. It gave them fuel for propaganda for years. Essentially saying the concentration camps were fake and never existed as extermination camps all along. They have apparently analyzed many photos and notice a lot of chimney stacks that don&#39;t connect to the buildings (or anything). They also claim is was a plan for the Bilderburgh group, Rothschilds, and others to take control over it. They used the concentration camps to cover up the fact that they had alien tech and their own currency owned by the people instead of the big banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, there are too many to come down on. But I wouldnt be surprised if the fbi keeps files on them. The reason is that the US has a history of antagonism against autonomy. An example is in latin america when the cia overthrew democratically elected governments in order to keep them as pliant client states. Arguably, homesteading has the potential to be a bigger headache for them because its on US soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be true but its worth the risk IMO. You just have to have the mindset that its perfectly natural and that it is our imperative to go off the grid. Just look at all the tsunamis, hurricanes, and wildfires going on right now. This is only going to get worse in the coming decades. Some say because Planet X is getting closer to passing through the solar system, others say because of changes to the sun due to us passing through a large cloud. Others say because of manmade climate change. All I know is we can&#39;t count on the government to accurately inform us of the incoming difficulties, but it is clear given every major prophecy points to this century being the time when &quot;shit hits the fan&quot; and if we aren&#39;t prepared most of us will die. We cannot rely on the grid because it will fail and at that point it will be too late for most of us. I mean, look at all the rich people building underground bunkers. If they are preparing that now, we have to be preparing too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what would they do if we started a religion worshipping our own death and praising our murderers as heroes for sending us to heaven.</p>

<p>and then instead of being crazy islamists, we just overrode the bank by replacing currency without their consent, disavowed the legal government, and got at least 40% of the military and police on our side.</p>

<p>then each time someone died we just threw huge parties and instead of adding in more laws to protect ourselves, just take AWAY laws and make sure we were even in more danger?</p>

<p>I kinda feel if it was possible to do, that sort of reverse psychology would be unbeatable</p>
