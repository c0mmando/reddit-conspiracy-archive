       Im not the original author of the comment below(just to clarify) but it lays everything out well enough to end this stupid "wheres the proof" argument.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sources said the email occurred in June 2016 around the time of the recently revealed Trump Tower meeting where Russians with Kremlin ties met with the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

       <p>
        Dearborn was involved in helping to arrange an April 2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel where Trump delivered a major foreign policy address
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And things get more interesting.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Putin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right," Papadopoulos wrote in an email on April 27 to then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, according to the Post. On that same day, Trump delivered his foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And even more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just puzzle pieces, and the pattern isn't that hard to see.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        CNN has reported that the FBI saw intelligence last summer suggesting that Russian operatives tried to use Trump advisers to infiltrate the campaign. Sources said this intelligence referenced foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Page denies ever working for Russia or having any improper contact with Russians. Sessions led the campaign's foreign policy team, which included Page and Papadopoulos. CNN reported in May that congressional investigators were examining whether Sessions attended a third private meeting with Kislyak, at the Mayflower event that Dearborn apparently helped plan. During the speech, Trump said that "an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength, is possible." Kislyak watched from his seat in the front row
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A lot to parse in this article so lets sort of summarize where we are at so people can see how ridiculous this has gotten. So Russia gets in contact Trump campaign through almost every key individual in the Trump campaign. Page, Kushner, Flynn, Trump Jr, Manafort, Sessions, Prince, Papadopoulos, Stone and now Dearborn. This serves as a means to see where the campaign is vulnerable, who is willing, but also serves as its own Kompromat. Every meeting you don't expose, or everything you talk about in private can be used against you. This was the same concern IC had with Flynn for example speaking with Kislyak. So we have secret Russia communications in numerous instances that weren't reported until team Trump had no choice due to subpoena's or investigations or journalism. All of which were focused around better relations with Russia in one form or another, all while Russia was hacking Trump's opponents and spreading propaganda to help swing the election. Trump Jr takes a meeting promising dirt, Stone gets messaged by a Russian cutout about incoming dirt. Russia was also actively trying to get dirt to Flynn, as well as talking to a GOP operative who listed Trump campaign officials in his efforts. None of this is initially disclosed. Kislyak speaks with Kushner, Flynn and Sessions, none of those meetings are initially disclosed. Dearborn and Papadopoulous both try to arrange meetings with Putin. Kushner tries to setup a back-channel with Putin using Russia's own hardware. None of this is initially disclosed. Prince also tries to setup a back-channel. Flynn, Cohen, Page, Sater, Trump Jr all directly tied up in meetings and conversations related to Sanctions on Russia. None of which were disclosed. And they still want to pretend like Trump didn't know about any of this, while literally every single person in his campaign seems to have had communications with Russia figures 1 or 2 hops away from Putin the entire time. All while being literally right in the middle of it. At Trump tower the same day as the Don Jr meeting, tweets about missing emails. At the Mayflower as arranged, setting up a pro-Russia relations speech. At the RNC weakening Ukraine policy. But he's doing it of his own accord right? Just a coincidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       The source is someone within or close to the Congressional investigators that came across the email from Trumps deputy chief of staff. The email happened in June '16, Obama being president at the time has nothing to do with anything. You won't respond because you have none and don't have room to lie or spin things.

       We already know nearly every politician is bought and paid for by all sorts of foreign governments and multinational corporations. This is not a huge conspiracy this is publicly available information.

       Why limit yourself to Russia when they’re economically a drop in the bucket compared to ME nations and Corporate ownership of both parties?

       You have a post on the front page saying don't let the media divide us...but I see so many posts from you that are purposefully trying to divide people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of your posts contain titles with phrases like "my strong conservative values" or "as a conservative"

       Here is something I was able to verify.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here is the deed for Manafort's condo at 721 Fifth Avenue, which was purchased in 2006 for $3.675 million in cash using John Hannah LLC(controlled by Manafort). During the same time period, Manafort was being paid $10 million a year to advance the interests of Putin through the Russian Aluminum magnate, Oleg Deripaska. Also at the same time, Manafort was being paid for assisting the Party of Regions in the previous Ukrainian election by Rinat Akhmetov.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to launder the money paid from these sources, Manafort would obtain mortgages on properties he paid in cash, but he would take out the mortgages in either his name, or more often, he would take them out in his daughter's or his wife's names.
       </p>

       I can get you more property transaction records if you want to get an even more detailed picture of the crimes Manafort is going to be charged with.

       I honestly wouldn't go saying Putin is anyway affiliated with Trump, but who knows for certain... Only them.  Then again I don't live in Russia, maybe he did pledge his life to Lucifer.

       The evidence?  How about how Congress has refused to investigate the Trump Campaign.

       Proof isn't stupid whats stupid is the people intentionally ignoring the countless red flags that something fucked up is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The source is someone within or close to the Congressional investigators that came across the email from Trumps deputy chief of staff. The email happened in June '16, Obama being president at the time has nothing to do with anything. You won't respond because you have none and don't have room to lie or spin things.
