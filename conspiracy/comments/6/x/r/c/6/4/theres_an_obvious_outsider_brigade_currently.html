<p>I should have.paid better attention, didn&#39;t realize the post was third from the top on our front page.</p>

<p>It still stands that Snopes is a piece of shit propaganda outlet, but I am the ass this time.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t explain what I see most often, though, which is people rejecting something Snopes says out of hand as if it&#39;s totally non-credible. If the problem with Snopes is that they don&#39;t address every myth, that&#39;s not a basis for rejecting the writeups they do create. Especially if it&#39;s so hard to find errors in those writeups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But when people post articles about issues that were debunked debunked by snopes here, that isn&#39;t an issue, is it?</p>

<p>I think many people here try to dismiss any sources disproving their theory. And since snopes does nothing else than disproving stuff, dismissing snopes outright is very valuable to people spreading bullshit. In my opinion dismissing entire sources (and commenters as shills btw) is far worse when the goal is actual free thinking.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people calling themselves scepticle here are only scepticle against &quot;main stream beliefs&quot; and not when it comes to their own beliefs.</p>

<p>And in the piece you quote, she&#39;s showing that the Snopes people went back and corrected some mistakes. She&#39;s livid that they criticize her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to have much to say when it comes to actual mistakes Snopes made. When her snippets go from &quot;before&quot; to &quot;after,&quot; it looks like the &quot;after&quot; blocks have more detail and are more accurate. </p>

<p>Yeah, it takes work to make a solid point sometimes. If the work is too difficult or can&#39;t be done, that doesn&#39;t justify jumping to the conclusion without it. The work might be hard because the conclusion is wrong, after all. </p>

<p>In other words, one reason why people can&#39;t point out mistakes Snopes makes might be that Snopes is pretty accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is one:
Here is a snopes article that is responding to a Post headline stating that Clinton wore a $12,000 Armani jacket. This particular issue is not really that controversial and should have resulted in a mostly true rating and if it had been about the Trump family (or any Republican), it would have been. However, they give it a mostly false rating.
The snopes piece states &quot;it is unclear whether she purchased it or whether she was loaned the item.
The only part that was a fair rebuke was rebutting the claim that she wore the jacket while giving a speech about income inequality. The speech barely touched upon the subject.
At the very end they go so far as to compare it to an article that pointed out that Ivanka wore a $158 dress but add that Melania wore a $2k dress. That was a pointless addition and literally added to attack the Trump&#39;s.
This particular rating should have been mostly true and only added that the speech was not about income inequality. It&#39;s such a stupid thing to do mental gymnastics over and really goes to show how partisan they are.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your points here--fair to say it wasn&#39;t worn during a speech on income inequality, and the rest is nitpicking. No falsehoods, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply because it is, Zhu Yu is a well known artist and did this stunt as part of an art show. Just do a small amount of poking around and you can find a ton of info on this. Here&#39;s a quote from him, </p>

<p>“I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” he said.</p>

<p>“No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it” Zhu stated in response to the public reactions.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu also claimed in interviews that he used real aborted fetuses stolen from a medical school to create the piece and that he actually cooked and ate the fetuses for art’s sake</p>

<p>He also admitted that the meat obtained from the bodies tasted bad, and said he had vomited several times while eating it</p>

<p>I didnt mean for those parts to be bolded I just copy pasted from the article. But, yea, take a look through some pics of the stunt and tell me thats a dolls head on a duck carcass lol. This one is brought up frequently among those who love to diss on Snopes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Snopes points out that he claimed to be eating a baby. And why that claim is probably not true, including the fact that it was investigated by LEOs. (Not to mention, between &quot;artist claims he was eating babies to be shocking&quot; and &quot;artist actually eats babies to be shocking, even though he&#39;d get the same effect without actually stealing corpses,&quot; one&#39;s a lot more likely to be true than the other.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started liking Snopes from back when they were the only site in the early oughts that would publish something about the possibly fixed voting machines that put Bush in office. I think they put voting software on their site when no American site would. So I still have positive feelings about them. Though I realize the CIA and plutocracy want them destroyed and with conspiracy full of shills, I&#39;m just reverting to the old desire to see them protected.</p>

<p>In 2003, she discovered the source code of voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems, which changed its name in 2006 to Premier Election Solutions.</p>

<p>After examining these files, Harris wrote an article on July 8, 2003 detailing how to bypass passwords and manipulate election results on the Diebold GEMS central tally system.[1] The information in Harris&#39;s article was subsequently confirmed by internal memos written by Diebold&#39;s own engineers.[2]</p>

<p>Researchers at Rice University and Johns Hopkins University also studied the programs she obtained and found security weaknesses that afforded opportunities for abuse[3] Diebold officials and state election officials disputed the findings of the Rice and Johns Hopkins researchers. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Harris">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Harris</a></p>
