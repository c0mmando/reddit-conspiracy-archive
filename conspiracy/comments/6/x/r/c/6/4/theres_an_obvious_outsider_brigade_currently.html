       Edit: I apologise. My head was up my ass and I want to take responsibility for it.  I was reminded that with enough upvotes, posts here go to
       <a href="/r/all">

       and we get flooded with regular people that aren't brigading, just redirected here.

       I should have.paid better attention, didn't realize the post was third from the top on our front page.

       It still stands that Snopes is a piece of shit propaganda outlet, but I am the ass this time.

       it gets hopped on my a bunch of outsiders just looking to argue... "new" queue is where this sub is at it's most legit... and shittiest at the same time cause ya have to look at all the failed attempts at starting shit.

       NP... I spent a lot of time on this sub, but only visit "hot" maybe 2 times a day and then 90% of the time I just skim the headlines and upvote counts... "hot" usually has topics with like 13 innocuous comments or like 600 comments consisting of lost normies throwing down with the whole gamut of conspiracy theorists... ranging from "woke" to "interdimensional reptilian psychic alien vampires control the NWO simulation multiverse".

       I think you missed the point: once shit hits the top, bots come in and fabricate the image to the straggler normies that come in. Remember, appealing to bandwagon psychology is where it's at.

       Yeah... as soon as I have to explain the same thing to someone for the second time... I start getting suspicious. People often disagree with me, but they usually totally understand what I'm trying to say... until we hit "hot"... then it is time for the short-bus.

       I get the complaining about their spin on some explanations, and I do think it's a liberal perspective. But when they say X happened or Y didn't happen, do they actually get those facts wrong? When?

       I've found that most often the way fact checkers manipulate truth is by carefully choosing claims to fact check.

      <p>
       They just tend to check facts which will help to further their narrative.

       I can see that. Hard to measure, but I don't doubt that it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't explain what I see most often, though, which is people rejecting something Snopes says out of hand as if it's totally non-credible. If the problem with Snopes is that they don't address every myth, that's not a basis for rejecting the writeups they do create. Especially if it's so hard to find errors in those writeups.

       Unless the fact is being discussed because, indirectly, snopes is intentionally hyping the issue by "fact checking" it.

       But when people post articles about issues that were debunked debunked by snopes here, that isn't an issue, is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think many people here try to dismiss any sources disproving their theory. And since snopes does nothing else than disproving stuff, dismissing snopes outright is very valuable to people spreading bullshit. In my opinion dismissing entire sources (and commenters as shills btw) is far worse when the goal is actual free thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of people calling themselves scepticle here are only scepticle against "main stream beliefs" and not when it comes to their own beliefs.

       So Snopes is bad because of conflicts of interest, etc., but Food Babe is an acceptable source? Seriously? Food Babe actively sells products based on the fear and loathing she gins up about "chemicals."
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the piece you quote, she's showing that the Snopes people went back and corrected some mistakes. She's livid that they criticize her, but she doesn't seem to have much to say when it comes to actual mistakes Snopes made. When her snippets go from "before" to "after," it looks like the "after" blocks have more detail and are more accurate.

       That's a legitimate error on Snopes' part, although that piece also points out there are "dozens" of examples of people making the claim they assumed the Trumper they quoted was making.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the claim they said was false was actually false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still not an example of Snopes inaccurately claiming something true was false, or vice versa.

       Is the alternative to not do the work to discredit Snopes, and just assume that they aren't credible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, it takes work to make a solid point sometimes. If the work is too difficult or can't be done, that doesn't justify jumping to the conclusion without it. The work might be hard because the conclusion is wrong, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, one reason why people can't point out mistakes Snopes makes might be that Snopes is pretty accurate.

       here is one:
Here is a snopes article that is responding to a Post headline stating that Clinton wore a $12,000 Armani jacket. This particular issue is not really that controversial and should have resulted in a mostly true rating and if it had been about the Trump family (or any Republican), it would have been. However, they give it a mostly false rating.
The snopes piece states "it is unclear whether she purchased it or whether she was loaned the item.
The only part that was a fair rebuke was rebutting the claim that she wore the jacket while giving a speech about income inequality. The speech barely touched upon the subject.
At the very end they go so far as to compare it to an article that pointed out that Ivanka wore a $158 dress but add that Melania wore a $2k dress. That was a pointless addition and literally added to attack the Trump's.
This particular rating should have been mostly true and only added that the speech was not about income inequality. It's such a stupid thing to do mental gymnastics over and really goes to show how partisan they are.

       Simply because it is, Zhu Yu is a well known artist and did this stunt as part of an art show. Just do a small amount of poking around and you can find a ton of info on this. Here's a quote from him,
      </p>
      <p>
       “I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it” Zhu stated in response to the public reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Yu also claimed in interviews that he used real aborted fetuses stolen from a medical school to create the piece and that he actually cooked and ate the fetuses for art’s sake
      </p>
      <p>
       He also admitted that the meat obtained from the bodies tasted bad, and said he had vomited several times while eating it
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt mean for those parts to be bolded I just copy pasted from the article. But, yea, take a look through some pics of the stunt and tell me thats a dolls head on a duck carcass lol. This one is brought up frequently among those who love to diss on Snopes.

       Yeah, Snopes points out that he claimed to be eating a baby. And why that claim is probably not true, including the fact that it was investigated by LEOs. (Not to mention, between "artist claims he was eating babies to be shocking" and "artist actually eats babies to be shocking, even though he'd get the same effect without actually stealing corpses," one's a lot more likely to be true than the other.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want. I'm not going to assume Snopes is wrong here just because you want to believe the claim and declare it's true "simply because it is."

       Snopes used two shitty pictures which didn't show any close up detail. Why didn't they link the entire album? Snopes wants you to look at two pictures, I want you to look at all of them. Or should we just take what they say as fact and disregard all other evidence?

       Snopes is alright for things like seeing if that guy really did blow off his nuts with an M80, not so great for things like 9/11 or other political stuff

       I started liking Snopes from back when they were the only site in the early oughts that would publish something about the possibly fixed voting machines that put Bush in office. I think they put voting software on their site when no American site would. So I still have positive feelings about them. Though I realize the CIA and plutocracy want them destroyed and with conspiracy full of shills, I'm just reverting to the old desire to see them protected.

        In 2003, she discovered the source code of voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems, which changed its name in 2006 to Premier Election Solutions.

        After examining these files, Harris wrote an article on July 8, 2003 detailing how to bypass passwords and manipulate election results on the Diebold GEMS central tally system.[1] The information in Harris's article was subsequently confirmed by internal memos written by Diebold's own engineers.[2]

       <p>
        Researchers at Rice University and Johns Hopkins University also studied the programs she obtained and found security weaknesses that afforded opportunities for abuse[3] Diebold officials and state election officials disputed the findings of the Rice and Johns Hopkins researchers.

       Yeah, Snopes points out that he claimed to be eating a baby. And why that claim is probably not true, including the fact that it was investigated by LEOs. (Not to mention, between "artist claims he was eating babies to be shocking" and "artist actually eats babies to be shocking, even though he'd get the same effect without actually stealing corpses," one's a lot more likely to be true than the other.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want. I'm not going to assume Snopes is wrong here just because you want to believe the claim and declare it's true "simply because it is."
