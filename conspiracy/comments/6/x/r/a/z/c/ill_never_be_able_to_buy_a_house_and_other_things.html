    <div class="md"><p>My great-grandfather built a house for his family of wife and nine kids. They lived in an uninsulated chicken coop on the lot for the two years it took for him to gather materials, prep the site, and build it. </p>

<p>He traveled about 150 miles north to where they were tearing down an old train station, got the building materials from there, brought them back to his property and built the house by hand. At the time, they were moving the governor&#39;s mansion one town over in the state capital, so he ended up reusing many of the old fixtures (doors and knobs, a chandelier my grandmother inherited and hated to clean, stair railings, other light fixtures, so on). This was in the 1920s.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, the Federal Highway Commission and eminent domain put an interstate forty feet from what had become my grandfather&#39;s inherited master bedroom. My dad was born in that house about five years prior. They continued to live there despite the noise and pollution until they sold in the late 1990s. Preliminary plans to add a lane and a noise wall to the highway and demolish the house were being made, and they got out while the getting was &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>I often wonder to what extent the dissolution of the family unit and wealth-drain from the middle class is just haphazard or random. Some people have the knack for being in the right place at the right time, and others, well, just the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Middle Class of the US specifically has been undermined and degraded from the trade and monetary policies of the last 40 years. My Grandfather served in WW2, then came home and worked in a Steel Mill for 28 years, and retired with a pension. He took the lump sum, which was a good thing. By the time he retired in 1984, de-industrialization was already hitting the US heartland hard. His neighbor, who worked in the same mill for 28 years as well, took the annuity pension, and lost everything 3 years later when the mill went bankrupt and shut its furnace down- there was nothing left in the pension funds. This same thing has played out time and again for the last 40 years. It is intentional. No longer can a Middle Class family be supported by a single earner. Hell, even 2 parents working full time struggle to make ends meet in 21st century America. What remains of the Middle Class is severely over leveraged, in debt either with the mortgage and houses worth less in reality than on paper, with credit card and auto debt, and so on. Millennials have been fucked, <em>HARD</em>. These same opportunities no longer exist for us. Rent AND Housing prices are up 6.5% year over year, <em>nationally</em>. Inflation on food and goods are up as well. Wages barely rise above 2% a year, while inflation hovers at 2%, effectively negating any gains the middle and working classes achieve. The whole situation is fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying the Middle Class isn&#39;t in a position like it once was. It is fake affluence, built on debt, over leveraged and on the precipice of collapse. The opportunities that once existed no longer do. Inflation is up, wages are stagnant, incomes are the same, when adjusted for inflation, as they were 40 fucking years ago. We&#39;re stuck. US household debt is actually higher now than in 2008. When the next crisis comes- and it will be sooner rather than later- the whole facade will come tumbling down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The new way to become successful relies on either networking or entrepreneurship. Either learn a skill or trade, tweak it and &quot;modernize&quot; it to make yourself money. A good way to do this is to learn a programming language or two and create yourself either a browser based game and/or a smartphone app. Cue in-game transactions and micro-transactions, suddenly people are wasting precious cash to get up to the next level in stupid kingdom DX.</p>

<p>That or capitalize on the increasing collector&#39;s market and start hitting the dollar store or browsing Ebay and Amazon. Buy up booster packs on the cheap, buy up some card sleeves and some curator gloves (white cotton gloves used to handle things) and start researching the price of each card/item you unpack. Hit up rummage sales and Craig&#39;s list to buy up collections of people or see if you spot some cheap junk gold and/or silver to sell to a coin shop.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat, keep so much aside for taxes, some set in savings, a few bucks for &quot;fun&quot; and the rest to further increase your stock. Keep it up and you&#39;ll see develop a buyer&#39;s base who&#39;ll &quot;trust&quot; you for how prompt and safe you send their orders.</p>

<p>Finally, another way to increase your own wealth is to simply find a need and  fill it. If people are losing french fries to their fat folds... create a fry catcher. Simply put: Don&#39;t drown in the abyss, go out and create something worth money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We helped a collector blogger not that long ago, they gave us some advice on the &quot;hustle&quot; and how comics are dead for now but you can buy up stock in them quite nicely due to people selling them cheap. The new big ticket items or high valued items are what&#39;s considered popular by the normal consumer, ergo crap like that plastic or vinyl figures; movie posters; autographed memorabilia and anything related to the DC or Marvel movies.</p>

<p>Video games can also bring a pretty penny if you can find in-demand items, like the PS2 linux cd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure the monetary system is the counterfeit of God&#39;s system. If you think about it people revere money like it was their deity. Babylonian money majick, covered in esoteric symbols hidden in plain sight. Used to keep us all spiritually and physically enslaved. The Golden Calf, the cash cow. We were created in the image and likeness of God, but money assigns a value to each individual, some are worth more than others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your great grandparents probably bought a crap house by today&#39;s standards and paid 12% interest on that loan. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve switched from incentivizing being frugal and saving to be leveraged and spending. Seriously, you realize that when savings paid 10%, mortgages were 15%, and deflation was a thing, you saved your money. There was no borrowing for things you didn&#39;t need. </p>

<p>Now savings won&#39;t keep up with inflation. So you spend. You can&#39;t afford to not have debt because buying power is falling quicker than quoted inflation. We&#39;re all getting richer, but it&#39;s really just a sliding scale where the minimum standard of living is artificially high, supported by a bubble of debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have four questions for OP.</p>

<ol>
<li>Did you attend and graduate from a competitive 4-year university?</li>
<li>What did you major in?</li>
<li>Did you apply yourself fully and achieve a high GPA?</li>
<li>Did you complete internships in the summers after your sophomore and junior years? If not how many applications did you submit?</li>
</ol>

<p>It is undoubtedly much more difficult now than it was in the past. What is making it even worse is that people are not being told how hard they need to work to achieve the success that they feel is their birthright.</p>

<p>It is not your fault per se, no one told you that you are in a vicious fucking race and you will be chewed up and shat out unless you act accordingly. Your parents didn&#39;t. I know they didn&#39;t because if they did, you would&#39;ve either worked your ass off and succeeded or failed knowing why you failed and wouldn&#39;t have the feeling of getting surprise fucked that you now have.</p>

<p>Working less hard to achieve an ever more challenging task is a recipe for disaster. My recommendation to you know is to study your ass off for the GMAT and get into the best MBA program that you can. If you get a high score (90th percentile and above) you can probably get into a top 30 school with a weak resume.</p>

<p>If OP is struggling because he has a household income is around $50k, then I am explaining to him how to get it up to $100k. If his spouse does it too, then they will be on a strong track. This is the way I know how to do it. If you have a better way, then we&#39;re all ears. Even better because I can learn too. </p>

<p>Also I didn&#39;t say &quot;get a graduate degree or two&quot;. I said compete your ass off at a top 30 MBA program. By the way, getting a second grad degree can signal to employers that you are wandering through your career. It is a weird thought to me, but I have heard that from multiple corporate talent recruiters. </p>

<p>But I am used to moving goalposts, so let me respond to the two points that jump out to me. </p>

<p>First: it is evil for my wife and I to work hard to provide for our children? I am supposed to rise up put my kids at risk to fight for what? I should have sacrificed my life to achieve your desire for a socialist form of government? War is evil. Working hard and raising a family isn&#39;t. Your whole argument is spoken like a boy still attending university whose only responsibilities are to get to class on time, take good notes, and study for the exams. Probably a CHId type major. </p>

<p>Second: the US public been finna rise up since the 60&#39;s. I am not going to hold my breath. The fact of the matter is life is too good to foment your beloved revolution.</p>
