        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has anybody considered this? This animosity between the two biggest superpowers in the world, just sounds like something the social engineers would have come up with and planned many years ago so they could get leverage on the populations of both countries, and create a &quot;social hysteria&quot; to keep them both in control. </p>

<p>Also serves as an excuse to continue this  arms race, and A LOT of money has assuredly been made since WW2 regarding military contracts and equipment based on this goofy ass Cold War concept.</p>

<p>We question EVERYTHING in this world as theorists, but for some reason, we can&#39;t seem to wrap our heads around the concept that the financiers of these big super powers (Russia, China, US), actually get along quite well, and are faking hostility to control the people through fear of a threat. The New World Order is alive and well folks. There is way more cooperation behind the scenes than some of you care to think. </p>

It&#39;s always been fake, but you can&#39;t sell military weapons and development to any country if the country doesn&#39;t fear someone or something.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say a few reasons would be:</p>

<p>•Economic Sanctions, enforced by US despite protests from some European countries because of job losses and the outrage coming from Russia. </p>

<p>•Ukraine. The US deliberately funded groups of right wing extremists who were insanely anti-russian to overthrow their government, US companies almost immediately begun fulfilling Government contracts while Ukraine broke out into civil war. </p>

<p>•Syria: one of Russias most valuable allies was the target of a CIA coup back in 2010 in order to install a pro western government that would approve their pipeline, US arms extremists to overthrow Assad, Russia gets involved, millions of Syrians suffer.</p>

<p>•BRICS: US has used the CIA, UN, their military and economic sanctions to destabilize, threaten or install corrupt governments in pretty much every BRICS member since its inception. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP , I&#39;m on the same boat. I strongly suspect the rivalry between those have been structured might be all that fake. I won&#39;t be surprised. How the fuck can you leave NK on the hotbed of the absurd shitness without a fixed game ,  seeing them giving ineffective sanctions and buying Chinese products ( it is said China is the master of NK but I don&#39;t buy it . This appeared being a well composed story but I never buy this. And I have nothing against China at all honestly . I want to set myself neutral as much I can. To read conspiracy theories from neutral perspective. I am just talking about a big lie we are told ).   I regard the same for Russia and the US . Only the reason the &quot;US vs Russia &quot;and &quot;the world vs NK &quot; narrative is pushed up and coming by is this scheme, preparation for NWO . Now all the composition of conflicts seem to be a fat lie to me because things are going as them do . &quot; The US vs Russia &quot; narrative was a big focus at the last election.  I won&#39;t be surprised if I come to know they are having handshakes under the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I are on the same wavelength, I need friends like you.  US has federal reserve, virtually all other nations have the same.  All owned by IMF, owned by BIS.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png">http://i.imgur.com/eoChcXj.png</a> Federal income tax goes solely to the owners of the federal reserve, it pays for nothing.  Federal reserve is a private corporation which loans what is nothing more than monopoly money to banks at interest.  This debt is impossible to pay off and a total falsehood used to make people believe they owe someone something.  The federal reserve is a misunderstood form of slavery which makes the federal reserve owners unimaginably wealthy and powerful turning them into the unseen oligarchy/dictators of the USA.  </p>

<p>Pair this yearly sapping of all wealth, their power of selection on loans, taxes on inheritance and inflation and now you can see why the bottom 80% of people in the USA have merely 16% of total wealth in the USA, the wealth distribution is massively skewed.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5hfEBupAeo4">https://youtu.be/5hfEBupAeo4</a>  All wars are bankers wars</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0?t=80">https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0?t=80</a> </p>

<p>This should convince the skeptics or make those unsure far more certain.</p>

<p>They own the media, I have a lot on this.  They own the marxist educational system.  They own agriculture, and they probably pretty much entirely own the federal government.</p>
