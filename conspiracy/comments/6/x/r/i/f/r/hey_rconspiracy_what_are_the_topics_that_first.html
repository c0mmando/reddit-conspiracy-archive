       i suppose santa claus was my first. i remember being so shocked to learn that everyone around me would lie to me and take advantage of my ignorance and play along with this charade.
      </p>
      <p>
       then a few years later i walked out of church, convinced that church was more of the same
      </p>
      <p>
       i remember when Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin got kidnapped. Googled Johnny Gosch when Google first came out, learned all about Franklin Coverup
      </p>
      <p>
       in the early 1990's when i first got online, i heard there was a flat earth society, so i found their website and went in to have a look around. they had a chat box, so i chatted with these guys for a while. i had to admit i was utterly stumped by everything they said, and also convinced that they were some seriously dedicated trolls. i decided to play along with flat earth, because who doesn't like to troll?
      </p>
      <p>
       in 2017 I'm more convinced of flat earth than i am of big bang. stephen hawking is a puppet. his wikipedia biography reads like satire, because it is
      </p>
      <p>
       the moon landing hoax was another big red pill for me. i like this one because it is relatively easy to understand their claims, and relatively easy to understand why their claims are impossible, and thus false. also, this red pill implicates many various pillars of establishment, from science, to government, to media, to education... and its a relatively non-partisan issue. people don't automatically assume you are a D/R if you think the moon landing was a hoax
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 big red pill for me. I had not really been exposed to anything other than the official story, until i saw the original
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       in about 2005. i have since come to believe that
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       was disinfo, produced by the same (((Zionists))) behind 9/11. i believe (((Wesley Clark's))) list of 7 nations pretty much describes the motive for the (((false flag)))
      </p>
      <p>
       somewhere along the line, i became aware of the fact that the Iraq soldiers took the Kuwait babies out of the incubators and left them on the floor to die story was a big lie. i distinctly remember GHWB talking about incubator babies on TV, and i remember believing him, and i remember being outraged enough to support war to "liberate Kuwait". i was shocked to learn years later that GHWB was lying to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       somewhere along the line, i became aware that the US Secretary of State (((Madeline Albright))) said it was "worth it" to kill 500,000 children in Iraq
      </p>
      <p>
       then Sandy Hook happened, and i was aware of the supposed shooting, but had no reason to question it
      </p>
      <p>
       then the Boston Marathon Bombing happened, and i totally believed the story, and was very upset that someone would kill an 8 year old boy, so i took an interest in the still-develping story.
      </p>
      <p>
       my mind was not able to process what my eyes were seeing, and someone had to explain what "crisis actors" were to me, and they even sent me a link to crisisactors.org i was blown away that they were so brazen to even have a website, (although crisisactors.org vehemently denies they were involved with Sandy Hook, there are other companies that do the same thing, but "Crisis Actors" is what we call all of them)
      </p>
      <p>
       the word "hoax" finally entered into popular lexicon on the internet, to describe all of these "fake news" stories
      </p>
      <p>
       soon after the Boston Marathon Bombing a tornado in Moore, Oklahoma. i usually wouldn't have paid any attention to the tornado, except that "the jester", who was aligned with the so-called Boston Trolls/ Boston Shills on twitter inexplicably shifted from talking about Boston and started talking about Moore. after some digging, i discovered that Moore has had 3 tornados in only a few years, and that they recycle the images from one tornado to the next.
      </p>
      <p>
       also soon after Boston, there was an explosion in Texas, except the video of the explosion they showed on TV was actually from an explosion in 1988 in Hendersonville Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
       then Rachel Maddow did her piece on how Obama's oil spill was recycled news.
      </p>
      <p>
       __
      </p>
      <p>
       somewhere in here, it was noticed that these high profile fake news stories happen on a regular 6 week cycle. a website was even put up with a calendar that showed all the fake news on the day they happened, and even predicted future (((fake news))). the originators of the 6 week cycle theory had predicted the Boston Marathon Bombing to within the day. (April 15) . that website has since been scrubbed, and the internet was forum slide-ed with a bogus "6 week cycle" diet and exercise program whose sole purpose it to cover-up the 6 week cycle of (((false flag))) (((fake news)))

       then we had PG, which the MSM labeled as "fake news", and gave it way more attention than it would've merit'ed if it really was a big nothing burger.
      </p>
      <p>
       even today, this hurricane that has buried Houston is fabricated, in the sense that people are saying its man-made by cloud-seeding and HAARP (NEXRAD), and if you just watch how the media frames DJT during the crisis, then you will know why they did it.

      <p>
       lately i have been focused on Autism and other side effects of vaccines, and i have been red-pilled on just how corrupt our so-called science is when it comes to vaccines and the safety of our children. our establishment knows or should know that vaccines cause autism, and they refuse to address the situation. 1 in 68 kids is ASD, and projections are looking like 1 in 50 or worse. we need to act now, with truth and reconciliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       i gotta say, i must be pretty damn naive, and slow to learn some of these tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       even after 9/11, i assumed that 9/11 was more or less an isolated incident, as far as a (((false flag))) goes
      </p>
      <p>
       even after learning about Crisis Actors at Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon Bombing,
      </p>
      <p>
       i was still shocked to learn that Ferguson was staged as well, and that Rev Al Sharpton really is a race-traitor for participating in this fabricated narrative against the reputation of black people, particularly in Ferguson
      </p>
      <p>
       and slowly but surely i have come to the realization that everything on CNN is propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       you could literally take notes of "the news", and then go fact-check everything they say, and add the word "hoax" to your search, and you will find people de-constructing CNN
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       as an atheist, one of the all time biggest red pills was when i stepped back from it all, and took it all in, it its totality, and was at a loss for words as to how to describe it, other than to use words like "evil" or "satan"
      </p>
      <p>
       fortunately, 90% of the people have some sort of belief in "God" etc, so when you start using words like "satan" and "evil", a lot of other people already understand the language, and understand what you are trying to say. using this language bridges wide gaps across very diverse minds

       "Santa" is definitely a satan stand-in. That dude satan is extremely tricky--dresses in red, got a beard, has replaced materialism for spirituality at Christmas, uses magic like flying reindeer and has little mythical creators as assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the modern santa/satan is a Coca-Cola construct, back when the poison sugar water was still including cocaine in their drink. Coke even brags about it!

       just watch how the politicians behave. they may not get their gun control the first time, but they will keep trying, like they did in Australia.

       string of (((fake news))) high profile shootings, accompanied by media hype, until guns were banned and confiscated in Australia
      </p>
      <p>
       the last town where there was a shooting was near Newtown, iirc
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       alternatively, these false flag fake shootings may be staged to sell more guns and ammo, because people buy more when they think gun control might coming.

       Interesting isn't it? How one person can look at all the evidence and realize nothing is happening and that makes them become more critical of how bad it all really is. And then there's people (I'm assuming) like you who say, "ah our overlords haven't done anything with the pedophile issue that could implicate a vast amount of our politicians, must be not developing." The resources are all right there you can inform yourself if you really wanted.

       I think Pizzagate is different. It's a conspiracy engineered for political purposes. I mean, it came up during election season and it directly accused one of the two campaigns of sponsoring those atrocities.

       So weird that the conspiracy that came from implications and information in the Podesta emails would come out during the election that Podesta got his P@ssw0rd phished from him.

       Sandy Hook for me 100% I remember having a surreal moment when I was looking at Adam Lanza's picture and realizing that it was manipulated to make this person look creepy as fuck. The next Sandy Hook moment was that video where the parents are clearly using signals and cues to direct their daughter on what to say

       Sure, it's disturbing, but if you view this from the angle that they just went through something extremely traumatic, the daughter especially so, just days/hours earlier, it's no surprise that they would be acting weird.
      </p>

       A person who views this and believes it is strong evidence that they are actors
       <em>

       just shows that they don't understand how people react to trauma.

       For a second, just try to imagine that Sandy Hook did happen and their daughter was there. Now, wouldn't that be a motive for them to be so affectionate after sharing such a traumatic experience? They repeat answers because they've done multiple interviews and get the same questions. Maybe they are rehearsed responses? Possible normal reason why--they are normal, everyday people and they're nervous about being on live tv. All of those answers make sense to me.

       Surviving and dodging a hail of bullets is one thing but being in the building when it occurs and never even seeing the shooter or the carnage is another. It's very possible that classrooms on a different side of the building could have evacuated without ever encountering anything very traumatic. Besides, the first interview wouldn't have been rehearsed. But it makes sense for the ones that followed to have similar-sounding answers because the interviewers all have similar-sounding questions.

       I won't argue you there. I agree, and I don't even understand why in the world they would do that. Still, for me to believe in a conspiracy, there has to at least be a motive for it that I can wrap my head around.

       yeah Sandy Hook was an excellent red pill, because it helped me understand the concept of "crisis actors" which i otherwise probably never would have fathomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       so now "crisis actors" is part of the popular lexicon amongst the so-called conspiracy theorists, so every time a new "crisis" happens, enough people know what to look for and how to describe it, and the seekers know how to search for certain key words.
      </p>
      <p>
       it wasn't just about this one school shooting, but about the public really figuring out the M.O. of fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       i didn't initially pay attention to Sandy Hook SH, but i did pay attention to the Boston Marathon Bombing BMB... and when i would mention BMB to people, they would be like "yeah what about SH?"
      </p>
      <p>
       i thought i was ahead of the curve, but it turns out i was behind the curve
      </p>
      <p>
       during the BMB, they brought out Frank Shorter, who allegedly witnessed the shooting at the 1972 Olympics in Germany where the Israeli athletes were allegedly shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       i had no reason to doubt the Olympics shooting, until Frank Shorter became a witness for the BMB, which i already knew was staged. so now i suspect the Olympics shooting was staged

       When my Grandfather informed me that Our Family is the .1%, and have been since the founding of Venice, around 1500 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roman Senate, British House of Lords, US Senators, WTO, IMF etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an eye opener, let me tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was offered what I call "The Golden Ticket" at age 12 (Introductions, Schools etc) The only cost is you have to better than everyone at everything (Play a game, be a Champion. Enter a Field of Study, be a revolutionary groundbreaker. Enter the world of Finance, become a tycoon.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't I take the Golden Ticket? As my grandfather said on his deathbed, "You have all the tools a person could want, to have anything you want, you only lack Ambition, so you will amount to nothing" Old man was right. I have no regrets
      </p>
      <p>
       My family is big on Darwinism, especially Social Darwinism, they're not evil (except the greed part) they just have to be the best, as you can read, they usually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They honestly try to take care of people who are weaker. If you attack someone who is weak or can't defend themselves, the rest of the family will correct you in the medium of the conflict. Insult or mock someone who has a mental disability, they'll make you feel like a dolt or loon (depending). Hit a person with a physical disability, you're getting your ass kicked. "It is the duty of the strong to protect the weak" is a strong theme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of my family members are attractive, atheletic, quick witted, charming, willfull , HIGHLY adaptive and have this spark. The spark is something small and nearly inperceptable, but the spark is what sets us apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       That "spark" has helped forge the history of mankind. (My personal favorite family projects were the Abolishment of Slavery and Woman's Sufferage.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not always the good guys, we're a family with our good guys and our bad guys like every other family, except where we're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       What my red-pill was is there IS good and evil in the world. Real, tangable and in conflict constantly. You cannot have one without the other, but I think it's best to have more good than bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light: Education, freedom, equality, pushing humanity to great heights physically, spiritually, scientifically. (Sometimes Humanity needs a push, let's be honest about ourselves)
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark: Driving conflict for personal gratification, using power to abuse the weak, pretty much the seven deadly sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The First one is a huge one currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dark side want people fighting each other to get away from building a better stronger humanity. I knew this election was going to be a big win for the bad guys but the technology is coming along to get rid of Need which will itself usher in the first truly golden age for humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully expect nearly no-one to believe this post, people rarely have believed me when I tried to explain this to them before. The people who have actually believed me changed how they interact with me after they learn this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like being a regular Joe, up to the point where I'm just a regular Joe. I want to be a regular Joe only because I want to, not because I HAVE to.  What can I say, it's in my genes to be exceptional. (The bragging is all me. lol)

       I've been suspicious of the "official story" since I started really digging into the JFK thing in the late 1980s, which just happened to coincide with the Washington Times reporting on the "Call Boy" scandal. I lived-in D.C. and the reaction to that amongst some people I knew was verrrrry strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'd say what really pushed me over the edge was Dave McGowan's "Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon" and "Programmed to Kill."

       I grew up wondering why the IRA killed innocents instead of those responsible for their troubles.

       Then 9/11 happened and 7 to 8 years later i watched Zeitgeist and my mind exploded.  I was brought up catholic in England.
