<p>Bullshit if you ask me.</p>

<p>This is their new tactic, trying to get all the reasonable people banned, and turning this place into either r/politics or r/T_D.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ì did not attack another user.  Ì attacked an idea.  Apparently you have trouble making a distinction between the two.</p>

<p>I believe that religion is quite literally a form of insanity, a memetic virus that causes massive psychosis. Interestingly, I was introduced to this concept at university, which, if I&#39;m not mistaken, is where the term &#39;collegial discussion&#39; arose from.  I can see why that would offend a religious person, but I&#39;m not going to say other than what I believe.</p>

<p>I absolutely say &quot;believing in something without evidence is stupid&quot;, because it is. I also say &quot;religion is a form of insanity&quot;.  Those are attacks on <em>ideas</em>.  Attacking ideas is absolutely foundational to discussion in any actual collegial setting.  What I wouldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t  say is &quot;you, userX, are an insane idiot because you believe X&quot;.  See, that would be an attack on another user.</p>

<p>In any case, the fact that none of the mods would even reply to my queries about the ban shows exactly what kind of moderation users can expect there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but an idea is no more or less true because a person doesn&#39;t like it, and no more or less true because of whatever beliefs they hold.  I said what I said because I believe it to be true;  a user&#39;s religious beliefs don&#39;t affect my opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>I stand by what I said:  religion is a form of metal illness.  Sometimes a fairly benign one, and sometimes one with horrific real world consequences.  I can direct you to a number of academics who believe the same, if you like, because I didn&#39;t originate the idea.</p>

<p>I made 3, all were ignored.  FartonToast talked to me because he saw me warning people off in TRC, but not in a mod capacity.  In any case, a conspiracy sub that bans people for having ideas they find offensive is a bit humorous, dontcha think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large problem in this sub - if you defend or debate for idea that is pro Trump indirectly, you are called a Trump shill from The Donald, even if you aren&#39;t pro Trump. So basically, it&#39;s getting to the point where that includes everything except open Trump bashing. Like every other legacy political sub.</p>
