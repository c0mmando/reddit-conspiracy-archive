    <div class="md"><p>Hehe, this is a subreddit for discussion of conspiracies, and our Presidents potentially being deep state assets is certainly one of them! I didn&#39;t take your comment as confrontational, and I certainly would love to discuss it with you!</p>

<p>So for Obama, I think he is probably the easiest one to link to the CIA prior to his presidency/political career. For starters, he worked for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation">Business International Corporation</a> after his time at college. This company eventually merged with the Economist Intelligence Unit after it was purchased by the Economist Group. Think of the EIU as a private research, forecasting, and intelligence analysis division of the Economist. Well anyways, the Economist Group is partly owned by the Rothschild family and it&#39;s no secret that the Business International Corporation had strong ties to the CIA, they even mention it on Wikipedia for crying out loud haha. I would also bring up Anne Dunham and Stanley Dunham as having ties to the CIA however I am unable to find a reputable source that describes such a connection. </p>

<p>For George W Bush, his father was a CIA agent and later on the Director of Central Intelligence (and later on a President, so I guess that makes the previous 4??) .  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2016-featured-story-archive/bush-as-director-of-central-intelligence.html">source</a></p>

<p>For Bill Clinton, you only need to look as far as Mena, Arkansas (or perhaps watch that new Tom Cruise flick coming out, American Made, a pretty clever method of soft-disclosure) Basically, &#39;ole William let the CIA smuggle drugs into South America using his state as a port. I won&#39;t link any sources on this one because they are readily available all over. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that our last 4 Presidents were either involved with, working for, or associated with the Central Intelligence Agency before their political careers or presidential aspirations. My original post was meant to be sarcastic in a way, I think Trump is as deep state as they come, there is the illusion of choice between Hillary and Donald, between Republican and Democrat, all rivers lead to the same ocean.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>And a ClA operative that deployed a global surveillance network, boosted remote warfare based on flying robots and provided support to a bloodthirsty extremist mercenary army won a Peace Nobel prize AND killed at WHCA diners with his suave personality and perfectly delivered jokes.</p>

<p>That many popular pop stars, famous for their overt debauchery, substance abuse issues, oversexualized performances usually targeted to a teenage fan base and edgy eschatologictal art exhibits, all of which that supported the last losing presidential candidate, have by now suffered crises of conscience, mental breakdowns and rediscovered their faith and the <em>right way</em> and now are presenting new, cleansed versions of themselves, just in time to have the moral weight to condemn the new POTUS&#39; evil acts.</p>

<p>And a throwaway graphic meme that came out of an obscure message board on the net&#39;s fringes became an icon for the intolerant, the dispossessed, the fearful of <em>the other</em> and ended up a victory and a hate symbol.</p>

I know she was the one who delivered him a vegan meal that one time in the embassy back in December. It was pretty sketchy considering they aren&#39;t known associates and Assange isn&#39;t vegan. It&#39;s been proposed she was a CIA/intelligence agency plant who was sent to scout out what he&#39;s doing under the guise of bringing him lunch.<br/>
Has she visited him at all since December? </p>
