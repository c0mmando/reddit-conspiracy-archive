        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>An analogy would be:</p>

<p>I call the local news crew to my yard, claiming that my house has been broken into and all of my possessions stolen by some guy named Keith.</p>

<p>The police arrive because its all over the news and they want to help me with my Keith problem, but I deny them access to my home so they can&#39;t perform any type of investigation.</p>

<p>Despite no authoritive investigation whatsoever being done because I myself didn&#39;t allow it, I still get on the news every night, making my completely unverified claims about Keith, over and over and over. The police can find no evidence that Keith did what I&#39;m claiming, but the local news anchors bury him anyway and encourage everyone in town to hate that guy.</p>

<p>The shit-show is ridiculously obvious. </p>

<p>Raising the dead yelling that someone did me harm on one hand, denying the authorities the ability to prove or disprove the veracity of what I&#39;m saying on the other... and now there&#39;s swarms of folks from some other town defending this line of bullshit as if it made any actual sense. </p>

<p>Give me a fucking break.</p>

<p>Edit: Now I&#39;ve got a genius saying Crowdstrike did the investigation, so the FBI didn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>In the above analogy, that&#39;s like me telling everyone the cops didn&#39;t have to come in to investigate the break-in, because my buddy Gary, whom I paid, will investigate for them and deliver the results.</p>

<p>Who in their right mind actually believes this shit? What sane person actually defends this fantastically unrealistic line of thought?</p>

<p>The transfer speed argument isnt a good claim, you don&#39;t need to have intimate details of the attack to know this. There are two arguments against it in the post that I cited, one is that those speeds are possible. The second is that there is no way to confirm that transfer is the one from the DNC to exfil location, and in most cases it wouldn&#39;t be (you&#39;d have transferred to multiple locations after exfil, and you wouldn&#39;t send it out directly from the exfil server). </p>

<p>There&#39;s the argument, dispute it or continue showing you have no interest in a real argument. </p>

<p>And then not backing that up isn&#39;t an argument.  It&#39;s an opinion.  A wrong one.  Because it does matter.  You don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re arguing, you&#39;re just parroting your sources opinion.   I didn&#39;t come here looking for an argument.  You did.  Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do actually lol</p>

<p>Its explained in the article I linked as to why, if you worked in It you&#39;d know those speeds are reasonable. Personally I think the date of transfer is the better argument, there&#39;s no reason to think that&#39;s the transfer from the DNC server to the first exfil location. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can say they&#39;re &quot;reasonable&quot; all you want until you&#39;re blue in the face.  But They&#39;re not the same. That&#39;s basic knowledge.  You&#39;re argument isn&#39;t even coherent.  There&#39;s a difference between the two.  It&#39;s not impossible to figure out if something was transferred onto a USB or not.  Hence why the dnc felt it necessary to hire their own people for the investigation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean they&#39;re not the same? That is a reasonable speed for network transfer, if you don&#39;t believe it I doubt your experience. You denying it isn&#39;t going to change the opinion of actual experts.</p>

<p>Probably because private security firms do the job much better than the fbi. And because the fbi doesn&#39;t need to ask, they can demand it.</p>

<p>Its funny seeing some helpdesk nobody attacking Erratasec like this. See if other experts agree with you in <a href="/r/asknetsec">/r/asknetsec</a>? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol paint it however you want man. i never said it wasn&#39;t reasonable.  Only that the two are different.   So now you&#39;re resorting to putting words in my mouth as wel? You didn&#39;t make yourself look retarded enough the first time when you went to look for something to discredit me with in my history?  I bet you were devastated to find I wasn&#39;t a frequenter of T_D huh?  So now you try to discredit my IT experience, but guess what, that doesn&#39;t make you right cuz you still don&#39;t know wtf you&#39;re talking about. First I had no life- now I work at a help desk? Lol You ain&#39;t got shit home boy.  we can argue all morning long.  </p>

<p>Your entire user profile is picking fights with people in conspiracy.  That&#39;s it.  At the end of the day you look more suspect than I do. And anyone with half a brain can see that.   </p>

<p>Seems like youre the one who just came to pick a fight.</p>

<p>They certainly aren&#39;t the FBI. They&#39;re just about as dependable as Crowdstrike. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It IS simple stuff! Thanks for pointing that out.</p>

<p>The FBI couldn&#39;t go cruising in there with Swat teams securing servers because the DNC is the one claiming they had been wronged.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s return to the analogy.</p>

<p>I refuse to cooperate with the police in their investigation into my house being broken into. If anything, they can raid Kieth&#39;s house to see if my stuff is there (but, you know, the FBI can&#39;t raid Russia), but you say they can raid my house, even though I&#39;m the alleged victim? </p>

<p>You&#39;re actually saying the FBI should have raided the &quot;house&quot; of the alleged victim they&#39;re trying to help?</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert in the nuances of law enforcement protocol, but this doesn&#39;t sound like something that law enforcement should be doing in a free country. They can&#39;t just go raiding whomever the fuck they want. </p>

<p>There is a process. They asked for access to the evidence that the DNCs claim they were victimized was legitimate. The DNC denied them access. They themselves are the accusers of wrongdoing, so asking for cooperation is all the FBI could do, AND THEY WERE DENIED.</p>

<p>Binney has been attacking the nsa a ton lately, pretty sure hes trying to pressure them into giving the evidence to the public. I like him, but I don&#39;t agree with his opinion on this matter, and think Graham is just as qualified to make these statements as Binney was to make his. </p>

<p>No shit, that&#39;s what the whole post is about. Why didn&#39;t they have enough evidence? </p>

<p>Because, for the 100th time, the DNC didn&#39;t allow a proper investigation. Had they actually cooperated with law enforcement, plenty of evidence could have been gathered to make sense of everything. </p>

<p>The DNC didn&#39;t want that though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is retarded. It’s not “standard” to block law enforcement from seeing the evidence.

<p>You never saw Target refusing the FBI to help investigate after it was shown they were hacked. That’s because you’re straight up bullshitting that this is standard practice. </p>

<p>2015</p>

<p>Nice red herring, but it&#39;s bullshit. I might accept your viewpoint if you can show me that the FBI specifically paid Crowdstrike to do their investigation for them, <strong>after the election</strong> but, they didn&#39;t</p>

<blockquote>
<p>same thing happened when NYTimes was hacked, a third party did the analysis for the FBI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s not the same thing. From your own source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the Times worked with both the FBI and AT&amp;T in tracing the hackers, the newspaper hired Mandiant to do the immediate network analysis work, and had the firm <strong>coordinate with law enforcement for subsequent attribution</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, &quot;COORDINATE with law enforcement&quot; is the key phrase here.  The FBI didn&#39;t say, &quot;do this for us&quot;, the FBI was blocked entirely while Crowdstrike did the entire sham investigation then handed over what they wanted to hand over.</p>

<p>Crowdstrike didn&#39;t coordinate with authorities, they pretended they were the authorities against the will of the authorities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most prominent “private, non-partisan security firm” is CrowdStrike, and despite Kelly’s use of the term “non-partisan” to describe the firm, its fiduciary relationship with the DNC suggests otherwise. </p>

<p>Far from establishing an airtight case for Russian espionage, CrowdStrike made a point of telling its DNC clients what it already knew they wanted to hear: after a cursory probe, it pronounced the Russians the culprits. Mainstream press outlets, primed for any faint whiff of great-power scandal and poorly versed in online threat detection, likewise treated the CrowdStrike report as all but incontrovertible.</p>

<p>In April 2016, two months before the June report was issued, former President Barack Obama appointed Steven Chabinsky, “general counsel and Chief Risk officer” for CrowdStrike, to a presidential “Commission for Enhancing Cybersecurity,” further demonstrating CrowdStrike’s intermingling with powerful Democratic Party factions.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike’s findings continue to be repeated by journalists and politicians with unflinching certainty — despite the fact that it was forced to retract a central element of another report involving related malware attribution, raising doubts about the reliability of its DNC conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a statement to WIRED, a senior FBI law enforcement official wrote in an email Thursday that &quot;<strong>The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers</strong> and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated.&quot; </p>

<p>There&#39;s the former head of the NSA saying they have &quot;other means&quot; rather than needing physical access, it&#39;s vague but that&#39;s what it means. Does that qualify?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that they don&#39;t ask when they need something, if the FBI really needs it you can&#39;t just tell them no.</p>

<p>We also have what was revealed in the Snowden leaks and other subsequent leaks showing the level of control they have over the internet to demonstrate this is possible. It&#39;s a logical conclusion that if they have this capability they will use it. </p>

<p>So when you said &quot;we,&quot; were you referring to the US IC or to people in the cybersecurity industry? I had assumed the latter based on some of your other comments, but yeah, I&#39;d agree with Binney that NSA would certainly have the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also the fact that they don&#39;t ask when they need something, if the FBI really needs it you can&#39;t just tell them no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, if they needed it, I&#39;m sure they could have gotten a warrant, but what I got from the statement was that FBI wanted access to the servers so they could help the DNC mitigate and/or attribute the attack, and didn&#39;t get the warrant because they didn&#39;t want to compel a potential victim to hand it over. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also likely that since at the time FBI first became aware of the attack, they didn&#39;t suspect it was Russia, and therefore might not have classified it as a national security issue. NSA is only <em>supposed</em> to be a foreign intelligence agency, and might not have given the data to FBI, even if they had asked, which we don&#39;t know that they did.  </p>

<p>The thing I keep coming back to is that even if Russia did a million illegal things to aid the Trump campaign, it would be just as easy and advantageous for them to do so without Trump&#39;s involvement.  There&#39;s probably not a smoking gun quid pro quo communication out there. There might be large sums of illegal money moving around,  But I don&#39;t think there will be anything like the Watergate tapes.</p>

<p>Look at the financing behind Trump Batumi and Trump Baku. </p>

<p>The Batumi hotel wasn&#39;t even completed. The land that was used for the project was sold back to the shell companies of shell companies that were owned by the original financiers of the Batumi project. If you look at the Silk Road Group that financed the Batumi project, the loans issued to Silk Road for the Batumi project came from the BTA Bank while Mukhtar Ablyazov controlled the bank. If you read into Ablyazov, he fled the country after it was discovered he stole $8 billion from the bank he controlled through operations like these that used fraudulent loans in attempts to get the money out of the bank. </p>

As I&#39;ve said many times before, there is an insane push on this sub for the narrative &quot;if the DNC emails were leaked then Trump has no ties to Russia!&quot; That is such a BS false equivalency.

When in reality, both can be true and probably are (at least IMO).

Basically your argument is Hillary is such a great candidate that the only way she could lose is if Russia brain washed the entire American public into believing that trump would be a better president. Don&#39;t you think that it&#39;s possible, more likely even that Hillary lost because not enough people were motivated to vote for her? She was a scandal ridden candidate from a scandal ridden family, She and her dnc cronies massively alienated all the Democrats who voted for Bernie in the primaries, she called a later portion of the electorate deplorables, she didn&#39;t campaign in every state, and besides from Donald Trump, was the most unpopular presidential candidate in history.

<p>I actually do think the main reason Hillary lost was lack of motivation under the assumption she would win. But collusion with a foreign state to run propaganda campaigns (which is a big part of what we&#39;ve covertly done to influence foreign elections) is real collusion. </p>

<p>Wow, talk about a nothing-burger. So, it&#39;s based around propaganda (kind of like the unfounded smear propaganda the mainstream media is tossing around) and strategic leaks that no one is sure the origin of because the DNC wouldn&#39;t cooperate with law enforcement. </p>

Not many people or organizations would voluntarily hand their servers over, but forensic evidence was provided via a private company called CrowdStrike (a pretty well-respected company, which, btw, would be totally blacklisted from taking contracts if they manufactured evidence). From everything that&#39;s been said, it looks like the findings are taken as valid and would be admissible in a court.

<p>Yeah, the deal was approved on her side in the name of the state department, and Bill Clinton was paid 500k for a single speech from a Russian bank pushing the stock, and Russians directly related to the deal pledged to donate 135 million to the Clinton foundation after it went through. Not to mention Podesta&#39;s undisclosed Russian holdings of 75k shares in an energy company that he hid under his daughters name, and Obama caught on hot mic telling a Russian diplomat that he&#39;ll be able to be more flexible after his term ends. But hey, nothing to see here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing of bills speech and the Clinton Foundation donation do not line up with the uranium one deal, unless Hillary also has a time machine.</p>

<p>Podesta had shares in a silicon valley company that was associated with a Russian company, but it was green energy tech and not linked to uranium one.</p>

<p>And Obama was being a diplomat... Trump could learn a thing or two from him. </p>

<p>Also, this is not new news &quot;parroted for months&quot;, the NYT reported on this back in 2015: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=1">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am well aware the company was sold.</p>

<p>Parents comment makes a blatantly false claim </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Uranium sold</p>
</blockquote>

<p>innocent </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is quite the difference between selling a mining company and selling fissile material to Russia.</p>

<p>Posters like the one I replied to know cully well what they are doing, but I&#39;m sure others will appreciate your info for background.</p>

<p>But just to cover the issue for the thousandth time,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. </p>

<p>multiple United States agencies, as well as the Canadian government, had signed off on the deal and that, in general, such matters were handled at a level below the secretary. “To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government’s review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless,”</p>

<p>When the Uranium One deal was approved, the geopolitical backdrop was far different from today’s. The Obama administration was seeking to “reset” strained relations with Russia. The deal was strategically important to Mr. Putin</p>

<p>Now, after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine, the Moscow-Washington relationship is devolving toward Cold War levels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deal was made in different times, and with way more people involved than Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in agreement with you. I see the Uranium One deal with the various Russian donations to the Clinton Foundation as (forgive me for the cliché) quid pro quo smoke but no fire.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe that everyone posting the &quot;sold uranium&quot; misnomer is being intentionally deceitful, some are for sure. It was repeated a lot, by Trump himself IIRC, so a lot of people are probably just misinformed. I do see your point about that being parroted, I just wanted to provide information / context for on lookers who may be swayed in one direction or the other when really the situation is much more nuanced.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not for the State Department to decide, it&#39;s for the President. One of the diplomats from the State Dept. simply acts as an advisor but you knew that right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s sad that you guys always have to deflect to Hillary and compare Trump to someone you chant &quot;lock her up&quot; about.</p>

<p>First of all she is not unrelated to Russia.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Veselnitskay">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Veselnitskay</a></p>

<p>Second of all Jr thought she was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Crown prosecutor of Russia[a] met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.</p>

<p>Quite the far cry from the denials that Trump had no connection to russia. He keeps lying to his supporters and they still support him &amp; the goal posts keep moving. sad!</p>

My view is that this makes it so anyone with enough money can determine who the President is by hacking the email accounts of all the other viable candidates.

<p>Which means the FBI did <strong>NOT</strong> manage to do a remote investigation that would be the same quality as a physical one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m simply providing direct evidence that the FBI got the data/information they needed is James Comey&#39;s testimony. That&#39;s what you asked for.</p>

<p>Comey states content is &quot;important&quot;, but the point is that they got what they &quot;needed&quot;. You can interpret that however you want, but the fact that the FBI states they got what they needed, which is in direct conflict with people like you claiming that they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>&#39;remote&#39; claim - nobody has offered a shred of evidence whatsoever</p>

<p>I work in an office. If my email was hacked, would my bosses give our entire network server over to LEO? Fuck no they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Seems like common sense to me, honestly.</p>

Basically, it involves referencing an authority on a subject for which they are not an authority. For example, in a discussion on climate change it would be appeal to authority to use the opinion of &quot;Dr. John Smith&quot; if his PhD is in computer science instead of a relevant field.</p>

<p>As I have said elsewhere in this thread it seems like there is a big push from TPTB to divide us further by making us pick sides. They make it seem like it has to be one or the other - DNC emails leaked or Trump-Russia collusion - so you better pick a team. In reality, both can and probably are true (at least IMO both have truth to them).</p>

<p>From your posts title: &quot;That, right there, makes all of the Russia accusations topple&quot; etc. etc.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s the unfounded and uninvestigated part that I am replying to. There are other pieces of evidence, thus not unfounded, and there are multiple active investigations, thus not uninvestigated. I am down to let justice take its course and see what happens.

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of data speeds DNC hack never hppened. If hack did occur, the DNC as a political party whose job revolves around getting votes would have demanded FBI look at their servers regardless to get votes with the public who believe FBI is best law enforcement agency in world (regardless of whatever the truth be about FBI)</p>

<p>And to the dropkicks who keep at it this hack bs, the only speed you should care about is the oneone where a Russian ICBM launched from a submarine stationed on the continental shelf gives anyone living on the coast of that continent about 4 minutes left to live.</p>

<p>This is the reason I would appreciate a full and proper inquiry into DNC hack before fingers are pointed. Not some private company claiming something and nobody double checking. </p>

<p>That simple.</p>

<p>As for anonymous sources and top secret reports, I don&#39;t believe any of it since Iraq WMDs.. If you believe cause some government official said they have proof of something but you can&#39;t see it the your a jerk to believe it.</p>

<p>And if bureaucracy are so sure Russian hack happened why are they using prefixes like &quot;moderately confident&quot; when referring to the hack?  Only reason anyone would use such a prefix is if  you wanted to save your job six months down track when hacking turns out to be bullshit by referring to you saying you used the word &quot;moderately&quot; as a means of saying you had doubt at time. </p>

<p>Unless you&#39;ve got a source that shuts me down on this, the rebuttal to that statement is: the only proof we have it&#39;s true are people that have just told us it&#39;s true - and they&#39;re all coincidentally the same people that would benefit from it being true, and that would also be publicly embarrassed if it were false.

<blockquote>
<p>A leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operation… would be exposed in the media there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claim has been verified. A Russian embassy official named &#39;Mihail Kalugin&#39; left the embassy in August 2016, with the embassy accusing media sources of distorting his stated reason. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry said Kalugin was head of the embassy&#39;s economics section. He had gone home in August 2016 at the end of a six-year posting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the story, the BBC reporter confirmed FBI surveilance of Kalugin as well as the virtual absence of any State Department contacts with the embassy official. McClatchy independently verified the BBC&#39;s claim that Kalugin was under scrutiny when he fled the country.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You&#39;re driving erratically through a school zone doing 55, a plume of pot smoke larger than an adequate analogy describing just how large it is spilling from your open windows.</p></li>
<li><p>After numerous calls from concerned residents and anonymous tips to the police asking that something be done about the speeding, reckless driver in a car with a license plate matching yours that&#39;s about to plow through a crowd of fifth graders because school <em>just got out</em>, the police begrudgingly send a squad car your way (the police have been involved with responding to calls about you before - wild house parties, joy rides, etc. - and every time it&#39;s a pain in the ass because you&#39;re rich as shit and have better lawyers than they do, and you own the police commissioner anyway, so why bother?)</p></li>
<li><p>The squad car pulls up behind you and turns on its sirens. You pull over because you know they can&#39;t do shit to you.</p></li>
<li><p>The police officer approaches your window. You roll it down the rest of the way, and smile in contempt as the blast of the escaping THC smoke hits him directly in the blood stream. You leave your shitty EDM on above legal levels (shit what is that? 90dB?) - the officer nervously asks you to turn it down. You tell him to get fucked.</p></li>
<li><p>Reluctantly, the officer tells you that they&#39;re have been complaints about a reckless, high driver matching your description in an area that looks a lot like this one.</p></li>
<li><p>You tell him, &quot;horse shit. Whatever pot you smell, whatever erratic driving happened - that was like... The guy that stole my car this morning.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Officer: &quot;d...did you file a report?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Eat a sack of baby dicks&quot; you respond.</p></li>
<li><p>Officer: &quot;if someone stole your car, we can help you find out who it was, we just need-&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Ivan. He doesn&#39;t live here, he&#39;s got no records, but it was definitely Ivan.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Oh...well, can I dust your steering wheel for prints and file a report for you so maybe... You know... We can help you find Ivan?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>You look over at Demetri, the mid-thirties-something wet blanket clinging to mediocrity - who <em>literally just sold you the pot the complaints were about</em> - sitting in your passenger seat, casually point with your thumb in his direction, and look back at the officer: &quot;actually, this guy already looked into it for me - it was definitely Ivan.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Ok...c...can I talk to that guy.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;No, but you can definitely get fucked for even <em>suggesting</em> violating my rights like that.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;O...ok. Have a nice day.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The officer walks back to his squad car. You floor the gas pedal and take out the sign in front of the school. The police department ends up paying to replace it.</p></li>

<p>More accurately, it would be like your buddy Gary (who happens to be a very credible PI) had done the investigation and shared his full methodology and findings with the authorities. Meanwhile the authorities already had a pretty good idea who did it based on some other similar sketchy shit that had been done in your neighborhood recently. Oh, and their notion happens to perfectly line up with what Gary came up with. Why would they bother with the investigation at that point?</p>

<p>This is the ONLY unsubstantiated claim I&#39;ve been requesting a source for. So far <strong>nobody</strong> has been able to provide it.</p>
