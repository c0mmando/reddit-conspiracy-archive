       I was thinking of the eastern idea that all is one. What if it literally means that all is 1? As in binary? Thus confirming simulation theory. 0 is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder if Einstein really was as smart as they make him out to be. Maybe he was just the messenger, and the message has been known by the Elite for much longer. I mean you have to reveal some knowledge in order for the masses to accept the use of atomic weapons and energy.

       One pattern I've recognized is that many Ashkenazi Jews seem to be at the center of a conspiracy. The Rothschilds funded an unemployed Karl Marx to write the Communist Manifesto, or at least assigned his name to it, and I'm sure they funded Einstein as well. Isn't it strange how Hitler rose to power when Einstein was in the US, and wasn't able to return to Germany? Freud is another interesting case as well. Communism, atomic weapons, infantile sexuality.

       It's all smoke and mirrors, tbh. Marx didn't write anything (and was not poor - look at his wife), Clinton Roosevelt wrote it. Everything is a rich man's trick.

       . Whoever these fuckers are, you cannot define them by religion or race, really. The only thing I can describe TPTB as are bloodlines from an elite "dark" priest class survivors of the Great Deluge. Are they even human at this point, or were they ever?

       Enhanced pattern recognition was historically a beneficial bioevolutionary adapation trait.  Presently, those with enhanced pattern recognition have, due to their successful ancestors, a genetic predisposition to likewise see patterns where others, historically less successful, have or can not.  When you are seeing these patterns, the synchronicities, it is parallel to an ancient ancestor seeing a pattern in a natural phenomenon which increased their ability to adapt, survive and procreate.  This means, you can both take pride in, and understand - why you are experiencing the

        tyranny of genetics
       </a>
       in the form of the observation of these patterned synchronicities.  The fact is, there is quite a large amount of data, that even those of us with this facet of genetic tyranny, do not see - but the relatively miniscule subset of data that we do process to see as a pattern, coincidence, and sychronicity - which objectively invalidates any supernatural or paranormal explanation of this phenomenon.

       As far as things happening that lead you onto the right path or warn you to not go forward with what you were going to do? I believe it because it has applied to my own life. Same thing with astrological signs. If something makes sense to me an applies to my life I believe it.

       I'm sure chemicals are one way to peer beyond the veil of reality. Something I was thinking of is that an ordinary person may see some code written and not understand it at all, however a programmer will be able to understand its meaning and purpose and recognize any patterns. This may be the same with people who see re-occurring patterns in our world, which is a simulation. These people may not be at the same level as a programmer, but are able to detect something.

       Reposting an old comment of mine that I think it's relevant and wanted to add to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't think it's literally a simulation (in the computer program sense) but the universe effectively acts as a simulation due to the laws of physics that govern it. What made the laws that govern this simulation-like universe? Consciousness - on both the universal and an individual level. What is consciousness? It's an emergent property of the universe as the resulting phenomena of an information feedback/feedforward loop created by the interconnection of all points and things in the universe with one another (be that via varying degrees of separation on a "physical" level, and/or instantaneously via quantum entanglement on a quantum level).
       <br/>
       Seems odd at first, and also circular in logic, but bear in mind that our current models of physics only describe the universe after the big bang. They don't tell us what was going on before the expansion. And they only describe the effects and patterns of the universe, they don't explain why they are those in the first place. But given this information we could propose that the universe and consciousness both came to manifest alongside one another, codependent of each other. And they've both existed since at least the big bang. We just don't know about before... unless the universe is indeed infinite in time and space and before the big bang what we know as "the observable universe" was just being squeezed/compressed while some universe outside of our observable part was expanding. Kinda like a balloon in that when you squeeze a part of it the rest expands.
       <br/>
       But anyway I digress. My main point is that without the material universe you wouldn't have consciousness to come from and govern it, and without consciousness you wouldn't have a universe (at least not in the way we know it) to govern or exist through. The two require each other to exist. Without one or the other neither would be. And that's yin and yang, brah! Check out more on
       <a href="/r/holofractal">

       !"
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I'd like to add that I think of consciousness as the code for the universe. Consciousness being a fundamental property exhibited by quantum mechanical systems. Quantum mechanics describe the systems at work on the very base level of "reality", and you'll often hear that quantum mechanics and general relativity - the two leading theories of the universe in mainstream science today - don't fit together. They each describe two fundamentally different things. And it shouldn't be a surprise. Quantum systems are far more dynamic and fluid with themselves than systems on a larger scale. But due to the self-organising nature of the universe systems on the quantum level come to form larger systems made up of parts governed by quantum mechanics, but these larger systems act with their own rules and mechanics that are emergent from quantum mechanics, but also independent from it. Over time this pattern continues wherein smaller systems come together to form parts which form larger self-governed systems until eventually you have the universe the way we see it today. And the way we see it today is as described by general relativity - which despite being emergent from and based in quantum mechanics, doesn't jive with it at all.
       <br/>
       The best way I can describe this in normal ways is by equating it to evolution. Eg. When someone asks "if humans came from monkeys then why are there still monkeys?" and they get the response "well not exactly, but rather humans and monkeys evolved from a common ancestor." In the case here, general relativity is the humans and quantum mechanics as we know it today is the monkeys... Sort of. It's not a great simile, but I think it helps get the idea across of why the two theories don't work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think synchronicity is consciousness at a human level (or any level at which it forms its own independent conscious system), wherein due to some convergence or superposition of spacetime, is able to recognise aspects/effects of the fundamental laws of the universe which are reflected in, or resonant with, higher level/more complicated systems. I hope that wasn't too "word-salad", but I am trying to describe this theory of mine as accurately as possible.
       <br/>
       Thank you for reading if you did get this far :) tell me what you think please.

       There must be a rule or law that dictates this, it seems the more aware you are of these coincidences, the more they seem to occur around you.  Almost comically absurd in some ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that the individuals or entities that seem to be throttling humanity must show their hand.  Maybe this leads to implied consent, even if through psychological manipulation for compliance with this rule.  It's the only thing that makes sense to me, it cannot be just arrogance.  I do think an awakening is happening, I feel absolute confidence that we are on the cusp of something great.

       You are the first person I've seen type this stuff out.  I've wrote out my experience under it awhile back and it felt eerie similar to scene out of the Matrix where Morpheus first talks to Neo via cell phone and navigates him through the office.  Except Morpheus was the universe and I was being navigated through signs and people (hand gestures, eye movement, adjustment bureau type stuff).  It was something else.

       Same - then I started experiencing it daily. You just have to be aware of it. Realize that your current "present" reality is the coherence of your future and past simultaneously. Then you'll start noticing that you current reality is being affected by events happening a few minutes later.

       "Time", as we know it, isn't really a fundamental property of the material universe. The time we experience, from our 3d perspective, is merely an artifact of higher dimensional reality that can only be perceived by a conscious observer. The universe in 4 dimensions is connected at the beginning and end. You can picture it as a line in which all points are connected to each other, or as spherical. As far as "the universe" is concerned everything ever is happening all at once right now forever. It simply "is" - there is no when or where about it. In 5 dimensions all given parallel universes are occurring simultaneously and instantaneously. In 4 it's any one given universe occurring instantaneously. In 3 time is perceived by whomever the conscious observer may be, almost (but not
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       ) as a segmented 4d, cut into slices (it's at least a good way to visualise it) but rather more accurately as an ever present "now", with a memory of what "now" has changed from to give it something to relate to. Thus creating the concept of "past" and "future".
       <br/>
       I like to think of parallel universes as sideways time. To simplify it visually, picture our universe as a line from beginning to end (we can put a wormhole at each end to signify that they're connected, but for visualising's sake it can just be a line). Parallel universes would obviously then be other universes as lines parallel to our universe. You can picture them on a plane alongside our universe for simplicity. But more likely they're layered on top of our universe at a base frequency different, but relative, to ours, so they don't significantly interfere with each other. Also they're infinite in number. But through conscious action one can transverse parallel universes (this is the concept of "choice" in action).
       <br/>
       Things definitely get real weird in 6 dimensions when you have tangential and perpendicular planes of parallel universes against ours. I haven't thought much about this so I can't say much. Time would probably be perceived differently in these than to ours, probably going backwards or sideways (relative to ours, of course). But yeah... Time doesn't really exist. Any given universe has a given set of events that are going to occur within it (fate), but through conscious action and exercising choice one can change their fate by changing the universe they experience. They can move themselves into a universe where a different set of events is going to occur within it. I don't doubt it's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       for one to move from a universe to another that's "perpendicular" to one's original... But that's probably something I can't, or at least currently don't, understand in this life.

       Once I kinda had a pseudo projection. I was attempting it, and obviously had never projected before though I do try to meditate regularly. I 100% felt myself leaving my body through my forehead as if I'd been thrown out by someone pushing me up from my feet. But then I got overexcited and felt myself get yanked back into by body. I'd seriously considered the idea of alternate realities before that, but that experience solidified it for me. I intend to explore it more in time!

       Ah nice you were so close. You have to get over that WTF!! feeling and just let go of your ego and any worries that you might actually die, because you won't. I had a few semi-projections like you until I really flew to the stars - it's really incredible and solidified lots of stuff for me.
