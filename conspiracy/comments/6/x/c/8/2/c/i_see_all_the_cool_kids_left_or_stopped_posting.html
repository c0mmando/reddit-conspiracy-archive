       Ì did not attack another user.  Ì attacked an idea.  Apparently you have trouble making a distinction between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that religion is quite literally a form of insanity, a memetic virus that causes massive psychosis. Interestingly, I was introduced to this concept at university, which, if I'm not mistaken, is where the term 'collegial discussion' arose from.  I can see why that would offend a religious person, but I'm not going to say other than what I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely say "believing in something without evidence is stupid", because it is. I also say "religion is a form of insanity".  Those are attacks on
       <em>
        ideas
       </em>
       .  Attacking ideas is absolutely foundational to discussion in any actual collegial setting.  What I wouldn't and didn't  say is "you, userX, are an insane idiot because you believe X".  See, that would be an attack on another user.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the fact that none of the mods would even reply to my queries about the ban shows exactly what kind of moderation users can expect there.

       To paraphrase (I provided the link to the exact statements.), saying, "You are likely mentally ill if you believe in God." to someone who has stated they believed in God is calling them likely mentally ill.  That is an attack and not collegial discussion.

       Sorry, but an idea is no more or less true because a person doesn't like it, and no more or less true because of whatever beliefs they hold.  I said what I said because I believe it to be true;  a user's religious beliefs don't affect my opinions on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand by what I said:  religion is a form of metal illness.  Sometimes a fairly benign one, and sometimes one with horrific real world consequences.  I can direct you to a number of academics who believe the same, if you like, because I didn't originate the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made 3, all were ignored.  FartonToast talked to me because he saw me warning people off in TRC, but not in a mod capacity.  In any case, a conspiracy sub that bans people for having ideas they find offensive is a bit humorous, dontcha think?

       They may well.  I find Christianity offensive.  However, I don't see every mention of Christianity as an attack on me.
      </p>

       Anyways, you're being disingenious.  You've lied several times, you won't address my point, and I suspect that you're biased because of personal religious belief.

       You still have not addressed my argument.  The link you posted proves my side, because at no time did I attack the person I was talking with, only the idea of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, judging by our relative point totals, the majority agrees with me.  But I can see that this idea is oersonally offensive to you, and that you therefore feel the need to censor it.  Since we can't agree, here's my proposal:  you moderate the sub however you like, as is your right, and I'll keep warning people about wht they can expect there every time I see it discussed.

       Again, paraphrasing, you said, "If you believe in God, you likely have a mental illness." to someone who believes in God.  That is you saying that the user likely has a mental illness because the user believes in God, which is an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people would find being told that they likely have a mental illness by a random person that they do not even know on the internet is offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be fine with your proposal except you are saying things about our sub that are not true.  If you go around saying, "They banned me because I told someone that believes in God that I think people that believe in God likely have a mental illness." then I am fine with that.

       Yes, I did say that, and I stand by it.  Religious belief is mental illness imo, as Ive already said a dozen times.  It is not my intent to offend anybody, but I understand why religious people might find that offensive.

       It's very odd to hear someone that's a conspiracy theorist espousing religion. Organized religion is the biggest conspiracy ever.

       In my experience there are a ton of religious people in the conspiracy community.  It is a bit strange, given that the point of organized religion is control.
