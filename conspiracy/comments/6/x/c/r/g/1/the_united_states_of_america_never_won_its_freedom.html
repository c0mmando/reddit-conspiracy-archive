For you to suggest the most successful business model in the history of the world has not been employed by other entities since then is farcical.

<p>Thus, it&#39;s not an issue if you say it is a honeypot because I have researched this on my own and no amount of thought control bullshit on your part is going to change that.  You may as well try to convince me that the sky is green, because it will have the same effect.</p>

<p>You are lying.  If you weren&#39;t, you could point to a single applicable court case that demonstrates the current validity of the law.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t and won&#39;t, because it doesn&#39;t exist.  You&#39;ll just keep saying that you&#39;ve done it and it&#39;s real, with no proof.  Lying, trying to get people to submit personal information while committing wire fraud.</p>

<p>We both know none of that is going to happen because you&#39;ve never done it.  People who have presented your claims in court have been praised by judges for exercising their democratic rights but have had their claims dismissed because there is no factual basis for them.</p>

<p>You on the other hand have absolutely no relevant legal citations and are basing your entire concept off of disinfo Youtube videos.  So yes, you are spreading lies.</p>

<p>Thankfully it is absolutely transparent so people who look through it can see that one side has literal <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/18-19/11">legal documentation to support their claims</a> while the other is effectively asking people to participate in fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your argument, then - is that because all debt and engagements were not absolved and reneged upon, that therefore the USA never won it&#39;s Freedom.  </p>

<p>I summarize this for you, to demonstrate that I in fact understand your position - but do not hold the same interpretation of conclusion of meaning.  In the traditionally accepted historical view - this is just the USA communicating to all that it will continue to act in good faith.  To read anything more into it seems pure fantasy, but please - do explain.</p>
