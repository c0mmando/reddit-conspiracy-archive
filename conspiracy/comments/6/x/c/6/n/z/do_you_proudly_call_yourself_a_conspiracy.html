I tried to avoid calling myself a conspiracy theorist by simply saying I was writing a book, but then of course they asked what it was about. I mentioned that one of the books is about a perfect communistic tribal system for US and Europe and that the other was about the connections between Hollywood, 9/11, and Ukraine. The first fucking thing they did was laugh and say &quot;So, you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist&quot;. I snapped back and said &quot;This is serious fucking work.&quot; It was really embarrassing and I left the gathering with my tail between my legs. I really hope none of you had to deal with anything at all like that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ironic that you talk about &quot;parrots,&quot; since you&#39;re parroting complete nonsense here. The term was not created by the CIA. The term was in the Old English Dictionary at least as early as 1909, and had been in use for <em>decades</em> prior to that, virtually always in a disparaging fashion. You can find it in books from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0AEpAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA56&amp;amp;dq=%22conspiracy+theory%22+%22The+Path%22+Blavatsky&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Z9alUrWPK8PL2gWil4CAAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20%22The%20Path%22%20Blavatsky&amp;amp;f=false">1890</a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AtcuAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22conspiracy+theory%22&amp;amp;dq=%22conspiracy+theory%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=7ob8UZL2PM6EygHNrYDoAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgyhttp://books.google.com/books?id=AtcuAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22conspiracy+theory%22&amp;amp;dq=%22conspiracy+theory%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=7ob8UZL2PM6EygHNrYDoAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgy">1881</a>, and as early as 1870 in the The Journal of Mental Science.</p>

<p>So no, it was not created by the CIA. If you really think of yourself as a critical thinker, stop being a parrot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol.  You idiot.  By created I meant perpetuated.  It was created in the sense that they popularized it for the purpose of marginalization.  They coined an interpretation of the words that weren&#39;t popularized before.  That&#39;s what was meant.  I thought it was obvious. lol</p>

<p>OF COURSE they didn&#39;t &quot;create&quot; the term.  That&#39;s like...the stupidest interpretation anybody could have made.  What? did the CIA create language as well? did they literally <em>create</em> the word &quot;theory&quot; so they could use it in the words &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;?</p>

<p>Jesus.  Some people want so badly to by the &quot;edgy&quot; one in the room correcting others that they&#39;re willing to make themselves look like a complete idiot in the process of attempting it. lol.</p>

<p>Then you should have said that. Words <em>mean</em> things. Blaming others on your inability to understand that is kind of sad.</p>

<p>If you are going to continue to mindlessly parrot things that fit into your worldview - and if you were mature and secure enough to be honest with yourself you&#39;d acknowledge that that&#39;s exactly what you did - don&#39;t be surprised when people call you out on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have learned over the years to not give a fuck about what others think of what I think. Seriously. </p>

<p>Furthermore,  I used to try and convince with long debates on various subjects,  family,  friends.  It&#39;s like I felt I needed to -educate- them.  Came to realise it was a waste of time, energy and puts some sort of needless strain on  relationships. </p>

<p>Today,  I prefer giving <em>nuggets</em> here and there,  pointing out tidbits of incongruencies here and there in the never ending media propaganda for example.  Sow the seed,  let them digest it and follow up on it on their own terms.  It may take months, years but given  time these folks often come to a point where they realize they are pawns in a game they knew nothing about and this is enough for most people to look for rabbit holes to dive into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and it was only a recent revelation. I went to David Icke&#39;s &quot;Wake Up&quot; Tour when he stopped in Toronto with a buddy of mine. We left halfway through due to the crowd it attracted, not the content.</p>

<p>The &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; stereotype was in full effect at this thing. White guys with braids wearing wolf shirts, monks in full Shaolin garb, and many people who were quick to let Icke know, from the crowd, that they were aware of what was going on in the world. Lots of peanut gallery comments, lots of smug laughter. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t help that we were blasted out of our minds on a couple of edibles but it felt like we were in the Truman Show. The audience was acting like an audience in other words. Felt contrived, like they were part of a group that made them special not knowing that they were taking part in the same divisionary thinking that Icke was presenting to them in the slides on the projector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would rather question everything than believe anything.</p>

<p>I hate the term conspiracy theorist.  I always explain my beliefs to people in terms of the news.  The mainstream news never gives you the full story.  Conspiracy theorism uses the scientific method to analyze the news and fill in the holes.  </p>

<p>How does this relate to my beliefs?  One example is Bigfoot, or whatever the nomenclature is.  Some say it is definitely real, others say it is definitely fake.  After looking at evidence, I would say nothing has convinced me thoroughly of either argument, but the existence of bigfoot is entirely possible.</p>

<p>Some of the &quot;theories&quot; out there are quite wild.  I won&#39;t hinge belief on faith, as billions do with religion everyday, but I am always willing to listen and it is usually more entertaining than thumping bibles.</p>
