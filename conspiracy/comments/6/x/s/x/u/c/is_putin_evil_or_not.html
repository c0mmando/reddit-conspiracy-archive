      <p>
       I was listening to Ben Shapiro's podcast the other day and he started going on about how evil Putin was and that he is a dictator, etc etc. Basically the worst person on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagreed with that, so I went and did some searching to find out what evil things Putin had done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say I found much.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Some unproven accusations of Putin "murdering journalists" or hiring assassins, with no proof. (not saying innocent).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For example, "Anna Politkovskaya". The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya">
        wikipedia page
       </a>
       says "Five men were sentenced to prison for the murder, but it is still unclear who ordered or paid for the contract killing"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, on
       <a href="http://www.debate.org/opinions/is-putin-evil">
        Debate.org
       </a>
       they claim "Putin ordered the killings of journalists and human rights activists like Anna Politkovskaya", as well as other ridiculous claims like "He has murdered thousands of people (mostly children) in Syria.", "The Russian economy has deteriorated" (does that make him evil?), "He has committed horrendous acts of horror via his Chechen zombie idiot , e.g. mass genocide of homosexuals in Chechnya. He supports both Assad and ISIS." (Putin is fighting ISIS?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen conferences where Putin talks about America's deep state, and how they are an embarrassment and are shitting themselves thanks to this election, so I can see why there would be valid intentions for such a big disinformation campaign from the western/American press to paint him the villain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR: What absolutely verifiable, proven things has Putin done that demonstrate how evil he is? Please no unproven accusations or speculation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: People STILL somehow managed to bring up unproven accusations and speculation
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: 90 comments overnight. Not a single piece of verifiable evidence that Putin is evil. You'd think if Ben Shapiro considered him the most evil person in the world, that there'd be good reasons why. Apparently not?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Shills and bots out in full force now, multiple accusations of being a Russian shill. Still no examples other than accusations and speculations (which I specifically asked to NOT bring up). Pretty pathetic

       Isn't it much like the Clinton death count - people connected to or opposed to said person randomly perish?

       Could be, that is a decent theory. Here is the problem, our media has lied to us about so many things I'm getting to a point that I consider the opposite of anything they tell me to be more likely.

       There are people in russia who defend put in like that, they are like Clinton supporters here in this analogy.

       An American has no reason to concern troll for put in. It's weird and a mentally gymnastics seed being planted because if anything critically damning is proven about trumps connections to put in and russia is ever revealed the first thing trump supporters will try to say is...

       Putin is being set up as a resistance against the new world order along with several other Communist Countries. The truth is the communists are just as bad as the "good" countries and were used as weapons to advance the NWO. The NWO is a communist system.

       It sometimes feels like there are a few competing TPTB groups, and there is a power struggle between them now.  The victor will become the NWO TPTB.  Russia seems a confident adversary.  I assume Asia, primarily china is the other faction.

       Agreed. To me, beyond the massive global military movements, power posturing taken place since since the general filled coronation of 'america first', the reaffirmation of the alliance between putin and xi just before the g20 was an indication of the scale of the clash. i think nk is a puppet piece in this affair.

       Any world leader who is controlled by the central bankers is not a "good guy". Look at Gaddafi. The Western media compared him to Hitler, yet he gave the majority of his oil proceeds back to the Libyan people. Does that make him a "good guy"? I don't think so. He was a megalomaniac. In fact, I think all of your world's leaders are megalomaniacs. They are narcissistic sociopaths who would murder their opposition in a heart beat. But, when they are aren't obedient puppets, they end up like Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi.

       Gaddafi knew he had many enemies and he believed that as long as he had the support of the Libyan people, he would never lose his power. The majority of Libyans supported Gaddafi, but that didn't prevent him from being overthrown.

       The thing is that Putin didn't want to be controlled by the bankers. The US went around Putin to Anatoly Chubais who together convinced the IMF to loan money to Russia in the early 90's (Bill Clinton and Podesta era). Of course the money didn't go to the people of the country like it was supposed to - the majority of it was stolen by higher-ups and laundered through the bank of New York and other banks.

       There have been hints that this was part of the debt that was coming due in September 11 - but I have not researched that further.

       Saddam Hussein was taken out for trading his oil for euros instead of USD. That was a specific OPEC extraction. That is all we care about with the middle East. Hussein had started trading this way in 2000. His fate was sealed before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran started trading oil for euros in March. Congress passed a measure to allow the invasion back in january. The white house has been trying to get the UN to find Iran in violation of the nuclear deal. History is literally repeating itself and nothing about our actions in the middle East is a secret these days.

       I'm with ya man. We are supposed to know about how evil Putin is, because it is self-evident or something. And I don't think he is a swell guy, but seeing how much the media and IC lies, and how much vested interest TPTB have in keeping Putin painted in the worst light possible, I don't think any reasonable person that understands all the situation could fault me for having questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure some shills will roll through with a wall of text of WaPo and Snopes links showing me just how evil Putin is, but I am not accepting MSM as part of my premise here. That won't stop them though lol.

       He's basically made out to be both the State head and head of Russian Intelligence for the last 20 years.  He's synonymous with Russia itself in many minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think of every questionable decision the US has made in those twenty years and imagine one single person being blamed for those actions.  Just how evil would people consider that individual to be?

       If he were as evil as he's made out to be, then you'd think there would be verifiable proof posted in this thread.  I was trying to explain how people might perceive him as evil while providing a thought exercise to hopefully assist with added perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       People act in their own best interests for the most part (the mentally ill and religious fundamentalists withstanding).  The more cartoonishly evil an individual or group is made out to be, the more I tend to believe that portrayal may be a misrepresentation or exaggeration and there is usually an aspect which is being purposefully ignored to make them look worse.

       You actually got me looking to see what I could find regarding Russian whistleblowers and leaks since Putin took power, as testimony from those sources and documents are the sort of evidence you are looking for.  The best source seemed to be allegations straight from the whistleblower who got poisoned in London, but he seemed to have an agenda himself.

       Did y'all have a problem with Yeltsin? Because he and Bill Clinton we like best buddies! Mrs. Yeltsin even nursed Podesta's vodka hangover and made him a linzer torte with her own two hands, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once, when Yeltsin was visiting the Clinton White House, he was arrested, wearing nothing but his underwear, trying to catch a cab to go "get some pizza". Strange times..

       Bill also didn't call on Boris to get information against his opponents, make multiple attempts at building properties in Russia, use his children as surrogates for political meetings with Russians, or hire a campaign manager that used to work in Ukraine/Russia with their best interests in mind.

       with the Russian leader. Were y'all freaked out when Boris and Bill were cozy? Was Russia a good guy then?

        Journalists who say/investigate things critical to the government are assassinated. We're not talking suspiciously timed suicides (although there are some of those), we're talking journalists getting gunned down in the street or openly poisoned. Here is a list of journalists who have been killed in Russia since the Yeltsin years. Think Russia is just a violent place and there's no connection to Putin? Then I would direct you to the case of Vladimir Kara-Murza; an outspoken critic of Putin who was poisoned, narrowly survived, returned to Russia, and was poisoned AGAIN.

       Maybe you should read the post again if you can't figure that out. Take special note of this sentence:
       <strong>

       . Maybe then you'll be prepared to discuss the topic properly.

       Cleaning up all the reports on this thread and it's funny, you gave specific and reasonable terms to your request, no one met them, and the thread degenerated into the usual slide attacking you and anyone who might ask similar questions. Why is it so hard to come up with a few specific facts? You weren't even asking for a preponderance of details, just some specifics. But this was a replay of the same vague notions parroted by the MSM for years that are used by the whole world to damn this guy. The evidence for pizzagate is more compelling lol.
      </p>

       I keep coming back to the Rothschilds and central banks myself. Putin's rejection of the most powerful banking system in the world makes me very skeptical as a CT. We know someone that does this is a target. And people mention Ukraine. I was on this sub when that went down. The consensus back then was that was a CIA coup. But now? Interesting, that wasn't even brought up.

       You've never heard of the Magnitsky Act?  I guess if you're a Trump person you would ignore his torture and death. The Russians don't give a shit about children, it's all about the sanctions.

       Don't you think it's weird that all of the vids to Putin's original proclamation banning adoption to the U.S. and citing elite pedo are gone from the the internet? Even the subhosts that I've linked in my previous submissions result in a 404 error.

       You should try being less biased and actually research Magnitsky, and watch Browder's testimony.  Of course if you think Putin's a good guy nothing will change your mind.

       You won't find much 'absolutely verifiable' evidence when dealing with a former-KGB oligarch, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what you have to do is look at him as the sum of his parts. We all know he's ex-KGB. That should speak for itself, if you've studied anything about the Cold War. Think CIA with even less need for restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is also probably the richest man in the world, valued at something like
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/former-kremlin-banker-putin-is-the-richest-person-in-the-world-until-he-leaves-power-2015-7">
        $200 billion
       </a>
       . Meanwhile, Russia sits at 10th on the global GDP rankings. How do you amass $20 billion in wealth when you run a relatively poor country? The answer of course is massive corruption and money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the fact that much of his major political opposition seems to die or end up hospitalized and disfigured. It's a long list, but
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/gunman-found-guilty-murdering-russian-opposition-leader-boris-nemtsov">
        Boris Nemtsov
       </a>
       was a recent one. There's also Boriz Berezovsky, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya (whom I notice you've already dismissed,) and Alexander Litvinenko. There are more, but I trust you can handle your own research. If you want the Russians to investigate these murders and blame Putin as proof, I don't know what to tell you. It simply will never happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also pretty hazardous to be a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Russia">
        journalist
       </a>
       in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's his foreign affairs. Like the US, Russia has a long history of 'managing' its sphere of influence. Putin accomplishes this by sowing division in countries and then encouraging the election of Russia-friendly, right-wing candidates. Viktor Yanukovych, the guy who fled to Russia and is currently wanted for high treason in Ukraine, is probably the most famous example of this. He's the guy Manafort worked for.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it points to him being a very wealthy and powerful sociopath whose life probably depends on his absolute control of a nation renowned for its organized crime and corruption. Do you think he could have gotten where he is as a 'good guy?' The idea is absurdly naive.

      <p>
       Stop right here. This just means that Russia does not poor. In fact, being at the 10th position means that they are actually quite rich. Not US rich but still. So Putin has 200 billion $ isn't exactly that unbelievable, when especially that he beat the shit out of the Russian Oligarchs in 2000 and make nearly every remaining oligarchs under his own rule.

       He said relatively poor because he has critical thinking skills that tell him that Russia should be creating a much larger GDP based on resources and capital population and other factors that would excuse a country with no resources or money from generating such a relatively low GDP.

       It's not that he expected Putin to confess... it's that he expected proof rather than hearsay and allegations, and considering it's mass opinion that paints him in that negative light you'd think that there'd be a bit more to it than "bro he was in KGB obviously he's bad".

       Yeah, but the thread isn't about Capone? It's funny how evasive you guys are. It's a simple question and you try to bend the rules. Just come out and say that there aren't any hard facts about Putin, but he's widely suspected to be associated with a bunch of shady people and because of that you've come to the conclusion that he's a shady dude. You don't need to set up these little games. Be honest.

       Propaganda? That's literally the transcript of his testimony to the senate judiciary committee.

       That Business Insider link is actually a prime example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open it up. First thing you see is a picture of Putin toasting someone at a dinner, with a slightly "evil" look on his face. That sets up the tone of the article to be "putin is evil" already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although Putin’s exact wealth is unclear, hedge fund manager Bill Browder previously estimated it at $US200 billion during an interview with CCN’s Fareed Zakaria.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So not "something like 200 billion", it's "this one guy estimates it to be". Spot the difference?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The “first eight or 10 years about reign over Russia was about stealing as much money that he could,” Browder added.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More opinions of some guy with no authority on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, a great example of the western media portraying Putin as a villian, but providing
       <strong>
        no actual content or reasons
       </strong>
       , just some hedge fund manager saying things about him.

       Because you are starting with the assumption that Putin is not a bad guy even though pretty much anyone who has ever interacted with him says otherwise. You're also dismissing anything that points to him being a bad guy as "not evidence" even though this is a conspiracy sub and circumstantial evidence or witness testimony are more than most other topics discussed on this sub ever get.

       Accept that circumstantial evidence, countless personal anecdotes, and Putin's history are enough to know that he's a bad guy. Especially since there is virtually no evidence to the contrary outside of propaganda.

       I don't think Putin is the dictator we think he is, he seems to work for the Russian Orthodox Church, it might not even be the original Putin we saw back in the 90s and early 2000s that did the false flag apartment bombings.

       Putin is probably evil. Almost definitely evil. But, good luck on finding evidence of his crimes. He has covered most of them up. He is not as evil as Bush or such who have started wars which killed millions, but he is nobody's saint. He has started or been involved in several wars himself such as Syria and Ukraine.

       I'll admit I cannot provide you with clear facts, but it would be very interesting for you to talk to some Estonians or Ukrainians. If anything, Putin is amazingly smart, dark, and unable to trace anything back to. I admire and hate him for it. His neighbors full-on despise him though, and for good reasons. Google 'little green men' and start from there.

       Putin is probably evil; however I think Russia suddenly gets such a bad rap that went away mostly in the 90's and 00's because Putin is actively going against the agenda of the elite that are truly in control.

       Personally I think that Putin is a bad man potentially and currently fighting a good fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is ex-KGB. He likely knows all about the CIA and I would guess that he wants to see them fall. He despises NATO and has taken control of his country. Russians are proud people, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he killing journalists? I absolutely would not put it past the man. I do have to wonder if that's just more of the real criminals' projection onto enemies.

       I don't think you understand, you don't get to make the rules, no matter whatever warped reality you live in. You've got other posts where you talk about all the mental disorders everyone else has.. have you really looked at yourself critically?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly wanted an answer that might attempt to follow your "rules", go to r/askreddit r/history r/explainlikeimfive or other places that has a greater variety of people from around the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you asked in r/conspiracy, where people assume that anyone who dies who's met a Clinton, was murdered by a Clinton. But the ties are often nebulous at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there's Putin, and literally hundreds of direct ties, nothing that is stretching, literally you say something bad about him, you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't answer the most important question is saw you were asked: if it wasn't him, who else was it? I think you replied with "you don't wanna know." But actually, we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you're either mentally ill in your thought process, "no matter how many very tight ties he has to deaths, he's innocent of them all, until someone can absolutely prove it true." See, the rational mind uses logic. The Clinton's going around killing people for some very loose ideas seems pretty absurd, but at some point, there's a tipping point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, guy who doesn't get to make the rules, because there's already rules, and you have the authority of nothing.. if you're so smart, and somehow it ISN'T Putin, then who is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you don't answer, you're obviously just some bored Russian either defending or getting paid to push Russian propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you ACTUALLY AREN'T, you need to really look at your life choices, your messages and views.. and realize you're the exact type trying so hard to change the views of actual Americans, in the Donald, here, and everywhere else, in a very unamerican way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't answer to ANY of that, then answer this: why did you ask a question in such a way that you obviously believed can't be answered. What IS your agenda?

       Did y'all have a problem with Yeltsin? Because he and Bill Clinton we like best buddies! Mrs. Yeltsin even nursed Podesta's vodka hangover and made him a linzer torte with her own two hands, lol.

       Once, when Yeltsin was visiting the Clinton White House, he was arrested, wearing nothing but his underwear, trying to catch a cab to go "get some pizza". Strange times..

       Your very first point was "Journalists who say/investigate things critical to the government are assassinated."

       Sorry, but if that's your example of proof, then goodbye. No offense.

        Makes about as much sense as speculation not being allowed on your post on r/conspiracy, wouldn't you agree?

      <p>
       Not a logical argument. I didn't call for no speculation allowed in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , just this post that I wrote. If you can't handle the idea of a topic on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       being discussed only with facts and not speculation, then I pity you.
