<p>If you ask the Bible, Jesus did say that they are children of their Father Satan, worshiping him in his synagogue.</p>

<p>If you ask a Nazi, they will say Jews are just born that way (thats why they deserve the GAS)</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think the are just extremely selfish and possibly geneticly sociopathic.</p>

Instead of using their talents for the well-being of mankind, they turned inward, and use them for greed and destruction, and the benefit of the Family.</p>

<p>The old testament, along with its &quot;yahweh&quot;, was invented during the Babylonian/Persian exile by &quot;somebody&quot;. This &quot;somebody&quot; went on to fabricate a Jewish history, based on the fragments of Egyptian and Sumerian history.</p>

So yeah I&#39;m going to point the finger at them. But even I am skeptical. And I&#39;m sure your rabbi sucked you off while he circumcised you. Judaism is the most vile religion of them all.

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ.  You&#39;re full of hate, and blasting it in all directions.  Calm down, for a moment.</p>

<p>Ok.  (protestants don&#39;t have rabbis, btw)</p>

<p>Now, if this family infiltrates and rules over all sorts of nation&#39;s, even putting them at war with each other, do you think they give a shit about race?  They&#39;re Jews.  They&#39;re British.  They&#39;re Dutch, Greek, German, Italian.  They&#39;re whatever they pretend to be, and they don&#39;t give a shit about jews or whites.</p>

<p>They rule through religion and debt.  And they&#39;ve been around a long time.  Ancient Egypt is where Jewish history comes from, so you should start there.  Check out Ralph Ellis interviews on the hyksos, for a good starting point.  <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fDrf7VGUjm0">This interview</a> is about an hour, if you can spare a moment, and he has many other interviews, which provide an interesting angle on how these Hebrews, err..  hyksos infiltrated and were later kicked out of Egypt.  (But not all the way out...)</p>

<p>From there, it branches out quite a bit, but like I said, it&#39;s a nice starting point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the God of the Old Testament (the jewish part), the God of New Testament isn&#39;t  YHWH, it&#39;s a being of unlimited and unfathomable nature, but its&#39; best manifestation in our reality is through light. And that&#39;s why Jesus is also sometimes called &#39;the Light Man&#39; by people who have transcendental experiences. </p>

<p>Jewish God is much more &#39;human&#39; in its&#39; nature. It can be cruel, passionate, require worship or sacrifice, etc. It&#39;s, for all intents and purposes, the anti-God of Christianity. This is why some people say (some) Jews worship Satan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is light a metaphor? And I do literally mean light, like the frequency of photons which powers the entire universe. Is that a metaphor or a physical aspect of the world?</p>

<p>Granted, the same way we are not able to see all frequencies of light, this is how we are not really able to perceive God in our 3-d universe, but light itself is as good of a manifestation as we&#39;ll ever get. 
It&#39;s what Tesla thought to be true, so it must have at least some value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not all metaphorical. The fact that these practices remain to this day (sacrifice, rituals, etc.) means there truly is something there. 
Why would all these bankers, politicians, media manipulators, basically pragmatic people, why would they dress up in silly costumes and have elaborate rituals that include murder and orgies if there truly wasn&#39;t something powerful in those acts?
Same as the god of the Old Testament. People started drawing power from earthly pleasures/pains and shortly after some sort of global cataclysm occurred. Those who survived had a fantastic story to tell, but those who came after them, chalked it up to a myth and said it was a divine intervention as punishment for their sins. 
But Christian God does not punish or reward in 3-d space. It just exists, as a power that enables all of it to function in the first place, and all other &#39;divine beings&#39; are inventions, made to help in population control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, but I think the answer lies in the behavioural patterns of Christianity vs. behavioural patterns of Satanism (egoism, etc.).
The former teaches people to use both their emotions and reasoning in inter-human relationships, while the latter just says &#39;all bets are off, do whatever you want to (as long as you don&#39;t really hurt anyone), which is prone to so much interpretations, it becomes degenerate with each new generation. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that a &#39;human&#39; trait? How can a being that is unfathomable and unlimited be &#39;capricious&#39;?! Why would that be the case? It doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sacrifice is also discarded very, very early in the OT, not sure where you got the idea it survives all the way through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How come then, when archaeologists dug up Herod&#39;s palace (Masada), they found a pit filled with human bones? Children&#39;s bones, I might add. Granted, there were those who didn&#39;t practice sacrifice neither before nor after Jesus, but the fact that this religion itself allows for such a behavioural patterns testifies how dangerous its&#39; interpretations can be. 
Even to this day, with the whole Spirit Cooking and pizzagate info coming out, do you think any of those people who do these kinds of things are Christians in their souls? I think not. </p>

<p>As for the Christian God that condemns people to eternal damnation if they didn&#39;t &#39;find&#39; Jesus, that&#39;s  just a deliberate misinterpretation of the idea. The main message of Christianity lies in their behavioural patterns, in the way it teaches people how to live, how to interact with each other, and with the world and how to achieve inner peace. It doesn&#39;t really have a whole lot to do with dogmas that the &quot;Church&quot; basically invented. You have to understand that Christianity is corrupted as much as Judaism, from the time the Church was established, to this day. Judaism as well, it just got corrupted even earlier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mind is like a garden. It has to be taken care of to flourish. People who accidently poison their own mind can turn evil. When they turn evil, they seek to enslave others beneath them. Good power is the power of unity. Evil power is the power of slavery. The evil minds are poisoned and when good people do nothing to stop the poison and to heal the poison, it spreads and poisons other people. For example, a good man can turn to drug dealing if desperate enough. His desperation stems from evil men&#39;s Ponzi scheme of an economy they set up for us so he becomes evil overtime. Still, evil people can become good again especially when good flourishes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too simple to say all humans are greedy. All humans want 5 things: love, fun, peace, unity, and freedom. Good and evil people are trying to achieve this in 2 separate ways. Most are good and are willing to do it the right way but don&#39;t know how since this world has an evil hierarchy that never taught us. Evil people are extremely selfish and approach this problem in a way where they maximize what they can for themselves in exchange for being evil which ends up driving them into insanity. </p>

<p>The good people aren&#39;t automatically powerful. Good power needs to be worked on and improved like a business. We haven&#39;t really experienced this in our lifetimes yet so it&#39;s confusing but once we optimize good power, we will create a world of wealth for us all. Evil power is more for short term gains in exchange for long term losses. Good power is about short term &quot;losses&quot; through stratgeically fair planning that pays in the long run and depends entirely on the power of unity. </p>

<p>Evil people believe in an &quot;every man for himself&quot; motto and in a disunited formation like this, each man holds a power of 1. 10 men hold the power of 10. The good, using unity, generate a power of N(squared). 3 people squared equals 9 power. 10 people squared equals 100 power. This is the power we have to tap into in order to create a wealthy planet. As of now, good people are mostly only united with family and friends. This loyalty needs to expand worldwide to all people and then we will generate massive power. The cabal knows this and that is why they use divide and conquer techniques and that is why they have been trying hard to destroy the family unit but have failed thus far. </p>
