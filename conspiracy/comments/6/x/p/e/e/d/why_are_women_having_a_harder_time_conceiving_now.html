       Almost every woman I know is having trouble getting pregnant. A lot of couples are on IVF now, but what is the reason why this is happening? Is it chemtrails, fluoride or GMOs? It could be health reasons, but even healthy women who work out daily are having this issue

       I knew someone that couldn't get knocked up, then at 33 or 35 she met a guy that gave her 3 kids.  Doc said she had some scarring and couldn't have kids, so who knows how it worked out.  Guessing just need to find sperm the body doesn't reject.

       It's a ridiculously understudied subject. And it possibly impacts so many things- like vax and blood type? Mom receiving the rhogram shot while pregnant?

       I picked up a book at the used store the other day about different blood types having different ideal diets.  Of course for my blood type, it says I should eat all the boring stuff I am meh about and should be vegetarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Potential NSFW comment: a few years ago I read that women can sometimes be allergic to their man's sperm and ingesting it orally helps to grow a tolerance.  I assumed it BS but it did mention as supporting documentation it gave examples of women that could not get pregnant their husband, then had an affair or one night stand and BAM.  Could be bogus.  Seems possible low sperm count.

       Well, says meat isn't optimal for my kind.  Truth is, I'd happily be on an all meat low carb diet if I could.  So unsure what his science is, will read more soon.

       Probably because they are trying to get pregnant later in life. Women's fertility declines with age. Add to that, the older a woman is, the more likely the couple has a busy work schedule and sex starts taking a backseat to all that.

       I have no idea if it's only happening in western countries. Maybe it's because the Internet is western centric that we get more news about the west. I think there was 12,000 people killed in flooding in India, why us that not getting 24 hours news coverage.

       Excess hormones from Birth control get stored in fat. So its not unreasonable to jump to the conclusion that more fat = more hormones stored = harder to eliminate from body to get pregnant.

       I think it has to do with birth control. A lot of women have been on birth control for 10+ years. Who knows what kind of effect those hormones have on women's bodies. But i suspect it's this.

       It's actually quite simple. We are exposed to many chemicals today that affect hormones, fertility, and cause disease. This started to pick up during the chemical revolution, but in the past few decades, it has really started to accelerate. That is the primary reason for low fertility. We know that sperm counts across the globe have significantly decreased as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are exposed to flame retardants in furniture, endocrine disrupting chemicals in the food and water supply,  and untested chemicals in cosmetics, perfumes, and many other products.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of 2010, it was estimated that 84,000 industrial chemicals were used in the United States, with about 700 introduced annually.

        extremely tiny percentage of these chemicals are tested for and regulated in tap water.

       Since we don't know what many of these chemicals are, it's very difficult to test for their presence in tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       We obtain our water from lakes or rivers, which go through an insufficient filtering process. If the water in the lake or river is polluted with a chemical that is difficult to remove, then your tap water will also be polluted. Since we only test for about 100 contaminants, we are taking a risk every time we drink from a tap.

        indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded." (article written in 2009)

Unlike pharmaceuticals or pesticides, industrial chemicals do not have to be tested before they are put on the market.

        It could take centuries for EPA to test all the unregulated chemicals under a new landmark bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Synthetic chemicals surround us. They’re in our takeout containers, children’s toys, furniture and clothes. There’s BPA in our receipts and flame retardants in our children’s carseats. You might think the government has carefully reviewed every chemical for safety before it hits the market. But it hasn’t.
        <strong>
         In fact, there are more than 80,000 chemicals registered for use today, many of which haven’t been studied for safety by any government agency.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The new law requires EPA to test tens of thousands of unregulated chemicals currently on the market, and the roughly 2,000 new chemicals introduced each year, but quite slowly. The EPA will review a minimum of 20 chemicals at a time, and each has a seven-year deadline. Industry may then have five years to comply after a new rule is made.
        <strong>
         At that pace it could take centuries for the agency to finish its review.

        “The bill doesn’t provide EPA enough money to get through this enormous backlog of old, and in some cases, very dangerous chemicals to assess whether they need to be regulated or even banned,” he said. “It will take EPA decades to get through the thousand most dangerous chemicals that EPA itself has said need urgent review.”

       There isn't very much information about how two or more chemicals interact in our bodies. When scientists study the toxicity of chemicals, they study the effects on animals of one chemical alone at a time. Very rarely do they study two or more chemicals and how they interact. Some chemical combinations can have multiplicative effects ("synergistic toxicity"), which means the toxicity of the combination is much more severe than we would have thought. Here is one example:

         They show that some oestrogens such as ethinyloestradiol (one of the active ingredients of contraceptive pills) and organochlorine pesticides such as trans-nonachlor, although very weakly active on their own, have the ability to bind simultaneously to a receptor located in the cell nucleus, and to activate it synergistically.

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Societal changes - women are starting families later due to careers and generally just "living".  It's harder for older women to conceive

       It's in the food supply. They ate too much of something and it's clogging their fallopian tubes. Look it up. There's a reason why some women can conceive past 60.

       Actually you may be right. My wife had problems getting pregnant. The fertility specialist we consulted advised to flush the fallopian tubes. It's a fairly simple process that doesn't involve surgery. This experienced fertility specialist himself told us his wife couldn't get pregnant until he flushed his wife's fallopian tubes. He has got 4 kids. My wife got pregnant not long after.

       It's not something you do yourself I believe. From what I remember, the specialist introduced a little pipe inside and he probably flushed with some liquid solution. This was done in the theatre. It doesn't take long. Also wife was 39 when she got pregnant and she delivered a beautiful healthy child.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as other mention, low fertility has a lot to do with your diet, and with endocrine disruptors. Eat healthy and limit exposure to endocrine disruptors (pesticides, BPA, etc...)

       I know a woman that had troubles conceiving all through her 20s.  At age 30 she cleaned up her diet (followed South Beach diet; low carb diet focusing on clean protiens and vegetables, basically) and concieved her first child about 60 days after the diet change.  She concieved again only 15 months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       She attributes her pregnancies entirely to clean eating and elimination of processed foods.

       Excess hormones from Birth control get stored in fat. So its not unreasonable to jump to the conclusion that more fat = more hormones stored = harder to eliminate from body to get pregnant.
