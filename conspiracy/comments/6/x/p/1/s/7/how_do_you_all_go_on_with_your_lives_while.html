    <div class="md"><p>There is no point. We are all doomed just do as many drugs and be a degenerate because there is no hope. Sad but true. I regret ever leaving my bubble of ignorance, but I&#39;ve always been curious to know everything about everything. Turns out that was a bad idea.  The only place I can even see hope is possibly on a spiritual/metaphysical level but my pessimism renders that pretty ineffective since the only hope that exists is after death. Pretty bleak. Turn back now. Go listen to Taylor Swift and drink a four loko and take a xanax and smoke a bowl and realize that in that moment, that&#39;s as good as it&#39;ll ever get. Chasing the high. A high which will offer less and less relief over time until you&#39;re forced to face the bleakness of existence in sobriety, walking through hell everyday with death as your only salvation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big part of the point of existence on this planet is transcendence.  You must arrive at the point of understanding on this plane where regardless of what’s going on around you, YOU make sure and handle whatever it is you need to do in order to help yourself evolve into a more advanced, more developed being.</p>

<p>And you won&#39;t be able to evolve and develop too well if you encounter little or no resistance on your path.</p>

<p>It’s like wanting to get in shape and build muscle, wind, endurance, conditioning, etc.  If in the process of attempting to work out, you encounter no resistance to your body and your mind - i.e. you lift weights that weigh nothing and are not difficult to lift, you only slowly “jog” 10 feet per month and that’s it, etc - you will get absolutely no benefit to your physical conditioning whatsoever.</p>

<p>You need <em>resistance</em> in order to improve.  Working through and overcoming and superseding above the resistance you receive is what ultimately makes you a better, stronger, more intelligent and evolved being.</p>

<p>Consider existence on this planet amongst the most all-inclusive work outs for the body, the mind, and the spirit - the personality/identity.</p>

<p>You won’t improve and evolve if you don’t learn to overcome great obstacles - and this planet is absolutely choc full of them.  Lots of opportunities to grow and better yourself.  This is how you improve.</p>

<p>None of this is to except or excuse any of the negativity or the evil that exists on this planet.  Far from it.  Take all the negativity you see and that is around and use it as an opportunity to react and respond in an intelligent and disciplined manner.</p>

<p>Again, this is how you improve and evolve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  I wouldn&#39;t say OP or anyone like him/her is necessarily being a pussy, however.  Life on this planet <em>is</em> indeed very tough.</p>

<p>It seems that&#39;s part of the very point of it.</p>

<p>Sort of like when you&#39;re lifting heavy weights or doing a hard work out.  You may grunt.  You may scream.  You may exclaim out.  &quot;Arrrrgh!&quot; as you lift that weight or finish that final mile.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that exclaiming out or even complaining about the work out itself is necessarily being a pussy though.  It&#39;s just acknowledging that the shit is <em>tough</em>, the work out is hard as hell - and indeed it is.</p>

<p>I think being a pussy is thinking you can&#39;t do something you can do. Being in fear. You can acknowledge the pain and you can learn from it and move on. You don&#39;t have to worry, think, hide, distract yourself, any of that. But doing those are easier than just growing up and get real. Not being a pussy is getting real and being honest with yourself. </p>

<p>Sheeit.  <em>That</em> part’s a LOT easier said than done. lol.  I’d personally say “Just WORK.  If you’re going to be scared, then <em>be scared</em>.  However, don’t let your fear keep you from still doing what you’re supposed to do.  The strong are not they who have no fear.  The strong are they who in the face of great fear - in the face of feeling the pit of their stomach drop to their feet and feeling their knees buckle and their heart pound uncontrollably - STILL move forward and work toward doing whatever it is they can possibly do.”</p>

<p>I, after all, generally have <em>very</em> little confidence.</p>

<p>I work at not letting this keep me from still moving forward and trying to be the absolute best me that I can possibly be though.</p>

<p>I have a lot of fear though.  I guess I’m a pussy then - even if and when I do things that others look at and go “Holy shit!  That was crazy awesome!  You’re so brave!”  Not that I do too many things that people have said that to, but my point is that I personally have a lot of fear.</p>

<p>Yes.  Correct.  Agreed.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree on all points, we may not agree on what the word fear necessarily means. </p>

<p>I just like detaching your identity from your emotions. I think that&#39;s the way out. Heightened awareness and consciousness through experience. You know too much to be afraid. You see through the bullshit, so why be afraid? I don&#39;t want to get arrested, but I&#39;m not afraid of it. I don&#39;t want my girlfriend to leave me, but I&#39;m not afraid. I think fear is a result of over thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Seems to me one’s emotions can be a significant tool in helping one have a proper assessment of the world around them.  In that sense, I’m not sure emotions are something one should want to necessarily detach themselves from entirely if at all.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a quote from Rabindranath Tagore, the great eastern poet and philosopher:</p>

<p><em>“The mind all logic is like the sword all blade.  It cuts the hand that uses it.”</em></p>

<p>I feel it’s not so much complete detachment from emotions that we should strive for as much as it is proper and responsible <em>control</em> of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that&#39;s the way out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it can be <strong><em>a</em></strong> way out - not necessarily <em>the</em>, however.  I don’t doubt that a proper handling and management of ones emotions can ultimately be a tool in helping one evolve further.  Seems to me that our emotions aren’t necessarily something we should want to do away with.  They’re characteristics that we would do well to learn how to control properly - not so much try to eradicate them entirely.</p>

<p>Sort of like great powers.  Think about the X-Men character Cyclops.  Shoots red death beams from his eyes.  Without proper control over his powers, he literally destroys everything around him.  <em>With</em> proper control over his abilities, however, he saves lives and becomes the leader of his mighty cadre of super heroes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heightened awareness and consciousness through experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not entirely sure that an understanding of and an experiencing of emotions aren’t a necessary step on the way toward the experiencing of that heightened awareness and consciousness, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know too much to be afraid. You see through the bullshit, so why be afraid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have enough fears to fill a book, but honestly I wouldn’t say that I have much if any fear of any NWO/PTB type of manipulation.  No.  The fears I refer to are fears dealing with other type of subjects and scenarios.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want to get arrested, but I&#39;m not afraid of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Agreed.  Same here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want my girlfriend to leave me, but I&#39;m not afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think fear is a result of over thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly <em>can</em> be at times.  Yes.</p>

<p>Sometimes not, however.</p>

<p>That’s fair enough.  This is in part the Eastern concept of non-attachment - one I agree with more and more.</p>

Because this stuff will cause anxiety in the most level-mooded person. Also, expect momentary feelings of depression, helplessness, loneliness. But there is also, for me anyway, a sense of greater purpose, a feeling of control that comes with having a better sense of what &quot;reality&quot; is, a new confidence in choosing the path that was set out for you, a set of people will come into your life that you can actually trust. </p>

<p>we know about the CNN fake news coverage of war</p>

<p>we know ISIS is a Mossad proxy, which means they are probably fighting a &quot;fake war&quot; against them </p>

<p>Pearl Harbor is looking more and more sketchy, especially since 9/11 was to be the &quot;new pearl harbor&quot; and we all know 9/11 was a (((false flag)))</p>

<p>what about other wars...</p>

<p>was Bradley Chelsea Manning leak of &quot;collateral murder&quot; real or fake? the whole Manning thing seems very weird </p>

<p>Viet Nam</p>

<p>Korea</p>

<p>Syria </p>

<p>etc </p>

<p>Did you check out fakeologist? I think you will like their perspective. they are consistent on this: you can&#39;t trust the news because we know the news lies. without the news, we know nothing of Bradley Manning or the myriad &#39;wars&#39; allegedly going on right now. So why would we choose to believe any of it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>two of the more significant achievements of the US constitution were interstate commerce and mutual defense. </p>

<p>i think we can build a new model that incorporates both of these but cuts out waste, fraud and abuse</p>

<p>we are told we are &quot;at war&quot; in Afghanistan, but in reality the Marines are literally guarding poppy fields, to supply the world with opium/heroin</p>

<p>and now we have an opiod / heroin epidemic in USA? from drugs that come from the fields that Marines are guarding in Afghanistan?</p>

<p>the opium wars are not just history, but are current events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay grounded.   Get a dog,  go for walks.   For millions of years life has been chugging along,  and humans,  many of who are confused and destructive,  are only a part of it.   On the other hand,  you have to chose whether to be informed or not.    The power of information is greater now than before,  for a world that is dependent on information and technology.    So there are a lot of games going on,  a lot of lies.   A lot of questions.   A lot of secrecy.   A lot of misinformation.</p>

<p>Culture,  the arts,  entertainment,  is a very mixed bag,  there are mafia like groups that want to use everything to enrich themselves.</p>

<p>Going to college is to submit to part of the human game,  but then most jobs,  most ways of making money are going to have a lot of that give and take.    The saddest part is that in some places close to the centers of power,  the corruption is extreme,  so the adults that live their lives in that are jaded and messed up.    Try to find a place where you do as little harm as possible and contribute something to the healthy functioning of society,  a place where people can still walk their dog in a nice place.</p>
