       No I'm aware of that. That's the way this typically went
      </p>
      <p>
       NK: threat
      </p>
      <p>
       US: here's some aid
      </p>
      <p>
       NK: content for now
      </p>
      <p>
       But now they're ramping up and have been getting more and more aggressive. What used to be cute and funny in its own way (NK failing miserably at launches) is and has been getting progressively scarier since they've improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was in South Korea I would be actively trying to flee the country at this point. Anything else seems foolish. No matter how much appeasement or aid NK receives; they're still attempting to actively attack the US knowing on some level that they have 3+ million they can rain hellfire down upon in SK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US or another world power does a preemptive strike? SK gets glassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US or another world power keeps ignoring or does nothing that impacts NK to the point of deterrence? NK keeps trying to launch at the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing is a shit show and it hasn't even really begun. If or when NK is hit in retaliation; you've got millions of people there that are brainwashed. Who will want to adopt them or culture them? What horrors will the world discover the Jun-Un regime and their predescessors have wrought on their own people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Camps and conditions rivaling the Holocaust? Human experimentatiion?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll find out in the coming weeks/months/years and I don't think we're going to be ready for it because we truly don't know how bad it is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point I think is this: if you're in Seoul then get the fuck out of there sooner rather than later.

       The People need a distraction. Can't have us questioning the rampant drug problem, rising poverty, the collapse of the middle class, the looting of the country, the bickering of the power elites. War solves all of these problems- at least for a few years. Bonus if you can strip away more rights with War Powers and imaginary threats of nuclear fire.

       Well he made a bunch of irrelevant tie-ins.  Ie- well you mentioned that this group believes in X, so I'm gonna make the assumption that you believe in X?  Then he goes and assumes that Satan must have an opposite for no reason whatsoever.   And no one said anything about this being exclusive to one party or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't that confusing.   The words elite pedophile ring among our politicians really should get the point across.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no,  the focus is on whatever make believe entity that the group is worshiping.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I think if they are worshiping anything it's only as a means of control coming down from the hierarchy.  It's a cult that uses child sex abuse for blackmail power.

       No.   I can believe that Joe down the street worships anything without believing in what Joe worships.  Sorry to drag you through the mud man I'm very literal.

       These politicians are puppets controlled via a cult that teases them with magical mumbo jumbo to get them to commit horrendous evil acts that act as the perfect blackmail.  You're focusing on the mumbo jumbo.   It's just a means of control over them. Sorry if I came off like a douche, I'm good at that.

       People also need change... And sometimes the only way to change is to severly shake things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people, here and elsewhere, are really smart folks. They understand how hard it would be to change how everything is run... I mean.. What can any of you do to stop how this is all going? The heart attack gun would be out in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people just want change that bad that they feel war is the one way to bring it to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one would not like to see a war... As i think once it starts, likely with 2 countries, itll be short lived as a 2 sided conflict and i dont wanna go out due to some retards who would rather die than compromise and be civil.

       We all know it isnt black or white... Its long corrupted and its not in our favor one tiny bit. It could be so much better and so much more fair and prosperous.

       Well... China kind of got screwed by British opium so badly they started a whole 2 wars about it, so there can be damages to having an addicted population. But I agree the police and prison problem due to the way drugs are regulated is insanity

       Do you realize that China STARTED the war in response to drug addicts. The Drug addicts did not start the war and did not want that war to happen. MORE evidence that people meddling with drug addicts' lives is harmful to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are better ways to hedge against drugs than prohibition (which history has shown to be ineffective) such as education and harm reduction. We should focus on keeping drugs away from teenagers who are most likely to take risks and experiment and stop taking drugs away from adults who want to make choices with their own body and lives.

       He has tweeted multiple times about escalating things with NK and everyone else has had to say he didn't mean it. There are no comments on news subs calling for war that I can find on

       I can admit to wanting to see this war play out in a morbid way. Kind of like the lyrics to Vicarious on some subconscious primal level:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Cause I need to watch things die from a distance. Vicariously I live while the whole world dies. You all need it too. Don't lie. Why can't we just admit it?.......The universe is hostile, so impersonal. Devour to survive. So it is. So it's always been. We all feed on tragedy. It's like blood to a vampire. Vicariously I live while the whole world dies. Much better you than I."

       I find it pretty interesting that it's always Trump supporters who make threads like these and yet the one they voted for are sitting in the WH making threats like never before screaming "fire and fury!" to NK while blaming China, wanting to use nuclear weapons, sowing doubt among NATO allies and ruining the relationships with other allies the US has had for decades, bombing the shit out of more civilians in 9 months than Obama did in 8 years, making the world a more divisive and dangerous place.

       Hey man, we just need to keep talking to them until they build up enough nukes and have them pointed at every major American and international city. Then we can really negotiate with them. And we'll probably have to negotiate with Iran because NK will sell them a nuke for some $$. Those pallets of cash from Obama will come in handy. Fuck all the past admins that just kicked the can. Fucking traitors is what they are.

       I hope you are kidding. But if not, here are two reasons why we dont need to engage with military force. First, they are bluffing. They dont want war. They want aid. Money and food and probably fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, they are to close to many densely populated areas that could be targeted in retaliation. 
The cost of war in either life or money is too high.

       If north korea blows up a country they wont be able to take food or resources from that country. The food or resources would also have been destroyed.
      </p>

       That is foresight. Getting scared because the bully is now holding a bigger bat is not. You are acting on emotions, and not thinking this through.

       North Korea could do some serious damage, damage that WOULD occur if we tried to strike preemptively.

       Yes it is. They cannot eat fallout dust. Seriously, foresight is the ability to predict the future. What would be North Koreas future if they launched an attack? They cant kill everyone before a counter strike is launched.  What would be the point? Its suicidal for North Korea to attack anyone. They probably wont, but if we attack then they have nothing to lose.

       People also need change... And sometimes the only way to change is to severly shake things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people, here and elsewhere, are really smart folks. They understand how hard it would be to change how everything is run... I mean.. What can any of you do to stop how this is all going? The heart attack gun would be out in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people just want change that bad that they feel war is the one way to bring it to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one would not like to see a war... As i think once it starts, likely with 2 countries, itll be short lived as a 2 sided conflict and i dont wanna go out due to some retards who would rather die than compromise and be civil.
