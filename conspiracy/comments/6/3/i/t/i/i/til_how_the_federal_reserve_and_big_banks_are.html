        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li><p>A small bank sells a home to a buyer. Let&#39;s just assume the buyer borrowed 1 million even to keep it simple. </p></li>
<li><p>The small bank can loan out up to 10x what they store in the vaults. Any excess money is lent by the federal reserve at a 0.5% interest rate. The Fed works with all banks so they constantly rake in cash. </p></li>
<li><p>The real estate agent sells the house and makes 1% on the loan. In this case, $10,000 on a million dollar loan. </p></li>
<li><p>The small bank then sells the loan to big banks like chase and bank of America at a 1% commission so they make $10,000. </p></li>
<li><p>Assuming the house is worth 1 milion, the buyer pays that back over 30 years at triple the cost. This means the buyer pays back 3 million on a 1 million dollar loan. The big banks make 2 million clean after 30 years plus bits of cash from fees. This is at 4% interest per year. If the big banks need more money, they borrow from the fed at half percent. </p></li>
<li><p>The custoner buys mortgage insurance at 1% of the loan amount per year. If he defaults on the home, the mortgage insurance company pays off the balance to the big banks. Instead of big banks paying this insurance cost,they put it on the middle class. Also, upon default, the bank takes the house, which is now worth more, and sells it outright for 100% profit. This is a massive amount of profit for 0 work outside of printing cash and doing paperwork. </p></li>
<li><p>The insurance companies make massive profits because of mortgage insurance and property insurance. On top of everything, the average property tax is $4000 a year  on your own property so you never feel like you own your home in full. If you don&#39;t pay, they can give your home to investors who pay your taxes for a few years until the judge outright hands the house to them for massive profits. At this point, the sheriff evicts you even if the house is paid for. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All this really hit the fan when money was off the gold standard. Now the fed prints like crazy, hands the money to big banks for half a percent and this goes to all major banks in the US. These big banks make a fortune off every home buyer. The small real estate agent and small banks make 1% each while big banks make at least 300% and if the buyer defaults, the big banks make much, much more.</p>

<p>Also, on average, only 1/3rd of each monthly payment  goes to the principal of the loan. After 20 years of payment, things get better. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that all these trillions of dollars are earned by the middle class and handed over to big banks who are making the money nearly out of thin air. </p>

<p>The conclusion is that Usery through home loans is one of the biggest ponzi schemes in existence. The banks have tried very hard to keep this a secret which is the only reason they have been getting away with it. </p>

<p>Note: The federal reserve that prints and loans all these trillions is NOT a government agency but rather a private corporation who simply prints and loans money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a few things wrong with what you wrote, but I do agree with the sentiment, to some degree. That being said, if there was not usury, a private bank could not exist. Now, we make that bank a State entity, there would still be usury and robbery via taxation, to keep the bank in business. Now, if you want to be able to borrow money, you would need some sort of usury. If you don&#39;t want to borrow (like me - I know the pains of debt), then I say fuck all. Basically, you cannot have your cake and eat it too... So.. Decide...</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple economics...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but the messed up part is that when these banks make bad loans, ones that they know are going to default, they either sell them in one of their sub-prime bundles masked as a safe investment, or if they do actually take some losses, they just get bailed out under the guise of &quot;too big to fail&quot;. -- That&#39;s the messed up part. Not necessarily that they charge interest on loans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only if you have a ton of money to &quot;bet&quot; in the mean time. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to do. You&#39;d have to be paying periodically huge sums for that insurance policy to be worth it if the particular industry collapses. If you saw the &quot;The Big Short&quot;, that&#39;s why the investors backing Michael Burry want to kill him.. It&#39;s because he placed a bet that the housing market would collapse way too early, therefore costing him millions in insurance payments until it eventually does collapse and he makes a killing. It&#39;s all about timing, and having enough money to make the final return worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to some extent, but the damage will at least be more contained.</p>

<p>I explained above how the bank leveraged a single mortgage into many separate products, so that a single mortgage&#39;s default was capable of creating a cascading tsunami effect (which is what happened). No such derivative market was created off of student loans. </p>

<p>That said, student loans are more dangerous because the student loan holders are younger, more angry, and desperate than home owners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This only applies to private variable interest rate loans. Also the total amount of money in mortgages is far larger than the amount in student loans. Unless the student loan numbers recorded were filtered based on a bunch of criteria like the unemployment numbers then we will probably be okay for some time. The collapse of brick and mortar retail or even small business loans is a more likely factor than student loans imo. Retail makes up a large percentage of the US economy and if ecommerce makes brick and mortar obsolete, then we could be looking at a slow default on commercial retail spaces. It&#39;s tough to decide what will happen because there are so many risks in play all at once that could be driven by rate hikes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In America, prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve System, banks gave what was known as &quot;open book loans&quot;. There was no deadline on the loans. There was rarely a foreclosing if someone was &quot;late&quot; on paying their loan off. If a farmer couldn&#39;t make any payments during the winter months, the bank would let him wait until harvest to continue payments.</p>

<p>With the creation of the Federal Reserve System, if you miss your monthly payment, you lose your home. It&#39;s a scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I recall of my readings, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religions all have prohibitions on usury. It&#39;s just that Jewish religious law made a distinction between lending to Jews vs non-Jews. Thus Jews could lend money (and generally be immoral) to anyone who wasn&#39;t a Jew, thus the Jewish profession of money lending within Christian communities.</p>

<p>Anyone feel free to correct me though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>300% is assuming you somehow didn&#39;t make any payments until the end of the 3 years. If you made monthly payments you end up paying around 170% of what you borrowed, it&#39;s hardly outrageous for the bank to be making 70% profits over 30 years.</p>

<p>For comparison the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pretty well accepted to provide 7% returns, so if the bank were to just put that money into the index they would earn that 70% in just less than 8 years.</p>

<p>Also if you follow your own number 6, the house is somehow automatically worth more in the future, so if you were only to pay 1 million dollars on a 1 million dollar loan then you could simply borrow and purchase as many properties as you can and get free money from each of them as long as you can pay off your loan.</p>

<p>Whoever told you a 4% home loan is ursury has literally no idea what they&#39;re talking about. Also this has nothing in common with a ponzi scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm no. The mortgage-taker pays the premium. I.e. the home-owner pays the insurrance-premium (whatever % it is) to the insurrance company and also pays theinterest on the loan to the bank. </p>

Still zero risk.</p>

<p>And anyway this would only be a problem for a bank if a large amount of loans defaulted <em>at the same time</em> (thus causing a major problem for the insurer). Anyway it would just get bailed out by the government.</p>

Putting a 20% down ( the threshold to avoid mortgage insurance) and then taking a 30 year mortgage at 4.5% would allow you to invest the rest of your cash as you please - which could net you more money overall. </p>

The area I live in is very transient, but it&#39;s upper middle class. I now have a very valuable asset which i can leverage for a mortgage on better terms. My ex is on her 3rd home doing this, and rent from the first two cover her current mortgage and taxes on all 3, with leftover income at the end. When she got the mortgage for that 3rd house, she didn&#39;t even have a job.. that&#39;s unheard of, but obviously property is quite valuable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A million dollar loan at 4% over 30 years costs $700,000 in interest. There are no &quot;fees&quot; unless you fail to make payments on time (I&#39;ve had mortgages for decades and never paid a dime more than the agreed-upon payments.)</p>

<p>You are also ignoring inflation in your consideration of the &quot;vast&quot; profits banks earn. Inflation averages 2-3% a year, so at 4% the bank is earning only 1-2% in real terms. Mortgages are actually terrible investments in terms of return, but are generally safe and it provides a place to park large amounts of capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting 1.2 million but it&#39;s wrong. Use a mortgage calculator - there are tons of them and they all produce the same results, since it&#39;s just math.</p>

<p>Interest is not a &quot;fee&quot;, it&#39;s interest. It&#39;s what you pay for the <em>use</em> of the money over 30 years. The bank doesn&#39;t get to use the money and you do, so the bank gets interest. And you cannot ignore inflation which eats up most of that 4%. </p>
