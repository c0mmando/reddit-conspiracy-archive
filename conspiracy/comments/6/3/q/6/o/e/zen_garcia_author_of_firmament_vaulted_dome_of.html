        Audio of the challenge can be found here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The challenge is through his publishing company, Sacred Word Publishing.  It was originally issued to a retired veteran who attempted to chastise Zen for proclaiming the earth to be flat.  Zen then responded by issuing the challenge him and has since gone on to broaden the scope of his challenge - to scientists, physicists,  to ANYONE who can prove and provide two witnesses which can verify and confirm through repeatable experimentation that the earth is moving or that there is curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark Sargent, another flat earth activist, is on this clip as well - his friend Jeffrey Grupp also has a standing offer to debate anyone on flat earth VS globe models.  Grupp's challenge was initially offered over 6 months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's right - there is a standing challenge if any of you "aerospace engineers" or what-have-you if you would like a rude awakening.  While I'm not the biggest fan of Mark Sargent's presentations Jeffrey Grupp would make a fearsome opponent - anyone who wants can contact Mark Sargent through his website - if you respond to the challenge through Sacred Word publishing then I believe the pot is up to almost $10,000 now.

       why would they be using cgi though instead of rockets?
      </p>
      <p>
       also rockets predate cgi.  So cgi doesn't really explain the whole history of rocketry or space exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
       so like according to this whole flat earth theory every country with a space program has decided to get together and pretend to be sending probes to mars and shit...but why?  Like where was the point of failure that rockets stopped working?  Why did everyone get together and agree to fake the same model of numerous spheres falling through the vast emptiness.

       Ships, after they appear to go below the hotizon, can be seen again when a camera or telescope zooms in. The same with the Chicago skyline or Island of Elba, or Oahu, all visible with a good zoom from coastlines over the water a hundred miles away, which should not be possible on a globe. Not only are their sails visible, but the
       <em>
        entire ship
       </em>
       , or the
       <em>
        entire island
       </em>
       , a hundred miles away, no curve apparent at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for space agencies, of course they all got together and don't do anything NASA disapproves of. Of course they all fake it. Of course rockets are real, but thry go nowhere. Look at the recent SpaceX rocket and how slow it lifted off to nowhere, compared to real military rockrts which actually, you know
       <em>
        rocket
       </em>
       away at top speeds toward its target. It's all theater. If you are entertained by it, go for it, eat it up. The rest of us question it.

       That's one of things I'm skeptical about. But if the sun is 3000 miles up, I don't think there are any spotting telescopes that a regular person could have that could see it. Add to that, I think there may be a curve of the curve, but it is very slight. Think of a mound-shaped earth in a kind of snow globe.

       One thing I've wondered which supports the flat earth sun: the light from the sun set
       <em>
        follows
       </em>
       the sun, even as it disappears into the horizon following basic laws of perspective. The light is still there, not blocked by a turning away globe. When you see animations of the globe turning, it always looks like instant night from day, like in the snap of a finger, bright sunny day, then instant darkness. We don't see that, though.

       Do you mean anti-crepuscular rays? Those are pretty well explained on a the globe model. What are your thoughts on the

       Questions about that picture of the cloud: If the earth was curved, toward the horizon, I should see the
       <em>
        bottom
       </em>
       of a cloud as it bends away toward the horizon at an angle almost perpendicular to me. We don't see that. The clouds go into the horizon as if on a plane, getting smaller and smaller, still showing the same side toward the viewer, until they go off into the distance from perspective as if above a flat plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mile is 93,000,000 miles away, shouldn't the rays be parallel? I would think the shadow would be as well, but these shadows look like the bright object is just beyond the cloud. I took a flashlight and shined it on an object close, and got similar shadows, but the further I withdrew the light, the more and more parallel the shadows. Shouldn't that be the same with the sun? Similarly with the sun's rays when shining from behind a cloud, go off in many different angles. You would think, since it is that far, the rays should not shine so many angles, but should be about parallel.

       As in literally the bottom of the cloud? Can you show me the math showing the degree of tilt of the cloud towards the horizon?

       Then again, I do have a similar question. Depends on this though, do you believe the Moon to be flat or spherical?

       Because they are. Parallel lines that are slanted to you will appear to converge, but they don't. Just like how train tracks will appear to converge. This is, ironically, an effect of perspective. The same applies to the Sun's rays. Demonstration

       I was talking about the appearance of clouds into the horizon. Google image sesrch " stratus clouds horizon" and you'll see what I mean. The clouds appear to follow perspective into the hotizon, not over a curve. They act as though they are dissppearing over a mostly flat plane, with no curvature of the cloud cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Moon is special whether the earth is round or flat. How it got there and what is made of or in it is a mystery in either model. If gravity is phony, then there is no reason to think large objects must be spherical, so things may just be discs but I don't think the Moon is. It could be spherical in the flat earth theory, but might be much closer, and move along a yin-yang shape with the sun. It might give off its own cool cold light. If people walked on it, then I am Mickey Mouse.

        was talking about the appearance of clouds into the horizon. Google image sesrch " stratus clouds horizon" and you'll see what I mean. The clouds appear to follow perspective into the hotizon, not over a curve. They act as though they are dissppearing over a mostly flat plane, with no curvature of the cloud cover.
       </p>

       How much of a degree of tilt should we expect to see from the clouds?

        believe the Moon is special whether the earth is round or flat. How it got there and what is made of or in it is a mystery in either model. If gravity is phony, then there is no reason to think large objects must be spherical, so things may just be discs but I don't think the Moon is. It could be spherical in the flat earth theory, but might be much closer, and move along a yin-yang shape with the sun. It might give off its own cool cold light. If people walked on it, then I am Mickey Mouse.

      <p>
       So why would some objects in the sky appear as disks? Have you checked other subreddits such as r/astrophotography?

      <p>
       Since you don't believe the Moon to be flat, and I assume spherical, then why don't different observers at different positions see other phases of it?

       Also, a ying-yang orbit as in a circle? Do you believe that the AE map is accurate?

       The clouds are some 7 miles up, so yes, I would expect a high degree of tilt and the appearance of a curvature in the clouds at 8 inches squared per mile out, which would be quite far, if the horizon is 140 miles away looking out from Mount Fuji or other high vantage point. But alas, no curvature as far as the eye could see, not just the ground, but 7 or 10 miles up to the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there no curvature seen from the Baumgartner jump 120,000 feet up with a 425 mile away horizon with a supposed 22 mile drop of the curvature of the earth in every direction, and yet, the horizon rose to eye level even at that height, no curvature down? Every picture shows a high horizon but that shouldn't be. That's only possible if we are lied to about the size and/or shape of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the flat earth model, the moon illuminates itself. It may be translucent, as stars have been seen through it. Why is the moonlight cool and not warm, as in color temperature? If the moon were really reflecting sunlight, which bakes the earth in warm light, you would think it should reflect warm sunlight, but it doesn't.

       How could objects in the sky appear in 2D as disks? Why have the stars not moved, and have been mapped precisely for millennia all the while we move 600,000,000 miles per hour? Since we don't know what there was before the Big Bang, how could we know what stars could be if not balls of gas if we question what gravity is? Have you ever seen a star closely through a large telescope and not some CGI NASA fakery? I'm not sure, but they look more like bioluminescent creatures than balls of gas.
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       there is a dome and there are waters above it with creatures in it, how can you guess what they are made of and why they twirl in the sky? Because a book says the universe popped into existence and balls of gas have been burning since? Some imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe one magical explanation (gravity) but do not believe any other magical explanations are possible? Everyone says that people used to believe the earth was flat until someone came along and proposed another model which the elite, and by extension their peasantry, have favored and believed since... until another explanation comes along, and everyone is taught to believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AE map may be false, but evidence suggests it is closer to reality than the typical globe model. The AE map may be on a mound, which itself may be part of a larger sphere. I don't believe everything I have been taught nor everything I read, thank god. This may all be illusions but something isn't right. I want to figure it out more.
      </p>

       You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being

       If you, for some reason, don't trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon

       The clouds appear as if they are going off into the distance over a flat plane or the curve of a much larger earth than a curve 8 inches squared per mile. The clouds reflected in salt flats are reflected in a perfectly flat mirror image in the water. The clouds fade into perspective as if on a flat plane, showing no curvature. Why is that? Why do the clouds not show curvature at 25,000 feet, distance of 145 miles to horizon from Mount Fuji?

       Stars have been tracked since prehistory. We have been travelling 600 million miles per hour and those stars should have been travelling at that speed or more as well, in all directions.

       I'm not sure the AE map is the accurate model of earth, either. I think it is more accurate the closer to the center, the north pole, and maybe it should stretch more the further you get to the Antarctic ice wall (if the earth is flat or a mound).

       This is a simulation of what the curvature should look like on a ball versus flat, as you rise in altitude as if on a weather balloon. Notice the horizon always rises to meet the eye level on a flat earth, as it always does in reality.

       This is an image posted by NASA (upside down likely), at supposedly 249 miles altitude. If the left of the horizon is point A, and the right, point B, there would either be no measurable curvature, or only slight, but that distance should be over a thousands miles. The black at top and bottom are obviously added later (they forgot stars too)

       A look at you reddit history shows that you only have
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       posted about flat earth, never anything on any other topic. My answers have been sufficient for anyone else who could be reading this, and I will address their concerns in future comments, but I'm afraid I have stuff to do that don't involve the shape or size of the earth. I highly recommend trying it out.

       So, you didn't even look at the links that I sent you about your horizon "rising to eye level" stuff? Oh well, I'll post it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being
       <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">
        here.
       </a>
       Another one being from a plane like
       <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">
        here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you, for some reason, don't trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha6PeAVLpNo">
        being below the eye level of an obersver in a plane.
       </a>
       Here's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">
        another one.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, you don't need to rely on space agencies to take pictures of planets, stars, nebuelae and galaxies. I already linked you to r/astrophotography. All of those pics are taken by amateurs. If you, for some reason, believe that the images taken from those at the subreddit are fake, state your reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those images are
       <strong>
        far
       </strong>
       more credible than the distorted blob videos taken by flat earthers. They should learn how to focus a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say that the flat earth hypothesis is very entertaining.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       no.  The cloud would need to be tilted like 5-10 degrees at least before its tilt was visible to you, 5 degrees of tilt would take 100 miles distance to acheive.
      </p>
      <p>
       as wikipedia tells us:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#Distance_to_the_horizon">
        "For an observer standing on the ground with h = 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).  For an observer standing on a hill or tower of 100 metres (330 ft) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 36 kilometres (22 mi).  For an observer standing at the top of the Burj Khalifa (828 metres (2,717 ft) in height), the horizon is at a distance of 103 kilometres (64 mi)."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       so in most cases you would observe a tilt of 1 degree or less on a cloud on the horizon.

       Yes, yes they can. Try Youtube sometime. It's a place where people can upload their own videos, it's really cool. Consumer telescopes cannot see far enough to see across the whole world, and since you can see that the view becomes faded and misty only a few miles out, you can understand that the atmosphere would get in the way of seeing very far.

       this is a little beyond "the government" this is like most of the science the modern world is built on.  Serious thinkers have literally been laughing at flat earth century for hundreds of years, fucking

       figured out the earth is a sphere.  As far as i'm concerned you may as well be denying the existence of fire.

       When you look into a telescope and see a mountain range or an archipelago of small islands, the further you see, the bluer and more faded the islands get, until you can barely see the islands or mountains in the distance. Basically, the atmosphere gets in the way. Plus, who is to say there isn't a slight curvature, which would prevent distant sight of the distant continents, even if you could see them through the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at that Chicago skyline and ask yourself, why am I seeing those buildings point straight up instead of out an angle away from the viewer as if on a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the atmosphere and perspective prevents distant sight. There is  something literally called the "vanishing point" for a reason.

      <p>
       well the whole theory for one.  Secondly, if you're willing to accept their may be any curvature then why are you so skeptical about the measurements that have been done of the curvature, which come up spherical.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       i'm not, a line drawn directly up from their position would not intersect with one from the video's position above their perspectives, incidentally the line would intersect in the center of the earth and emerge from the other side the same distance apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       however the difference between the observer's straight up and the building's straight up is not visibly noticeable, as noted a line from each of us would exit the bottom of the earth no further apart than the res locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if the earth is approximately 8000 miles thick, and we were to take an elevator down from each of these positions, 40 miles from each other, that went
       <em>
        1,000 miles an hour
       </em>
       , it would take 4 hours for the elevators to intersect.  4 hours at a thousand miles an hour, to go 40 miles.  From one of those elevators do you not think the other would appear to be a perfectly straight line facing almost until the very moment of intersection?

       To the best of my understanding there are many varied beliefs - some do, some believe they're spherical, some believe they're contained within the firmament and some think they merely float above us.  Depends on who you ask and how they conduct their research.

       (According to majority of serious flat Earth models): The sun and moon are spheres, which both give off their own light, and travel within our atmosphere (beneath the firmament) in concentric circles around the center of the Earth (the "north pole").  They are only about 30 miles in circumference.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars are said to be fixed to the firmament,  but not spherical.  Planets are said to be some form of "wandering star," but not necessarily spherical, and not necessarily solid.

       Good question - happy to admit I'm not sure.  According to all the sources I've found humans haven't gone more than 10ish miles down if even that - if you have any more info I'd love to look at it.

       I don't have any info on that, I was seriously just asking.  I don't buy the flat earth theory, but I would like to hear what those who do have to say about its thickness.

       How deep have we drilled down in the globe? In the globe earth theory, we can only guess what's down beneath the crust. It's only speculation, same with flat earth theotists.

       I wonder how it's possible they haven't bothered to dig lower than a few miles. They should be able to tunnel deep into the mantle. They can only guess what's under there.

       There is always some excuse. I would probably be banned from those subs for genuinely asking ELI5 simple questions which are frequently met with hostility (even around here). I really would like to know how we can put people on the moon but we can't bore into the earth from surface down to surface, doesn't even have to go through the center, or how we can see galaxies in detail 15 billion light years away, but we are told we can't zoom into evidence of the moon landing sites. I ask people to explain like I'm 5, but many times they don't explain, just ridicule.

       Most flat earth models show more depth than there is distance up to the firmament/top of the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many such models place Hell under our feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should really be called "Flat top Earth," since almost no one believes in a disc.  Most models show something like an iceberg with a flat top (save for hills and valleys and oceans and what not), and plenty of mass going downwards from the surface.

       You mean adapting Eratosthenes experiment between Alexandria and Syene?  It doesn't prove the shape of the earth because this experiment would give the same result on both models.  The curve he witnessed in the shadow of the stick could be attributed to the spinning of the ball earth or the circular motion of the sun on the flat model - further physics experiments such as those done by Airy, Michelson, Gale, Sagnac, and Bradley prove the earth to be motionless while the celestial bodies move around us.

       Na man. If you are in the same longitude. And your at different places like the artic circle and the Tropic of Cancer. You can use basic sphere geometry and trigonometry to tell you where the shadows should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spinning of anything won't alter a shadow unless it is near the speed of lights

       what i find hilarious about this is that right now there are satellites
       <em>
        in orbit
       </em>
       transmitting this website to people (mostly people in planes, satellite internet is slow as shit cause of light speed lag).

       You don't believe we have antennas that can do that? It's all doable without satellites, especially if there is a dome to bounce signals off of.

       well but antennas only go so far because rock blocks them, and the earth is a sphere, so you can only put them so far apart before the signal gets blocked by the rock in between.  You can cheat a little with some wavelengths and get it to bounce off the atmosphere, but to do more than that you need a higher vantage point to mount your antennea and mountains are just too short.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats where your low earth orbit and your geosynchronous orbit satellites come in.  Now for total coverage it only takes a few, probably three, geosynchronous satellites to broadcast to every point on the earth (would only be one in a flat earth model).  But Geosynchronous orbit is really high up there, so its more expensive to stick satellites up there and the light delay lag is more noticeable.  LEO, or low earth orbit satellites are much closer to earth and consequently their orbital speed is much higher and they noticeably move (GEO satellites appear perfectly still).  LEOs cover a much smaller percent of the earths surface at any given time, so many more are needed for continuous coverage and the antennea which communicate with them has to track them and cnstantly hand off service from one part of the "constellation" to the next.

       Wonderful!  a easily testable experiment.  Firstly if we can bounce signals off the dome then we can determine its exact distance with simple division!  And secondly it means you can just get any old radio transmitter, point it into the sky and start transmitting, then based on when the echo from your own broadcast bounces back to you you'll be able to say just how tall the dome is.

       Who's to say some radio signals don't just get lost in the waters above and others, which the government has discovered around the time "satellites" came about, bounce back?

       well because a radio transmitter is omnidirectional, it releases its energy in a sphere.  Thus if we were in a sphere, at some point the transmission from
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       radio tower would hit the top from a point where the geometry bounced it directly back to its origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       again, this isn't something the government, though it would have to be
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       governments really,
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       control, cause
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       with a transmitter could prove there's a dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       also there'd be no such thing as gps.

       not sure what the irony is, thats
