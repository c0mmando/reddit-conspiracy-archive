Awakening out of the body and mind while still the body/mind consciousness remains. But now it does not box your awareness in it. Its the body/mind that is in awareness, not the other way around.</p>

<p>How? You see that the minds voice isnt you. Its mental projections and its personal identity isnt you. Nothing that has a form or is in time is you. If you see it begin and end it isnt what you essentially are. Our true nature is being. Not trying to be but simply self aware effortless awareness. All thoughts are known in you, awareness. Same for sensations and all of experience. Dont overlook yourself, dive in to the truth of your being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really decent synopsis bro. I lime it. Its true though. Breaking out of your little conditioned box of awareness is real close to the psychedelic exeperience especially but can be quite trippy in and of itseld becausw when you realize the shit going on and the fact that you have been lied too, the viel tears you realize there is what you used to know and there is what you know know and usually it is a huge gap in understanding. Most people underestimate what they <em>dont</em> know and of course over estimate what they do know &quot;<em>ego</em>&quot; the evil little problem societt considers their elephant in the room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are both correct and incorrect.</p>

<p>Tat tvam asi - thou art that.  Existence is holographic.</p>

<p>What that means is literally that &quot;everything is everything&quot;, and what <em>that</em> means is that although you are correct in saying that the ego-body-self (e.b.s.) is not the True Eternal Cosmic Holistic Universal Self - TECHUS - it is still at least a <em>part</em> of the TECHUS.  The e.b.s. <em>is</em> the TECHUS in that sense.  It&#39;s just an extremely minuscule, extremely vague, extremely distanted, extremely limited version of It.</p>

<p>And spiritual awakening <em>is</em> real - as you said.  The evolution of the identity - that self that exists independent of the physical vehicle - leads to TECHUS.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I would not think it needs to take many lifetimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doesn’t <em>need</em> to necessarily, but it would seem that on many occasions, it most assuredly <em>does</em> take many lifetimes to reach nonetheless.</p>

<p>We have to realize what reaching TECHUS status actually means, after all.  The TECHUS is, again, “The Eternal Cosmic Holistic Universal Self”.  That means that It is an identity (<em>the</em> Identity) that is functioning not only with the understanding of everything there is/ever was/ever will be in all of existence ever, but who actually IS all of those things - has the awareness and the identity of all of those things - simultaneously as well as one at a time, individually and collectively both.  This is a paradox I’m not sure the human mind can fully grasp, honestly.</p>

<p>One would imagine that the type of identity that needs to be sufficiently evolved to be able to grasp and realize <em>that</em> type of perspective - i.e. to be <em>everything</em> simultaneously (sheesh) - is grander than anything we can even come close to <em>imagining</em>, let alone actually being able to accomplish it in this or even many lifetimes.</p>

<p>The human vehicle, it would seems, is singularly incapable of grasping <em>that</em> level of grandiosity.  This isn’t to say that it cannot arrive at at least some type of <em>facsimile</em> of it.  I’m sure it can.  I’m sure all the great teachers of human history and lore, spiritual and otherwise (people like Buddha, Mohammad, Jesus, etc), might have risen to a bit higher level of realization and understanding than a lot of human beings…but even their level of “self-realization” is as nothing compared to that of, say, some being in some other solar system or galaxy who lives for perhaps ten thousand years or more years and who has A) not only some sort of internal, synaptic computing capability that is more powerful than all the super computers on planet Earth combined, but B) actually has the <em>wisdom</em> necessary to know how to actually USE and organize and make sense of all that understanding and ability and knowledge (because intelligence and wisdom, after all, are not necessarily one and the same thing).  THAT being would presumably be all that much closer to a real and accurate and true understanding of what real “God consciousness” really is.</p>

<p>And we are not even <em>close</em> to the capacity of this being that I just described here (a being, by the way, who is, of course, hypothetical, but that I don’t doubt actually <em>does</em> indeed exist somewhere in this cosmos).</p>

<p>I’m just spit-balling, of course, but everything I just said here seems to make sense to me at least in theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If one is really wanting truth truth will be shown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the thing, however:  Truth is ALWAYS being shown.  It’s just a question of whether we can understand and grasp what is always there being shown before of us or not.  The fact that we don’t understand what it is yet isn’t actually any fault of the truth.  It’s ours.</p>

<p>This is because truth is like that flower’s fragrance that doesn’t pick and chose who partakes of its aromatic fragrance.  Its fragrance is available to one and all who pass by and have the ability to smell what it offers.</p>

<p>It’s not a question of <em>wanting</em> to smell the fragrance.  If you have the necessary equipment, you <em>will</em> smell it regardless.  Someone with insufficient olfactory capabilities can pass right by an aromatic flower and not smell much of anything, while another with a far more developed sense of smell can smell the “truth” of the flower from far, far away.</p>

<p>Same thing with other types of truths.  We’ll understand them as we arrive at the necessary level of spiritual, mental, emotional, cranial, synoptic capabilities/evolution to understand those truths which had <em>always</em> been there all along and which were always being presented before us but that we were just not capable of understanding and receiving at the time for whatever reason.</p>

<p>You’re right in that there are some truths that, if one <em>wants</em> them bad enough, one can arrive at them.  Yes.  However, there are other truths, it seems, where desire alone is not enough to arrive at them (at least immediately and in the short term), and it doesn’t matter <em>how</em> bad we want to understand them.  We simply don’t have the equipment to adequately grasp them.</p>

<p>And then there are yet other truths that exist that we don’t even <em>know</em> that we are ignorant of.</p>

<p>Again, all kinds out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If truth of what we and everything else is is the most important thing for us then I see nothing that could keep us from striking through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would certainly like that to be the cased as well, but it seems to me that there are <em>many</em> things that can (and do) keep us from arriving at those greater levels of knowledge and wisdom that could improve our lot collectively and individually.  I imagine that we may/can <em>eventually</em> get through one way or the other.  I mean I’d like to think that it is a law of the universe that “What one is in fact ready for <em>no one</em> can deny them or withhold from her/him forever”, but it certainly does seem that we on this planet have been kept (and are being kept) from having a LOOOOT of information that we could certainly be having and made aware of.  They are things we are currently very ignorant about, however, because, among other things, A) the information is being withheld/sequestered by certain powerful (political/corporate/occult) forces, and B) we as a people/as a population aren’t coming together and working hard enough and diligently enough (individually and collectively) to <em>force</em> that truth and that knowledge to be released to us by those withholding it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Often the first stage is to wake up and the second is to wake down and this is like you said seeing that the body/mind/word and what we are is of the same universal substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One must be willing to work and move forward and address one’s growing understanding about the world and the universe one lives in in as many ways as possible so as to derive as much understanding and learning from it as one can on the way toward cosmic evolving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s build on this, for discussion. </p>

<p>Separating the ego from self and just &#39;being and chillin&#39;, wouldn&#39;t that be considered, in this societal construct, to be simply lazy? Sort of drive-less? Or going through life saying to yourself, &quot;this is good, I&#39;m ok&quot; as the world around you burns. Wouldn&#39;t that be a form of irresponsibility? That&#39;s something I feel the priestly classes (whatever they may be: Catholic/Christian priests/bishops/monks/sisters, Tibetan Buddhists, Sheikhs, Rabbis, Brahmans or Shamans) have the responsibility to do, but in this respect are either weak and cowardly, greedy or secretly love watching the world toil in mediocrity, in terms of its population&#39;s capabilities as a species. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love bulding on theoreticals just for discussion. </p>

<p>To preface this with let me start with a detour; I get what you&#39;re saying, and I actually had the <em>exact</em> same reaction to a friend&#39;s dad trying to explain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus">Epicurus</a> to me. </p>

<p>He said that according to Epicurus, the meaning of life is to live up in the mountain and simply don&#39;t give a shit -for example- if the city right on the feet of the mountain is burning due to war. Now, I&#39;ve never actually read so much as the guy&#39;s wikipedia page (that I just linked) but even then I could tell that was a bunch of BS. </p>

<p>If Epicurus was so smart to have lived 2 millenia ago and still have a wikipedia page, he never said that shit. First of all, war on the feet of the mountain <em>will affect you</em> no matter how many shits you give, that&#39;s a given. I&#39;m also gonna go ahead and guess that a person who sees a city full of civilians and pets burning and doesn&#39;t care, isn&#39;t much of a philosopher. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s Sodom and Ghomorra that&#39;s burning down by your mountain, there are bound to be some innocent babies and cats and dogs burning with all the sinners.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re in the same page, I agree with you; what I described above isn&#39;t my idea of a productive life either. However, I know that Epicurus may have also said: &quot;the fastest way to riches is the shedding of desire for material things&quot;. This I can quote because it is the one thing I happen to have read from Epicurus and I remember thinking &quot;this makes a lot more sense than the bullshit about not giving a shit about burning cities&quot;. </p>

<p>To sum up, I&#39;m not advocating laziness in all things or complete apathy. Just be lazy with the material things and focus on the important things in life: family, friends and fighting for your right to party. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not exactly what Tolle is saying, though. You ever seen a cat lay on the sun and not give a shit about anything chilling in the sun? That&#39;s what Eckhart Tolle is saying: unless you&#39;re currently hanging of a cliff, give yourself the time to unplug from the constant barrage of ego thoughts (&quot;I need those expensive new sneakers that I saw in that movie&quot;) and &quot;just be&quot;. Apparently, &quot;just be-ing&quot; includes feeling the life force running through your body, your limbs and enjoying the sensation. It actually kinda helps and as an anecdote I can tell you it works for me when I&#39;m trying to relax and think productive thoughts. </p>

<p>Now, my meaning of &quot;productive thoughts&quot; <del>may</del> will differ from yours, but as a way of getting where I want to be (in my case destressing from life in a shitty world circumstance and thinking what I perceive to be &quot;productive thoughts&quot; instead of &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhBHL3v4d3I">we&#39;re fucked</a> it&#39;s over, gg&quot;), it works. </p>

<p>Bottom line, if you don&#39;t chill you can&#39;t get your thoughts in order. If you can&#39;t get your thoughts in order and live in constant fear and doubt, it&#39;s harder to find any sollutions to the questions that bother you. BTW if you don&#39;t like to see the world toil in mediocrity, stop supporting mediocrity and ask for change. To quote father Gabriel from The Walking Dead: &quot;God will save Alexandria, because He has given us the courage to defend her ourselves&quot;.</p>

<p>tldr: there&#39;s no tldr, you asked for the long version. </p>

<p>Also its completely in line with Zen, your own awareness is Buddha nature, so simply realize your own awareness. Eventually it will transform, expand, loosen from the body, and you will realize the body/mind/ego are happening within awareness just like OP suggests.</p>

<p>Also you will start to transcend the human condition</p>

<p>Stoicism is one step lower on the ladder of enlightenment and self realization. Sure you have to reach an acceptance of things, but there&#39;s also a false acceptance that you have to be careful about, a sort of stoic apathy you can trick yourself into.</p>

<p>In a sense acceptance is on the level of personalty, but awareness is prior to and transcends the personality, it is above and beyond that truth, light, and core truth of most major spiritual paths that discuss enlightenment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, all up until the point when someone harms you, hurts you, causes you physical pain. That&#39;s a great test.</p>

<p>In Buddhism (which is the tradition I&#39;ve been practicing for 20 years) there is the concept of relative and absolute Bodhichitta - or the awakening of the heartmind. </p>

<p>Absolute Bodhichitta is loosely what you outlined in your original post. Relative Bodhichitta stipulates that while all things are impermanent and that there is no real self - this aspect of body mind that does exist requires certain conduct and behavior that requires compassion and intelligence to navigate in a skillful (Sanskrit: Kusala) way.</p>

<p>Or in other words. It&#39;s all good and well to peek behind the curtain and see the nature of phenomena. But you also have to live in the world and in the 1-99 years you might be around, it&#39;s up to you to be intelligent (Buddh) as to minimize suffering (Dhukkha) for yourself and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The absolute and the relative are not separate. From this perspective the bodymind is merged in its source and functions like automatically by the currents rising from the source. Pain and all of that is for the body and can be seen as challenging but unless it creates the separate self that is a subject to it it is just pain. Buddha nature is simultaneously one and detached from it.</p>

<p>&#39;Pain is for the body&#39; - show me a body without mind. Show me pain in the body without mental anguish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not asking you to prove anything. </p>

<p>The issue you have, however, is that you are stating what you believe to be truths and then saying that truth is not in any concept. So why bother opening your mouth or typing on a forum? What&#39;s &#39;in it for you&#39; to do that?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that comparisons of your ideas fall short when comparing them to others, it&#39;s that what you are saying falls short on its own.</p>

<p>Show me a line in the Nikayas or in the Triple basket where the Buddha says his teachings were not true. Certainly, he taught the fundamental emptiness of all phenomena, but at best, he said that his teachings were open to examination (read Kalama sutta for reference to &#39;free enquiry&#39;). And if you read that Sutta you will find that he points to a few &#39;universal truths&#39; that we (and the Kalamas) all agree with.</p>

<p>But, as far as my understanding goes, he never said his teachings were not truth. Heck, the fundamental premise of his teachings are called &quot;the four noble truths&quot;.</p>

<p>This is why I say it is apparent you don&#39;t have a fundamental grasp of Buddhadhamma yet.</p>

<p>I invite you to be careful with your words. Words that are not true, are lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, indeed. It&#39;s funny though right? Because words and concepts are pretty much all we have at the beginning - this is the basis of the first Jhana. We have to be able to fundamentally understand the conceptual framework before we can do away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was one of Bodhidharmas teachings. He also taught that the way is realised by one of two means, reason or practice. What is usually overlooked is reading between the lines of this teaching - that he is pointing to both of them simultaneously.</p>

<p>Arriving at understanding by way of practice and reasoning is vastly different to clinging to a dogma or a rule book.</p>

<p>You will also see in his teachings that &quot;one in a million becomes a Buddha on their own&quot;. And that a teacher is, in most cases, needed to instruct. I&#39;ll hazard a guess, and say that you&#39;ve never had a recognized teacher to guide you through the way?</p>

that, according to scientists and doctors,
it can attract demons to the body,
even to such an extent
that one can get into mental confusion or get visions.

    <div class="md"><p>You got that right :)</p>

<p>You speak like someone who is truly experiencing it. We are all spiritual beings having a brief physical experience. We are experiencing a shift in consciousness... moving from 3rd density awareness into 5th density... we are all dealing with past life karma and releasing trauma from our energy bodies.</p>

<p>The time is coming soon that everyone will be awake, and this will marked by a pulse from our sun, which originates at the galactic center. We will then be free to communicate directly with our positive ET soul families who are already here, and who are us.</p>

<p>Are guides are all speaking to us, and we have to be more aware of the energy of our thoughts and actions... You are right that nothing in our reality really exists beyond our perception of it. </p>

<p>We have to begin seeing past the false divisions and unite against the manipulators who have been ruling this planet for so long.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The minds voice isn&#39;t you&quot;. &quot;Nothing that has a form or is in time is you&quot;. </p>

<p>You are denying the fundamental truth that the body and mind are part of you. You can&#39;t have spiritual awakening without the body and mind going through a very real physiological transformation. The three are not separate. </p>

<p>Not all voices in the head are &quot;not yours&quot;. Sure, a good amount of them are entities and media programming, but there is most certainly your OWN voice speaking through the mind as well.</p>

<p>The mind, body and emotions are part of a system. Emotions are the Current coming from your Soul, the body is a conductor, and consciousness is the end product. Current + resistance = heat and light. The goal to gaining more consciousness is not to dissociate from your own mind/emotions and eliminate your very own Current, but to lower the resistance in your body. And you can only do this by fully owning your Ego and integrating the corresponding emotions with your body.</p>

<p>So what makes more sense: Holistic Integration, or &#39;floaty floaty I am not my body I am not my mind I am a floaty thingy&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the best way is to use every waking moment as a meditation. Work, school, traffic- whatever it is you are doing in the moment, be there fully in your body. You can be in charge of your body mind without being detached from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its true here. The bodymindworld appearance is made out of the essence and this essence is what everything is. The separate self is also within this appearance and made out of this essence. So I am not the separate self, I am the free essence but also at the same time this appearance is of me, but I cant be reduced to something within the appearance. The feeling that we are the separate self seems to hide the essence since a the appearance can not know the source which is the essence and substance of the appearance.

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve come to understand and pay attention to, is the &quot;nothing&quot; that I am.</p>

<p>What I mean, is that when I am sitting in quiet, and focusing on something, or reading something, or meditating without distractions, I AM the nothingness that is. </p>

<p>The eternal silent observer behind your eyes. When the ego is not present, and the mind is quiet without distraction or prejudice, the being I am is the eternal &quot;no-thing&quot;. </p>

<p>It is not separate from my mind or my existence. It just is. It has no feeling, or ability to decipher between &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. But it does seem to have a sense of what is &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot;. </p>

<p>Its hard to describe, but the quiet eternal nothingness that lives behind our egos is the true self. The concept of a &quot;me&quot; or an &quot;I&quot; is the deception. Building of self importance or the &quot;ego&quot; has been the purpose of consumerism, or of western society. 
It has had a very strong influence on creating a separation within us.</p>

<p>When learning to let the &quot;me&quot; go, I have been ever increasingly aware of the &quot;no-thing&quot; that I am. </p>

<p>We are all just the eternal nothingness, the silent observers, that really can only decipher between &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot;... Or &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.”  Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?”  Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.  What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”  Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”  Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?</p>

<p>“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony.  If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?  No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</p>

<p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.</p>

<p>“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.  Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed.  But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the Law of One: Ra Material </p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to share a &#39;strong insight&#39; that I had winter last year and hear other people&#39;s opinion about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been experiencing some very &#39;crazy&#39; episodes since 3 years, involving &#39;spiritual and esoteric&#39; things that many people might call bullshit, just as I never thought much about all that before experiencing it myself. Call it spiritual awakening, dark night of the soul, kundalini blablabla I&#39;m sure there is tons of different words.</p>

<p>That time I felt how something opened up around my solar plexus area and from there I felt sooo much love, so much love energy, the more I send out the more I had to share. It was like experiencing universal love for the first time. I could actually feel how this love radiated from me into my surroundings. I also cried a lot because I wanted everyone to feel this love. I know how it comes across but at that time I was like &#39;This is the solution to everything. This love is so powerful, its beyond good and evil, nothing has a chance against it&#39; (in relation to how helpless I felt about the state this world is in). It was like I was sending out this frequency of love and I saw how it influenced people around me. It was like experiencing first hand how reality shifted in front of me, how this love changed it. People started to tell me their traumatic stories which made me understand more what formed them into the person they are today. At some points I actually felt like this bright lamp attracting people towards me like mosquitos. I won&#39;t go into the details of feeling, seeing, hearing and this sense of premonition about understanding the underlying pattern of the things happening in front of me.</p>

<p>One anecdote I wanted to share is a conversation with a chiropractor that I had during that period. Partly because for me that was that kind of &#39;proof&#39; that whats happening with me is not just inside my bubble of reality, not just subjective, but touches other people&#39;s realities. I live in central Europe and thats the only real chiropractor from the US in my city. I&#39;ve seen him couple of times before and he was always nice and friendly. But this time I felt something was different the moment I entered. First thing he said was &#39;Wow your vibration is so high, you never have to worry about negative energies and entities latching onto you&#39;. He never ever said anything along those lines ever before, I was seriously surprised. Then he kept on going about seeing three different mediums all telling him the same about his past life and how he died in a plane crash in WWI. That his wife was a medium too, they have regular sessions where they record on tape what she &#39;channeled&#39;, that he has seen things levitating in space, blablabla a lot of these things, even invited me to join one day. We talked for about an hour. Normal session is like 15 minutes. When I walked out I apologized that it took so long and the secretary said, no problem. The next 5 clients all called and cancelled their appointment. </p>

<p>During that time I remembered when looking at certain people (mostly pictures, not people I knew personally etc.) they looked like reptilian, greenish. It felt foreign but not &#39;evil&#39;. And I had this strong feeling that reptilians are nothing more than humans who awakened their kundalini energy, or that there is some connection there. That if you &#39;perceive&#39; them through your third eye, higher senses, whatever, it may come across as foreign and dangerous. Just putting this out there for discussion.</p>

<p>I am not coming to some kind of conclusion, just wanted to share tiny little excerpts of the past years and my journey of trying to find out whats happening with me. And in no way do I feel good, part of me feels like utter shit and just want all this to end and be normal like everyone else, just be done with this life and see how the next one will be or whats after this one here. </p>

<p>But from observing my surroundings I have this strong feeling that we are on the right &#39;track&#39;. Especially the younger people (I&#39;m 26 myself), its like something is awakening in them, they feel this power to want to help the world but don&#39;t know how. A bit like some have special little superhero abilities that they are slowly rediscovering. Certain people around me, how much they changed the last years, the way they talk, the way they perceive the world, it&#39;s all coming together, it&#39;s hard to put into words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The absolute and the relative are not separate. From this perspective the bodymind is merged in its source and functions like automatically by the currents rising from the source. Pain and all of that is for the body and can be seen as challenging but unless it creates the separate self that is a subject to it it is just pain. Buddha nature is simultaneously one and detached from it.</p>
