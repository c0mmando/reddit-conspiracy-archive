Why can&#39;t we stop this from happening. Why are we so easily led to violence? Why can&#39;t we stand up to this problem? Doesn&#39;t anyone care? Even in my bones I feel the urge to shed blood and dominate. Why do we feel this? When will we transcend this animalistic urge to show force. Are we really just simply killing machines with some sort of consciousness. Are we higher than that? Are we just a warring breed of people? Should I accept this primal nature and destroy anything in my way? I don&#39;t know what to do guys. We uncover and we look and we dig and they still start wars. They are steps ahead of us. I&#39;m not giving up but I think this battle is going to a lot harder than any of us imagined. We are up against pure evil.</p>

<p>I remember about 1971, I was 19 years old, and a bunch of us went up into a mountain camp for a 3 day music and beer drinking festivus, the beer was stashed outside of the cabins in the snow.</p>

<p>One morning I went out the door of my cabin and looked around at my pine fresh top-of-the-world enviro landscape, and thought to myself that at that very moment good people were dying all over hot humid rice paddies of Vietnam for no purpose; that as I stood there I was responsible for not stopping the madness, it was me who had not done enough to make it stop.</p>

<p>That was nearly 50 years ago. </p>

<p>I have never had the power to make it stop, and it hasn&#39;t. This is madness. There is some deep, systemic, underlying evil that has been raging out of control for decades. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what we can do. I really don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Constitutional Convention. Founders left the door open to peacefully dismantle what they constructed - it is well past time to do that. Time to try the &quot;other option&quot; - anti-federalism. Hamilton and Madison were clearly wrong. Let&#39;s try Jefferson&#39;s approach. Vest power in the states and defund the federal government. No standing armies. This idea is so remote in time, so foreign to us as to be laughable, but look where the alternative has brought us - an economy based on perpetual war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Defunding the federal government is a cool idea. But it&#39;s tough. We would need to have people start identifying very closely with their states. And we need the states to become protective of their members and create the will to defend them from the feds, without a full on balkanization. We already see the glimmer of state revolt in the legalization of pot.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pretend to know how to make it happen, but if we could gut the federal govt to the point it was just an interstate road construction authority, it would make the world a much better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think balkanization in the traditional sense is likely in the US - it&#39;s not locally-ethnically homogeneous anywhere enough to go that route. We do already see glimmers of state revolt (sanctuary cities are another example), but until we overtly refocus from government <em>policy</em> to government <em>structure</em>, we&#39;re missing the point. The federal government is fundamentally broken - it is time to fix the structure. Most policy debates would (and should) naturally fall to the states.</p>

<p>It would take one generation of public school students to retrain the nationalist impulse into statist loyalty if that&#39;s what we consciously decided to do. I hate to say that, because of course people ought to use critical thinking and act on reason rather than indoctrination, but &lt;looks around&gt; yeah, that&#39;s not the way of it. If you convert the NFL from nationalist to statist conditioning, you could probably turn the tide in ten years rather than twenty.</p>

<p>For my part, I&#39;ve started to bring it up lately when people are searching for alternatives. Plant the seed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a People&#39;s Parliament. Sack ALL current politicians. Pick a Joe at random, pay them a living wage and ban Lobbyists. Ban war.  Remove religious doctrine from any government. Fair tax system. Sanction guilty multinationals. Tax TV advertising and proceeds fund health/ welfare. Research and provide personal renewable power to everyone. Fine/sanction all polluters heavily.
These are some of my utopian/ hippy ideals. 
These has to be some defining moment for the people on this Earth where we &quot;draw a red line&quot;. 
Corruption in the current system is becoming more exposed but people just accept this as the norm. We like our shiny things.We don&#39;t want to know that an 8 y.o Nigerian mines metals at risk of their life.
We follow vacuous models on IG more than we read about what these evil, corrupt, agenda-driven fucks are upto.
The Pentagon has the gall to tell it&#39;s people that it lost 50 trillion $ of their tax dollars and no one bats a fucking eyelid. 2 weeks later and everyone is clamoring for war again. 
Sorry if this seems like an incoherent rant but I agree with you dude. I feel that the snake has been kicked; it&#39;s really up to us, the people, to take back control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think balkanization in the traditional sense is likely in the US - it&#39;s not locally-ethnically homogeneous anywhere enough to go that route. We do already see glimmers of state revolt (sanctuary cities are another example), but until we overtly refocus from government <em>policy</em> to government <em>structure</em>, we&#39;re missing the point. The federal government is fundamentally broken - it is time to fix the structure. Most policy debates would (and should) naturally fall to the states.</p>

<p>It would take one generation of public school students to retrain the nationalist impulse into statist loyalty if that&#39;s what we consciously decided to do. I hate to say that, because of course people ought to use critical thinking and act on reason rather than indoctrination, but &lt;looks around&gt; yeah, that&#39;s not the way of it. If you convert the NFL from nationalist to statist conditioning, you could probably turn the tide in ten years rather than twenty.</p>

<p>For my part, I&#39;ve started to bring it up lately when people are searching for alternatives. Plant the seed.  </p>
