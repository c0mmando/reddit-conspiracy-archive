    <div class="md"><p>He warned Russia that he&#39;s gonna have a bunch of tomahawk missiles coming in so if they&#39;re flying around they better get far far away. It was a pretty risky move because of course Russia could&#39;ve tipped off Syria beforehand which they clearly did not even though they (Russia) condemned the attacks. Not that it would have mattered strategically. The target was the air base. Not the people on it. </p>

<p>Unfortunately some more news has come out since to wrote your comment and so far 9 civilians have reportedly been killed including 4 children. Not really sure what a bunch of kids are doing on an air base that was allegedly the source of a chemical weapon attack like not that long ago. Seems like bad parenting. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When the Nazis came for the communists,
I remained silent;
I was not a communist.</p>

<p>When they locked up the social democrats,
I remained silent;
I was not a social democrat.</p>

<p>When they came for the trade unionists,
I did not speak out;
I was not a trade unionist.</p>

<p>When they came for the Jews,
I remained silent;
I wasn&#39;t a Jew.</p>

<p>When they came for me,
there was no one left to speak out.</p>

<p>Just like to share that poem with you by Martin Niemoller.</p>

<p>It could easily be adapted for the current situation. </p>

<p>I hope his blind loyalty supporters figure this out soon.</p>

Any mention of objectionable material is met with denials, accusations, fake news and counter lies so the American people don&#39;t know who to believe.  People (Ron Paul and others) have been telling the American people for decades the Fed is a scam but guess what? We still have a Fed.   And remember, these guys are playing hardball. You&#39;re not allowed to just stand there and give away secrets that will cost them billions in profit but also could result in lynchings IF enough people ever began to believe it.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all OP begins by making the assertation that the chemical attack is a false flag by using the claim that the public information obviously points to a false flag, without going into any kind of detail what he means. Now to the points. Point 1 I agree with cause it seems this is where OP represents the facts of the situation (bombing location, targets, casualties, russias involvement). For point 2, what the hell does he mean by &quot;he just put Assad in check&quot;, this is just a assumption that Assad wont retaliate in any way, the other half of point 2 makes the case that this appeases his opponents and makes him look good even though in point 5 he completely glosses over the fact that Trump lied to his voters and just claims that his supporters will see the see the truth once the hysteria clears (I know I jumped points but the 2nd half of point 2 and point 5 show how OP is ignoring the negative of Trumps actions and embellishing the positive). Point 3 is a warmongering statement that I dont see how anyone should agree with, &quot;not fucking around with north korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well&quot; glad to see OP is so willing to start dealing with US adversarys with aggression, cause no way there would be backlash there. Point 4, since they bombed a syrian airstrip isnt that effectively crippling Assads air power consequently increasing the amount of air superiority Russia has over the region (this is more speculation since I do not know the infrastructure of Assads airforce and how much support Russia provides). Point 6 is just a opinion and really dosen&#39;t prove at all that Trump-Russia is false, all because Trump is being aggresive to a ally of Russia dosent mean that this just cleans the slate of his investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for sure but I would think probably not. If you&#39;re going to go through the trouble of demanding that they hand over all chemical weapons it would make sense that all facilities able to make it would have to be destroyed. </p>

<p>So they would have to start from scratch without drawing any attention to it. Build a lab, get all the ingredients, have scientists on hand that can mix it up. My best guess is if Assad used them, he lied and held on to some. It also could have been some other group (ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc...) that secured some from weapons cache from one of the areas they&#39;ve run over. Hell, the CIA could have provided them or another sympathetic country. Then again, there might not have even been a chemical a weapon used and it&#39;s all bullshit. We&#39;ll probably never get the real story much like Benghazi or the laundry list of other recent events unless someone leaks it. </p>

<p>Considering the options available, yes. Its him or US backed radical Islamist. Of course I think most people would perfer a blossoming democracy which respect the rights of women/minorities etc but the reality is that dropping bombs for years on a vulnerable society will convert many many people into radicals.

<p>It&#39;s not making any sense to me. IMO this is another big embarassment from him. Its still a mess. The international community is all over the place. Congress is asking if it was essentially even constitutional. The human in me is not pleased with more hasty destruction in response to death and destruction. What does the msm see in this?</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist in me wouldn&#39;t put it past Trump and Russia to stage this as a red herring to hide their relationship. There are several other plausable scenarios as well. All seem to me to be more likely than an Assad planned chemical attack.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real though, the media is the medium for all of the footage. Maybe they are happy that they still have power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to do a long write up on this because I spent a lot of time researching this over the last few days because, like you said, this doesn&#39;t add up. It doesn&#39;t pass the smell test. What I found is exactly what I expected from our government. </p>

<p>The Attack:</p>

<p>1) They were targeting a weapons depot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nusra_Front">Al-Nusra</a>. Al-Nusra is the rebranded Al-Qaeda leadership in Syria. We cut a deal with them and some other rebel groups, you can read about it in the wiki link above, that basically says if they don&#39;t target the West and focus on their fight in Syria, we&#39;ll give them weapons and more while turning a blind eye. Some of their members had small parts in the 9/11 planning. They are a rebel group and some of the rebel groups we are giving <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-equipment-idUSKCN0RP2HO20150926">money, guns, ammunition, vehicles and other supplies</a> to are working with them. Pay attention here, because the vehicles and vehicle supplies thing is going to be relevant.</p>

<p>But, when you boil this part down, we are indirectly funding the same people that flew two planes in to the world trade center and one into the pentagon which killed 2,996 people in 2011. This is what our government is and has been doing for some time in the middle east, funding rebel groups that get bored and turn their intentions on the West. Disgusting.</p>

<p>2) The aftermath of the sarin gas attack do not line up with other historical instances of sarin gas usage. When a weapon systems delivers a chemical payload like sarin gas they are not blowing anything up. The bomb/missle will detonate high above the target site and the gas will fall and settle in a wider area below (wind can shift this obviously). The affected area, once the gas settles, is highly toxic and cannot be entered for around <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp">24 hours while the gas dissipates</a>. The gas is heavier than air, so it typically settles and dissipates hours later. However, in this most recent attack, first responders were able to <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp">assist without ventilation</a>. Some did succumb to the nerve agent but most were able to recover, which is not in line with a targeted chemical attack of this nature. </p>

<p>It makes a lot more sense that the bombs that were dropped on the weapons depot that the Syrian forces were had sarin gas in it. Which makes sense, because on May 30th 2016 eight members of Al-Nusra were arrested in southern Turkey and they believed that they were trying to make sarin gas. However, they we&#39;re only carrying anti-freeze. Here is the kicker. <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/syrian-rebel-groups-sought-to-buy-materials-for-chemical-weapons-prosecutors-say.aspx?pageID=238&amp;amp;nID=54365&amp;amp;NewsCatID=341">They were subsequently found guilty of attempting to manufacture chemical weapons, as anti-freeze can be used to manufacture sarin gas.</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Adana+province+to+Idilba+province&amp;amp;oq=Adana+province+to+Idilba+province&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.7210j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Here is how long it says it will take to get between the province the Al-Nusra fighters were arrested in (Adama province) to the rebel stronghold in Idilba province</a>. About 5 hours away.</p>

<p>To summarize only what we know:</p>

<p>1) The attack does not gel with any previous sarin gas attack. Typically the areas are toxic and inaccessible to anyone with a respirator for about 24 hours. The goal of a chemical attack is for the gas to linger. Within 1 hour of the attack first responders were able to assist without a respirator to some trouble, but these areas should have been impossible to survive in without a respirator and suit at that time. The bombs dropped by Syria also don&#39;t gel with a chemical attack, it would have caused the gas to burn off faster and disperse quicker, which is what was reported. Sarin drops don&#39;t contain explosives, and they detonate high above the ground and let the gas settle. Syrian military claims they were dropping bombs on what they claimed was a weapons depot of Al-Nusra.</p>

<p>2) There is no motive for Syria to use chemical weapons on a war they are winning. On their own people. As we probably all know, they were ordered to disarm all chemical weapons in a <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12777.doc.htm">UN resolution in 2013</a>. Did they disarm all of it? Probably not. But they certainly would be under the microscope were they ever attempt something like this again. Assad is no saint, but that doesn&#39;t seem like a path anyone would take. It doesn&#39;t add up, it doesn&#39;t pass the smell test.</p>

<p>3) The rebels targeted by this Syrian operation are called Al-Nusra. They are a rebranded Al-Qaeda (see links above) and they have received vehicles and vehicle supplies, like anti-freeze, from the CIA either directly or through allied rebel groups. They struck a deal to not target Western countries in exchange for weapons, vehicles and supplies. They have been trying to make sarin gas for over a year now, with some of their fighters being convicted in international criminal courts and jailed for attempting to manufacture sarin gas specifically.</p>

<p>The rebel groups happen to be backed by the USA directly and indirectly. In my opinion, there isn&#39;t enough evidence to confidently say Syria carried out the attack. It seems much more likely that they were targeting a weapons depot of a UN recognized terrorist organization (the CIA calls them a friendly rebel group now) who have been pursuing chemical weapons for over a year. </p>

<p>What it looks like to me, is we just fired 70 Tomahawk missiles at a country that is fighting ISIS and a bunch of other rebel groups, and most likely did not drop chemical weapons on their own countrymen (this time at least).</p>

Kushner was a Mossad agent who placed Golan Cipel as the &quot;boyfriend&quot; of NJ Bov McGreevey - who put him on the NJ Homeland Security counsel - AND put Kushner in charge of the WTC rebuilding after 9/11 (i.e., in charge of the cover up.)</p>

<p>The &quot;Alt Right&quot; people have it all wrong - Trump is a literally, biological &quot;cuck&quot; - a cuckold. He pimped his own daughter out to the Israelis, spent 15 years doing their bidding, and now they are going to destroy his presidency.</p>

<p>We know him. Well. Have for decades. Many of us have friends or family who have worked for him and had been fucked over by him. We watched him firsthand inject his vile racism into the Central Park 5 and when he was proven factually wrong by DNA evidence he just doubled down on his lies. </p>

<p>What he&#39;s doing is nothing new. There&#39;s a reason that 80% of us voted against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the &quot;Trump is controlled by Putin&quot; comes from Trump kissing Putin&#39;s ass, the Russian interference in the election directly benefitting Trump, the numerous undisclosed meeting of Trump and Putin associates, and all of the lies Trump himself has said about having no connections to Russia (yet every week, at least 1 new connection is discovered)</p>

<p>But go ahead and say that this is due to the &quot;democrats&quot; egging Trump on. It&#39;s not possible that someone who is so vainly insecure that the only way they know how to respond to challenges/criticism/defeat is to attack tenfold might possibly see the events in Syria as a challenge and respond by a show of strength.

<p>To be quite honest, I thought it was just pro-trump people pushing that narrative (a lot of posts here have said that MSM is reporting on trump-russia collusion which is &quot;proof&quot; it&#39;s untrue) but now that I&#39;m seeing it here in an anti-trump context maybe it really is how people think.</p>

What people want are big organizations of &#39;the goodies&#39; and &#39;the baddies&#39; so they don&#39;t have to muster the effort to do their own investigating. For some people, &#39;the mainstream media&#39; (which in America seems to mean any large news organization that isn&#39;t fox) falls into &#39;the baddies&#39; category, so everything they say is just at the discretion of &#39;the baddies.&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact same with Donald Trump, where over the past few months people on this sub have been scratching their heads over weather the man is one of &#39;the goodies&#39; or &#39;the baddies.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is another possibility here: If Trump is in bed with Russia,  then Putin may have seen it as acceptable to throw Assad under the bus so that Trump can quiet dissent from his strongest critics.</p>

<p>Russia was adamant about defending Assad because the US wanted to use Syria to strengthen their influence in the region. If the US and Russian interests align, then Putin&#39;s motivation to deffend Assad is significantly diminished.</p>

<p>I think it will be very interesting to see what comes next. If the above theory is correct, I would expect to see an offensive against Assad turn around and demolish ISIS right after.</p>

<p>So you get &quot;Social Justice&quot; Marxism instead. After all, Google.com has no problem with tranny bathrooms because that doesn&#39;t really hurt the bottom line now does it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s adorable how you desperately pose as smarter and more sophisticated than your perceived enemies. Never say that Viacom, the corporation that makes your favorite snarky Democrat TV shows, don&#39;t know their target market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats propose stronger taxes on corporations and the rich to better redistribute the wealth and create a country with greater infrastructure, medical care and wellbeing. The Republicans want to gut healthcare and allow the corporations and banks to fuck over poor/lower middle class people across the country. That is a fact. Republican party best benefits the rich, and will continue to service the rich (as has been proven by policy) AND will regress in social issues such as sexism and racism - without inverted commas because they are real things. Yet, for some reason, people think Republicans are saving the people of this country from the democrats. I just don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheap labour is an inevitability, the question is the measures put in place to combat it. For example, the idea of a national living wage as opposed to the minimum wage - the latter of which a majority of Republicans want to decrease, whereas the former of which has been proposed by many democrats.  Add this to the tax and fiscal spending policies, as well as a litany of other indicators, and you have a bona fide guarantee that the Republicans are anti-working class, pro-corporatism and, ultimately, bad for America (unless you want an oligarchy, as in the case with the right&#39;s new best friend Russia). The democrats, whilst admittedly not perfect, represent the most working class- and middle class-friendly party in the dichotomy of American politics.</p>

<p>“All we have to do is replace Obama. …  We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don’t need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. … We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don’t need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate. […]</p>

<p>Pick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared.”

<p>Trump&#39;s (read: Bannon&#39;s) human centipedes are hilarious.</p>

<p>Steve Bannon thinks we are at war with &quot;expansionist&quot; Islam. This is exactly what he wanted. I suspect he was &quot;booted&quot; simply because Trump needs McMaster. And McMaster&#39;s a principled man who doesn&#39;t want to deal with Bannon&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Anyone with a half  a brain could have seen this coming from a mile away.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Look up Steve Bannon and the &quot;Fourth Turning&quot;.</p>

<p>He believes in cycles of &quot;crisis&quot; that result in <a href="https://youtu.be/0BSrJv0IpHY?t=10m38s">&quot;turnings&quot;</a>. The first 3 turnings were the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and WW2.</p>

<p>He thinks the next &quot;crisis&quot;/&quot;turning&quot; is now and that <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/FWXScQaZ2uI?t=7m31s">&quot;we are in an outright war&quot;.</a> He thinks that the longer we (the &quot;Judeo-Christian West&quot;) deny we are at war, the weaker we become against <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-dr-thomas-d-williams-february-25-2016?in=breitbart/sets/breitbart-news-daily-69#t=5:50">&quot;expansionist Islam and China&quot;.</a></strong> &quot;They are motivated. They’re arrogant. They’re on the march. And they think the Judeo-Christian West is on the retreat&quot;.</p>

<p>Wonder why Trump tough talks China so much? Or why Trump returned drone strike authority to the CIA and <strong>stopped disclosing how many US personnel are in Iraq/Syria?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>most of this debt won&#39;t be felt until your grandchildren are in college.  We don&#39;t pay for it, the HR department uses data from the birth and marriage and death certificates to calculate man hours that WILL be available to pay back the debts in 40, or 80 year increments.  The &quot;bond&quot; that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (non federal entity) &#39;buys&#39; (prints out of thin air notes equivalent to the value of the bond) is actually the promise to repay the debt by creating excess labor in the 40-80 year time span.</p>

<p>So I mean it&#39;s kinda cool being at the top of the pyramid scheme by being able to take advantage of NOT paying for anything the government does right now and just watch it slowly drip away... it&#39;s really our grandchildren at the bottom of the pyramid that will be dealing with severe austerity measures, a worthless dollar, and likely work camps to pay back the interest accrued by the &#39;loan&#39;.</p>

He is not very attractive and he has a very difficult time getting a woman to go to bed with him, but he has been very successful since the Iraq war began in 2003. He finds the names of young widows who lost their husbands, and the real good looking ones he treats real nice. Since they are grieving over their loss they are vulnerable and he eventually gets them into bed. Then he moves on to his next &quot;victim&quot;. Sad, really sad.</p>

And because it&#39;s pretty obvious Assad did not carry out the gas attack, it makes zero logical sense for him to do so and is virtual suicide considering the position he was in.  Why would he commit a war crime right on the eve of peace talks, just as he has all but wiped out Isis from Syria and both Trump and Tillerson have given tacit support to him remaining in power?  What sort of mental gymnastics would be required to even consider this as a benefit to Assad in anyway?</p>

<p>I am also HUGEly dissapointed in r/the_donald; i thought that just maybe this was a place where we could all pull together and discuss things freely. I was severely wrong seeing the amount of censorship taking place in the Syria threads. Nearly half of the comments have been deleted and i was <em>banned</em> for expressing my disappointment. I knew that BS was rampant in some of the less-savory corners of reddit but i never thought it would happen there.</p>

<p>Shame on you r/the_donald mods. Shame on you. You claimed to be above such things and just lost a lot of credibility with at least this independent thinker and i hope a bunch more.</p>

<p>The Russian narrative should be the least trusted narrative. The donald narrative will always pull the most extreme gymnastics to make it fit.
We can point the blame on other &quot;nefarious&quot; countries or non state actors. But every source I&#39;ve seen is click bait, ad ridden and not sourced.</p>

<p>Yes all these were downvoted to oblivion with no negative comments toward action. Weirdly I can&#39;t find these on there anymore, huh.</p>

<p>Well at least none of the comments are being removed... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory:</p>

<p>Trump is a narcissist. He wants to be accepted due to his huge ego. Many people who were friends of his have said this in the past. Most recently, howard stern came out and said Trump is the kind of guy who just wants to be accepted deep down inside, and wants people to like him. Stern also mentioned that he feels trump is probably miserable as president due to the constant negativity from the msm.</p>

<p>I think he made a deal with the devil(deep state, tptb, etc) - take out Assad like they did to gadaffi and sadam, and tptb will start to flip the narrative of trump in the public eye. They will make him seem like a more universally accepted president. </p>

<p>In exchange for this, Trump has to ease up on the Obama/surveillance scandal and pedo stuff. </p>

<p>In the end, trump gets what he wants. acceptance. And history will remember him as a good president that had a rough start.</p>

<p>TLDR; Trump agreed to take down Assad in exchange for sympathy from the higher ups that can change the media narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a perfect lesson in &quot;controlled opposition&quot;.  Think about how preoccupied and distracted trump supporters have been with the Russia collusion narrative.  Then shit like this slips through.  It&#39;s no coincidence that all these stories about the rise of Kushner coincide with Bannon&#39;s firing from the NSC and the Syrian airstrike.</p>

<p>Also, isn&#39;t it interesting that we were given the information about the exact amount missiles, the exact location of the strikes and the exact amount of casualties?  Troops involved in the operation don&#39;t even know that much. I mean, when does that ever happen during a military operation?</p>

<p>Furthermore, Alex Jones and his weird transition from supporting Ron Paul to supporting Trump raises alarms.  Do you think Ron Paul supports this?  Why isn&#39;t Alex listening to him instead of neocon trump?  Assad has been using chemical weapons this whole time, (possibly clandestinely supplied by the Russians) and all the sudden we give a shit?</p>

<p>The media in our country is in a shitstorm over a fake Russian interference with our election. This minor air-strike destroys that narrative.</p>

<p>The Russians at the base were warned ahead of time, but Moscow was not warned. This makes it look like USA is not coordinating with Moscow, when in fact, I am positive they are--Trump likes to be unpredictable. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that this war was pre-existing. </p>

This is all so fishy especially for a president that said he didn&#39;t want to mesa on foreign affairs. Same old story again and again.
Also, Asad may be guilty of this attack, but where are proofs ? Everybody rushed pointing the finger and trump pulls the trigger on his own. Where are UN resolutions about these kind of situations? </p>

I&#39;ll pretend to be outraged &amp; do a little sabre-rattling. That way, the pro-CIA Liberal types who are after your ass will totally rally to your side, they&#39;ll stop accusing you of being too friendly to Russia, &amp; later you can patch it up and say your statesmanlike intervention prevented World War III.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah people who can think for themselves rather than being told what to think should not apply. This was clear last night when the first comments were pouring in and expressing their outrage at this attack. They were mass banned and the thread wasn&#39;t under control until they came up with a bullshit power move script to tout.   You keep on lying to yourself all you like but don&#39;t spread that bullshit here </p>

<p>Seeing this just makes me lose hope. I didn&#39;t really care too much about him winning because I thought that at least we&#39;d avoid more conflict in the middle east. Well, fuck. I don&#39;t think presidents have the power to avoid it anymore. We don&#39;t vote for the people who make that decision I think.</p>

<p>Now we get to deal with his crazy bullshit and Syria on top of it. Good times.</p>
