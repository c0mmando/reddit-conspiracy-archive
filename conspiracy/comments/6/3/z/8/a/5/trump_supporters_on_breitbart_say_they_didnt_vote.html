</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if he &quot;loses&quot; support. He won the election. &quot;Support&quot; doesn&#39;t change anything. When Bush was president, Congress gave the Oval Office wartime powers that allowed the president to bomb whomever he or she wanted to at anytime without Congressional approval. Trump has found something much more entertaining than playing with twitter. How can anyone stop him from bombing other countries? </p>

<p>The Iran war is certainly scheduled in, they want to pick off Syria first, I believe that the Globalists really do want to impeach Trump and put one of their own puppets in power.</p>

<p>Banning guns is not on Trump&#39;s agenda, that&#39;s a Globalist plan, whereas Trump works for the Zionists</p>

The more I think about it, I&#39;m hoping it was a &quot;shot off the bow&quot;, planned for minimum casualties etc. to serve as a warning about the chemical attacks, and nothing more. Trump Criticized Obama in 2012 for not reacting firmly to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but hopefully his stance on regime change stays the same.</p>

<p>The chemical attacks were in 2013 not 2012. I don&#39;t know where you get your news but your grossly misinformed. Trump kept telling Obama <strong>not</strong> to retaliate. Here are some tweets AFTER the attack in 2013. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/339818069641801728">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/339818069641801728</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should stay the hell out of Syria, the &quot;rebels&quot; are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?ZERO</p>

<p>What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.</p>

<p>If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad!</p>

<p>How bad has our &quot;leader&quot; made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don&#39;t have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.</p>

<p>@realDonaldTrump mr trump would attack Syria or no?&quot;  No, lets make our country great again as they fight their war!</p>

<p>What I am saying is stay out of Syria.</p>

<p>The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A.</p>

<p>AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN &amp; FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!</p>

<p>There is no way you can&#39;t twist this around to claim he wanted Obama to act more &quot;firmly&quot;. That&#39;s revisionist history.</p>

<p>I suspect that group will be a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, there&#39;s also a large group of Trump supporters who are aware of false flags and Syria, and don&#39;t want us to get involved.  So some of the Democrats will calm down their attacks on Trump, and Trump will lose a large portion of his supporters.</p>
