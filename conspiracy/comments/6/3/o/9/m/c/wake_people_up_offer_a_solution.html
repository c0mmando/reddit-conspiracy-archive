       We've all done it. We all get mad at the sheeple for not waking up. For not listening to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, people know it's bad. Most people hate the government. But they don't want to waste their energy on what they see as a fruitless endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you propose a solution, the observation that it has not been implemented proves the conspiracy. Show people that we can have a banking system that works for them (a National Bank, like we had early in the Republic), and you won't have to share youtube videos about the Fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government could easily fund itself entirely without a dollar of tax revenue. We have the capacity to borrow tens of trillions of dollars, and there are projects we could build that offer double-digit returns to the builder (and create double-digit economic growth).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some examples of projects that would easily pay for themselves (and fund the federal government) while creating massive growth for the economy as a whole:

         That tells you a lot as to what the point of communities like this should be:

        <p>
         You're more of a threat when you can articulate a better way, than you are exposing how bad things currently are.

       Looks like I left a couple of good ideas out. Which is a good thing. Because it means I'm not the only one thinking about these kinds of solutions.

       You may want to look into thorium. It's much harder to weaponize, and much safer than the old 1st generation reactors.

       The development bank in particular is powerful. It's how we end the Fed.

       Telling people "hey, if we had hard currency and streamlined regulations and a better tax code, we'd have 7% economic growth due to efficiency gains by removing deadweight loss" is too abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling people "the government can fund itself by building a train that goes 700 mph" resonates with most people.

       This is so important. The TV is the worst mind control device they have. People are starting to look for the truth now, and you seem them reaching for people like Alex Jones or Young Turks.

       What they really need is a solution. A way out of the whole mess. And not in 50 years, but soon.

       A new financial order is one of the best solutions we can offer.

       Let's stop bullshitting about it, and start pooling our talents to create an advertisement campaign of short technical clips for each of these technological innovations - what talents do ya'll have?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can do mixing / audio production &amp; voicework - i am also very experienced with doing drafting and design with industry standard CAD software, like AutoCad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any multimedia people here?  People skilled with adobe premier?  Any graphic artists, modelers, animators? Can anybody make a good leader to create a deliverable list?  Anybody who can do a preliminary design for any of the technological advances listed above (OP)?  Can anybody do a somewhat detailed financial analysis about the project(s) (costs vs returns ect)?
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to sit idly - we can get this process started today and have real alternatives for people to look at other than bullshit NWO articles.

       Totally agree we need to look at solutions.  However, we need to SCRUTINIZE the connections of every solution - for example, the globalists are beginning to work through development banks.

       Sure. And that's why it's so important to look at the projects being done. Do they help humanity? Clean up the environment? Grow the economy for everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       These projects I'm proposing do all of those.

       Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square; on top of the wall she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech: “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings. But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand, since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you— when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. “Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me, since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord. Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”

       I've watched these and there are some really good ideas worth discussing. Also going back to something akin to Colonial Script or Alternative Forms of Currency Exchange.

       Great Post by the way, with the economy prepared to collapse and the money masters offering a solution to "fix it" we need a means to ignore those suggestions and come up with our own, after all...

       Looks like I left a couple of good ideas out. Which is a good thing. Because it means I'm not the only one thinking about these kinds of solutions.
