       If this subreddit is truly exposing all of   the deceit and corruption throughout the world, why hasn't it been shut down yet? There really is no punitive recourse that could occur. There are only 440,000 subscribers, only a fraction of which who would organize into any sort of opposition were this subreddit to be shut down. And it's hard to think that reddit is beyond the reach of the elites, given the amount of shilling that goes on across this wesbite. I don't see why those in control would allow such a forum to exist, a place which promotes active antagonism toward the oppressive control schemes. If this subreddit were to actually one day simply not exist anymore, what could be done?

       I mean every key stroke we do is logged by the NSA/CIA. But for the "Active" users of this sub I'm sure there is a little more attention paid, probably more so to people who post or make anti-narrative comments. I don't think the lurkers would get paid too much attention except that they visited the page. But for somebody like me I'm sure my account has been flagged for something or other.

       We probably all do. It is debatable how much they care about most of them, but without a doubt there is a mastigia folder out there, and it has my picture on it. And a threat assessment score. I have no illusions in that regard.

       I'm sure most of us are on the low threat level. I wonder how my vet status plays into it and what my job was while I served.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being in the military is what woke me up to the bullshit going on in the world. I miss my guys and the job its self but not the overall politics of being a service ember especially the way the culture has turned during the Obama years.

       Oh yeah, I doubt many of us have a concerning threat level, just making the point that it exists, and recording data to determine that threat is part of the reason boards like this are allowed to exist relatively unimpeded.

       Its better to let people point things out so that you can ridicule and make them out to be crazy rather than carrying out blatant censorship imo, which would draw even more attention. Hence the profession of the shill.

       But this page does expose corruption, it also exposes deceit and wrong-doing on many levels.

      <p>
       It hasn't been removed or closed down because ultimately it is still a small page, we are a page that has minimum impact on reddit or the internet. TPTB have no need to remove pages like r/conspiracy because the vast majority of people are still satisfied with MSM.

       We are a quarantine zone. They let forums like this exist to isolate opposition, otherwise we will go everywhere and make their jobs that much more expensive. Better to keep us in one place so they can keep an eye on us.

      <p>
       There is a secondary interest in using us for distribution of misinformation, but (I think they are starting to realize) that is like herding cats. The media is losing credibility and I think there is an effort to try and use places like this as more organic behaving channel for disinfo distribution.

       I'll admit, I don't buy into everything that gets posted on here. I do believe there's definitely more than meets the eye and that the political world leaders in the public eye are not at the top of the food chain. I also believe that the gods were a race of ancient aliens that bestowed the spark of sentience into our ancestors and that they had a hand in many technological advancements, so that may discredit a lot of what I say in many people's eyes, but I just don't buy into the whole Kharazi Mafia and occult/black magic/inherent "evil" of TPTB, I just think they're greedy humans who are willing to fuck over the majority of humanity to centralize their wealth and power. I just don't see why it all has to be so covert though. If the world's governments are really under their thumb why don't they go ahead and enslave us already?

       I always pictured it as forced labor camps and martial law, but I suppose if it's impossible to escape from their imposed system as it is then yeah I guess that's enslavement. Probably cheaper for them too since we do a lot of it to ourselves.

       I think it's probably the fact that it would still be too much of a red pill moment for a lot of people. However, if they can formulate a good excuse to do so at some point, i imagine they could go that route. Until then, trying to control the narrative is their plan.

       Public Relations, in much the same way David Icke goes on an on about Lizard People, in NYC the same way you're called an Anti-Semite because you criticize the Federal Reserve or Rothschild, in much the same way Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster get lumped in with False Flag Wars, 9/11, and other major historical events that have MAJOR implications.

       I find it fascinating that people are so obsessed with minutia.  People on this sub and others like T_D have put so much effort in believing that it doesn't matter what is fact or fiction.  What matters are only things that let them win their arguments.

       I certainly don't want to get into an argument over this, but if someone found out for the first time this year that there is a Deep State in the US that is in permanent control of government policy and controls the entire mainstream media, that's deeply impactful.   Learning that what you believed your entire life was a democracy is actually more like fascism (and that's before Trump came along!) was likely the most mid-shattering event I've ever had (except for having babies).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not meaningless when you're learning- and millions of people are waking up all over the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some food for thought, unless I misunderstood you. I get that your overall point is most people just want to argue, and that's true, but the underlying facts are deeply troubling.

       What's the point of any sub existing? Someone created it and others joined it so they could discuss the things that interest them. That is a useful purpose. It's naive though to think that this sub actually changes anything on a scale beyond the personal.

       “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum—even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.”  Norm Chomsky, How the world works.
