<p>We can identify several countries where atrocities are occurring, but forget all those, it&#39;s Assad in Syria who&#39;s so evil we must do something, now!  Just like Sadam was so evil it was in his country&#39;s best interest for him to be toppled.  Does that remind you of anything?  Assertions a dictator used chemical and mass destructive weapons, only for it to be proven false, as a means to an end: public support to meddle in another country, again.</p>

<p>Tired of this shit, and subs like /pics tripping over themselves to show pictures of hurt children from Syria.  Where&#39;s their picures of other heinous atrocities, though?</p>

Russia may have hacked the DNC and tried to influence our election, but no one bats an eye when China hacked our intelligence agency, or the CIA influencing foreign elections for decades.  Hell, they definitely don&#39;t want to talk about what an impact Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop had on our election and how it made Comey reopen the investigation a week before the election, that was what killed that campaign.</p>

<p>As the author himself concedes - &#39;if I had it to do over again, I might not headline that article “Seymour Hersh Says Hillary Approved Sending Libya’s Sarin to Syrian Rebels”, but instead, something like “Seymour Hersh Makes Vague Allegations About Sarin in Syria.”&#39;</p>

<p>Everyone here jabbers on about mainstream media lies, but one article from a Infowars level source that promotes chemtrails, trutherism, anti-vax, global warming is made up, elites are <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/genetically-modified-organisms-gmos-planned-sterilization-of-humanity/5511206">sterilising people through GMOs</a> etc.</p>

<p>But hey, we don&#39;t like Hillary Clinton, and the article says Hillary Clinton did something evil. Since I already know Hillary Clinton to be  evil, it naturally follows that the article is true! Regardless of the content of the story, regardless of the trustworthiness of the source. Upvote away!</p>

There ARE people bitching about them being the largest exporter of Wahhabi terrorism. The ARE people who want to cut them off so they will shrivel up and die. </p>

<p>You&#39;d see people wondering why Israel doesn&#39;t complain about the Saudis. Why ISIS never bothers to attack Israel. </p>

<p>You see people who believe Iran&#39;s only threat is the fact that they are an energy superpower who happens to like Russia more than us. People who see that America and Israel want a different pipeline than the Russians because otherwise it will hurt the Petrodollar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. He has already deployed troops in Syria, and has at many points talked about aggressively attacking ISIS, who are in Syria. The question now is whether he attacks Assad. Considering his response to the attack during a joint conference with the King of Joedan, it seems likely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I will tell you that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me – big impact,” Trump said in the White House Rose Garden. “My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much … You’re now talking about a whole different level.</p>

<p>Trump also left the door open to new action in Syria. &quot;You will see,&quot; Trump said when asked if he would take new action, according to pool reporters present when the President welcomed King Abdullah to the Oval Office.</p>

<p>&quot;These are very troubled times in the Middle East, and we see what happened just recently yesterday in Syria -- horrible. Horrible, horrible thing. Unspeakable.</p>

<p>The other link presents questionable information. I really doubt Syria managed to shoot down an Israeli fighter. I don&#39;t doubt that Israel did attack in Syria, but according to your article: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, both Israeli and foreign media have reported a number of Israeli airstrikes inside Syria targeting arms convoys of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>One of the projectiles was intercepted north of Jerusalem by Israel&#39;s Arrow air defence system.</p>

<p>In recent years, both Israeli and foreign media have reported a number of Israeli airstrikes inside Syria targeting arms convoys of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In January 2015, Jerusalem was blamed for an airstrike which killed six Hezbollah fighters and Iranian general Mohammad Ali Allah-Dadi in a Syrian-controlled area of the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it funny how all the countries that don&#39;t want to use the petrodollar / oil pipeline (through Syria) are &quot;the bad guys&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pro tip: children are killed everywhere, even in the USA (!). One day, someone might take an interest in US gang violence (hint: Chicago) &amp; accuse the US government of standing by whilst children are murdered, thus choose to bomb the cr*p out of America &amp; instigate a regime change. </p>

<p>Sounds implausible? It is, only because the USA remains the premier military powerhouse &amp; can therefor impose its own hypocrisy on the world. I needn&#39;t even mention America&#39;s own bloodshed around the planet, nor the actions of its &quot;greatest ally&quot; Israel in Palestine where murder is commonplace - whilst Europe itself has now become a hub of violence, rape &amp; murder committed by brown immigrant invaders who were imported here by political regimes which America backs militarily with NATO (Merkel, for example). </p>

<p>One rule for us, another for them. Some things never change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many more children will die in another US-led regime change war? This is madness watching this unfold. Not one pundit I&#39;ve seen so far even explores the possibility that ISIS was responsible for the attack. </p>

<p>Is Assad an authoritarian? Yes. Is Assad a good guy? Probably not. Would it make sense for Assad to use chemical weapons on his own people right after the current US administration declared they had no intention of toppling his regime? Think about it. We&#39;ve seen how shit with Saddam and Gaddafi went down. An action like this would certainly invite a military invention that would lead eventually to the death of Assad. </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make sense. Frequenters of this sub, <strong>this</strong> is the false flag we have been anticipating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prior to all the present hype and propaganda, Assad was a well liked and high ranking Syrian with an MD and who specialized in Ophthalmology in England where he met the pretty wife he eventually married that had been born and raised in London by her Syrian parents. </p>

<p>That was still the general opinion of him even after his elder brother was killed in an accident and the presidency of Syria fell to him. In fact everyone in Syria was looking forward to better times under him because of that particular background and even while he was starting to be vilified in earnest by the western mass media confirmed their overwhelming support for him in two major referendums just to prove that.</p>

<p>Now the most significant piece of news about Syria just prior to the 180 degree shift that suddenly began to be voiced against him by all the western mass media was the discovery of the largest natural gas deposit ever found on the entire planet just off the Syrian coast. </p>

<p>A find of inestimable value that Assad wasn&#39;t about to invite any US or it&#39;s allies companies to help develop because of their support for Israel and past Syrian conflicts with Israel over the Golan Heights and all the difficulties thrust upon Syria in trying to take care of and find a place for the over two million Palestinian refugees that the Israelis had quite literally driven out of their homes, off their lands, and over the border into Syria at gunpoint vowing to kill them if they ever tried to return. </p>

<p>The only other nation with the kind of technology, resources and expertise necessary to develop that enormous resource was, of course, Russia with companies like Gazprom and who was a long time partner in trade and only too willing to help.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s the roots of the geopolitical/resource war/refugee crisis phoney Arab spring, civil war, Russian involvement, etc. etc.</p>

<p>The end game is the same as Libya only it was the Chinese that saw their billion dollar contracts with Gadhafi to further develop his country&#39;s oil fields over any western companies get torn up by the rebels the same western nations those companies hailed from all backed in return for their own oil companies getting to move in and completely take that over once the Chinese had been cut out of the picture. </p>

<p>Once again an Arab country refusing to deal with western nations and it&#39;s major companies due to their unequivocal support for Israel and it&#39;s ongoing crimes against other Arabs that they themselves are not simply being condemned, undermined, and brutally attacked for, but having their most valuable resources literally stolen out from beneath their feet and to the even greater detriment to their own citizens.</p>
