The MSM reports that the US is backing off &quot;regime change&quot; in order to wipe out ISIS and then we&#39;re supposed to believe Assad saw this as an opportunity to use the chemical weapons <em>he already relinquished</em> on some of his own civilians?

<li><p>Syria, with Russia&#39;s help, is winning against ISIS. Why would Assad use chemical weapons when he has nothing to gain and everything to lose?</p></li>
<li><p>This comes on the heels of the Dirty Rice Scandal</p></li>
<li><p>This comes the day before an international conference about the situation in Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>The USA, Syria, and Russia all concluded that the chemical weapons had been destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Sarin is fucking nasty, and it sticks around for a while. The White Hats showed up <em>without any protection immediately after the chemical weapons had been deployed</em>. They should be dead, along with the victims.</p></li>
<li><p>We know the &quot;Moderate Rebels&quot; have no compunctions about using chemical weapons themselves so long as they have a supplier. We also know that the US has funded these rebels through the CIA with resources, money, and weapons.</p></li>
<li><p>An anti-Assad reporter tweeted about a media campaign covering the use of chemical weapons by Assad <em>a full day before it happened</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One of these is a blip. Two is a coincidence. Three is suspicious. Four brings serious doubt. Five just about seals the deal. <strong>I have seven.</strong></p>

<p>Trump stance changed 180. Hes ready to go into there too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read about Assad many times, however to please you i will also google on the spot, which unfortunately for you yields many positives....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[He] brought in all these social networking mechanisms -- Facebook and the Internet,&quot; Landis said. &quot;The Internet had been band in Syria. He brought in newspapers. He legalized satellite TV. He allowed Syrians to connect with the world, become educated to the ways of the world and begin to see the flaws in the Syrian system. ... By opening up Syria to the world, a very closed society, he didn&#39;t realize he was sowing his own demise ... and that&#39;s why there is revolution today.&quot;</p>

<p>The protests are not against Assad the man, Landis said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not around his personal character, it really isn&#39;t. And one of the tragedies of this is you&#39;ve got a fairly decent guy who&#39;s trapped in a really bad regime,&quot; he said. &quot;Syrians liked him, many Syrians did, as a person. They didn&#39;t like the system. ... They found him sympathetic and they were hoping that he would be able to put a chicken in every pot.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Look, I&#39;m not saying Assad is a miracle man. I&#39;m not claiming hes the best.... I&#39;m just saying, in comparison especially, he was good for the area and the general public continues to prefer him the power over the US promised shit storm that is ensuing. We are doing more harm than Assad at this time. Before our meddling Syria was overwhelmingly peaceful and an array of religions lived together, largely without issue</p>

<p>You might think he used chemicals just the other day, which is not proven....and I&#39;ll ask you to consider this... Does this attack make sense? With Assad seeming to get negotiations with the US and after years potentially having a favorable situation, doesn it make any sense that he would do the one thing that would turn the international community against him? Didn&#39;t John Kerry state recently that the chemical weapons have been entirely removed? Isnt it proven that the rebels have chemical weapons and they have used them? Its also possible no-one used chemical weapons because the other possibility, according to Russia is that the bombs they dropped damaged a factory that contained the chemicals that are being spoken of..</p>

<p>IMO,  Assad is absolutely the best option for Syria at this time and we should allow the Syrians make their own decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are pretending that if we don&#39;t meddle, then Assad is simply chosen by the people. That&#39;s completely absurd. Do you know anything about the religious demographics over there? He isn&#39;t, nor has he ever been, the people&#39;s choice. You are buying into Trump administration propaganda. You are even using the same language.</p>

<p>The CIA isn&#39;t much in the business of torturing and killing US citizens either. There would be way too much blowback when discovered. Its not in their power interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so set the standard. If that&#39;s the standard, how many other countries should we overthrow? Saudi Arabia? Half of Africa? Venezuela? North Korea? China? </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t go around looking for trouble and the Middle East is a perfect example. We have made the region exponentially worse. By overthrowing Saddam we created incredible instability and destroyed a regional threat, only to allow a global threat to replace it. By trying to overthrow Assad we have allowed ISIS to have much more power in Syria and surrounding countries, in some cases we literally end up helping them and arming them by getting involved with &quot;moderate rebels&quot; who then lose power and their weapons and moneys are lost to ISIS, Al Nusra and others. We are involving ourselves in unwinnable situations that literally perpetuate themselves. For every 1 terrorist we kill, we may create 10 more extremists who lost family in friends as collateral damage. For every leader of a country we over throw we allow another worse group to take their place.</p>

<p>You speak of blowback but I think you are naive to believe it would come primarily from torture when the conditions we create contribute much more to blowback on their own. For once an administration is (almost) advocating non-intervention. I am not following &quot;Trump propaganda&quot; I am following the principals I have had since before GWB and the principals liberals used to hold near and dear. You are the one blinded by party lines here. Clinton and Obama have slowly pulled you away from advocating peace, and pulled you under the murky waters of &quot;USA approved freedom.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some really simplistic and, frankly, lazy thinking here. For instance, you want me to set a &quot;standard&quot;. That&#39;s trying to artificially simplify very complex situations. You accept some simplistic calculus about terrorist creation. You don&#39;t address the fact that they are going to be &quot;created&quot; in ways that have nothing to do with us. You hope that he will do &quot;ANYTHING different&quot;, ignoring the fact that there are far more ways to make things worse than better and he is so ignorant he&#39;s almost certainly going to choose one. Btw, he&#39;s about to go to war over there. He always wanted to. He&#39;s been building up troops for a month already and now he&#39;s pretending he changed his mind on Assad, even though Assad already used chemical weapons once. Its clearly an excuse. </p>

<p>The point is that you need to look into the history of Assad&#39;s regime and thoughtfully compare it to the rest of the world. Its clearly been among the nastiest dictatorships for a long time. There is a reason this sociopath has chemical weapons when most of the region doesn&#39;t. There is a reason he&#39;s used them when most of the region doesn&#39;t. His secret police is brutal. They torture and disappear political opponents.</p>

<p>You have no idea what my views are and you are being incredibly lazy talking about me being &quot;blinded by party lines&quot;. That&#39;s absurd. Its a lazy way of dismissing what I&#39;m saying. I believe in getting at the truth and understanding that foreign policy is hard. There are actual bad people in the world that must be dealt with. That much of foreign policy involves finding the least worst path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I am not advocating for Trump. I am advocating for non-intervention. You keep acting like I am defending Trump. If he makes a decision I don&#39;t like I will not support that decision as I have done in the past. I&#39;m not saying Assad is a goody-two-shoes. I&#39;m saying the region seems to be better off (and we seem to be better off) when we don&#39;t intervene. Was Saddam better than ISIS? that&#39;s an impossible question to answer, but one is clearly affecting a larger populous. Same goes with Assad; is he better than ISIS? Probably not, but he is democratically elected, regardless of what your opinion is of it... and our intervention seems to only help ISIS grow their influence, make Syria worse, and gain the US enemies. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Trump, although half of his rhetoric is better than we&#39;ve had previously (the other half is just like Bush and Obama.) that doesn&#39;t mean I agree with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How far back are we going? Would Iran be a better place if we didnt install the Shah? yes in my opinion, more than likely.... Would Syria be a better place to live if we didnt try to oust Assad? I think so, and from what I can see, so do a majority of people living there. Syria was one of the nicer places in the ME to live.... Would the ME be a better place overall? I have no way to know but I do know that we haven&#39;t helped... all we&#39;ve done is gotten ourselves involved, given another generation of war torn youth a reason to hate us, and taken down any powerful(and possibly bad) leader that stands in the way of ISIS. It&#39;s like another Vietnam in a way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US isn&#39;t responsible for what&#39;s happening in Syria. He was murdering his protesters and they started a civil war. The protests were part of a broad movement in the Middle East. But these are precisely the kinds of events that you can&#39;t predict when you make claims like that Iran would be better off without the Shah. They were certainly flourishing under the Shah. That Islamic revolution really hurt their development and growth. </p>

<p>Its very easy to say the US did X thing I didn&#39;t like and Y was the result I don&#39;t like <em>and pretend that&#39;s all you need.</em> Its not. What would the result be like if the US didn&#39;t intervene? It certainly wouldn&#39;t have stayed the same. Sometimes we intervene and places do better than before. Sometimes worse. There is a tremendous selection bias towards them doing worse though. We are far more likely to intervene if its already going poorly, like in Libya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that. I really don&#39;t feel like we should intervene even if it could potentially make things better because the potential negative consequences, IMO historically are far more likely. Especially in the ME. We have been intervening there for over 60 years, our past 4 presidents have bombed Iraq and it just continues to get worse... Maybe it will be even worse without us there but at least we wouldn&#39;t be involved or blamed and we wouldn&#39;t destroy our own country financially so Exxon mobile can pretend to care about children while paving the way for an oil pipeline. We&#39;ve been trying intervention for a long long time. I think it&#39;s time to try something else.</p>

Fog of war is a real thing, yet it also allows claims to be debunked without real proof. I do know that Syria is the murkiest fog imaginable, and I don&#39;t know what to believe. </p>

<p>The CIA cannot be trusted; I don&#39;t believe this means that every significant US-related world event is somehow always a CIA operation. Do people trust Assad and Putin simply because they directly counter every US IC/media claim? At times it seems like that. I&#39;ll go as far as to say that the popularity of this Syria attack hoax thing is exactly what the GRU and/or Assad&#39;s regime would hope for-- a popular American-based english-language web board floating their exact claims as &quot;the real truth.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely a false flag attack by US/CIA backed jihadists. Strategically for Assad it would make zero sense to gas his own people right now. I see this as part of the deep state escalating the tensions with Russia and feeding the war machine. We already are in a psuedo-proxy war with Russia over Assad. The media has been manufacturing consent with nonstop &quot;evil Russian&quot; propaganda, and now this will be the conflict that brings us into direct confrontation with them. It&#39;s sickening how blatant and obvious this all is </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that may be irrelevant, but I will add anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Khan Sheikhoun, where the incident - whatever it was - took place is a small town <strong>on Syria&#39;s single main highway</strong> the M5, linking Damascus to Aleppo. </p></li>
<li><p>there is very, very little coverage as to how the incident took place. There are claims that an aeroplane was heard sometime before people started falling over, but that&#39;s (1) pretty vague and (2) not part of the main media dialogue. </p></li>
<li><p>the stories coming out of Turkey, the BBC and the anglo-american media in general are inconsistent. For example, Turkey is claiming a chlorine attack - but there is no skin damage on the victims - while more to the west the claim is sarin - but the response is impossible and the first responders should be dead. Effectively there has been no statement of which chemical was used. </p></li>
<li><p>If we look at the latest situation map <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/March%2030EDITS%20COT.pdf">http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/March%2030EDITS%20COT.pdf</a> and especially read note #6, we can see that Khan Sheikhoun is just behind &quot;Hay’at Tahrir a-Sham and Ahrar a-Sham&quot;&#39;s (i.e. rebranded Al-Qaeda&#39;s) front line, advancing southwards to Hama. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to suggest that it could have been a transportation crash or disaster, on the main highway. </p>

<p>Probably not, it would be insane for either side to use chemical weapons other than as a false flag, but it is an idea. </p>
