        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/63cx2p/1984_to_be_screened_by_cinemas_worldwide_in/">Link to thread</a></p>

<p>Some highly upvoted comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The general opinion in the comments is that this is a crappy, click bait article. Yet it&#39;s getting upvoted to the very front page of Reddit. Pretty interesting </p>

<p>It&#39;s so obviously artificial. There is no way the subscribers here are in agreement with this. It&#39;s mind boggling </p>

<p>Such a click bait title... less than 200 cinemas spread across 5 countries is a far cry from &#39;worldwide&#39;.</p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t Trump who expanded government surveillance and opened the gates of cross-department information sharing for the NSA... So I&#39;m not sure what showing 1984 has to do with Trump.</p>

<p>Yeah if Obama was supposed to be the &#39;good guy&#39; then why did things get worse on his watch? Why was the Patriot Act renewed? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget about how he aggressively pursued whistle blowers. That was swept under the rug. People were so mesmerized by his &quot;cool&quot; persona, they didn&#39;t notice the shady dealings. </p>

<p>People seriously need to take a closer look at just how intertwined the Democratic party is with the mainstream media. It became really obvious just how close a lot of the top figures in media, as well as media celebrities in general, were to Democratic politicians during the Obama administration and this last election cycle. </p>

<p>Yeah this whole 1984 thing is pretty cringe. It just sounds like a bunch of lefties trying to be edgy. The comparisons are pretty fuckin slim. And as stated, it&#39;s a shit movie. </p>

<p>Trump had nothing to do with mass surveillance and the NSA, and 1984 is about the dangers of Far-Left Socialism run amok. If they were trying to do a Trump protest, they completely missed the mark.</p>

<p>I can only speak from experience. When I was in college, I was part of a small branch of Friends of Israel. I assure you, it wasn&#39;t the Trumpers that were harassing us at a daily basis. It wasn&#39;t the conservatives who tried to &quot;no-platform&quot; even our in-group speaker sessions. The hatred, hurt, and censorship the left shows whenever anything dares to challenge its ideology in any way is what truly resembles the &quot;1984&quot; depicted in the movie. Did everyone see r/all today? What the hell is r/BlueMidterm2018? There&#39;s a new left-wing sub every fucking day now. Where are all these subscribers coming from?</p>

<p>It is crazy... so many anti-trump subs with a low subscriber count getting to the front page</p>

<p>All those surveillance programs governments around the world implemented over last 20 years? Yep, all Trump&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>The funniest part is how often 1984 was referenced during Obama&#39;s term, yet any talk of it was shut down and called &quot;conservative conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how &#39;woke&#39; people apparently have become since Trump was elected. Why are these systems that have been in place for decades only now a problem?</p>

<p>The scariest part is how many people are buying into it. How many people hate him just to hate him. How many people protest without a true reason other than to protest. There&#39;s plenty to actually protest about, but a lot of this shit is just nonsense.</p>

<p>Surveillance of American citizens increased significantly under Obama but it is Trump&#39;s fault. Got it.</p>

<p>Welcome to Reddit 2017, remember we LOVE GW Bush now and we hate Wikileaks.</p>

<p>This is great. Because someone has to stop Trump. He created the NSA and Prism. The CIA and Vault7. All this surveillance that Trump has started. I&#39;m glad Obama is getting us to see the scariness of a Trump presidency and a surveillance state.</p>

<p>Coming from a former leftie.</p>

<p>The authoritarian left appropriating Orwell to attack a political opponent that defeated an establishment political class who has legalized unwarranted surveillance on American citizens, legalizing the arrest of Americans without charge and indefinite detainment without charge, giving the president the ability to bypass congress and attack another country by declaring &#39;international martial law&#39;, spying on political opponents, pushing endless hit pieces against political opponents.</p>

<p>If you support the Clintons, McCains, Obamas, Bushes, Kerry&#39;s (All who ran for presidency, all who are best of friends) and you think you&#39;re part of the &#39;resistance&#39; you need to get your damn head checked. They are the ones who have pushed more authoritarian policies than any president, and the fact that Orwell is now being appropriated by them to act like Trump is the Authoritarian, the one outsider who represents a giant middle finger by the American working class. (The true working class that actually do shit jobs, not the writer who&#39;s poor because no one is buying their dumb books.)</p>

<p>The only good thing about this is that people will read or watch 1984 and realize that they&#39;ve been getting fucked in the ass for the past 16+ years and being fed a scam. Trump&#39;s not perfect, he might not even be good, but he&#39;s a million times better than the ISIS-funding, saudi-backed corrupt political class who feel they are entitled to running the country.</p>

<p>that&#39;s ironic, because 1984 would be extremely fitting for what the anti-trump mass media is doing right now, shameless propaganda</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brave New World is a right wing dystopian future. 1984 is a left wing dystopian future. At least get your dystopian future movie protests right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really glad to come to this thread and see others agreeing that this is a lefty edgelord move. I stand behind NO politician, but Obama did more to further the spy state than Trump has, obviously. Bullshit move and a really poor film. Recommend reading the book, lots if folks can do it in one sitting!</p>
