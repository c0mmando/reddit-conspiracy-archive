       So yesterday, while I was waiting for my girlfriend at the bus station, I noticed that a lot of cars where parking behind the lodge (the lodge is the old hotel HARDIA) and they had a flag with the Knights Templar cross on raised. Plus, I walked by some of them and they where wearing a pin with the square and compass.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I was wondering if the 3th of April has a meaning to the Freemasons or if anyone else noticed a gathering at a lodge close to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm looking for some sources to read more about the masons, so if you have any or can send me in the right direction I would appreciate it

       This is the first time I have seen them meet, and I have lived here for 3 months now and walk by the lodge for at least 4-6 times a day, so maybe they don't meet to often here, but everybody who showed up was old, so they might not have to much energy for it

       The lodge near me meet at least every 2 weeks. It's just a load of dickheads hanging out. No world wide conspiracy happening at mason lodges, they are basically working men's clubs full of middle class boring fucks and small business owners

       The higher levels are very different. Among the general population, less than 1% are masons. Among the powerful, it's often 20% or more. There's certainly a concentration of power.

       I would personally love to be a part of this, partly because of it being so old an secret, partly because of what they (officially) stand for, I like those principles, the philosophy is really interesting and I think there is a lot to learn from it and the people.

       That's the hook. It sounds like a fraternal brotherhood of people trying to make the world a better place. And centuries ago, it may have been. But it's not anymore, certainly not at the top.

       I would suggest reading Manly P Hall, then. He will give you a much better explanation of the esotericism than most lodges, and you don't have to swear blood oaths.

       York Rite lodges meet usually at least once a month sometimes they go dark ( which means no meetings )during winter months, blue lodges meet anywhere from 1 to 4 times a month.

       Sometimes meetings are not held during the holidays so that people can be with their families so not having meetings since December is not a surprise and actually I would guess they haven't had a meeting since the middle of November

       Most Masons aren't privileged enough to be involved with conspiracy tasks. Their knowledge is so compartmentalized and they'll even change their message to a Mason from rank to rank. This is why it's so absurd when a Mason tries to defend their organization as if they know what's going on at each degree.

       Interesting, I haven't thought about the fact that their tasks change with their degree. But it makes sense that the lower degree Masons don't even have an idea about what is going on in the top ranks

       This is a common claim on

       . Of course, there's no way to prove or disprove it. All I can say is that I've been a Mason for nearly 30 years. I'm a Master Mason, Past Master of my lodge, a member of my Grand Lodge, 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite, and PHP of my Royal Arch Chapter (part of the York Rite). In that time and in those positions, I haven't seen anything to give me reason to believe anything nefarious is going on.

       You are the typical Mason that we speak of. I don't mean to be rude, but if you're going to join an organization like that why don't you do any real research first? Go read Manly P. Hall's "The Secret Teachings of All Ages", and Albert Pike's "Morals and Dogma".
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know jack about what's going on because you're not important enough to them. If you're not already in a position of authority, power and wealth it's not likely they would initiate you into higher degrees. Also, if you've shown compassion for others or faith in Jesus Christ they'll likely keep you at a lower degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know who you're really important to? Us. Humanity. God. Start your own secret society based on love, peace and goodwill toward all. You don't need secret handshakes, symbols, passwords or jewelry to do something big and wonderful in this world that will lead others back to the light. You only need love and empathy.

If you can't conceive of such a thing, then you're not approaching the issue scientifically. This is known as the 'Principle of Falsifiability', and is central to rational thinking.

       You haven't read both and comprehended the material or you wouldn't be trying to convince someone who is much more learned in these subjects to change their mind. There is no "hypothetical evidence" that could change my mind because so many events, stories and occult philosophy ties the conspiracy together. Even if you shot down 99% of my sources I'd still be concerned for the welfare of humanity over the welfare of your secret society.

       [Mason here] Its unclear where you're located. Be aware that my comments are from an American perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       April 3 has no particular Masonic significance. That you've not seen much activity at the lodge may be a due to the time you pass by - most hold meetings in the evening hours on a weeknight. Generally, there's a meeting once a month (though around here, we 'go dark' for July and August), and there may be extra meetings on different nights. In this case, a local York Rite body was apparently having one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The YR is an appendant body of Masonry, which Master Masons can join if they wish. There are many such appendant bodies, the other two well known ones being the Scottish Rite and the Shriners.

       Neither. I was just interested by the philosophy, and that it was so old, yet still going.

      <p>
       I'm a software engineer, and its a welcome piece of stability compared to my work life,, where anything I learned more than 5 years ago is ancient history. In Masonry, I can pick up a 100 year old book and its actually still useful.

       an announcement would be made to them, but you would know that if you were learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       To just show up would be rude.

      <p>
       Tell me who would announce you to them.

       Thank you for your comments, I take a look at r/freemasonry tonight and read some more about it.
If you don't mind me asking, what was the reason for you to join the Freemasons?

       Is common in other countries that they consistent of multiple strains? I always believe that they where more united because of their secrecy, like you said, you could to a completely different town, and still be treated like a 'brother' in this society

       Freemasonry has no central, over all organization. However, the large majority of Masons are in a loose grouping of Grand Lodges which have mutual recognition, and can intervisit freely.

       My friend is a Mason and a small business owner. He told me his lodge is made up of mostly local small business owners who try to look out for each other and help each other with legal stuff and local chamber of commerce stuff.

       Manly P Hall is a good somewhat pro-masonry source. Bill Cooper's Mystery Babylon series is a good anti-masonry source.

       Albert Pike's writings are particularly interesting, because he was so high up in the organization.

       If you're looking for a very basic outline, the first 3 degrees are called the "Blue Lodge." After that, you can join the York Rite (the Templars are the highest degree) or the Scottish Rite (goes up to 33 degrees). Once you complete those, you can join the Shrine.

      <p>
       There are tons of variations and supplemental groups, and each jurisdiction might be different, but those are the major groups to understand.

       You guys are missing the chronological history here. The Masons weren't an evil organization to begin with, they were infiltrated at the top by evil. It doesn't mean that every Mason is involved in that evil aspect. Likewise, it's not any proof or evidence when a random user claims to be a 33rd degree Mason and never saw anything malicious occurring.

       Freemasonry hides its evil in boring old men. The deal is the high ups between 1-5 percent actually know what they are about. Don't fall for the lie that they are nothing because they look like nothing that is what the people hiding amount them want you to think.
