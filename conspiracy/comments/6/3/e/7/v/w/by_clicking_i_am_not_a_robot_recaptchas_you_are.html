    <div class="md"><p>I do use reCaptcha all the time (easier or mostly lazier than most other captchas), that being said, my point was we saw in the last week multiple news article and threads relating to the bill that is going (has?) to be repealed letting ISPs basically sell your info, which they did prior to november probably. The law doesn&#39;t do much in terms of its goal and it isn&#39;t a fair law for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It helps because it allows smaller businesses a chance to compete with bigger businesses such as Google Fiber for example. </p>

<p>This bill was tbh blown out of proportion in my honest opinion. </p>

<p>I do however agree that selling information is not right, or okay. It has become the status que, normalized. It&#39;s something we need to change as a whole. I think we should make it so it&#39;s illegal for every company to sell our statistic information. But if we don&#39;t do that, then we have to make it fair for every company to do that, so they can compete. If we don&#39;t it creates unfair situations where a big company like Google has a huge advantage. </p>

<p>Google does btw sell products, work with companies that sell products, and has stuff that costs money (unlike what people are saying here). All of which sell your data. They act as if Google isn&#39;t one of the biggest companies in the world, and just a search browser. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and explain this further. Google, Facebook, and multiple other companies sell your statistical information. They do not only sell your statistical information to ad companies. They sell it to ISP&#39;s. That means, they choose which ISP they are going to sell it too. That ISP can now sell your information to target you with ads. Other smaller ISP&#39;s will not get sold this information. Creating an unfair advantage. </p>

<p>Not only that but Google has Google Fiber. Because of this, they could also make an unfair advantage to other companies. </p>

<p>You can also call, write, email, and opt-out of this. So people saying, &quot;you can&#39;t opt out of the internet&quot;, well you can still opt-out of selling of your privacy. </p>

<p>Now, yet again I&#39;m not saying any of this is right. We should make more laws to protect our privacy against ALL companies. This way our privacy is safe, and all companies are on an even playing field. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some of this is backwards. And also google fiber is going away. They stopped expanding it and are already looking into alternatives, but regardless google fiber is a small example of google acting as an ISP. Lets consider Comcast, Cablevision, TimeWarner, the rest of the big players. They dont provide the content you see. They provide you the means to get to that content, the backbone. Google, websites, facebook, they are the ones who end up showing you what you see on your screen. So what do the ISPs get from Google selling your information to them?
I wont claim to know all the inner workings and back room dealings between the major tech players and the ISPs, but I do work in the industry so I have a basic+ understanding of some of it. </p>

<p>You talk about other smaller ISPs. They don&#39;t really exist. Thats one of the major problems. ISPs have created a ridiculous monopoly over access to the internet. Take cellular for example. Sure there are smaller companies than Verizon, ATT, Sprint and Tmo, but most of them just piggy back off the big guys infrastructure, or service remote areas. They have already been pushed out of the market, so theres no unfair advantage against them there, certainly not by that bill. </p>

<p>I think there should be separate legislation and regulation for the ISPs as well as other tech companies, but I don&#39;t lump them into the same category and therefore don&#39;t feel that the same legislation is applicable to them. </p>

<p>Most utility services are monopolies. But that doesnt mean that other products that consume or use those utilities fall under the same umbrella as them. If you Gas/Oil provider in your town is the only option you have, I dont feel that your Oven or water heater should be legislated under the same rules as them, they dont have much to do with one another. </p>

<p>Whats worse than all of this however is Net Neutrality. By losing that, then we will see more of the collaboration between ISPs and the major internet companies because by working together they will have complete and udder control over what you can consume. they could also work against each other in this sense, for example if for some reason the ISPs wanted to restrict your access to facebook because they fell out of love with each other, they would be able to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are paid services that google provides but many that used by every day people are free. E.g., google maps, gmail, google search engine, android OS, etc. And even though google does collect data from paying customers that use services like paid gmail, google play, google music, youtube red, etc., people can opt out of using them and thus being tracked. Alternatively same is not true when it comes ISP&#39;s due to the limit amount of them in any given market.          </p>

<p>And yeah, the data they are selling is just data part of generally analytics and trends. They are not selling individual user data. The issue is that ISPs have been fucking us for years. The government gave them money to continue fucking us but at least with better and stable services, which they did not provide. And now the government of the people just said &quot;keep on fucking the people and here is more cash on top.&quot; At least with google, their services are getting better. It just sucks giving something up and getting nothing in return. </p>

<p>You can call your internet provider, and opt-out from them selling your data. </p>

<p>This will help smaller businesses, which I explained <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63e7vw/by_clicking_i_am_not_a_robot_recaptchas_you_are/dftsuck/">here</a> creating more of a market. Not only that but you can opt-out. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to bet that they work out a way that allows them to stop your service unless you agree to them selling your info.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No it won&#39;t.  When Google Fiber tried, which has failed in many areas and is failing in general, they found themselves in battles to even be able to use utility poles that the big guys like Comcast negotiated into being the only ones able to use them.  Another thing they liked to do was increase everyone&#39;s speeds in areas where Google Fiber was.  So not many people switched.  Lots of other reasons too.  Keep in mind this was Google throwing their money at it and it failed.  Essentially the monopolies in their given areas do everything they can to prevent competition.  There are no &quot;smaller businesses&quot; that are going to be able to get into this game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only that but you can opt-out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I&#39;ve said in other posts.  I would bet that Comcast and the other monopolies will figure out a way that if you opt out you don&#39;t have service.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that this is okay. Like in that comment, I don&#39;t think we should allow any company to sell any information, that way we protect our privacy while everyone has an even playing field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CAPTCHA was mostly made to avoid large unsuspected data to be entered as a host. Bots in fact contribute to have a large percentage on the internet, so having CAPTCHA is to continue to avoid a bot to process as a human. Thus emphasizing &quot;I am not a robot*. The only thing abbot can&#39;t do is input information randomly selected by the program. Injection is hard to implement if it&#39;s needing a user to input the correct verification and or needs to submit verification of images (this is were google improves there database and AI to train to understand human logic). </p>

<p>The only way a bot can actually penetrate a CAPTCHA if it&#39;s an AI who shares the equal amount of information the CAPTCHA program runs, basically knowing it&#39;s admin codes.</p>

<p>You can call your internet provider, and opt-out from them selling your data. </p>

<p>Alternatively same is not true when it comes ISP&#39;s due to the limit amount of them in any given market.</p>

<p>This will help smaller businesses, which I explained <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63e7vw/by_clicking_i_am_not_a_robot_recaptchas_you_are/dftsuck/">here</a> creating more of a market. Not only that but you can opt-out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that this is okay. Like in that comment, I don&#39;t think we should allow any company to sell any information, that way we protect our privacy while everyone has an even playing field. </p>
