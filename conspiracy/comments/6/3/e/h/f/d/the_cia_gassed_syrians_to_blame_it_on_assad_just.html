    <div class="md"><p>When I heard the report, I shared the same thoughts as you.  If you think about it, the US gets a 2-fer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We look reasonable.  We just let Assad off the hook.  But now, we are compelled to act.  How can we not?  The US cares deeply about deaths of innocent civilians and the world will see us as heroes for coming to the rescue.</p></li>
<li><p>We get rid of Assad.  This has been on our to-do list for a while.</p></li>

<p>If you and I are correct, this is really a beautifully crafted false-flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, not that I doubt that the CIA perpetrates a number of things to meet whatever ends, but it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t groups with their own individual agency that eagerly engage in acts of terrorism well outside the realm or reach in international intelligence organizations. Reducing instances of terrorism to a simple extension of the CIA does nothing in the way of understanding how grass roots domestic terrorist groups or more international bodies motivate themselves against a particular target, engage the local populace or fringe groups in also becoming militant, etc. </p>

<p>It just seems so vague to say &#39;CIA <em>this,</em> CIA <em>that</em> when there&#39;s plenty of groups abroad who act on their own accord without any outside involvement behind it. A vague definition or understanding of terrorism as always being perpetrated for the sake of false flags doesn&#39;t necessarily help treat the symptoms of those who are in a position where they&#39;re able to be radicalized because it instead says, &#39;look those terrorists are bad guys, but secretly they&#39;re always being enabled by THESE guys and there&#39;s *nothing we can do!&#39;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re playing the <strong>Chemical Weapons Card</strong> against Assad - AGAIN?</p>

<p>Remember Obama&#39;s &quot;Red Line&quot; threat - promising to embroil the US fully in Syria if Assad used Chemical Weapons &quot;again&quot;?</p>

<p>Remember the Sarin Gas attack on Ghouta - in which Syria supposedly &quot;crossed&quot; that &quot;Red Line&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you know why Obama did NOT send in US forces as promised?</p>

<p><strong><em>Because the attack was NOT launched by Assad - but by Syrian &quot;rebels&quot; who had been trained and equipped by the CIA and Mossad in Jordan.</em></strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/IAgSw">Archive of Jerusalem Post article</a></p>

<p>It was a false-flag that was botched SO BADLY that everyone saw it for what it was: British Parliament balked first - and refused to authorize intervention - this was followed by members of the US House and senate who quickly abandoned ship - all but a handful of the most devoted Zionists.</p>

<p>If Obama had gone forward, the whole plan would have been no doubt EXPOSED, so he had NO CHOICE but to back down - and luckily for him PUTIN allowed him to save face by offering a &quot;compromise&quot;: Syria will voluntarily turn over ALL chemical weapons to International Authorities - AND THEY DID - under the watchful eye of UN inspectors.</p>

<p>So Assad has no Sarin or other CW&#39;s - and even if he did, WHY would he use them, knowing the consequences? <strong><em>He wouldn&#39;t</em></strong> - and neither would Putin.</p>

<p>This is a STUPID PLOY to try to get the US to run head-long into Syria.</p>

<p>Well, why not ask the common folk? You know, the ones that HAD fairly stable <strong><em>secular</em></strong> governments, decent economies, infrastructure, etc that the US destroyed in their aggression. These people ALSO had friends and family - until many were killed or displaced - either by the US war machine OR by the wild-eyed Religious Jihadists that swooped in to FILL THE POWER VACUUM created by the unjustified US wars...</p>

<p>Could we ask THOSE people? Or at least the survivors?</p>

<p>Yes, Saddam was backed by the US when he was fighting Iran... we gave/sold him the chemical weapons he used on the Iranians and the Kurds. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Meaning what? That we should take out the bastards that we helped put in power at the expense of THE INNOCENT PEOPLE? How many hundreds of thousands of CIVILIAN lives is a dictator worth, anyway? In the case of Syria, what - half a million - SO FAR - not counting the number of displaced and refugees?</p>

<p>On the contrary - our involvement in the region is to serve the interests of Israel. It&#39;s been that way for decades. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vCYjXUu.png">Here&#39;s a handy map that will save me a fair amount of typing.</a></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the days of the Cold War - Russia is not the Soviet Union - they were robbed and raped and damn near bankrupted by the criminal MOB of vultures that FEASTED on whatever wealth the Soviets had - many of whom were &quot;relatives&quot; of the Bolshevik bastards that overthrew the Czar and started the Soviet Union in the first place - and the Bolsheviks were financed and supported by the SAME PEOPLE that brought us ISRAEL - the Rothschilds and their Zionist pals.</p>

<p>Wait - you&#39;re accusing RUSSIA of causing the flood of immigrants into Europe? The ones that have flooded in from Syria, Iraq, Africa, Afghanistan, etc? The countries that WE destabilized?</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll let this lovely and talented lady tell you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFE0qAiofMQ">who masterminded the refugee flood.</a>. Two minutes of your time for a WORLD of enlightenment! What a bargain!</p>

<p>With their positions in the region, Russia could EASILY enforce a no fly zone over Israel.</p>

<p>But that would start WW3 - so that&#39;s not likely to happen.</p>

<p>If Sarin Gas was used in Syria yesterday, it was done by ISRAEL and/or its<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">** Golems**</a>. It was NOT by Assad or Russia.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy is not a good strategy in the long run.</p>

<p>&quot;According to Iraqi documents, assistance in developing chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France. A report stated that Dutch, Australian, Italian, French and both West and East German companies were involved in the export of raw materials to Iraqi chemical weapons factories. <strong>Declassified CIA documents show that the United States was providing reconnaissance intelligence to Iraq around 1987–88 which was then used to launch chemical weapon attacks on Iranian troops and that CIA fully knew that chemical weapons would be deployed and sarin attacks followed.</strong></p>

<p>On 21 March 1986, the United Nations Security Council made a declaration stating that &#39;members are profoundly concerned by the unanimous conclusion of the specialists that chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian troops, and the members of the Council strongly condemn this continued use of chemical weapons in clear violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which prohibits the use in war of chemical weapons.&#39; <strong>The United States was the only member who voted against the issuance of this statement.</strong> A mission to the region in 1988 found evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and was condemned in Security Council Resolution 612.</p>

<p>According to Walter Lang, senior defence intelligence officer for the US Defense Intelligence Agency at the time, &quot;the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern&quot; to Reagan and his aides, because they &quot;were desperate to make sure that Iraq did not lose.&quot; He claimed that the Defense Intelligence Agency &quot;would have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians, but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in the Iraqi struggle for survival&quot;.<strong>The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports of the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww, there wasn&#39;t a &quot;deep strategic concern&quot; from Reagan about what a US puppet state was doing to the Russian puppet state? Meanwhile Reagan during this time period was also addressing Afghanistan. Where Russia was leveling cities, towns and villages to the ground. Dropping &quot;soviet toys of death&quot; for children to pick up. The Russians killed 2 million civilians and displaced 7 million people (US-Afghanistan war: 26,000 civilians) </p>

<p>In hindsight, yes mistakes where made. But the context is is equally important if not more. And that doesn&#39;t mitigate future generations of responsibility.</p>

<p>If Trump takes us to conflict in Syria I hope he gets called out after campaigning on an non-interventionist foreign policy and being against the Middle East wars. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so everyone knows, Bush ran on a non-interventionist platform in 2000, and I don&#39;t think I saw anyone call him on it.  Although, he has 9/11 as an excuse to kick off what Dick Cheney predicted in his 1994 Quagmire rant on why they didn&#39;t take out Saddam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He sure did. So did Barack Obama. Being against the Iraq war was a major part of his campaign. As Ron Paul has pointed out the anti-war candidate is usually the most popular.

<p>Yup, and that&#39;s the issue, just because I think the Russian narrative is BS by the deep state, doesn&#39;t make me a Trump support.  I like Glenn Greenwald&#39;s point, there is a lot of other aspects to criticize Trump over that don&#39;t require me trusting the CIA or any agentcy who didn&#39;t have direct access to the DNC server.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know and agree, but the official public narrative is that we simply support the &quot;moderate rebels&quot; and would never put <a href="https://youtu.be/2sxcsrCJlJU">&quot;boots on the ground&quot;</a>.

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to infer that trump will do something in Syria because Obama wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m simply saying trump is more likely to send a couple thousand US soldiers into Syria because Obama wouldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - it&#39;s so transparent, but people will fall for it. NPR was going on about the faces of dead children this morning - quote: their lifeless eyes staring skyward.... They&#39;re trying hard to sell us on this war, but Americans don&#39;t want it. They&#39;re going to have to up the ante sadly, probably with some false flag on US soil. Finally - just from a strategic point of view - we&#39;re to believe that Assad used the ultimate option and only took out 58 mostly civilians? He used gas on his people in a clear invitation for US intervention to take out one small pocket of potential rebels? It&#39;s ludicrous, and so sad that the people of Syria are being abused by us in this manner for a proxy war that nobody wants for reasons we can only guess about. I&#39;m embarrassed trip be American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they need to? Honestly. Why would the CIA need to blame anything on Assad? There are plenty of well documented war crimes he has committed before the US or Russia where involved in Syria. So I just don&#39;t understand the point of orchestrating a false flag attack in Syria to fan flames of anti Assad there is plenty of that in our country and in Syria. </p>

<p>I mean I know this is going to get me down voted to hell and back but sometimes the news is just the news. Sure they might spin a story in a direction to push there political parties agenda but sometimes they don&#39;t have to totally make something up. Am I the only person that thinks it&#39;s pretty likely Assad is just bombing his on people because he&#39;s a loon and doesn&#39;t want to loose the power he has? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have honestly know clue who the FUCK did it, and I don&#39;t take anything most people say on here seriously because they are Pro- Russia for the simple fact that they are not the USA...and think they can do nothing wrong. Like where on the Conspiracy where Russia did it. They could have easily framed Assad for the attacks to have an excuse to reconsider their support for him, and get the international community more involved in the diplomatic processes.  Oh, and OF COURSE ASSAD IS GOING TO FUCKING DENY IT, if he did do it...he would be committing a fucking war...who the FUCK would own up to that shit. I love the irony of how you guys always question the USA news (which you should) but take everything Mother  Russia says to be the holy bible or some shit. When it is equally if not more corrupt (because it is stated sponsored news agency ) , and not to mention killing and silencing of opponents, journalist, oppression of minorities etc.. . They fail to see that they are as much as &quot;shill&quot; to the Russian/ Assad government as the &quot;Shillery&quot; they despise. You are both advocating the innocence of two horribly corrupted governments. Russia did hack the elections, and Trump was elected with their help ,because Russia is equally  fucked up, and willing to meddle in other countries elections. Not to mention Putin is an ex- kgb agent for FUCK sakes. Ugh! Sorry none of this was directed at you...just pissed off that they are not looking at BOTH sides. <strong>When you choose  a side between 2  corrupted government, and only question your opponent is the moment you become apart of the corruption, because you are unwilling to even think that your side could be corrupted. People should questions ALL corrupt governments, not just the ones you hate the most.</strong></p>

<p>With that said... I predict that this will have a positive outcome. It will cause Russia to reconsider their opinion on Assad, and he will be out the door. Syria&#39;s people only wanted democracy, until their government and a bunch of shit fucks, messed it up. By the end of 2017 the war with the Rebels (the Kurds, and those who actually want a democracy), and destroying Isis (regardless of who created it), will begin (let say... it is the CIA covering their tracks or some shit) and by 2018 they will be all dead or captured for war crimes.  So calm your fucking Tits bitch, we get the CIA is horrible, and I am glad you are bringing it to our attention but that doesn&#39;t automatically make your side the unquestionable queen. Assad could have likely stashed/ saved/ kidnapped their top scientists to make the Sarine gas, or God forbid lied about the location of the weapons. And just because he got rid of them, doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t stop causing chemical attacks with cholrine.</p>

The Jew government is already threatening to attack the Syrian air force hours after the incident despite their  denials and no clear evidence yet.
France the Brits  Turks and U.N.are publicly blaming Assad despite no clear evidence .</p>

<p>An airstrike to deliver chemicals is the worst and most unsuccessful method . Try artillery or helicopter.  Assad has literally nothing to gain from a chemical attack ,they are winning easily without it.
The Jews are starting to panic , soon Hezbollah and Iranian militias will have their illegal borders surrounded . They have been trying to lure Hezbollah into war by repeated airstrikes against them in Syria. Even the Pro Saudi Lebanese prime minister said Israel is trying to start war with Lebanon  .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an old playbook. Look up &quot;Markale Massacre&quot;.</p>

<p>During Bosnian war, it is reported that Muslims shelled their own civilian marketplace, in order to provoke international outcry. Their leadership justified the victims as martyrs, who died for a good cause.</p>

<p>This was in the realm of conspiracy, until a Bosnian Muslim ex-police officer confirmed this in court:</p>

<p><a href="https://thesaker.is/bosnian-muslim-witness-confirms-that-the-markale-massacre-was-a-false-flag/">https://thesaker.is/bosnian-muslim-witness-confirms-that-the-markale-massacre-was-a-false-flag/</a></p>

<p>So, maybe CIA didn&#39;t pull the trigger directly, but it is totally in the DNA of the fundamentalist thugs to kill their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the CIA may well have been involved in the sarin attack, it was also a group of incredibly brave CIA agents that <strong>stopped</strong> the US war wagon from rolling into Syria.  </p>

<p>After the sarin attack, the White House (primarily Brennan and Clapper) prepared an &quot;Intelligence Assessment&quot; blaming Assad for the attack, for use as a springboard to US intervention.  </p>

<p>A group of &quot;Intelligence Analysts,&quot; however, threatened to resign en masse if the Intelligence Assessment was published.  Ultimately, Brennan and Clapper folded, and they invented the knock-off version, which they called a &quot;Government Assessment.&quot;  </p>

<p>Surprisingly (given the IC&#39;s obsession with editing out any unflattering info), although the Wikipedia page has been watered down a bit over the last couple years, it still has much of the info:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence reports are normally released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and labelled an &quot;Intelligence Assessment.&quot; This report was described as a &quot;Government Assessment&quot; and the unclassified version was released by the White House Press Secretary [ed. normally released by ODNI]. One former intelligence official told Inter Press Service that the description as a &quot;Government&quot; rather than an &quot;Intelligence&quot; assessment &quot;means that this is not an intelligence community document&quot;; another said that the White House had apparently &quot;decided on a position and cherry-picked the intelligence to fit it&quot;.</p>

<p>A 29 August article from the Associated Press describes an unreleased report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that outlined the evidence against Syria that included &quot;a few key caveats — including acknowledging that the U.S. intelligence community no longer has the certainty it did six months ago of where the regime&#39;s chemical weapons are stored, nor does it have proof Assad ordered chemical weapons use.&quot;</p>

<p>Former CIA officer Philip Giraldi later wrote that &quot;With all evidence considered, the intelligence community found itself with numerous skeptics in the ranks, leading to sharp exchanges with the Director of Central Intelligence John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. A number of analysts threatened to resign as a group if their strong dissent was not noted in any report released to the public, forcing both Brennan and Clapper to back down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. The 2014 Sarin attacks were a Turkish false flag. When Obama realized this, he opted to accept Russia/Kerry&#39;s request to evacuate the regime&#39;s chemical weapon stockpile. If it was a &quot;CIA false flag&quot;, Obama would not have walked back upon funding out the truth.</p>

<p>In the case of the recent chemical attacks, you are incorrect too. From reports, it seems that the Syrian government hit a chemical weapons depot that the rebels had, causing a massive explosion.</p>

<p>For one, the rebels should be punished for stockpiling WMDs. Two, the incompetent Syrian government should be punished for war crimes. You <strong>do not</strong> bomb chemical weapons depots, for <em>exactly</em> this reason. How irresponsible.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton listed this point in one of her speeches as one of the reasons why the U.S. should not establish a NFZ (<em>contrary to her public position, which, strangely, was less reasonable than her private one - maybe she isn&#39;t a &quot;warmonger&quot; after all?</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the idea that we would have like a no fly zone — Syria, of course, did have when it started the fourth biggest Army in the world. It had very sophisticated air defense systems. They’re getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk — you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. In Libya we didn’t have that problem. It’s a huge place. The air defenses were not that sophisticated and there wasn’t very — in fact, there were very few civilian casualties. That wouldn’t be the case. <strong>And then you add on to it a lot of the air defenses are not only in civilian population centers but near some of their chemical stockpiles. You do not want a missile hitting a chemical stockpile.</strong> We have a big set of issues about what is going to happen with those storehouses of chemicals since a lot want their hands on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they didn&#39;t. I worked as an Army intelligence analyst monitoring the conflict from an undisclosed location in southwest Asia. I had proof that the Assad regime planned and conducted the attack, including radar tracks, SIGINT intercepts, MASINT collections, and independent chemical analysis - some of which I saw in real time. That&#39;s not to say the CIA doesn&#39;t engage in some shady shit, but not in this instance. There are some ways that the CIA  could&#39;ve been involved, but the coordination and involvement would far beyond what would be reasonable me for to judge as even a remote possbility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seen how it is being reported how Russian planes also bombed area where chemical attack occurred and the obvious inference to big bad Russia.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/04/chemical-attack-syria-170404195457304.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/04/chemical-attack-syria-170404195457304.html</a></p>

<p>Its a false flag with the bonus of further smearing of Russia by insinuation.</p>

<p>I am sickened by the deaths. Sypathies to the families and loved ones. those suffering </p>

<p>No arguing Assad is a dictator, thug, and corrupt but if these apocalyptic religious extremists get into power they will make Assad look like a saint. </p>

<p>The U.S is not supporting viable alternatives to Assad. The US and its allies are supporting insane extremist apocalyptic warlords who are deluded into thinking they are God&#39;s special vessels fulfilling koranic prophesies and therefore it is right for those who oppose their infallibility to be killed for defying God. They are.psychopaths reliant on foreign finance, weapons, manpower, and logistics to maintain power and control over any population because otherwise they would be a nonentity, probably in jail or sentenced to death as terrorists and mass murderers without this foreign support.</p>
