       Now that it's been confirmed that Susan Rice did the requesting and leaking - not only has CNN vowed to not cover this, but looks like r/politics is doing it's usual shilling. 
Even Bloomberg covered it, but not on Reddit....

       Pretty much the same kind of revolving door that exists between the Pentagon and the defence industries, or the CDC and big Pharma, or the EPA and all the industries that exploit natural resources and pollute the air and waterways that the agency's granted a free pass on. I'm equally sure that most of the others are probably just as joined at the hip to similar herds of swine that all feast and grow fat at the public trough.

         DNS lookups pinging every 10 minutes between Alfa Bank (Russian bank with ties to Putin) and Trump org. Potential Theories of either DNS-lookups as "pings to indicate package/mail pickup" or DNS-lookup pings as "code-like content" in place of emails potentially through mobile apps. Pings increased during RNC/DNC conventions. Pings at Trump org stopped when NYT/Slate asked direct questions to Alfa Bank (so Alfa told Trump org to stop the pings somehow). NYT/Slate had not asked those questions to Trump org.

         DT bought a $40 million mansion... then sold it to Russian oligarch of fertilizer Rybolovlev for $95 million a few years later. Rybolovlev then demolished the estate to sell the property. Typically in the legal world this is called Money Laundering.

         Campaign Lawyer Mike Cohen was caught around French islands in Europe, along with Russian oligarchs who also were vacationing around there. Oligarchs are used because they are not officials. 
Lawyer Cohen gave 4 different stories to 4 different news outlets about his involvement with Russians. He also claimed he never went to Czech, but actually had gone to Czech in the past, and there is suggestion that he has an Israeli pass port. These guys sure vacation a lot in Europe for some strange reason during the campaign even (are they vacationing or are they working?).

       Unless we're playing an inane game of semantics, which completely sidesteps the substance of the discussion, President Trump's tweet has absolutely been confirmed. How did this so-called incidental surveillance occur? Did leftist politicians fabricate the transcripts of these conversations? If not, there must have been some apparatus set up at Trump Tower to record calls made between him / his team and foreign officials. What should we call that hmm? At that point, the assertion of "surveillance at Trump Tower" is far from a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, to what end was this information collected? Why have Adam Schiff and James Clapper refused to state in an official capacity that
       <em>
        any evidence
       </em>
       of Russian ties to the Trump campaign exist? What about Devin Nunes' statement that most of the unmasked info had nothing to do with Russia at all? I eagerly await your reply 😉

       You're completely wrong, sorry.

      <p>
       To be clear, you still believe trump tower was targeted and surveilled itself in some way, based on the info we have?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you talk to someone who's under surveillance, your conversation is going to be caught up in that. Do you understand and agree with that concept?

       We don't know yet, investigations take time and maybe they won't ever find anything worthy of charges, or maybe they will. We don't know yet.

       Schiff said there is more than circumstantial evidence of coordination. Did you not hear that?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other countries who we surveil, are you aware of that? If there was some contact with non Russian foreigners under surveillance, that would be caught up incidentally.

       So sorry, but you are the one who is completely wrong - delusional too, I might add :) Don't think I didn't notice how you were incapable of responding to my substantive questions. Did they trigger you that bad? Take your fingers out of your ears and just try harder, I believe in you (I don't).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a couple of bunts you totally whiffed:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) How do you propose that surveillance took place? Absent the fabrication of transcripts, those calls had to have been recorded somehow...
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be aware that we know considerably more about leaks/unmasking than any Russia connection. However, that hasn't stopped legacy media from covering these yet unsubstantiated claims 24/7...how do you explain the double standard?
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on bluehat, these are really easy. Demonstrate that I should take you seriously, you've done a piss poor job so far 😂
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - Schiff from two days ago, way after his baseless claim of "more than circumstantial evidence" lol:
       <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/04/02/adam_schiff_there_is_no_definitive_proof_of_any_trump-russia_connection.html">
        There Is No "Definitive" Proof Of Any Trump-Russia Connection
       </a>
       . How did you not hear that?
      </p>
      <p>
       PPS - Clapper on Meet the Press:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycZj5-5KJwA">
        "No evidence of Trump-Russia collusion"
       </a>

      </p>
      <p>
       1) see paragraph 2 from my previous response.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I'm not sure why they are focusing on Russia, ask them? How is it a double standard? I've seems lots of coverage of Susan rice admitting to requesting unmasking. Granted I haven't been watching tv news all day. And also of the leaks, and the content of them. Perhaps it is you who is choosing to ignore the content of the leaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't criticize me and my arguments when I've addressed everything you've said that is actually on topic. You've made many unsubstantiated claims with no evidence and you've done it in a very rude way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know there is a difference between "definitive evidence" and "more than circumstantial evidence"? Why are you equating the two?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clapper says "at the time of our report we had no evidence of collusion between the campaign and the Russians". That doesn't rule out that there is evidence now or that there was coordination short of collusion. I have a feeling you will see no difference in those words and that's one of the big problems with discussing this situation is the way that language is interpeted and spun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suggest you be a bit nicer in your responses because your tone undermines your points.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've in no way proven that trumps claims of being surveilled by the Obama admin "have absolutely been confirmed"

      </p>
      <p>
       2) Just this morning, CNN alleged that the leaking stories / Susan Rice were a distraction formulated by President Trump to distract from the Russia narrative. This is schizophrenically insane, due to the imbalance of evidence on one side (are you smart enough to know which side I'm referring to?)
      </p>
      <p>
       LMAO the cognitive dissonance is
       <em>
        strong

       in this one. I'd love to hear your legal definition of "more than circumstantial"..I'll wait

       Clapper made those statements after the inauguration. At the time of his statements, he had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point as Director if National Intelligence. We now know that the investigation had been going on since President Trump secured the Republican nomination in July. Are you
       <em>
        seriously
       </em>
       alleging that any evidence of value was collected after January 20th? That position totally demolishes the claims that any collusion happened during the campaign. Love to hear your expert insight on this one haha

       They trust that their supporters aren't intelligent enough to understand the nuance or else won't bother trying to understand. "Incidental collection, FISA warrants, unmasking, what is all that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Republicans just wave their arms and shout and use words like "Freedom," "Obama," "smoking gun," "bombshell," "unprecedented!," and "cover up" and their base just goes along with it, because they hate Obama and want it to be true.

       What Rice is accused of doing (and likely did do) isn't illegal. It isn't surprising. It isn't interesting. And it isn't bad. If you want to have a high level policy discussion about how to balance privacy rights under the current intelligence gathering framework? Cool. Let's do that. But don't pretend this is an issue when you didn't give a fuck for the last sixteen years since you guys wrote and adopted the Patriot Act and then reauthorized it over and over.

       What happened was that she unmasked people who were talking to "bad hombres" because it was necessary to process the intel. Stop trying to make this scandal happen, it's not going to happen. I know that the treason investigation is scary to you but come and join us in reality. Bigly.

       here's just a few 
    Robert Mercer (Cambridge analytica [involved in brexit], cato, breitbart) &amp; Russian Oligarch's yachts met up at an island.. People are tracking Oligarch private jets like MKATE.
    DNS lookups pinging every 10 minutes between Alfa Bank (Russian bank with ties to Putin) and Trump org. Potential Theories of either DNS-lookups as "pings to indicate package/mail pickup" or DNS-lookup pings as "code-like content" in place of emails potentially through mobile apps. Pings increased during RNC/DNC conventions. Pings at Trump org stopped when NYT/Slate asked direct questions to Alfa Bank (so Alfa told Trump org to stop the pings somehow). NYT/Slate had not asked those questions to Trump org.
    Carter Page changed story to WSJ through text messages saying he had gone to Moscow, met with "Russian think-tanks &amp; university officials." He lied on national television.
    Paul Manafort lied on national television saying he wasn't involved in changing the RNC platform on Ukraine. J.D. Gordon confessed that Paul Manafort &amp; leadership ordered this.
    Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer Russian hacker and admitted to back-chnnel comms to WL. He has been sent a letter from SIC to preserve Russia-related campaign-related documents.
    Paul Manafort is wanted for questioning by prosecutors in Ukraine. He has told WashPo, "It's not like they carry badges!" regarding meeting with Russian spies.
    DT bought a $40 million mansion... then sold it to Russian oligarch of fertilizer Rybolovlev for $95 million a few years later. Rybolovlev then demolished the estate to sell the property. Typically in the legal world this is called Money Laundering.
    Campaign Lawyer Mike Cohen was caught around French islands in Europe, along with Russian oligarchs who also were vacationing around there. Oligarchs are used because they are not officials. Lawyer Cohen gave 4 different stories to 4 different news outlets about his involvement with Russians. He also claimed he never went to Czech, but actually had gone to Czech in the past, and there is suggestion that he has an Israeli pass port. These guys sure vacation a lot in Europe for some strange reason during the campaign even (are they vacationing or are they working?).
    Interesting stories swirling around about Azerbaijan Baku hotel that DT was involved in along with Ivanka and other sons.
    Dakota pipeline was going to be built with Russian steel.... when the media found out, quickly Sean Spicer tried to frame it as "no we will buy american."
    Russian propaganda that promoted DT for years since GOP primary stopped around late February. Indicating their dissatisfaction.
    Russia has been murdering officials and their own people, some of whom charged with treason and accused of working for the US. Coverup of UN amb of Russia, who died in NYC, Coroner in NY told to withhold cause of death and refer questions to State Dep.
    Russia launches investigation of US media.
    Nigel Farage had dinner with DT, then Nigel Farage ended up in London near Ecuador hideout. He was asked by journalist if he was there to meet Julian, and he stated something like "I don't talk about who I meet or where I go." Then the WL thing happened.
    Russian botnets are on overtime attacking McCain, Graham, CNN, Evan McMullin, and others in the media. Same Russian botnets are promoting Le Pen &amp; attacking Merkel. Still ranting about globalism and muslims.
    Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats have been asking questions about Russian money laundering and influence of media orgs and other tactics they use to influence elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanna know why everyone is going so slow and carefully... because we have a serious issue. A very very serious issue. There's going to be a reckoning.

       If these people don't get punished, then you know what has happened.

       Answers to your questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador who is under surveillance (do I have to explain how this means Flynns conversation with him is recorded?) -&gt; perhaps in investigating the Russian election influence, rice or someone else requested to unmask the US person in these intercepts -&gt; that request was granted and the unmasked transcripts were given to that person where they were then distributed throughout the intelligence community. I'm not exactly sure of the mechanism for that but it seems it could have been as part of the Russia meddling documents or a more secret thing limited to certain people in the IC community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense or if you have any refutations.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) People have been saying that trumps outbursts or allegations about being wire tapped have been smokescreen to distract from his teams Russia connections. I don't disagree with them. When you say it's insane based on the imbalance of evidence I assume you must believe that you are aware of all evidence in both cases, which clearly none of us are. The investigation is still ongoing, right? Not to mention that the two aren't mutually exclusive. Trump could fully have been illegally spied on and it could also still be a smokescreen/distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't use the term, schiff did. I'm not aware of all of the evidence in the case and neither are you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I quite frankly don't know what's being investigated. I think it's entirely possible that new evidence has come to light since clapper left. I don't know and neither do you. Are you not going to address the fact that coordination short of collusion could have happened? Or another crime? I don't know the details of the still ongoing investigation, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you were super respectful of Obama. How did you show your respect for him? Why would I respect a president who said we should never and that the country could never withstand having a president under investigation by the FBI, who at that time and still to this day is under his own FBI investigation? Who stiffs every day contractors, cleaners, and other service providers? Who blasts a president for playing golf when he's on a pace to play far more rounds? Who said he'd never leave the White House because he'd be working too hard but goes on vacation every week on taxpayer money? Who's wife won't live in the whitehouse, costing taxpayers millions? who's national security advisor resigned in disgrace and now it turns out also didn't disclose his work representing foreign nations? who won't divest from his businesses when they clearly benefit from his position and from foreigners? Who can never admit being wrong? Who can't stop tweeting?

       Good lord you are dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) So you concede that conversations involving Trump's team, and likely Trump as well, were recorded. Good job! To anyone with more than three brain cells working in tandem, this
       <em>
        absolutely substantiates President Trump's claim
       </em>
       . Just three weeks ago, President Trump was being ridiculed for suggesting that he was under surveillance at all. Are you mentally capable of seeing the change in narrative here or have I underestimated your stupidity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally if this information was being collected for ostensible use against the Russian ambassador, and the Americans "incidentally caught up" were not the target, why has it only been used for political purposes against said Americans? I'm going to love to see you squirm out of this one LOL
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Pump the brakes there bluehat my boy, when you assume you make an ASS out of U and ME (in this case just you). The evidence I am referring to are Susan Rice's own statements to NBC's Andrea Mitchell, admitting surveillance and unmasking of Trump and his team. As well as Evelyn Farkas' statements to Mika Brzezinski, detailing the process by which Democrats frantically collected intelligence against Trump and leaked it to the media. This information confirms actual felonies. It's not hard to understand, so I really hope you're being willfully ignorant. Regarding Russia, I'm glad you are willing to admit that you know nothing..it's a good first step. But then how can you be so confident in asserting the presence of a Trump-Russia connection? There is no factual support for these allegations. So what would President Trump be distracting from, exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to rub it in (I love it tbh), but you used the exact phrase in your last post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you know there is a difference between "definitive evidence" and "more than circumstantial evidence"? Why are you equating the two?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you always use phrases you don't understand? Is it to seem more intelligent? You'll need more than that to fool me. But thank you for again admitting you "don't know" and can't defend your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't know what's being investigated then why are you attempting to speak with authority on the subject? From my last post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clapper made those statements after the inauguration. At the time of his statements, he had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point as Director of National Intelligence. We now know that the investigation had been going on since President Trump secured the Republican nomination in July.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So when do you think the coordination/collusion (words I'm not confident you know the definition of) took place? Clapper's statements
       <em>
        preclude
       </em>
       it from having happened during the campaign. Your expert insight...?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see you've devolved into triggered ranting by the end here...bluehat buddy you're just going to have to get smarter. Your last post was one Yuge "I don't know," which leaves me wondering why you have such a strong opinion on it in the first place. I would recommend reading my post with a dictionary on hand for the tough words, and then reading it again just to make sure you understand the larger points. Cry to whoever you want in an attempt to silence me, it just reinforces my beliefs about you.
      </p>

       You're just projecting your own deflections on me. I answered your question about how Flynns conversations with the Russian ambassador came to be completely legally recorded and known within the IC and you've got nothing to respond with except to say "see, that means trumps claim about Obama illegally wiretapping him are tie and if you dont agree you're an idiot", so I can no longer converse with you. You either don't read my responses, are too thick to understand them, or are willfully ignorant of what I'm saying, so this discussion isn't in good faith. Trump didn't claim his people were caught up in legitimate surveillance because they were talking to people under legitimate surveillance. He claimed Obama had his wires tapped illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know the extent of the investigation, you don't know what evidence has been found, continues to be found, or may be found in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just calling names and throwing up dust to cloud the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't get triggered or rant. You said I'm a liberal cry baby and should just respect the president and I told you why that would be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I'm sure you showed your respect for Obama frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you have such a strong opinion about this when you don't understand the facts? No one but you and trump think he was tha target of surveillance ordered by Obama.

       FBI and Congress are investigating Russia's influence on the 2016 Presidential Election, and the connection to Trump. How could you have possibly missed that? Jheeze... 😩 so I'll reiterate:

       Yes, recorded as part of incidental surveillance. Not sure what the claim is in that first building? Doesn't seem to be one that I haven't already discredited.

       President trump didn't say he was under surveillance at all. That's not what he claimed but if you want to change the easily verifiable claims or misinterpret them I can't change that. What change in narrative? You've misrepresented the narrative so you have no basis to say it changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who said what the goal or use of the surveillance of the Russian ambassador was? I believe it's routine surveillance, to understand the contacts, discussions, what the ambassador is up to and what the Russian government is concerned with. How do you claim to know the full extent of what the surveillance has been, is being, or will be used for? How had the information been used for political purposes other than the leaks that led to Flynns resignation? Or is that the only thing you're referring  to?
      </p>
      <p>
       You've misrepresented the statements of both rice and farkas. Rice denied knowing what nunes was talking about in his confusing press conference. Farkas detailed the concerns that the incoming administration would bury the investigation into its connections to Russia, connections now proven that it had hidden at every step.
      </p>
      <p>
       His teams Russian connections and his own corruption, possible indebtedness to powerful Russians, Russian mob, and powerful Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly don't know what point you're trying to make about rubbing it in. There is a difference between definitive evidence of collusion and more than circumstantial evidence. I don't know what schiff was referring to with his comments, it's not public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I understand what those phrases mean, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that all information pertinent to an investigation is immediately known when an investigation commences? That seems to be what you're implying by saying that clapper wasn't aware of definitive evidence of collusion. Do you believe that the FBI and both houses will keep investigating something after they find that there is no definitive evidence to support their investigations? I'm trying to understand why you think not having evidence for a specific claim in one part of an investigation rules out any possibility of wrongdoing in any other part of an investigation? It could have happened and the evidence may not have come to light or been definitive at the time clapper was interviewed. can you prove there is no evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I care who you voted for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now please address every point here one at a time.

       It didn't answer the original question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unless we're playing an inane game of semantics, which completely sidesteps the substance of the discussion, President Trump's tweet has absolutely been confirmed. How did this so-called incidental surveillance occur? Did leftist politicians fabricate the transcripts of these conversations? If not, there must have been some apparatus set up at Trump Tower to record calls made between him / his team and foreign officials. What should we call that...?

       First claim, that unmasking equates to surveillance of trump - false. Trump was not targeted and may not have been even caught up in incidental surveillance. We know members of his team were, but that's not why he claimed. He claimed that Obama had wire tapped trump tower. Those claims remain disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second claim that there must have been an apparatus: I've explained many times how the incidental surveillance occurred, but you keep concluding that a spying apparatus was set up in trump tower. Not the case. Trumps team spoke to people under surveillance so those conversations were recorded. It's as simple as that. The fact that happened does not mean there is an apparatus to spy on trump.

       When you can't attack the argument you fall back into your hole and try to attack the person. It's sad. You're a sad person and it makes me sad to think about your life. Trump is doing terribly, thank god he's getting to blow off some steam at the golf course every weekend or we'd be in real trouble.

       I don't remember that, it must have had zero impact like the rest of your illogical comments. It does make sense though because all of your insults are projection. They came from within you, your hate for yourself, and so they apply to you perfectly, of course. I'm sure you'll be chanting maga while the world burns, truly idiocracy.

       Well, (1) wiretap" is a common term, and people associate it with spying and surveillance.  And it's a better tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And (2) Trump and or his people were targeted.  The surveillance didn't target them, but the unmasking did. Rice probably didn't have the juice to actually get a FISA so this was the next best thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, (3) her dissemination may have been illegal.  We need to investigate her.  We know that someone illegally unmasked and shared Flynn's info.  Was it Rice?  And, why did she feign ignorance of all this unmasking two weeks ago?

       When people say targeting in this context they are talking about the surveillance, not about the unmasking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to be clear, you think they somehow were targetting trump and got a warrant on let's say the Russian ambassador to try to get dirt on trump, then they somehow knew the conversations were with trump or associates before they were unmasked, so they requested to unmask them? Does that actually make sense to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       It could have been illegal if by dissemination you mean leaking to the media? We don't know she did that but anything is possible. She denied it today. If you're talking about dissemination the way that word is actually used in this context, within the IC, then I don't think it could be illegal but ya maybe they should investigate that. That doesn't mean the investigations of trump should stop.

       No, that doesn't make sense to me. And that's not what I meant at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I said targeted I was referencing the unmasking.  It sounds like Rice took incidental collection and exploited it when she found Trump and or his personnel on the phone.  Too early to tell, but at the very least she needs to be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that someone illegally leaked Flynn's name and his transcripts, so it's no real stretch to ask if someone was illegally sharing information on Trump.  And Susan Rice is no paragon of truth.  She lied about Benghazi, and last week she feigned ignorance about any unmasking.

       Great. So we should let everybody testify. Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Mike Flynn, etc. Let's get everything on the record. Once it's clear that there is zero evidence, Trump will be vindicated.

       Are you talking about hacking voting machines, which nobody is claiming occurred? Or Russian propaganda used to influence voters? Hell, we might be talking about inappropriate contact between Trump's team and Russian intelligence assets. We know nothing for certain (we do, but people are denying it). Let's get this investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the GOP is trying to block everybody from hearing the facts, and simultaneously telling us there is no hard evidence. Let's hear what happened, and go from there...

       Leftist politicians and commentators make speculative accusations every day against President Trump...so what are you trying to say? It's
       <em>
        very telling
       </em>
       that no substantive proof has been leaked or even insinuated by Schill or anyone else at this point. Come on, we both know that 😏 And if we don't know what's being investigated then why are you attempting to speak with authority on the subject?

       Gotcha. Susan Rice should get in trouble for unmasking Trump's team, but we certainly shouldn't talk about what they were doing! We have definitive proof that Trump's team were in contact with Russian intel agents. The GOP (and you) are simultaneously telling us that we have no concrete evidence of wrongdoing, and also we can't look for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right. We have no definitive evidence. We sure have probable cause for an investigation though.

       Devin Nunes has gone on record saying that most if not all of the unmasked intelligence he reviewed has no relevance to Russia at all. Your expert insight...? Calling him a liar doesn't count 😉
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump has been investigated/surveilled for at least a year at this point. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycZj5-5KJwA">
        "No evidence of Trump-Russia collusion"
       </a>
       after the inauguration. At the time he made them, Clapper had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point. Schill's statements from a few days ago reinforce this:
       <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/04/02/adam_schiff_there_is_no_definitive_proof_of_any_trump-russia_connection.html">
        There Is No "Definitive" Proof Of Any Trump-Russia Connection
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So when do you think the coordination/collusion (words I'm not confident you know the definition of) took place? Clapper's statements preclude it from having happened during the campaign. Again, curious as to your nuanced opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus Question: What evidence is there that Russia influenced one vote in the 2016 Presidential Election? If you can't prove this, then why does contact with Russians even matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       And not to be a total dick and rub it in, but your entire argument is based on a logical fallacy that invalidates it on-face:

       You can't have it both ways. How can they figure out the treason unless they investigate. If they investigate, they will need to unmask. If the investigation isn't complete, then they shouldn't go public, unless they are sure. Investigations go from suspicion to certainty over time.

       Considering how massive levying treason charges against a presidential candidate/president is, or even the softened "coordination" angle, you better have the world's most airtight case with multiple pieces of proof that cannot be forged or portrayed as inauthentic somehow, multiple witnesses, an incredible amount of verifiable, doubt-free evidence. Disclosing even a
       <em>
        piece
       </em>
       of this could derail the entire thing, then you're truly fucked. FBI is either compiling the most whopper-filled case in history right now or still chasing leads, scrapping together what they can, or just grasping at straws (which is entirely possible, as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Breaking any information before a presidential election could have resulting in mass rioting, maybe even a cutty civil war, the peaceful transition of power is vital.

      <p>
       We do have a situation where, just days apart from each other...
- Reports suggest Comey wanted to announce the investigation in July, but the Obama admin advised against it, perhaps one of the fattest non-partisan non-moves ever. 
- This Rice thing comes up and is being celebrated by Trump supporters as the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       second Watergate, the ultimate devious political conspiracy of note. We'll see.

I'm also curious as to why he would kowtow to the Obama admins wishes in July, but defy or bypass them in October to announce the Hillary email investigation was reopening.

       Can you not see how it would be considered political use if they released before an election or Trump taking office?
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire right would be in an uproar and claim Obama and the left are attempting to subvert the democratic process and invalidate the elected president.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would happen no matter what kind of evidence the left had. Just look how the left reacted to Comeys statement about emails right before the election and they had tons of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to think about it all but I know both sides stink to high heaven. I can't wait until all the evidnece is revealed so we can settle this once and for all.

       I think you're forgetting the situation back in July - the establishment RNC would have loved to have had a reason to get rid of Trump.  They wanted Jeb, Rubio, or Cruz - Trump was a nightmare to them too.  Also, remember that the DNC
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       Trump nominated because they thought he was unelectable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the Obama admin had evidence, pre-nomination, that Trump was in cahoots of some eastern sort, and they suppressed it because they thought it would help them in the general, then they're fucking culpable because they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have pressed prosecution a year ago!

       Yeah I can understand that. Although the government has a long history of letting criminals continue to operate until they have commited enough crimes to bring them down for good.

       This happens to low level drug dealers, paedophiles exchanging photos all the way up to terrorists.

      <p>
       The FBI especially love finding fundamentalist and supplying them with weapons and bomb making material. Even suggesting targets and handing out cash to recruit friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be they didn't have enough concrete evidence but a pile of circumstantial evidence. Leaking information that someone is under investigation is a well known technique and often leads them to the smoking gun when they get spooked and start trying to cover their tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course these are just all possible reasons and we won't know the truth until they decide to allow us too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though. If they had the evidence beforehand they should've gone public then.

       Your opinion on the matter's corner stone is that you honestly think the establishment dislikes Trump. Nevermind the fact that we have to look no further than Ron Paul to see how the establishment actually treats someone that's a threat to them.

       Not her job, she had no place making any kind of request. The presidents administration are CONSUMERS of intelligence, not investigators. And trump getting impeached is like saying he will never win the Presidency the day before the election. We will hear it until the very end of his term.

       Spying on another candidate is one thing. It's what got Nixon in hot water. Spying on Russians and finding out they're talking to Americans and then requesting the names of those Americans is entirely different. If Trump was spying on Russians and found a red hand in his opponents, then he would be in the right to ask who those people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the National Security Advisor is absolutely allowed to ask for the unmasking of these people. You're just flat out wrong in your claim. You say the people investigating are "low level," but the woman in charge of those people isn't authorized to access that information? That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.

       What's dumb shit is that you actually think Susan Rice would be handed an Intel report that was not as complete as it needed to be. These are not incompetent people and she is not the only one who can request an unmasking. If it would have been confusing to her and the context was needed it would have gotten to her Un- masked. Just like "Trump will never win" this is just more of the same shit. It happened, that is now undeniable fact. If this is allowed to ride I fear what crazy Trump would do with this freedom. This nation is fucked.

       " CNN’s Manu Raju reported this: “[s]ome of the communications picked up were Trump transition officials talking about Trump’s family, Intel source says.”
"Why in the world were conversations about Trump’s family picked up and potentially unmasked and disseminated around government? This would clearly seem to run afoul of minimization procedures, which are meant to protect U.S. citizens from such surveillance."

       Exactly, non-existent. If there was foreign intelligence value then the masking could be legal. Without knowing the content of the intercepts it's impossible to know if they were legal or not. Why have charges not been brought against her? I honestly don't believe in that line of thought but people keep saying it to me about trump.

       It depends, did the cop have probable cause? Just based on publicly available information now, it certainly appears she did. I not, I hope she's prosecuted for whatever crime she broke.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 2 wrongs do not make a right, and we won't know if Trump is guilty of treason until these investigations finish. So it's far too early to know if she had probable cause. Until that time comes, I'm filing this story under "classic deflection".

       Yes AND no. The collection is necessary to prevent a traitor from assuming a sensitive position, Presidency or close periphery. Even the unmasking was probably okay, were it limited to network analysis and collection on closely related parties. Basically collection and unmasking on anyone who could compromise the office is probably fair game. Unless those materials are leaked to compromise the office or the candidate. That isn't okay.

       at first I was going to say thanks for all of the sources. does seem that snopes was wrong I guess about the democrats standing one, but both of those first two links are about the same thing. The rest of it is about funding. I am interested in times that snopes has actually been proven wrong. You did provide one so thanks for that.

      <p>
       One thing I can say about this is that Snopes is very carefyl about how they respond to anything. If they cannot debunk it they usually debunk something else with tricky wording making it sound like they are referring to the question, when really they pulled a fast one on the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I had the example that usually gets passed around for this, but I don't think there are as many situations where you can outright say they were wrong, just that they conveniently avoided addressing the actual issue.

        won 119 Pulitzer Prizes
       </a>
       and a fly-by-night blog spam? Let me spell it out for you, any geek can setup a WordPress site and setup facebook ad revenue. With a few buck they can buy twitter and facebook bots to "like" their story. Then gullible people on social media share their make-believe stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, any geek cannot win Pulitzer Prizes.

       The ad click farm does not employ hundreds of journalists, just a few fiction authors who spin left and right wing fantasy tales.

       Snopes is misleading.  If you read through their whole explanation they usually don't lie there.  The lie is in their rating labels.  The problem is that is what most people look at.  They take a complex issue with the only right answer being a long one and condense it down into a black and white, right and wrong.

       I'm not a big fan of Trump but I did find that hilarious and ironic since they had setup a sub for
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       users when he lost titled
       <a href="/r/The_Meltdown">
        /r/The_Meltdown
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       I try to avoid that sub at all cost because it was clear what was going on. I don't like to be manipulated by anybody. No matter what side of the aisle their on.

      <p>
       Funny thing is I get severely down voted when I suggested politics was taken over by shills since I didn't go with their narrative.

       I'm so over the US versus Them mentality on Reddit. My comments reflect my honest views and what I personally believe, not what my party wants me too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also been called out because I've commented in The_Donald a few times too. Which really highlights one of the biggest problems on Reddit. Which is being judged on where you post rather than on the content.

       I know during election season they had a call for mods to help with the additional election news. Maybe people just got burnt out and quit? You pic doesn't really prove anything other than a few people quit in a 1 month period.

       They did, yes, but read the comments. No discussion about it, at least at the top. I'm not sifting through 1200+ comments, but from what I saw was trashing Trump (trying to connect him to the leaks) and pathetic pun attempts.

       Oh, I remember... that was also the time that Reddit switched overnight from being as pro-Sanders (which seemed legitimately organic, just as the website was pro-Paul in 2012) then to magically being pro-Clinton, despite the overwhelming majority of Sanders supporters being infuriated by the DNC's disenfranchisement. I also remember when mods shut down SandersforPresident in an equally unceremonious fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the fuckery that was afoot during the election, few things beat DNCLeaks churning out the Podesta email findings. That also highlighted T_D in their heyday, too.

       Thanks to the election cycle, though, I don't even browse all of Reddit anymore. The front page is astroturfed fluff, and the "important" subreddits like politics are even worse.

       Is it not in her job description as the National Security Advisor and as a member of the National Security Council to know if influential people are in contact with someone who has a FISA warrant against them?  That's a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, if it comes out that she leaked it, which very well could be the case (e.g. through her husband to ABC), then she should obviously be drawn and quartered.

       Here's the thing. American citizens are supposed to be protected and not have their names shown at all unless they are basically in the act of committing a crime that was caught in the Intel. So Donald Trump and/or his associates should have been "American 1" "American 2" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for me, it means 3 things. Either 1) Trump or his people were communicating with Russians and had their talks monitored and collected. They were talking about legal things or non-campaign issues etc. Nothing was wrong and they should have remained "American 1" and that was it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trump or his people were communicating with Russians and had their talks monitored and collected. They were talking about illegal things or campaign issues etc. Something was wrong and they should have been unmasked from "American 1" to "Insert Trump guy's name here" and then would have been arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Obama had his admin spy on Trump and his associates and now it is being called necessary because of the "The Russian's hacked out campaign" narrative.

       That's all I'm saying.

       To an extent, yes.  But there are members of our government who can see who is being masked.  I think Michael Rogers, head of the NSA, said in front of Congress that about two dozen people have the authority to unmask (I forget if just in NSA or all of government), for example.  The unmasking isn't permanent, though.  The identities are unmasked only to the person's eyes who requested access to the identity (or anyone with the authority to look).

      <p>
       We know that the incidental collection was collected because those recorded were talking with someone who had a Section 702 FISA warrant against them.  Obama can't give himself that warrant.  The agency wishing to spy on someone has to go to a FISA court for the 702 warrant, and so far, no one on other side of the aisle have questioned that warrant.

       Unless the information collected is still being used in an ongoing investigation as a lead.  This is something else that worries me.  If they were talking about something illegal, that means there is far more to what we all know about the extent of any possible connections to Russia.

       Just deferring to what I said in my last comment: this was someone influential, whether influential in the campaign/politics or the country, speaking with the target of a Section 702 warrant.  I don't think it's concerning the National Security Advisor wanted the information, but what's important, to me, is what happened with that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       In ordinary circumstances, I completely agree that the identities should have stayed "American 1," and so on.  But I don't think when we're talking about people very close with a President-elect (or candidate, etc.) I believe those circumstances to be extraordinary enough for the National Security Advisor to know who was involved.  I think any connection between a campaign, or campaign official, and a foreign power is, or can become, a national security risk.

      <p>
       Wouldn't it only be extraordinary circumstances if something was actually going on that shouldn't? Either nothing was going on and Trump('s people) were talking to Russians or there was evidence of it and it needed to be unmasked because of an ongoing investigation. With how much the media is talking about this, you'd think there were multiple smoking guns and there would have been charges brought by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wouldn't be too surprised if someone was influenced to report if they saw any of Trump's associates or anything in the Intel they had. That's a bit more "conspiracy" though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think a person's influence should change how they are treated though, to be house.

       This is what I've been going back and forth on for a while, now.  There is nothing wrong, in my eyes, with talking to a foreign government.  I would love stronger ties between the US and Russia, because I do not know much about my ancestors who lived there.  Travelling to Moscow and through Russia to learn more about them would be amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the other hand, Russia is still a geopolitical nemesis, at this time.  As much as I would love for Russia and the US to get along, we shouldn't be treating them as friends, right now.  They are not.  So I do start to get concerned with anyone who is seemingly very close with them (note: not people who just support the countries working together and trying to get along, like me).  But then for this to be about, not only someone in/working closely with (or similar), someone our own government deemed a worthy surveillance target.

Such certification shall be maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice with the concurrence of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, and shall remain sealed unless—
(A) an application for a court order with respect to the surveillance is made under sections 1801(h)(4) and 1804 of this title; or
(B) the certification is necessary to determine the legality of the surveillance under section 1806(f) of this title.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this would all come down to what the agreed upon security measures are between the Chief Justice, DNI, and AG.
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1805">
         50 U.S. Code § 1805 - Issuance of order
        </a>
       </em>
       creates the possibility of judicial overview, as well:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At or before the end of the period of time for which electronic surveillance is approved by an order or an extension, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So an AG would need a DNI, Chief Justice, and 11 judges to all be in on their plan, without anyone finding out.  There is the chance that does happen, or has happened, but extremely unlikely.  The more moving parts in a cover up, the harder the actual cover up.

       They would've never been monitored if they didn't contact Russian officials that were already under investigation... this doesn't look bad at all.  Now if they were monitoring his team originally that would be a problem.

       Earth. We absolutely should be monitoring foreign agents including diplomats and spies operating in the US. That's what our intelligence agencies are for and Flynn knew this as he worked for the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe the IA shouldn't be monitoring foreign operatives? Or do you just believe we shouldn't use the information learned from the reports?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetical. An American citizen places a call to a Syrian embassy diplomat to obtain a bomb to carry out a domestic attack while we have the diplomat under surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we act on that information and get a warrant to unmask the American and  begin an investigation or do we ignore it?

       If Trump did it on his own then his small team of under a 100 was able to convince 60 million to vote for him. So how does stating only 15,000 Russians help refute the claim? I'm confused.
      </p>

       Welcome to the 21st century. A single person now has the ability to reach an audience of millions.  One fake news article on Facebook has the potential to reach millions of American voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they did based on the amount of likes, shares and comments the stories had. So this absolutely could be used to sway enough voters to secure a win.

       Probably because such "collusion" is normal and commonplace among political candidates.  That's why this whole thing is a joke.  Flynn forgot to disclose some of these like dozens of others have, including some involved in Hillary's campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing feels like a giant farce to me.  The MSM will harp on "collusion" until they have you convinced that this is actually an illegal or unusual act.  It is neither.   This is a witch hunt into very normal campaign activities, trying to root out any smidgen of law breaking, something it appears Flynn fell victim to.

       We know that's obviously not the case as members of his team have resigned. So they were definitely in contact with foreign agents who were under investigation and they considered whatever they talked about bad enough to resign.

       I mean if Trump was spied on, it most likely WAS legal. Which is the real problem, that the government can legally do all this. It shouldn't be about if he was or was not spied on, but rather that he easily could have been legally spied on. But instead Trump has to make it left vs right instead of addressing the real issue.

       Legal, but unethical. It's also hard to disentangle this from politics as it is appearing more and more every day as a purely partisan spying effort to destroy his chances at election and then governing.

       But that's the thing we should be talking about, the ethics of these laws. It's no secret the right wants to take down the left and visa versa. So instead of hyper focusing on who did what to who, we should be looking at why they were allowed to do that and if they should be allowed to. Instead of tackling the issue everyone's just using it to paint their political opponent as an imbecile.

       They are using that as a justification to spy on everything. Every single politician or notable person could be targeted this way. Also FYI there's still no proof to justify spying on his whole team for months. The server that was "hacked" was never allowed to be examined by the FBI. So all we know about that is from a private firm that has already had to issue corrections about their report.

       It's not about winning people over. It's about making an echo chamber without people knowing it.

      <p>
       Being able to block subreddits inadvertently creates your own bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       By making "both sides" equally annoying, loud, obnoxious, and completely one sided, those that don't agree with it will block the subreddit out of annoyance
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, it's a self fulfilling prophecy of making a propaganda machine. If there are no dissenting opinions, you then control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why I don't block any subreddits, no matter how annoying or corrupted they become. You need to see as many sides of any argument as you can in order to make an informed and critically thought out opinion.

       The users of a sub are individual and can post whatever accusations they want. It's the way the mods act that sets the level of discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never been a fan of calling anyone a shill but as long as the mods aren't censoring topics and forcing people to refer to things certain ways I don't see the issue. You're never going to be able to control what all of the users says. After all I can just make an alt and pose as a shill/useful idiot to make the other side look bad.

       I'm not suggesting that astroturfing, or corporate manipulation of reddit votes, is not happening. But playing the victim-card, and the "we're the only authentic ones, everyone else is a shill" is annoying.

       Wait, wait, wait, it sounds like you're accusing Susan Rice of spying on Trump and his team. That's a bit of a stretch given that foreigners were targeted by FISA warrants and those targets happened to be discussing Trump or in contact with Trump officials. We're calling that "spying on Trump and his team" now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any real way to assess whether the "unmasking" is a big deal. The hysteria over at T_D makes me suspect that this is a rather routine part of an investigation.

       Wake up man, any notable person will have a link or know someone who has a link to a foreign person. Is that justification to spy on then? If so that means Trump right now could literally spy on all of Congress, it's ridiculous reasoning.

       no, I don't. But I think constantly lying about meetings with Russians is odd, especially when it keeps reoccurring. I think the Alfa/Spectrum/Trump story is weird. I think rosneft is weird. I think the whole russiabotnet thing is weird. I think trump echoing fake news is weird. I think Guiliani and his predictions are weird. I think chatting with the DNC hacker is weird. I mean I could go on, but none of this is news, is it?

       With a court order,  the government may seek a court order permitting the surveillance using the FISA court. Approval of a FISA application requires the court find probable cause that the target of the surveillance be a "foreign power" or an "agent of a foreign power", and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent. In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain "minimization requirements" for information pertaining to U.S. persons. Depending on the type of surveillance, approved orders or extensions of orders may be active for 90 days, 120 days, or a year. Thats from wiki, it looks like not being an american is the major requirement. Also some requests are denied at first and changed later so the judge will allow it.

       What you're describing is entirely different from what happened. The question isn't "did a Trump associate have a link with a foreign person?" The question is "did a Trump associate have
       <strong>
        a link to a specific foreign person who was being monitored in accordance with a FISA warrant?

       Yeah the world renowned FISA court which almost never rejects requests for warrants. I guess the evidence they used to justify spying on Trump is so juicy that it's why they can't tell us what it is yet! Of you don't see how dangerous this set up is, and how easy it would be to abuse I don't know what to say.

       Here again, you're describing something which did not happen.

      <p>
       There was no justification for "spying on Trump". Any justification was related to spying on foreigners. That's why it's called "incidental collection". And anyway, this would have been initiated by one of the intelligence agencies and not, as Trump has you fools believing, Susan Rice and the Obama administration.

       Oops!!! I incidentally stole your wallet, I promise it was incidental. Woah! Just tripped and accidentally unmasked all of this intelligence. Oh shit! Stood up too fast and accidentally leaked to the media.

      <p>
       Don't be so naive. Under what you described anyone can be spied on. Ah actually, I meant to say "incidentally collected". Totally different than spying, you can tell since they're different words.

       No naivety required. If the FBI is eavesdropping on a criminal and I happen to speak with that criminal on the phone, should I really be surprised if my voice is recorded? What if the NSA is eavesdropping on a spy.

       The fact that you're incapable of arguing your point without resorting to straw men and hyperbole says a lot about your ability to process this information. T_D, like the big orange con man, preys on gullible rubes like you.

       Except it's not just that communication. It's multiple hops, multiple people. This also doesn't cover why there was unmasking. There's also been no unveiling of any proof to justify listening in on the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you'd be surprised if that phone call in your example led to your boss being surveilled, and anyone they talked to. And then your unmasked communications got leaked. Kinda sounds like you're the one resorting to strawmen.

       Depends on the level of evidence you're thinking about. I'm going with what Nunes said initially, but I'll admit, since we don't know what he saw I could be wrong.

       In this case, I guess "any evidence" would be a good starting point. Did Nunes say that anything like what you described happened? AFAIK he just made a big show about what I described: monitoring of foreign people under a FISA warrant led to some Trump administration members "incidentally" being recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's better to stick to the facts until we actually know what happened. Especially when Nunes, Trump and the whole T_D gaggle have an obvious interest in blowing this way out of proportion.

       She unmasked anonymous names based on their contact with suspicious foreigners that were being monitored.  No way she would have know it was Trump or his team and she did not leak that information to anyone.  She was doing her job.  Why was Trump's team communicating with foriegn persons of interest is the better question of this story.

       I thought Nunes said that some people associated with Trump's campaign were incidentally surveilled as part of routine intelligence gathering on foreign nationals, but that it wasn't necessarily at Trump Tower, or ordered by President Obama (admittedly, Nunes was very vague).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even if Rice ordered the unmasking of the names of the Americans who were incidentally surveilled, how are we at "she unmasked what they got my spying on Trump and his team?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Did new evidence come out on this? Your statement makes it sound like she knew the surveillance was of Trump's team--that she knew the unmasked names would be of Trump associates before she even got them unmasked.

       i mean, i tend to believe that susan rice had a reasonable reason to request unmasking. if we find out the spies were talking about innocuous stuff then we can turn our ire to obama administration for making it political. till then one can only assume that there was something sensitive, treasonous, and of national security interest and darn it if that isn't juicy stuff i wanna know about.

       The IC gave the information to Rice because the IC knew that it was about the Trump team, and wanted President Obama to have that information. It wasn't related to national security at all, but was strictly to serve Obama's political interests.

       How does the masking and unmasking process work? What is the proper procedure? (I have no idea, I've only seen Rice say that it's routine, but without discussing any specific instances.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any indication that if Rice requested that such-and-such report be unmasked, that she used improper means to do so?

       There is no evidence that has been presented that she did anything improper. Its not even clear what the allegation even is. Here is a brief rundown of what I've read about how this works:
* Intelligence assets surveil foreign conversations and activities.
* Intelligence agencies get these reports back from the field.
* They sift through and decide what they believe and the confidence intervals they have in those beliefs based on the totality of the evidence, including previous surveillances.
* They prioritize the information then deliver it to someone like Dr. Rice.
* This means they've already decided its important and she needs to see it or it stays with them.
* Only the foreigner under surveillance is revealed. Any American is "masked", meaning their identity is kept from her.
* If she feels she needs to know the name for context, she may ask for it to be unmasked to understand what she is reading.
* Example "Russian ambassador spoke with American X about lifting sanctions if candidate y is elected.
* She wants to know who the Russia was talking to and about, because that's literally her job.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole scandal is bullshit manufactured to change the subject from the content of these surveillances which starting to become obvious is very damaging to Trump.

       We'll see.  It is really likely she would plead the 5th on all questions.  She can't really pick and choose which ones she would or wouldn't answer so it is safer just to plead the 5th on all of them.  It really isn't unlikely.  It is bad optics for her but much safer for her legally.  Plus they could ask all manner of questions that she would really not want to answer that may or may not be incriminating but could be very embarrassing.  It is guaranteed that she will be facing very hostile questions and she there is no upside for her personally to answer them (other than defending her reputation) and the downside is to risk a perjury charge.  I would be surprised if she doesn't plead the 5th.

       And, since this is the conspiracy sub afterall, if you are wondering why this seems to be under reported in the press, take a look at who is married to Rice.  Take a look at all the connections in a lot of the major media outlets and see if you can figure out why they might just be trying to suppress this story (hint they either worked in the Obama admin or are married to someone who did).  It won't work.  They can't bury the hearings and Trump is a master at making the press report things they would prefer to keep hidden.

       It would help your case if there seemed like she did anything wrong at all.

       I don't think you understand how silly the accusation is. Its really pathetic and desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't aware that if she asked for someone to be unmasked, it literally means she didn't know who it was, so it couldn't be targeting a political opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't know that it means that a FISA court approved a warrant, which means they had probably cause to think a crime was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't know that this further means someone in the intelligence community believed it so important that she be told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means that the intelligence community obtained a warrant because Trump or his associates were thought to be committing crimes and talking about it with Russia for it to get to her at all. All she did was  ask who the hell this Russian was talking to about a crime they were committing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is looking really, really bad for Trump. And you are completely buying the sitting government's story. This is the conspiracy sub. Is that what this sub is about? You just believe whatever the sitting government says without being skeptical? Because that's what's happening right now.

       The surveillance she requested unmasking includes material that doesn't relate to Russia.  Actually the current state of reporting makes it very clear that she acted improperly.  Nunes has copies of intelligence reports that he calls "alarming" due to the fact there doesn't appear to be a legitimate purpose for the unmasking.  Schiff confirms that Nunes' characterization of those documents is accurate (very under reported fact from this weekend).  Rice is named as the source of these reports and verified by multiple media sources.  She is in deep shit whether you choose to believe it or not.  It will all come out but the dots are already there to be connected.

       Schiff went to the whitehouse to view the documents on Friday evening.  Here is the confirmation from CNN State of the Union (you can find the transcript if you want):
      </p>
      <p>
       TAPPER: On Friday, you traveled to the White House to view these documents that Chairman Nunes, your Republican counterpart, has discussed, and Nunes says that they suggest the raising of issues, issues that he has, about incidental surveillance of Trump advisers, maybe even the president, himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president has said he feels somewhat vindicated by what Nunes has said about these documents, although Nunes has said they do not show what the president claimed, the wiretap of Trump at Trump Tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now you have seen these documents, can you understand why Chairman Nunes might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       SCHIFF: Well, I can't go into the contents of the documents, Jake.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I can't say I don't agree with the chairman's characterization
       </strong>
       , which is exactly why it's so important you don't share documents with just one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is using clever lawyer speak but the part in bold is the key.  You can reverse a double negative to get the easier to understand meaning of that.  The reverse is: I can say I do agree with the chairman's characterization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of his answer is bitching about the process but there is no argument presented as to the actual content.

       Nothing wrong with that. Notice the word "incidental". That means they were talking to foreign targets of surveillance and weren't targets themselves.

       The issues are not the incidental surveillance.  The issues are the unmasking of US persons from the incidental surveillance.  The issues include the possibility that the unmasking doesn't have any legitimate purpose other than political spying.  Those are the issues Nunes has raised.  Nunes has stated on the record that the reports he was reading had nothing to do with Russia and no intelligence value that he could determine.  Therefore why were names unmasked and why do these reports even exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI these documents Nunes and Schiff were looking at are Obama's presidential daily briefings most likely which means Trump may not be too far off base.  If you watch Rice's interview today with Andrea Mitchell she describes a process which matches exactly with the PDB.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done replying.  Choose to believe whatever you want but I have followed it pretty closely and the information that is currently available indicates that it is extremely likely that surveillance methods were abused for political purposes by members of the Obama admin.  We may never know the full extent and the crazy part is a lot of it was legal (for now).  It will be interesting to see whether or not the agencies are willing to put a few folks in jail to keep their powers because if not then I expect congress to start cracking down on them.

       I said I wouldn't reply but c'mon.  That's kind of a dumb question.  If it has no intelligence value then why request an unmasking?  In other words Nunes has stated there was information included that had nothing to do with Russia or any other intelligence value.  Probably a conversation with an ambassador to Turkey or something that doesn't have any particular value.  Why unmask the name?  What possible purpose did she have to request an unmasking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further it gets really easy to figure out which conversations are likely ones involving the incoming administration.  If there are 3 new calls to the Turkish ambassador right after the election from a person that has no previous record of contacting the ambassador it is pretty safe to guess that it was probably a Trump team member.
      </p>
      <p>
       The executive branch should not be spying on ANY american without good reason.  This same Obama administration has a history of doing this too.  They spied on reporters.  They even spied on members of Congress.

       I didn't say it has no intelligence value. Clearly it did or the IC wouldn't have chosen to present it in the first place. So if you have a problem with the presentation, blame the IC. All Rice did was say, who is this person talking to this foreigner about something that is so important that
       <em>
        the intelligence community brought it to her attention in the first place.
       </em>

       Question: My understanding of this story is that these communications were picked up through normal surveillance of foreign communications and that Susan Rice requested that the names of US citizens be unmasked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the case, is the suggestion that she knew that the names were of Trump campaign staff before requesting that they be unmasked?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, how did she know that and why would she bother requesting information she already had?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, what's the conspiracy? How was this 'targeting Trump' if she didn't know it was Trump staff before requesting the unmasking?

       Why don't you try responding to the points of his argument?
If I was a Donald Trump shill trying to make this look like a controversy when it's nothing even close to it, I would probably find people who actually read and understand the story and buy them gold so it looks like they're ShareBlue shills. Then I would make a stupid comment about the gold, hoping it will distract from the real point they're making.

       I don't really care if you gilded it or not, but it is very easy to gild a post while not using your main account. Posts being gilded shouldn't matter either way anyway, it's the content that should be considered. Non-admin users on Reddit wouldn't have enough information either way to make an informed decision on where a gilding came from, and would just be speculation susceptible to manipulation.

       Although I don't agree with many things Trump and his associates are doing, I do think it is a bit fishy for a comment to be gilded so quickly. Especially on this subreddit. Arguing with his comment? I agree somewhat with what he was saying. But I believe there is a possibility it wasn't unknown to Rice that they were connected to Trump and it wasn't just because he was talking about illegal things.

       To be fair,

      <p>
       The NSA and other branches of the IC collect a ton of data, especially on foreign individuals. Imagine a huge database of every phone call with people of importance on foreign soil. An analogy would be Susan Rice going into the database, and searching for names of Trump and Trump associates, and asking for all those conversations to be unmasked. Susan Rice then selectively leaks out conversations across several branches of the US government, some of which inevitably makes it into the news. It should not be this easy to spy on American citizens without a warrant. Dems are hiding under the claim that this was 'incidental collection' ie that Trump and team were not the target, but that narrative goes out the window when it becomes clear that names of Trump and associates were asked to be unmasked dozens of times. It effectively appears to be disguised monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an unmasking is normally requested by a law enforcement agency -- in this case, it should have been the FBI. It is shocking that Susan Rice made this request. It is also shocking that, as far as we know, unmasked conversations included conversations not related in any way to Russia. It is also shocking that she apparently made this request dozens of times.

        An analogy would be Susan Rice going into the database, and searching for names of Trump and Trump associates, and asking for all those conversations to be unmasked.

       That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

       If she requested a name be unmasked, that means that
       <em>
        she did not know who that person was prior to asking
       </em>
       . She sees a conversation between a foreign entity and a US person, and is allowed to request that US person's name be unmasked if it is deemed important to national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could the Obama admin possibly target Trump associates by unmasking their names, when by definition they don't know who the person is until the name is unmasked?

       Welcome to r/conspiracy, where everyone is taking crazy pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I have read into the story, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong conspiracy hivemind, the above comment is correct. She would not have known (except possibly through clear dialog queues in the transcripts) who the US Citizens on the calls were until after requesting them to be unmasked. And more significantly, people keep playing this like it's somehow vindication for Trump's "tapp" comments, when really, these calls were made by people dumb enough to contact foreign individuals who were the subject of monitoring before Trump was even in office. They walked into the worlds most obvious spider web, and are now trying to blame the spider for targeting them.

       In this specific case, yes.

      <p>
       Why? Because T_D blatantly states what the sub is all about, if you are not in with the crew you'll get censored because nobody wants to read that, everybody is circlejerking about how great America is going to be, that sub is not a place for discussion and they are very clear about it.

       Now,
       <a href="/r/politics">

       is disguised as this default sub in which everyone can participate, if they deleted the things they don't agree with they wouldn't show to people how bad it is to think like that.

      <p>
       IMO that's why it's more dangerous, which is my original statement.

       It'd be dishonest if the user conducted themselves without implying (or even outright saying sometimes) that they are the only bastion of free speech on reddit. A simple statement on the sidebar doesn't change the conduct and demeanor of T_D users.

       But a bastion of free speech for the right isn't a bastion of free speech, it's just an echo chamber. Which is fine, they need a place where they can discuss thier ideas without being derailed by completely opposing ideas. But to call themselves a bastion of free speech while engaging in heavy censorship is dishonest, not to mention them as a bastion of free speech is one of the tent poles in the morally superiority attitude many of them carry(which is one of my biggest personal reasons for disliking them)

       <a href="/r/politics">

       threads and there is a lot of rational discussion. Outside of the obvious trolls and idiots, there are a lot of actual conversations going on in there. I don't know that T_D serves any purpose such as that.

       Rational conversations because you agree with them. Trust me, I voted for Obama twice, it's eerie how easily you can get sucked into that chamber. Though then again,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       used to be much more measured back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only place, and I mean
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       place for sensible discussion is
       <a href="/r/neutralpolitics">

      </p>

        /r/PoliticalDiscussion

       is the first to come to mind.

       I agree with you that T_D is mostly troll. However they own it. /r/p are elitist trolls who think they have a higher understanding of the world when they are the same as T_D under a different veil.

       There is a huge difference between
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and T_D. One sub allows open discussion from both sides. Sure there are more liberals on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , but they do not ban you for facts. They do not ban you for presenting a conservative point of views.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dare you. Go on T_D and say you are upset about Trump signing the anti-privacy bill. You will be banned in minutes. Now go on
       <a href="/r/poltics">
        /r/poltics
       </a>
       and defend the anti-privacy bill using a corporate shill talking point. Like the it's "same as google facebook" BS.

       You are correct that you are banned in the self proclaimed echo chamber that is T_D.

       However, in order to keep up the facade that is fake balance in
       <a href="/r/politics">

       , they do not ban for dissenting opinion. They just downvote you into oblivion. My lowest rated posts are historically from

       and number in the -hundreds.

       Not even close. I didn't have to go far to prove you wrong. This discussion about Rice
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63ebcd/cnns_cuomo_rice_story_is_fake_scandal/dftpyvx/">
        is taking place over /r/politics.
       </a>
       Note how both the left and right are presenting their sides to make their case. This kind of discussion cannot happen in T_D. The Rice defender would be called a shill and banned immediately.

       But TD is ADVERTISED as a trump sub, politics is advertised as being bipartisan. It would make more sense if r/HRC (or whatever the mirror of TD is) was as popular as politics. But r/politics is supposedly bipartisan, but absolutely is shilled to the max by the left.

       Can you share those with me? I went back a year and couldn't find any comment with more than -14  let alone -100s.  I'd honestly much rather have my comment down voted rather than deleted right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I know my opinion was read by as many people I'm down voted by. Which is the entire point of making a comment. If you're  worried about how many points you'll get then you're doing it wrong as this leads to people saying whatever they think other want to hear rather than what they believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being banned is the worst possible punishment when you want your opinion to be heard. It completely censors you for good
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add I don't like either of their practices but not against them existing. I would like if they stayed three and didn't brigade other subreddits and pretend to be victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also people like to pretend that /politics has some much greater power and user base when in reality The Donald is second in daily traffic which gives it an enormous amount of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple that with their strict rules and instant bans, you can control any message you want.

       This is patently false. I was banned from politics (right after the new mods came in) for making
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/548uu1/fbi_docs_obama_used_pseudonym_to_email_hillarys/d7zxzv6/">
        this anti-Hillary comment

       B) 32 upvotes? Nice counterpoint to disprove the false narrative that any Anti-hillary comment on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was downvoted to oblivion.

       They keep crying about censorship all over Reddit but then delete any post that goes against their 'Trump knows best' worldview. They also constantly engage in vote brigading.

       You should've seen it last night when they cancelled an ama at the last minute because of some tweets the person are a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a unhappy pedes in there who were trying to delicately express their unhappiness at the situation without getting banned themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all fun and games until that shit begins to affect you  personally. Then you realize just how shitty it is to not be able to defend yourself at all and have to make a decsion to either compromise your integrity and go with it or take a stand for what you believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were at least 50 different comments at the time questioning themselves and having a a difficult time accepting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The others quickly switched gears and proffeseed how they never liked the bitch to begin with and knew all along how bad she was. These are the shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spend a year praising someone and continuing the circlejerk until that person says one thing they don't like. Then they become public enemy number one within minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When these things happen more and more people snap out of it and realize how crazy it is and cracks begin to grow larger in the community. Eventually they will split up leaving behind the most loyal and rabid fans and shills.

       And no, I won't correct as the fact is that there still no discussion while IMO it should be a sticky post or at least a thread with more than 5 comments, that's not discussion that's mods still not seeing those.

       I would hope they would be discussing that. I haven't read the bill myself, and I'm read in many conflicting reports on it. Our privacy has been violated by so many bills since 9/11, it's near impossible to link them together in some kind of historical order to create context to understand the newest shit.

       Your link is not about Trump actually signing the bill.

       Arranged the comments by new and the newest is from 3 days ago, when Trump haven't even signed the bill.

       You could play liberal and apply your own mental gymnastics out of this, or you can be more like a conservative and admit it's shit that there's no thread to discuss Trump actually signing it, because even yesterday people were saying there he wasn't gonna sign it.

       If you have a solution I'm here to listen, my solution was acknowledging what they are.

       I'd turn off all karma in political subs and have the votes hidden. That would greatly reduce the ones there simply to circlejerk and farm karma imo. These are the places to get quick comment and link karma for accounts intended for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always see hundreds of memes and other low effort comments posted over and over in big threads there. It gives the illusion of a lot of activity when in reality there is very little substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the people there who are willing to discuss it with your are drowned out by the noise. They also get ostracized for simply posting there rather than on the content of their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's happened to me firsthand in this sub. Someone insinuated I was a TD shill because I simply made a few comments there. However when I asked them to provide a comment with me supporting him they never answered.

       Susan Rice makes a statement about an ongoing event where circumstances are, at best, murky. SHE LIED!

       Donald Trump repeats verifiably false claims about things that never happened (people dancing in the streets on 9/11, Obama was not born in the US). Well gosh, that's just what he believes!

       Well first of all, we don't have access to the classified intelligence reports that the story seems to reference so we actually don't know what's in them.

       Second of all, she doesn't have the authority to discuss classified intelligence documents. Would you have rather her said "No comment"?

       So, so many. I want the various investigations to reach conclusions asap; but I also understand that the scope and magnitude of the issue requires thorough and impeccable research to provide iron-clad proof. There are FBI investigations of a much less controversial nature that have taken three years to conclude. I just hope our privacy, economy, environment, justice system, educational system, international alliances, and individual rights can survive that long.

       Regardless what happened I can guarantee you no former president is going to jail. Obama ordered an airstrike that killed an American citizen ffs.

      <p>
       Those scenarios you provided are like littering. Even Nixon avoided going to jail. Trust me they look out for their own first. Just like how Hillary is in jail even though Trump made his entire campaign about her.

       She does not have the authority to unmask. She has the authority to request that the provider of the report unmask American citizens. Because there are privacy concerns with such actions, this runs through a legal process which involves all non-political career national security professionals and lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way she could have obtained unmasking (if she did) is if the non-political career professionals determined that it was (A) vital to understanding the intelligence, or (B) implied that the U.S. person was complicit in some espionage or criminal wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further more, how could she have known she was targeting Trump officials at the time? How would she have known that [REDACTED] was acutally a Trump aid?

       So how do you suppose she knew which redacted names to unmask? How many innocent Americans do you think she unmasked before she found the Trump aids communicating with foreign officials? Was she just asking her intel sources to unmask ALL redacted names in order of striking gold? Sounds pretty far fetched.

       My question is why you think anyone cares that she unmasked the names. Director Comey listed several other people during his congressional testimony who had access to these and presumably didn't leak them.

      <p>
       The only one we are fussing about is Rice because she breached national security and leaked classified information which is a felony punishable by 10 years in prison.

       Most of the comments I've read today claim she was targeting the Trump transition team and this proves Trump Tower was "tapped".

       I don't care about the leak. If you would like to give me some evidence she was the leak I'd be happy to read it and comment on that, but it is not topic of the conversation you joined.

        Here's a headling for this sub: Susan Rice was ordered by Obama to spy on political opponents as far back as 2013! Not a peep out of you people.  This whole Russian narrative is being used as a coverup for the worst case of presidential abuse since Nixon.

       Your comment was stupid, inaccurate, purposely poking people you know will disagree with you, and then you ask for downvotes.

       You did it so you could complain later about being downvoted. You didn't add anything to the discussion, you just wanted a downvote badge to jerk off to later.

       Possibly intentionally spying on Americans via bogus FISA warrants, possibly unmasking inappropriately, possibly warrantless search for Trump associates via FISA network of data, possibly leaking information she found via all or some of the above. I think that all covers it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be an ultra high standard for unmasking Americans (something that rises to level of criminality). If they had that, Trump would not be sitting in the White House most likely.

       Lots of "possibly" in that statement. What makes the FISA warrants bogus exactly? Those have to be approved by a judge and the requirements for them are fairly strict.

       I'm not saying the are, bogus, as you pointed out, that's why I'm using the word "possibly." All I'm saying is that would need to be looked into in any investigation. The problem with FISA is that it basically rubber stamps everything because they aren't US citizens. So there is a very, very low standard to get FISA warrants. All you would have to do is get a warrant for a foreigner that you knew Trump was in regular contact with to spy on him. Again, not saying that happened, saying that is one of the questions being raised.

       All I ever said was that these are the possibilities...the reason it needs to be looked into is because there is a high standard for unmasking American names, so of course people are suspicious of the fact that it was done. Whether you believe the Russia stuff or specifically disbelieve it, you should be very curious as to why the names were unmasked.

       I saw some things earlier when I was first looking for the story. People just don't think it's as big as conservatives do. Besides both sides are busy with their respective scandals. AFAIK Trump is the one under FBI investigation. So if there were wiretapping the FBI would know. We have to have some trust in government institutions to do their job and give us the truth.

       But that wasn't illegal for her to do, and it's definitely not clear that it was for political purposes. She had to get permission from the agency that gathered the reports in the first place, which is specifically done to avoid political manipulation. There could be a legitimate, national security reason for her to have done so.

      <p>
       I'm all for having her testify in front of Congress. I'd want her to answer why she unmasked Trump's team. Let's see if it works out in Trump's favor.

       How is that what you took away from post? Of course the Intelligence community knows who everyone involved is. They redact the names of US citizens in the report they prepare for the Security Advisor. When Rice read the report it simply says "US Citizen" in place of their name, which is why she had to request they be "unmasked" (have their names given).

       FISA Foreign Intelligence Surveillance is not a tool to be used for collection of data of americans by intelligence community's. Thats the whole point of the F in the name. In fact for a FISA warrant to be granted there are supposed to be safe guards in place to protect americans. Somebody in the high up of the obama administration disregarded these safe guards for no reason whatsoever as far as we know right now. Then they lowered the classification of the transcripts and spread them far and wide. Thats what i took away from this.

       Susan Rice was the National Security Adviser. She received intel reports from the NSA and FBI on matters of national security. She is not given any information on American citizens, and their identities are "masked" before the reports ever reach her.
      </p>
      <p>
       She does not have the authority to unmask these American's mentioned in her reports. She has the authority to request that the provider of the report unmask American citizens, but because there are privacy concerns with such actions, this runs through a legal process which involves all non-political career national security professionals and lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way she could have obtained unmasking is if the non-political career professionals determined that it was (A) vital to understanding the intelligence, or (B) implied that the U.S. person was complicit in some espionage or criminal wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA or FBI reviewed her request, and deemed her concern was warranted and gave her the names of Trump Officials. Were Donald's friends complicit in espionage or criminal wrongdoing? Because that's what you're implying by posting that Trump team members were unmasked.

       The same intelligence agency who said they were not wire tapping Trumps people. Is that the intelligence agency your talking about. If they suspected Trump or his people of anything they should have used normal channels to spy on his people. But no they used the FISA because its set up to spy on non americans and dosent have the oversight of normal channels. And for what reason did rice have to unmask the people who spoke to people with FISA warrants? Are you seriously gonna tell me that none of the 3 letter agency's suspected that these people with FISA warrants didnt have any ties to Tumps people? They know who they are and what their talking about but its impossible to draw any conclusions from info they got from the warrant. If you say we were spying on these people and didnt know anything about them it makes our intelligence community look incompetent.

       No, as I have already told you, The intelligence agencies knew exactly who the Trump people were. Rice, on the other hand, had no idea who they were when she requested the unmasking.

       Yeah... Can't be a centrist neutral anymore... Downvoted there for suggesting that the left has a propaganda problem as well,  downvoted here suggesting that Susan Rice really didn't do anything wrong. I'd love to actually engage someone about this shit... Both sides are so fanatics.

       OP, in the off chance you want to learn anything today:
      </p>
      <p>
       Susan Rice never had the power to unilaterally order an identity to be unmasked. Because there are privacy concerns with such actions, this runs through a legal process which involves all non-political career national security professionals and lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way she could have obtained unmasking (if she did) is if the non-political career professionals determined that it was (A) vital to understanding the intelligence, or (B) implied that the U.S. person was complicit in some espionage or criminal wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were Donald's friends complicit in espionage or criminal wrongdoing? Because that's what you're implying by posting that Trump team members were unmasked. So by all means, keep pushing this narrative.

       In my opinion, the sub has been complete shit since the primaries began last year. I have browsed (And still do) there for years, and It was once my go-to for information. The sub was always left-leaning, but around the primaries things began to change. The manipulation of comment sections was probably the first thing I noticed. In the past the top comment would be a well thought out political comment regarding the post, and the discussion would take off from there. There was actually some good content in the arguments people would sometimes have. Nowadays the top comment for every post seems like a shitty anti-Trump joke that gets up-voted 1000 times for no apparent reason.

       large part of that is it being a non-story.  it was fully legal and well within her job description to unmask intelligence, she couldnt even do it without others approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only interesting part of this is that Republicans are playing it so wrong and trying to make her testify, providing an opening for democrats to ask questions that would allow her to bring whatever the intelligence contained out

       There Trump Russian connection doesn't rest on some meeting Obama orchestrated. There are deep ties between Trump's team and Russian officials. It came up in investigations because our intelligence agencies routinely investigate our adversaries. Russia interfered in our election, so it makes sense they'd be investigated by our intelligence agencies. No smoking gun has been made public that definitively links the Trump administration with Russia, but there are an unusual number of connections. Quite a bit of smoke for there to not be a fire. That's why they can't shake the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with your story is that it discounts the very real investigations going on as frivolity invented by Obama and ignores everything that points to there actually being something there. Just because Chaffetz used his position with the oversight committee in a shamefully partisan way doesn't mean virtually all of our intelligence agencies are doing the same thing.

       The very same investigations that both Clapper and Comey have said turned up no evidence of collusion? The very same investigations that caused Schiff to come out on Sunday and say they have seen no definitive proof of collusion between Trump's team and Russia, after he got done saying a few days before hand about how they had a "smoking gun"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the investigation you're talking about? At some point, you have to cut your losses and walk away. When everything says "there's nothing here", you don't keep digging because you
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       like there might be something. Sometimes there's nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama had phone calls, emails, and literal spreadsheets of information about Trump and his team's interactions with Russia. Nothing has come from that (from the mouths of the very people doing the investigation). If there was anything there, it would have been known long before Trump was even allowed to win the nomination (the wiretapping started before that, remember).
      </p>
      <p>
       But I get it, you want to hate Trump and you want to hate Russia. It's like a perfect marriage for you. A word of wisdom for you: You can dislike Trump, and think he'll be a bad president, without needing the Russian conspiracy. It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       possible for you to recognize it for the farce that it is, while still believing Trump was a mistake.

      <p>
       After over a year of everybody saying "it's nothing", yes I did. I still believe it was something, but the law makers have spoken. It got to a point where it was just wasting time and money. And so I dropped it. But at least with Benghazi we had actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm at that point with this Russian shit. We have
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       nothing to show for it after a year. There would be something to show for it if there was anything. We would, at a minimum, not see people who once beat the Russian drum change their tunes. And, if not, that would mean our intelligence community is incompetent, at which point I wouldn't believe what they say nor would I trust their investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we continue to waste our time, money, and effort investigating something that over a year of wiretaps, server spying, etc has turned up
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       ? It's time to cut our losses and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       Trump is a Putin "pawn", he's done the opposite of behave that way. Hell, he sent his UN lady to tell Russia to cut their shit more than once. And he wouldn't be able to act on it anyways -- the country has (and would have) such a happy trigger finger.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, why do we continue to hold up our government investigating something that's turned up
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       nothing? Why are you okay with your money being spent on something that, thus far, has been a complete failure (at least in terms of the stated goals -- which is to find evidence of collusion)?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, most importantly, why does all this suddenly make you okay with the government spying on political opponents, unmasking them, and then using that information for their own gains (news flash: these leaks existed BEFORE Trump took office. Same with the Flynn info. They sat on it to do maximum harm to Trump)?

       I think you missed the point.  Making claims without any evidence and then demanding someone disprove your assertions is not how the "burden of proof" works.  You should add the citations to your original post.

       I don't know enough about the subjects nor your sources yet to have an informed opinion.  I'll read into them and we'll see.

       Not in the way that you've represented it so far.  I'm taking my time going through every single citation, but the first two appear to be misrepresentations or faulty assertions.  I'll edit my original reply to you as I move through as I could be wrong, but this is my first impression.

       Again, my main contention was about the "burden of proof", but if someone was making assertions about a subject that they've no knowledge of... there's definitely an issue.

       Fair enough!  I always try to take the time to try and understand different arguments, however, as it makes mine more robust.  My only concern are gish gallopers, but you seem intellectually honest enough to engage.

       In this specific case, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because T_D blatantly states what the sub is all about, if you are not in with the crew you'll get censored because nobody wants to read that, everybody is circlejerking about how great America is going to be, that sub is not a place for discussion and they are very clear about it.

       Now,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       is disguised as this default sub in which everyone can participate, if they deleted the things they don't agree with they wouldn't show to people how bad it is to think like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO that's why it's more dangerous, which is my original statement.

       Rational conversations because you agree with them. Trust me, I voted for Obama twice, it's eerie how easily you can get sucked into that chamber. Though then again,

       used to be much more measured back then.

      <p>
       One thing I can say about this is that Snopes is very carefyl about how they respond to anything. If they cannot debunk it they usually debunk something else with tricky wording making it sound like they are referring to the question, when really they pulled a fast one on the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I had the example that usually gets passed around for this, but I don't think there are as many situations where you can outright say they were wrong, just that they conveniently avoided addressing the actual issue.

       Wait, wait, wait, it sounds like you're accusing Susan Rice of spying on Trump and his team. That's a bit of a stretch given that foreigners were targeted by FISA warrants and those targets happened to be discussing Trump or in contact with Trump officials. We're calling that "spying on Trump and his team" now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any real way to assess whether the "unmasking" is a big deal. The hysteria over at T_D makes me suspect that this is a rather routine part of an investigation.

       She unmasked anonymous names based on their contact with suspicious foreigners that were being monitored.  No way she would have know it was Trump or his team and she did not leak that information to anyone.  She was doing her job.  Why was Trump's team communicating with foriegn persons of interest is the better question of this story.

       I thought Nunes said that some people associated with Trump's campaign were incidentally surveilled as part of routine intelligence gathering on foreign nationals, but that it wasn't necessarily at Trump Tower, or ordered by President Obama (admittedly, Nunes was very vague).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even if Rice ordered the unmasking of the names of the Americans who were incidentally surveilled, how are we at "she unmasked what they got my spying on Trump and his team?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Did new evidence come out on this? Your statement makes it sound like she knew the surveillance was of Trump's team--that she knew the unmasked names would be of Trump associates before she even got them unmasked.

       this is what the Republicans always do. They did it with Benghazi, they did it with Eric Holder. They find something that is not illegal or even particularly problematic, but that is nonetheless complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       They trust that their supporters aren't intelligent enough to understand the nuance or else won't bother trying to understand. "Incidental collection, FISA warrants, unmasking, what is all that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Republicans just wave their arms and shout and use words like "Freedom," "Obama," "smoking gun," "bombshell," "unprecedented!," and "cover up" and their base just goes along with it, because they hate Obama and want it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Rice is accused of doing (and likely did do) isn't illegal. It isn't surprising. It isn't interesting. And it isn't bad. If you want to have a high level policy discussion about how to balance privacy rights under the current intelligence gathering framework? Cool. Let's do that. But don't pretend this is an issue when you didn't give a fuck for the last sixteen years since you guys wrote and adopted the Patriot Act and then reauthorized it over and over.

       1) Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador who is under surveillance (do I have to explain how this means Flynns conversation with him is recorded?) -&gt; perhaps in investigating the Russian election influence, rice or someone else requested to unmask the US person in these intercepts -&gt; that request was granted and the unmasked transcripts were given to that person where they were then distributed throughout the intelligence community. I'm not exactly sure of the mechanism for that but it seems it could have been as part of the Russia meddling documents or a more secret thing limited to certain people in the IC community.

       Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense or if you have any refutations.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) People have been saying that trumps outbursts or allegations about being wire tapped have been smokescreen to distract from his teams Russia connections. I don't disagree with them. When you say it's insane based on the imbalance of evidence I assume you must believe that you are aware of all evidence in both cases, which clearly none of us are. The investigation is still ongoing, right? Not to mention that the two aren't mutually exclusive. Trump could fully have been illegally spied on and it could also still be a smokescreen/distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't use the term, schiff did. I'm not aware of all of the evidence in the case and neither are you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I quite frankly don't know what's being investigated. I think it's entirely possible that new evidence has come to light since clapper left. I don't know and neither do you. Are you not going to address the fact that coordination short of collusion could have happened? Or another crime? I don't know the details of the still ongoing investigation, do you?
      </p>

       I'm sure you were super respectful of Obama. How did you show your respect for him? Why would I respect a president who said we should never and that the country could never withstand having a president under investigation by the FBI, who at that time and still to this day is under his own FBI investigation? Who stiffs every day contractors, cleaners, and other service providers? Who blasts a president for playing golf when he's on a pace to play far more rounds? Who said he'd never leave the White House because he'd be working too hard but goes on vacation every week on taxpayer money? Who's wife won't live in the whitehouse, costing taxpayers millions? who's national security advisor resigned in disgrace and now it turns out also didn't disclose his work representing foreign nations? who won't divest from his businesses when they clearly benefit from his position and from foreigners? Who can never admit being wrong? Who can't stop tweeting?

       No naivety required. If the FBI is eavesdropping on a criminal and I happen to speak with that criminal on the phone, should I really be surprised if my voice is recorded? What if the NSA is eavesdropping on a spy.

       The fact that you're incapable of arguing your point without resorting to straw men and hyperbole says a lot about your ability to process this information. T_D, like the big orange con man, preys on gullible rubes like you.

       We know that's obviously not the case as members of his team have resigned. So they were definitely in contact with foreign agents who were under investigation and they considered whatever they talked about bad enough to resign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was simply the weather they would've  stayed on the team and gladly released the conversation themselves.

       Believing that they were monitored for no reason is delusional at this point.

       Regardless what happened I can guarantee you no former president is going to jail. Obama ordered an airstrike that killed an American citizen ffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those scenarios you provided are like littering. Even Nixon avoided going to jail. Trust me they look out for their own first. Just like how Hillary is in jail even though Trump made his entire campaign about her.

       Schiff's statements on video. He never says he can't comment on existing evidence. In fact, it's pathetically clear that they have uncovered nothing thus far. Good luck to them LOL

       To a larger point, what evidence is there that Russia changed

       I don't remember that, it must have had zero impact like the rest of your illogical comments. It does make sense though because all of your insults are projection. They came from within you, your hate for yourself, and so they apply to you perfectly, of course. I'm sure you'll be chanting maga while the world burns, truly idiocracy.
