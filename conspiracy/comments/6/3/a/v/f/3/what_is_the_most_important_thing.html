       I believe if we want to fix the root of our issues, we need to ask why things are the way they are. If we follow the chain of asking why all the way down, we can find a root cause that may fix all the other issues that spring from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't feel good sometimes, because of anxiety or depression. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I feel uncertain of my future, and it makes me uneasy. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because without income, I may be homeless and without food. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because our society is organized in a way where money is gotten by exchanging labor. But we have arrived at a time in history where there's a shortage of jobs due to automation and outsourcing, so there are many who simply cannot get access to a reliable income stream to survive. So
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       is there automation and globalization of wages?
      </p>
      <p>
       Automation is happening because of the development of technology, which has to do with the human desire to control our environment. This desire seems to be in our genes, but we could probably culturally un-learn it over hundreds of years with effort. Globalization of the labor pool is allowed by technology too, airplanes and internet which allow for geographical distances to be less and less important. Because they have more money, companies can move locations more easily than citizens, and can manipulate law itself more easily than citizens.
       <em>
        But why?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't know. Stop asking why. It is what it is." say some who want to mentally check out when things get too deep, throwing out their preferred thought-terminating cliches.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if globalism is made possible by technology, and technology comes from our desires to control our environment, and we can't find jobs because of automation and globalization,  then
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       do we in effect keep desiring things that end up hurting us? Are we really that short-sighted? And/or are our genetic predispositions
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       ill-suited for modern society?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Just shut up, kid. No one needs to be thinking about this stuff, do something real." I can hear it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My stomach still hurts though.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Take some antacids."
      </p>
      <p>
       So it goes.

       Yup. The pyramid needs to be flattened. Positions of power need to be abolished, on the level of cultural beliefs, not just law. Just like people no longer tolerate Kings and Queens ruling over them, that logic needs to be extended to the groups that currently rule over us.

       Until this happens, every other attempt to fix civilization is just rearranging deck chairs on the titanic, imo.

       Haha, exactly. And when they charge interest on all money, and own the legal ability to create it,
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       they can basically hold the government hostage through the debt it owes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world is literally in debt to the central banks, and everyone seems to just be OK with this setup, generally speaking. They literally own the world, financially speaking. And then when they yank the reins of control, people are surprised. It's like... duh.

I've been talking till I'm blue in the face to people on the internet for 15 years now.  And now they're gonna shit it down, or at least end anonymity so they can come drone strike us troublemakers.

       Ugh this. I think the whole "don't talk politics, religion, or money in polite company" meme really hurt American public discourse. And I think the media primes people to be hyper-reactive and emotional on these topics, so to avoid that negative emotional trigger that's been programmed in to them, they avoid the subject altogether. They don't want to cause a social problem, and there are so many similarly emotionally reactive people out there, and that trumps everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you can do is just keep saying things and letting them be. Making a good point and then shutting up and moving on to the next topic is the best thing a "conspiracy theorist" can do, because people expect long rants and bullshit nonsense. So if you have short quips that are factually correct and then you immediately let it go and move on, you will win some people over. Or at least that's what I've discovered.

       Yessum. And then there's those conspiracy theory hater types who just defend the status quo no matter what. I think they're just afraid or stubborn because they didn't see it until someone else told them it, and they're just too narcissistic to have their mind changed.

       Yeah, the anti-conspiracy types have 2 modes of thought: 1. "Conspiracy theorists are paranoid and dumb" and then when evidence comes out 2. "Oh yeah, but we knew that already, no big surprise."
      </p>
      <p>
       They just take the side of the MSM zeitgeist and then pretend everyone else is dumb to maintain their ego. So simplistic.

       If I had a nickel for every time I've changed ideologies, I'd be a millionaire. At some point one gets tired of ideology shopping, and realizes most ideologies are just avenues for being controlled like a puppet. We've gotta cut the strings, and think for ourselves and encourage others to do the same.

       People who are central bankers aren't nice. That's just how it is. To rise to such positions of supreme power, you have to do a lot of backstabbing, and that's not going to change.

       The position of power itself needs to be abolished, like most positions of power. It attracts the worst of us to rule over all of us. This is a broken game.

       Everyone thinks they're doing the world a favor. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. They know not what they do. Etc etc. It's just how it is, I guess. People are going to get caught up in ignorant nonsense without realizing it, hurting others while thinking they're helping. Too much of that going on. People just need to live and let live.

       Yeah.  If you notice those busybody types are fronting so hard. They're so perfect in their own eyes.  We all have imperfections, our vanities, our butthurt egos, our jealousies. We cheat on our beloveds. Maybe we stole some candy.  They can't admit any of this, but they're cool with depopulating the planet. Go figure.

       I've become more spiritual lately, but my religion is that like emotions kind of gain a momentum and a charge that can spread and effect others, like an infection, or a healing power, depending.

       So Buddhism then? Haha
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Karma
       </em>
       is defined in Buddhism as the cause and effect that governs the behavior of the world, and it's exactly as you described. It's like a physics thing, not at all a supernatural thing, and it's very obvious once you see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Buddhists take it a little farther though, and say that your Karma determines your incarnation. So that infection or healing power you talk about, is more "you" than your physical body. After your physical body dies, perhaps you live on as that momentum in others. Like a mental shock wave going through generations of people. Perhaps this is eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       These ideas, along with meditation, are pretty much the core of most types of Buddhism. Buddhism is very scientific in a sense, but most lay Buddhist practitioners are laden with dogma just like every other religion, so it gets in the way of the core ideas. Just like every other religion. That's why I think being spiritual is more important than being religious, because religion ends up being associated with dogma just because of how it becomes a calcified social structure and narrative that ends up being repeated and embellished and spun, like some bad game of telephone, and the original core ideas get lost in the noise. I think most religions are like that on some level. So I don't call myself a Buddhist, but I'd say it's a primary source for a lot of my spiritual understanding. But so is Christianity, just by being raised in it I absorbed some of the good lessons there too. I think every religion is just a different perspective on the same spiritual truth that resonates with us all.

       Agreed 100%, but technology is enabling the sociopaths to get to whole new heights of power as they an "get ahead of the game" more and stay ahead of the citizenry, technologically speaking. Whereas if technology was stable instead of growing, this avenue of exploitation wouldn't be possible in the first place.

       The way I look at it, it's our birthright. To give that up is to give up the fight. Nobody said life is going to be easy. There's still going to be these sociopaths whether you have progression or not. The thing is not to blame technology, blame the people using it. We should have technology taking our jobs. We should be working less. It would give us more time to pursue more technology and advancements. More ways to help the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what your saying, but we are not loincloth wearing tribal people anymore. And I know you're not suggesting we go back to that. But we have so much more potential. Don't let the bad guy stop you from reaching their potential.that is exactly what the sociopaths want. They have technology way way more advanced than what we are given as citizens.

       I agree. But I think we also have to acknowledge the fact the powerful people have super-crazy weapons kind of gives them disproportionate power over everyone else. And they can maintain this lead because they have the resources to do tons of R&amp;D most people can't afford. I think this feedback loop of the powerful getting more powerful through technology needs to be slowed. This is the problem. Not that technology itself needs to be slowed or stopped or reversed.

       We're saying similar things, I'm just talking about one of the key tools those psychos use to maintain control. I'm talking about a dethroning technique, you're talking about IDing the perps. Both are useful and important

       Perhaps the most important thing is to live under the assumption that the world may not be there the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't try to haul the world upon your shoulders, like Atlas. Do good to people around you and when you get the chance, try to make a change somewhere for the better. Chances to affect our reality do come about when one pays attention, and all it takes is a bit of understanding and empathy to act in a way that effects positive changes, and these all have their own butterfly effects. Do good, as in try to act in a way to make people happy regardless of how they might appear to you physically. Perhaps our actions, as I've read, really do shape our own universe? If you filled your universe with good, as do many others, or may do in the future, it's sure to have positive changes on our mass reality. Western society only really started to crumble when fear of the cheap labourer set in, and people became distrustful on the streets, local businesses collapsed and convenience knocked intimacy off the thrown for our lifestyle choices. With proper education and a stronger, local people police presence, and stronger smaller communities , we could work towards a better future.

       Yes ok, it sounds naive and unrealistic, youd rather me tell you to trust on your fellow man to stab his fork into the hand of the man that feeds him, when in the other is glued a smartphone and ignorant bliss?

       The most important thing is self preservation. Why? Because our bodies are genetically geared for life. Even one not working correctly is still Alive and continues. So The importance of existing is almost All important for the Body.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the Body require? What else is important to it besides the basic necessities.. Not much. It basically looks pretty, well mine does, and it needs things and stores memory and wants to continue existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, where does importance come from after that?? In our bodies other impulses manifest also. Emotional and Sexual. And those two components can produce endless combinations that create something important. What is important in one moment can also not be in the next. Importance is both unabsolute and transitional.

      <p>
       As for the system,  I think the allure of having More of the basic necessities created a huge impulse in our past to support what it has become. Imagine living in a shack with maybe one cow in the 19th Century america. Compared to now. It was alluring to people I'm sure to have a bunch of shit, and another very important thing is having More. We are always wanting more, we are always becoming more, because we are geared for life too, just like our bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is important is Having more. Having the basic necessities, and lots More of them. And having more outlets for the sexual/emotional focus to be created.

       I don't think it's a trick so much as an evolutionary overshoot, a brain trick that got taken too far, and now we have to deal with the consequences. Egoism was a heavy selection force over the last million years of human development, I would imagine, since our intelligence is our key ability and egoism creates drive for power, and powerful people are more likely to survive and breed and pass on their genes. But now the environment is different but our genes are the same, and it's creating all this frustration.

       assuming force means protests to force changes the legal system, that doesn't sound like an awful idea. Democratically-owned/worker-owned businesses would be an incredible benefit to humanity and help redistribute the wealth more naturally across a company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even just putting a cap on the ratio between CEO and lowest worker pay in the company would be a boon. France and Germany have such laws, at 40x ratios, I think. In the US the average ratio is 475x. One of the many reasons there is so much class inequality

       How do you enforce such laws? Through force? Good Will? Your views seem very Marxist. I'm a free market guy myself. If a company wants to pay someone that much then that is their business. You and me might think it is stupid, but the company thinks that person is worth that much. I like your anarchist views. I'm an anarchist myself, I just don't believe in the initiation of force. I follow the guidelines of the non aggression principal. I won't dive into the philosophy in this sub unless the discussion calls for it. I'm reading through this thread and I like what I'm seeing. I'm more than happy to impart my anarcho-capitalists views if it is wanted.

       I'm non aggressive too, are protests not nonviolent? How does big change like civil rights come about? It's not just through voting, but it doesn't require violence either.

       Corporations have aligned with the state because the state has a monopoly on violence. If the state ceased to exist then all the power would be in the hands of the consumer (boycott) and in the hands of the labor (organized strike). We as the people could bend the corporations over our knee. In an anarchist free market, there probably wouldn't be these huge monopolistic multinational corporations anyway, but I digress.

       Why? How would this come about, and how would it be enforced? because it seems to me like all free markets eventually tend to become ruled by monopolies, that's why anti-trust laws were invented.

       Well first off the corporations write all the regulations and have their little enforcers in the government to burden the average person with insurmountable barriers to entry (taxes, labor costs, regulations, etc.). In my view, things would be done more locally. There could be some monopolies, but  with organized labor and boycotting, like I mentioned earlier, along with low barriers to entry into the market monopolies could be mitigated. This is all theory and I don't want to get bogged down in the minutia of all this in this sub. If you like this sort of stuff check out

       One of the most interesting aspects of the Star Trek universe is that it proposes a future without intelligent robots (DATA is a very rare exception). If we accept this concept, at some point the leaders of the planet would have had to get together and decide that the world would be a better (and safer) place if human beings did not have robotic slaves to do everything for them.
