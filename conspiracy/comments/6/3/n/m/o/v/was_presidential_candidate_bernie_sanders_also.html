       There may not have been much to learn by spying on Sanders as his public and private faces may not be as completely different as, say, Clinton's. The primary-rigging and propaganda was probably enough.

       Pretty sure Bernie was aware the whole time that he had no chance of receiving the nomination, he was just a way to drum up votes for the Democratic party, which obviously backfired..

       What amazes me is that people still wonder if individuals, especially those in the upper echelons of power, are being "spied" on or watched. It would shock me if any individual who's a threat to the establishment, or of any interest at all, were not being watched.
