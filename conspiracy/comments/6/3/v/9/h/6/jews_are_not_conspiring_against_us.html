       I am very disturbed by a number of people that seem to validate neo-Nazi ideas that Jews are responsible for conspiring against pretty much everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that Jews are disproportionately successful, this does not mean that Jews are behind a conspiracy to subjugate non-Jews or to undermine our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say that Israel, for example, is somehow innocent.  But we have to separate Jews, as a people, from actions taken by Israel or other lobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it very disturbing that so many people are being taken in by anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.

       It might be unfortunate that people have to use their own fake label "Jew" to describe them, but trying to brush off valid criticism of a Zionist agenda as racism makes you look like a propagandist.

       Tbqh I've seen less and less "anti-Zionism is anti-semitism" over the years while people claiming to be unfairly subjected to it have become more and more vocal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is that the Venn diagram of anti-Zionists and anti-semitists has a pretty huge overlap. IMO the reason is that I've observed many many anti-Zionists tolerate anti-semitism in their forums possibly because they're just happy to see the chorus grow louder.

       Also, you have to figure that there are operatives involved who's sole purpose is to sound as racist as possible when addressing Zionism just so that image is perpetuated of people who take issue with the globalists Zionism agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably not a true conspiracy out there that isn't shilled in that very same way.

       Correct. The conspiracy is to try to equate Zionism with Apartheid. It's a campaign, it's bullshit, and thankfully Israel is here to stay.

       that's because that line of thinking only get's peddled when someone with influence comes out against Israel and its' actions in Palestine. Which is why you hardly ever see anyone of influence take a stance against Israel.

       Jewish mysticism and Freemasonry have some interesting overlaps about a hidden female divinity. If Isreal is the female state of God, is she a location, or the people entire? Does the recreation of Isreal = end of days? What is controllable by man or by the Divine?

        “If this hostility, even aversion, had only been shown towards the Jews at one period and in one country, it would be easy to unravel the limited causes of this anger, but this race has been on the contrary an object of hatred to all the peoples among whom it has established itself. It must be therefore, since the enemies of the Jews belonged to the most diverse races, since they lived in countries very distant from each other, since they were ruled by very different laws, governed by opposite principles, since they had neither the same morals, nor the same customs, since they were animated by unlike dispositions which did not permit them to judge of anything in the some way, it must be therefore that the general cause of anti-Semitism has always resided in Israel itself and not in those who have fought against Israel.”

       wrong, Zionist do advocate for a Jewish state, but also actively looking to trigger the end of the world with biblical prophecy. The believe their is a specific way to trigger armageddon. So its pretty selfish, maybe the ultimate selfish thing to kill over nearly 7 people to bring your own heaven. You missed the biggest part of zionism, because there are even Christian Zionists who believe they live a spiritual/religious life and woud like to go to heaven now. This is the Judeo/Christian version of Jihad Death Cults - End the world, because we are going to Heaven and the rest be damned.

       Zionism = Jewish homeland. Period. Anything beyond that is either a fabrication of anti-Jewish propaganda or the ramblings of some fringe religious sect. If you were right, and you're not, Israel could have brought about an 'end of days' scenario from 1973 through today. I don't know why you're so invested in your point-of-view but its not supported by historical fact or the current reality.

       ill bring my first one - Allies for Armageddon - V. Clark. Clear literary and literal translation of biblical and Jewish prophecy of the armageddon and how we have seen several steps in that direction already. The re-establishment of the Jewish state and nationalism is the 1st step my guy.

       If you are arguing that the mere presence of a Jewish state means Armageddon then those hoping to destroy Israel are as guilty as those trying to maintain it. Your argument breaks down right there as there is no reason every people can have a home, except Jewry.

       As a Jew and a Zionist, whose been to Israel and knows many Israelis I can tell you, for a fact, that nobody believes what you think they believe except for about 1,000 Jews living in two neighborhoods in NY and another couple thousand living in a neighborhood in Jerusalem. Judiasm is mostly reform and conservative, and very little of it is Orthodox textualist as you suggest. Moreover, the Israeli government is really secular much to the dismay of the small very religious factions in the Country.

       Zionism and Judaism are diametrically opposed. When you see the word "Jew" it is a false representation of a people long since lost and actually refers to one's of khazarian decent. Look into it, most common people probably have more authentic "Jewish" blood in them than the ones who claim and parade their supposed ancestry. And i welcome all the hate as a good goy would do

       I have Jewish ancestry according to DNA tests.  I'm not Jewish, just happen to share their unique genetic markers. Probably because I am part Italian.

      <p>
       I don't think blood has much to do with identity.  Jews are a people, to be sure, but it is not solely based on ancestry.

       When you convert to a religion because it conveniently believes it's people to be "The Chosen One's of God" I'd say it has a little to do with ancestry. Plus there's that whole Ishmael and Isaac thing if you're familiar with your bible/torah history...

       All of the Abrahamic religions have an element of "chosenness" to them though.  Christians are saved, after all (the Reformed even refer to themselves as "God's elect").  Muslims aren't much different from Jews when it comes to their basic beliefs.  Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are just more unique (and smaller in number) because they don't seek converts in the modern era.

       Just a single individual troll can be responsible for half of the anti semitic posts in this sub. It is a proven fact that a couple have been caught red handed. Now think about the ones who haven't been caught yet. I believe this explains the vast majority of the racist crap in this sub.
      </p>

       The rest of the anti semitic stuff should get removed, but that is just my personal opinion and that's up to the mods. There are clearly going to be some real racists who come here, but the vast majority of it is manufactured nonsense.

       Completely agreed about conflation of Jew and Zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't help perceptions at all though that Israel is a religious/apartheid state, and that they are re-settling any members of the religion, even from distant countries in settlements to ethnically or religiously cleanse the region, but it's no excuse for blaming ALL members of the religion world wide.
      </p>

       The fundamentalists of the three major monotheistic religions are actually very similar to each other, and a big problem.

       Over 40 Islamic states but Jews can't have one Jewish state (Zionism)? See now this is exactly why Israel keeps WMD ambiguity... the end of the Jewish state will come at a unfathomable cost. Zionism and the Jewish state are here to stay. Have the veal! Two shows a night.

       I think that Jews can have a state, as long as the ethnically French, Han Chinese, Japanese, etc. can also have a state.  That would mean endorsing a state for every conceivable social group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don't think your argument does Jews any favors.  Israel is here to stay because Israel exists and it can't be deconstructed, sure.  That doesn't mean that Israel is a moral good incapable of being criticized.  Or that the fact that Islamic states exists somehow justify Israel.

       Right to exist is non negotiable and the negotiations start with a misclassification of Zionism as anything more than Israels right to exist. Flat out rejection reads harshly, but boundary setting is necessary.

       Look, my post isn't really geopolitical. It is about treating Jews humanely.  It is humanism 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit on this thread talking about Jews is miles away from the political considerations you are talking about.  At least to me.  I want people to understand that anti-Semitism is 1) Empirically wrong and 2) Ethically wrong and 3) Pragmatically wrong.

       I am not going to wade into the Israel/Palestine debate because this  is way more fundamental than that.

       The posts on the board are generally about a theory that Jews (or a subset of Jews) dictate geopolitics. Its often framed as anti-zionist and not anti-Jewish to make it more palatable. Splitting hairs doesn't really work here.

       Nice try friend. Most of your "Chosen Ones" are actually "Khazars". Are you familiar with their cozy little book the "Satanic Talmud"? The fact is almost every huge conspiracy/false flag connects directly to Israel/Khazars. they attacked the USS Liberty and killed us sailors in an attempt to create a nuclear war. They spied on the us and sold its secrets and Jonathan Pollard is seen as a "hero" by these Satanic Khazars. They did 911. Once again "They did 911"...

       Biggest shit post I have ever seen on here. Just because you are ignorant doesnt give you the right to rattle off bullshit to people that do know the truth. 
And screw your neonazi bullshit comment. Because Israel does all this shit dont label us!  I've spent the last 10 years studying and watching what is really going on in this world while you were watching worthless propaganda movies and tv while believing the complete horeshit on the news. Jews done it they always do it and will always do it til they are stopped. They have been kicked out of 109 countries for a reason. 
This world is truly inverted, the good guys are considered the bad guys and bad guys are considered the good guys.

       Yup read rabbinical commentary. There are dozens of fissures, sects and divisions in the Jewish faith. Cherry picking lunatic ramblings to support you Jew hating agenda is a laughable way to pass time,  but there's probably not much else for you to do right?

       Yes! This is what I've been saying! Peace-loving good-hearted Jews are being shouted-out &amp; shut-down by the militaristic Settler-driven Zionist ideology! Many good people are moving here cause they don't recognize their home anymore.

       The posts on the board are generally about a theory that Jews (or a subset of Jews) dictate geopolitics. Its often framed as anti-zionist and not anti-Jewish to make it more palatable. Splitting hairs doesn't really work here.

       All of the Abrahamic religions have an element of "chosenness" to them though.  Christians are saved, after all (the Reformed even refer to themselves as "God's elect").  Muslims aren't much different from Jews when it comes to their basic beliefs.  Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are just more unique (and smaller in number) because they don't seek converts in the modern era.
