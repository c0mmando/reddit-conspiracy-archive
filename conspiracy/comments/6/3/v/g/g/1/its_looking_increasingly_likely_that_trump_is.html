        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump&#39;s u-turn on Syria, general militarism and inability to see an obvious false flag for what it is (it&#39;s obvious Assad had no hand in this attack) should be making every one of his supporters mad. Bannon was essentially forced out of the NSC by Jared Kushner, whose rise in power with his prominent ties to Israel / AIPAC, Chabad-Lubavitch, Goldman Sachs and Wall Street should have everyone looking into him - he is not to be trusted. Trump also seems to be buying into the anti-Russian rhetoric from the hawks in his administration, and is taking a much stronger tack against them with his language. Despite running on a platform of non-intervention, Trump&#39;s insane militarism, continued drone warfare in Syria and Yemen, his seeming friendship with the dictatorship of Saudi Arabia and criminal Bibi Netanyahu, and his support for continuing the fraudulent War on Terror should be big, big red flags that Trump is capitulating to the neocon globalists and Zionists... or was one all along. He is straight up doing the opposite of his key campaign promises now, and either falling for the globalist Kool-Aid or happily going along with it. If he goes to war with Syria or Russia we will know he is completely compromised, and the fallout from his supporters will be <em>immense</em>, or the thick levels of denial and hero worship means it&#39;ll be completely ignored outright like Obama&#39;sâ€‹ betrayals were.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to get tons of downvotes for this, but we can&#39;t ignore this anymore.  I highly doubt this was what his supporters voted for, and if he doesn&#39;t get a clue and start governing the way he promised, he&#39;s not going to last long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he lifts 1 finger against Assad, his entire reputation goes down the toilet. That&#39;s a big IF. Attacking Assad would clearly indicate he manipulated the people to vote for him. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this will happen, but if it did, we would know that its time to go to plan B. Until then, I&#39;m for Trump and I will support any good moves he makes but everything he does should be watched carefully by all people. Not because I don&#39;t trust him but because the people are the ultimate police over the government and so we have to watch them just like they watch us. </p>

<p>Speaking of which, its time for an open source society. We have nothing to hide. Let it all out so the people can finally see what&#39;s really going on. If not, we force transparency on them with help from Wikileaks, whistle-blowers, and anything else we can think of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to be positive about it, but his rhetoric is pretty much lining up with Deep State / CIA talking points lately, and the promotion of Kushner and demotion of Bannon are probably not positive developments, or unrelated for that matter.  His core promises that made tons of people vote for him seem to be on the chopping block.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep State wants Assad dead.</p>

<p>Did Trump say during the campaign that he will get rid of ISIS and willing to work with Russia and Arab allies?</p>

<p>What is he doing now? </p>

<p>He is going to act, just not how neocons think he should be acting.</p>

<p>After his statements Russia is no longer supporting Assad unconditionally. Tillerson said they will defeat ISIS and Assad will be removed <strong>politically</strong> after consultations with international partners. </p>

<p>Looks like he is keeping his campaign promises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you honestly believe they will let Assad peacefully give up power?  Moreover, what makes you think the Syrians even want Assad out of power?  He has massive popular support over there.  Russia is likely backing off protecting Assad because they&#39;ve probably given up on a peaceful solution and would rather not get in the way of a potential American retribution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. Actually all wars are fail.</p>

<p>Still, it would be a huge difference if we fought ISIS or Assad. Also, Russia can finish off ISIS no problem as long as we don&#39;t prop them up. </p>
