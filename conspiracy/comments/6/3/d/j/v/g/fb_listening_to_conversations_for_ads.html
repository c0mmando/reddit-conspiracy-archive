<p>This morning I open my FB app and the first ad I see? A fucking ad for a cookie cake from Great American Cookie Co. What the fuck? </p>

<p>How is this legal? I tried searching but it says their official statement is that they do not listen for ads. Bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At any store, unless you&#39;re paying in cash and don&#39;t use store loyalty cards, everything from what you buy or might buy to how much you spend is marketable data. Those store loyalty cards are an easy way for customers to willingly hand over their information, all for the low cost of a small store discount here or there. </p>

<p>You honestly wouldn&#39;t believe how deep the social media targeting goes. Have an elderly mother that you visit in a nursing home? We know. Have a new teen driver in your family? We know. Just refinanced your home? We know that too. There have been very few times I wasn&#39;t able to find a target that matched what I was looking for. </p>

Basically he said they&#39;ll hit you with food ads like Pizza Hut to make you hungry knowing people buy more when their hungry or whatever. </p>

<p>So as we get closer to our destination, I google maps &#39;pizza&#39; to get the phone number for the pizza place for pick up. Guess what pops up: Pizza Hut. I quit out of it and try a search two more times and each time it started directions to Pizza Hut </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re not crazy, they do this. </p>

<p>I think my favorite Facebook hijinks was reading about how they subjected unknowing users to a psych experiment by seeing if they could change moods by curating the status updates displayed (ie, can we make users depressed by showing depressing news and status updates from friends, etc). </p>

<p>Ties nicely into the theory that they do this in tandem with the governments to foment uprisings and discontent (or obedience, depending).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend and I had a fairly long conversation over lunch a few days ago about a city she was thinking of moving to. The idea had come up newly while we were talking, and she had never been there before, or searched for anything regarding that city. While we were talking, she had her phone out on the table, and it was opened to Facebook, as she was waiting for a message.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, without any other input, she was spammed with ads for hotels, airfare to, and things in that city. Either a one in a million chance, or the app was listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one, it&#39;s in their terms of service agreement.
Also what do you think apps need permission for your mic for? It is understandable for some, but not most. Any app in the Google play store runs Google ads and most of these apps require you give them use of your microphone. It is something that they admitted doing years ago. And with Google Next, they can actually use your camera to check your surroundings for products and then identify what you have for advertising purposes. Google is an ad company, they make it very clear, and you agree to all of it because there is no real alternative. No traffic  traces or data captures needed because they spell it out to you in black and white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an article from over a year ago saying that google is listening through your phone, how to access the bank of recordings they have from you, and how to delete them. Keep in mind that these are the ones from Google&#39;s voice feature and that the audio gained through 3rd party apps cannot be viewed or deleted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At any store, unless you&#39;re paying in cash and don&#39;t use store loyalty cards, everything from what you buy or might buy to how much you spend is marketable data. Those store loyalty cards are an easy way for customers to willingly hand over their information, all for the low cost of a small store discount here or there. </p>

<p>You honestly wouldn&#39;t believe how deep the social media targeting goes. Have an elderly mother that you visit in a nursing home? We know. Have a new teen driver in your family? We know. Just refinanced your home? We know that too. There have been very few times I wasn&#39;t able to find a target that matched what I was looking for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to answer any specific questions you might have. </p>
