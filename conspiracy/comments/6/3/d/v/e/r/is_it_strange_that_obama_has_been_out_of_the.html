    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s strange that this post is delivering disinfo in an attempt to tie points together. </p>

<ul>
<li>still no evidence of illegal surveillance, plenty of data pointing to totally legal, court approved FISA surveillance </li>
<li>the Rice story is essentially &quot;this Obama admin official requested to unmask the names of Team Trump officials caught up in incidental surveillance,&quot; which was within her legal purview at the time.</li>
<li>the conspiracy angle is that Rice then leaked these names to the press, but this is an evidence-free possibility. Posts embracing this idea don&#39;t even offer examples of this maybe occurring. Maybe it did but we don&#39;t know for sure. And what real impact would it have anyway? The investigations are real and ongoing...it seems the threat of having to acknowledge this is creating mountains of cognitive dissonance and serious pushback from those who don&#39;t want it to be true/those who buy Trump&#39;s idea that it&#39;s all a big deep state Dem conspiracy to take him down, a view shared with Infowars, Breitbart, ZeroHedge, the National Enquirer. </li>
<li>This sub starkly changes it&#39;s views on leakers depending on who stands to benefit from the action, regardless of legality. A rather predictable shift if you ask me.</li>
