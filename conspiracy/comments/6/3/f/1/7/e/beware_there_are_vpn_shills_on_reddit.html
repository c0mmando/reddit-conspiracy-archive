       4 out of 17 VPNs privacytools.io recommend has suspicious history.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BlackVPN
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       BlackVPN was known to log until June 5, 2015.  VPN was banned for 8.5 million in China.  It is well known that Hong Kong is part of China.

      <p>
       <strong>
        EarthVPN
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       EarthVPN logged while saying they didnâ€™t. The log was used against a user in court.

       <strong>
        Proxy.sh

      <p>
       Monitored and tracked a user on the request of a random person.

      <p>
       If privacytools.io does not remove the providers, suspicious of their motives.  They are spreading links around reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who use these VPNs should file class action lawsuit against them for providing a fake service as liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are scammers and anyone promoting them is scammer who is ready to spy on you.  Quick google search shows everything i write is true.

       Been using PIA for several years with no issues. They don't log, but are US based. If I was doing anything I wanted to keep really private for my own safety, I would probably look for a foreign one outside 5 eyes collaboration. But for general high speed traffic obfuscation, browser add-on ability, and multi-region switching, can't beat it it at about 7 bucks a month.

       If there is a man in the Middle attack it renders the security steps useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your, you can have a compromised node. On VPN you can have a bad service provider, still tracking your data. At home you could have a compromised computer or router.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tor and VPNs do not negate each other, they both have potential security risks.

       Everyone who recommends VPN is a shill.
VPN can no longer be trusted as secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/bnd-inquiry/docs/Sek/MAT%20A%20Sek-13-3-q.pdf">

      </p>
      <p>
       That pdf from the NSA in the BND documents on Wikileaks clearly shows that NSA decrypts VPN, both IPSEC and PPTP, in real time and in bulk.
The BND leaks came out what, over a year ago? 20,000 "hackers" attended the most recent Defcon.
      </p>
      <p>
       How not one person notices this slide deck, including Assange himself, is pretty shocking in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hello, McFly, is anybody who's job earning 6 figures in Infosec paying attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the Computing industry so asleep at the wheel? Yet the Beogrammers cranking out widgets for Startup Inc think they're the smartest guys in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       The arrogance from all the fake paper billions in this industry has made everyone lazy and dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       NSA LOVES it when the sysadmins are lazy and dumb. They're so much easier to hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course that slide deck presents more technical questions than answers, but it proves VPN is no longer the Silver Bullet we once thought it was.
"Well that's what they're supposed to do, NSA is just doing their job, so that's not my Department" you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, well look at home careless NSA is with Cyberweapons and exploits. They lost the Keys to the Kingdom to the Shadowbrokers, and god only knows what else they lost that they never tell us about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is entirely reasonable to believe NSA lost their VPN exploit pack too.
Try to imagine the chaos that's possible in a scenario like that.
We might as well not have ANY security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is funny, because yet again, RMS was right! His tales about the MIT Media Kab in the 70's where he rejected new mandatory security policy and instead all users of the system shared the sysadmin's password.
      </p>
      <p>
       The honor system used to work. As a system of trust, high trust small tribes will always be better than any artificial security mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as an industy need to somehow get back to that. Trust in computing is only going to get worse, the hacks are going to become deeper as they copycat NSA's methods of industrial scale, and the consequences are truly unknowable.

       Skynet and Mr. Robot could end up looking like naive optimism.

       Exactly.

      <p>
       There is no point in VPN. It's a placebo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the 8,000+ pages leaked by Snowden, of all the 4,000 pages declassified by DNI'S to cover their asses in a face-plant rebuttal, and of all the shadow broken cyberarsenals and Vault7 goodies, that NSA Spin9 VPN decryption slide deck is the most troubling document I have ever seen.

       There is no way I am the lucky rando who was first to find it. Which means the powers that be simply don't care. They have their narrative to pimp out, and they have their regimes of power to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bothersome contradictory facts sitting in plain sight?
No problemo!
Just pretend it doesn't exist and shill harder blaming Russian disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I don't know what to believe, nor do I fully trust anyone on any side. Including Assange. He's not being entirely honest with us, and he holds back 99% of the leaks, making him WORSE than the Deep State he fights in many respects.

       Whatever is really going on, history offers advice: even if you're flawless at lying to all of the people all of the time, folks still know it in their guts.
And if you pissing off enough people for a long enough time, they panic, snap and do unpredictable things.

       Or just uninformed. I don't know many people other than hackers, IT and security professionals that would even pay attention to the technical details of what's been compromised and how.

       Anyone ever find a list of VPN providers who are fake? I have looked up butnever come across one, being fake means its just an app that leaks your real IP &amp; location, which basically means it doesnt work, just poses as a VPN.
