         Donald Trump represents the greatest and latest attempt by one part of the worlds elitist circles to survive this economical Armageddon that is upon us. So Trump vs Clinton was a fight between the representatives of the two world Supranational power structures:
         <em>
          The Rothschilds behind Trump and the Rockerfellers behind Clinton
         </em>
         The elitist circles have a problem in that they need to find a system to replace the no longer functioning Capitalist system.
And the arrival of Donald Trump is the first step to a New World.. not a New World Order but a New World struggling to be born..

         What's going on is actually very simple, we have Globalists Vs Zionists, Zionists who are joining forces with all Nationalists around the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them. As long as you leave these guys alone, they won't bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren't very visible, the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart,
         <strong>
          Infowars
         </strong>
         , WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         These guys all used to work together, but now that the Globalist plan is in it's advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren't happy with the way things were going, so they've now started to dismantle bit by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda, as those taxes are to fund the Globalist world government. The Zionists have allied with Nationalists, and they are fast gaining ground on the Globalists.

       As if Infowars openly declaring Trump is backed by Rothschilds and that they're about to give wealth back to the people wasn't crazy enough, Im keen to understand how the user in question saw fit to make such claims? You'll see how passionately they endorse the idea with a brief look at their comment history. Normally I'd take the words of anyone I saw on an Internet forum with a grain of salt. And I did when I first saw it. But even the most anti-conspiracy person you know, would find it incredibly suspicious to hear that agenda pushed 1 week later on Infowars.

       Billionaires control things. They differ on who gets to exploit what. Nice of you to point out that Alex is a Zionist. Apartheid is no better or worse than eugenics. Either way we are screwed till enough of us realize that the rich actually try to own and control us. They convince anyone with any resources that the poor (immigrants, homeless) are the problem while the rich exploit everyone and everything to get richer and hold control. Decentralized money and government are a great solution. Support bitcoin and blockchain technology. Power to the people.

       Yes that is a good evaluation. Wikileaks exposed some communication that demonstrated a cozy relationship with Lynn Rothschild. Curious about your bitcoin opinions. There might be better blockchains that could eventually replace it but the decentralized control over the money supply really hits globalist and zionists right where it hurts.

       It sounds to be that Zionists are either:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Playing 14d chess here to make us think they are siding with the people against the globalists so the people back them up instead of attacking them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Zionists are actually waking up to the reality that the mess they made has gotten so bad that Israel could be in serious trouble either because people will eventually sink Zion into the ground like they have with previous tyrants or that the mess is simply so big that the whole world is in Jeopardy. In this case, the best thing for the Zionists is to save their asses by giving the people what they have been holding back the whole time but I am sure they will only give what they must and still withhold a majority of the world's wealth from us.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It could be a mixture of the 2 also.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        A third possibility is that this is a setup to prepare the world for a large scale war (globalists vs Zionists/Nationalists) that will make the bankers even wealthier than they already all. This option seems suicidal though. I can't imagine Zionists being THIS stupid.  It's possible though because this is how they have traditionally created wars. The same leadership controls both sides but maybe they are considering dropping the globalist agenda altogether.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Bottom line: The fear of God has struck Zion. They know it doesn't look good for them.

      <p>
       The psyop is being played to separate the two - "Zionism" and "Globalism" -as it becomes increasingly obvious that Trump is a Rothschild lackey. The idea is they can somehow explain Trumps Rothschild connections away by saying that the Zionists are fighting the Globalist- makes sense ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism is a deliberately misleading buzzword for activities that are closer to opposite. Their strategies lay in divisions &amp; strife, not
Global unity with strong nation states. Ethnic bogeyman to justify military intervention. Corporate cronyism and tax cuts for the wealthy. When you take steps to actually quantify what this ephemeral "Globalism" is, you can see it describes Trump perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the full court press by Infowars to conflate Zionism with Nationalism.

       my knowledge of the upper levels of the cabal is limited as I am just finding out about families above the Rothschild and Rockefellers, but it would seem to me that there is a power struggle going on between them. However, they may be manipulated by the people above them through divide and conquer strategies utilized on lower levels of the cabal and on the population. It would be naive to believe that those strategies are not used on the 2nd? tier cabal members as well.

       Who is above those guys? I've been looking into this for a while now but it doesn't seem like a significantly sized cabal could be above them. I base that of history, seeing as how they were the ones behind banking manoeuvres at the turn of the century there couldn't be many people above them that control them because what would have to control them with?

       Estulin mentions a few families shortly after the transcripted info above.

      <p>
       That's a fair point about control, as I don't know, I can only speculate that the families come up with the technology or are the centers of the ideology.

       I remember reading these posts and sharing the theory with many of my friends. I listen to Jones fairly regularly. I don't trust him entirely because I have always felt he is controlled opposition and I didn't like his protective attitude of Israel. That post calling him out as a Zionist made perfect sense to me. And I read Estulin's book
       <em>
        The True Story of thr Bilderberg Group
       </em>
       about a decade ago around the time I was finally coming to terms with the truth about how corrupted the world is, the deep shadow government and globalist agenda. I haven't read anything else of his and don't know much more about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That post from a week ago has been pretty enlightening in a few ways and as I've been sharing this theory I've noticed a lot of people I'm talking with actually following it and feeling it has a lot of merit, based on recent events and the way the world is working toward a NWO agends but seems to have a degree of overt and covert infighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, it is highly suspicious that Jones and Estulin are pushing this same narrative now, because I'd otherwise never heard of it prior to a week ago. That's not to say it hasn't been discussed before but Zionists vs Globalists is a very different kind of narrative and a very plausible one.

       All you gotta do is look at the Alex Jones and David Duke interview. That video really opened my eyes as to who controls Alex Jones. The body language, the weak arguments, the schooling that David gave him, it was really eye opening.

       <p>
        They're aware Trumps connections are becoming common knowledge and are running psyops as perception management
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'd say the increase in efforts to prop Trump up run in inverse correlation to how fast his support is fading.

       Serious question, what makes every one think Jones is a shill? I mean he has been doing this for decades. Half the reason most of us are even aware of these plots is cause of him. If I were him I'd be very bitter that people think I've turned just cause he is making money out of it. At the end of the day we still live in a capitalist system, and a news network still costs money to run. What is it that makes this sub believe he has turned? Is it just that he makes money of protein powder and stuff like that?

       I literally was a fan boy of Alex jones until last night when I heard this. If you listen to the video it's much easier to grasp because of tone. He knew Trump was backed by the Rothschild's and still pushed him as America's last great hope for a year.

       I feel they're just playing this elite family war thing so they can create a conflict, then give closure to the conflict, which will in turn satisfy the masses that the 'problem' was taken care of. It gives people the impression that something is happening and someone is fighting for us. Meanwhile, the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are sipping the most expensive wines together behind the scenes in their underground castles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds are desperate to keep control. They know the repercussions for them will be awful if they're ever overthrown.
