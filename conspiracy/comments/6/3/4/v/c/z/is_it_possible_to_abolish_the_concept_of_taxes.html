       Yes, there is a monitory theory where the government just prints money. As long as they don't print more than GDP, there would be zero inflation. But this would require fiscal restraint, so it probably would never happen. The theory is described here:

       They don't even need the ammo. When the bridge collapses, you won't be able to get to your work and you will slowly starve.

       It's a loosing game for both parties. The population needs basic infastructure and services while the government needs disposal income for their toys. Taxes make both sides happy

       And a pretty large number of people can't even call a pot of soil their own. It's true that rural folks could probably adapt reasonably quickly to a self-sustaining lifestyle in case of collapse, but how do you expect city folks to fare?

       Its not just food. I know I used it as an example, but there are hundreds of things taxes accommodate for.  Even rural communities will have problems with fire, diseases, water and the like. It might take longer, but those things will affect them.

       Yeah, and who will pay for the hospital? Who will pay for the road that will get you to the hospital? Who will pay for the harbours and freights that get the pills to you and your hospital?

       Probably a good majority of the people who are already footing the bill. The people have the power to pull together and let a truly free market flourish where these services can be provided. Just because the level of faith you place in humanity necessitates the involuntary forfeiture of the means and abilities to have a true say in such matters, doesn't me we all follow suit. I wonder what the family of the man who died in the ambulance because tax funded stooges shut down "muh roads" would have to say on the matter? Surely they would feel that their tax dollars would have been better put into something else. The most of us alreay pay for these things you claim are impossible without coercion. We see the things our money gets for us.  We see the things it doesn't. We see the people who would rather go the rest of their lives living off our dime, continuing the cycle of dependently sucking off of uncle sams puss filled tits

       Given the current fragile socio-economic climate and the powder keg that is civil tensions, if you are hoping to make it if shit hits the fan like that, then i am sorry but there are some things you need to consider. How should city folk fare? Well i guess a better question to ask is what would you do if all the grocery stores shut down tomorrow?

       Personally, I suppose I would take stock of every useful item in my house and find a way to keep it safe for the time being, then I'd select tradeable items and start gathering every farmer and worker I know I can rely on start working towards a community network of useful people and products we have access to. I'd encourage the farmers to trade their stocks of cheese and vegetables with people who need it for things such as manual labor support when they need it during harvest or as protection of said harvests (as there would certainly be people trying to raid the fields), and in general get a trading farmer's market going where goods and services can be exchanged between collaborators. We also have very clean streams in my area, so we'd likely fill up as many tanks with it as we can and store that safely as reserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general where I live, in rural, alpine Europe it should be possible to pivot towards a communal system of exchange and manual labor relatively quickly and we have enough cows and wildlife to conceivably feed a fair amount of people for several months, before the next planting cycle can be begun. And that should be planned as well, planting only things that are immediately useful, like corn, potatoes, carrots, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue to my mind is what we've patronized Americans over for decades, namely the right to keep and bear arms. I've bought a bow and arrow recently, but if a gang of 20 raiders is desperate for my tomato patch, I'd still rather have a rapid fire shotgun or whatever to let them know what's what.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was just that rural areas are more likely to be able to self-organise into a community of mutual benefactors and survive from the fruits of its own soil and labor, while in the city I'd much rather expect a pretty Darwinian nightmare to unfold.

       We are not discussing government, we are talking about taxes. "You" building the bridge and maintaining roads will cost money. Before long you will get bored, find a company that does roadworks, pool money and hire them for a monthly fee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its exactly like you paying money so cleaning / gardening / elevator maintenance can happen in the building. All pay for it, no matter how much you use them. Its taxation just with another name.

       And I wonder if you are older than 22. You are using the internet to preach on a private message board about self-regulating commutes where people work for free and everyone is happy. Do you realise the irony of it?

       I'm talking about how you think taxes are helping our bridges, like motherfucker, have you looked around?  Who do you think is paying taxes?  Look at the fucking housing market, on the bring of collapse, the middle class paying property taxes on land they do not own.  Punching the 9-5 to turn in a W2 and get a little change back while the real owners are going after deduction after deduction, paying little to no taxes, saving their money and buying more land.  Does that go to fixing your stupid fucking bridge or does it allow them to buy more land?  It amazes me when people step outside and don't feel the dick in their ass.  You're accusing me of wanting utopia when all I am saying is that we all have the ability to play by their rules when they don't even play by their rules.  I'll leave it at this, I think you need to ask more questions and wonder when the housing market collapses in a couple years ask yourself why paying your taxes didn't prevent this.  You're being scammed and you're opening up your wallet for them.  You simply do not understand the game.  Get out there and participate if you want to really understand how fucked it is out there, despite you paying your taxes (that will allow the rich to buy up more land, lol, sucker)

       The funny thing is if you bring up how shit and corrupt our government is and majority of the people will agree with you. If you point out that taxation is robbing us and paying these people, then the get this brief look. Like its in the eyes or something, like they are desperately trying to recall why they NEED to pay taxes

       Yes, by printing money (if we had allowed the banks to fail in 08 we wouldn't have had to print more money than in all US history, or we could have eliminated income tax for a decade(

       The government can print money and spend it into circulation. The downside of unbridled government growth  is already a fact in practice. so  there's no new downside only the upside of no longer needing to pay taxes OR interest.

       It's already written into the Constitution that way.
