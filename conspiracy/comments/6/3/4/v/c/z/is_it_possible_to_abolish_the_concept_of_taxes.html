    <div class="md"><p>Probably a good majority of the people who are already footing the bill. The people have the power to pull together and let a truly free market flourish where these services can be provided. Just because the level of faith you place in humanity necessitates the involuntary forfeiture of the means and abilities to have a true say in such matters, doesn&#39;t me we all follow suit. I wonder what the family of the man who died in the ambulance because tax funded stooges shut down &quot;muh roads&quot; would have to say on the matter? Surely they would feel that their tax dollars would have been better put into something else. The most of us alreay pay for these things you claim are impossible without coercion. We see the things our money gets for us.  We see the things it doesn&#39;t. We see the people who would rather go the rest of their lives living off our dime, continuing the cycle of dependently sucking off of uncle sams puss filled tits</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I suppose I would take stock of every useful item in my house and find a way to keep it safe for the time being, then I&#39;d select tradeable items and start gathering every farmer and worker I know I can rely on start working towards a community network of useful people and products we have access to. I&#39;d encourage the farmers to trade their stocks of cheese and vegetables with people who need it for things such as manual labor support when they need it during harvest or as protection of said harvests (as there would certainly be people trying to raid the fields), and in general get a trading farmer&#39;s market going where goods and services can be exchanged between collaborators. We also have very clean streams in my area, so we&#39;d likely fill up as many tanks with it as we can and store that safely as reserves.</p>

<p>In general where I live, in rural, alpine Europe it should be possible to pivot towards a communal system of exchange and manual labor relatively quickly and we have enough cows and wildlife to conceivably feed a fair amount of people for several months, before the next planting cycle can be begun. And that should be planned as well, planting only things that are immediately useful, like corn, potatoes, carrots, and so on.</p>

<p>The biggest issue to my mind is what we&#39;ve patronized Americans over for decades, namely the right to keep and bear arms. I&#39;ve bought a bow and arrow recently, but if a gang of 20 raiders is desperate for my tomato patch, I&#39;d still rather have a rapid fire shotgun or whatever to let them know what&#39;s what.</p>

<p>My point was just that rural areas are more likely to be able to self-organise into a community of mutual benefactors and survive from the fruits of its own soil and labor, while in the city I&#39;d much rather expect a pretty Darwinian nightmare to unfold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about how you think taxes are helping our bridges, like motherfucker, have you looked around?  Who do you think is paying taxes?  Look at the fucking housing market, on the bring of collapse, the middle class paying property taxes on land they do not own.  Punching the 9-5 to turn in a W2 and get a little change back while the real owners are going after deduction after deduction, paying little to no taxes, saving their money and buying more land.  Does that go to fixing your stupid fucking bridge or does it allow them to buy more land?  It amazes me when people step outside and don&#39;t feel the dick in their ass.  You&#39;re accusing me of wanting utopia when all I am saying is that we all have the ability to play by their rules when they don&#39;t even play by their rules.  I&#39;ll leave it at this, I think you need to ask more questions and wonder when the housing market collapses in a couple years ask yourself why paying your taxes didn&#39;t prevent this.  You&#39;re being scammed and you&#39;re opening up your wallet for them.  You simply do not understand the game.  Get out there and participate if you want to really understand how fucked it is out there, despite you paying your taxes (that will allow the rich to buy up more land, lol, sucker)</p>
