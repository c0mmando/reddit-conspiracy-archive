    <div class="md"><p>Sure you could. In fact, actual flight paths show it&#39;s more likely that the earth is a round, flat disc-shape. When I flew from Philly to London, the curved flight path flew north by northeast, along Canada&#39;s coast which is bizarre, until you look at a flat earth map and realize, that we were actually flying in a straight path, along Canada to the UK. Similarly from Asia to west coast USA. </p>

<p>You have to forget about that silly map we all saw in school, which is where a ton of confusion comes from. If the earth were flat, it would be round on the edges, and to fly eastward along the equator, you&#39;d reach the origin eventually because north would always point toward the center of the earth, the Arctic, and you&#39;d fly in a circle just like if you were on a round globe. </p>

<p>This clip is only 4 minutes long and explains the map and flight paths on a &quot;disc-shaped&quot; flat earth:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They curve like that because on a round object that is shorter, you can easily see this using a basketball and a string. First try to go straight from point a to b on the basketball, then curve the path you take a bit, and you&#39;ll see you save a surprising amount of distance by adding a slight curve. That is one of the ways flight paths prove the earth is round. </p>

<p>Also another thing you need to take into account with flat maps trying to show a curved earth, the further north and south you go the more distorted and larger land masses appear due to being stretched to form the rectangular shape of a typical map.</p>

<p>Also the dude in your video doesn&#39;t buy that the rewson they avoid flying over the antartic is due to the cold? Does he have no idea how many flights have crashed due to ice build up on the wings? That is a very common and well known issue even in places not as cold as the antartic, example: <a href="http://gadling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/airline-de-icing-aircraft.jpg">http://gadling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/airline-de-icing-aircraft.jpg</a></p>

<p>Ice bu8ld up on the wings of planes is a HUGE danger, that is why they avoid it.</p>

<p>As for his claims on strange flight paths, there is perfectly valid reasons he is ignoring as well, mainly the jet stream, notice each flight path he mentioned is going directly against the jet stream if they didn&#39;t detour. Also just like with greyhound busses there are main arteries that all planes flu through, same with busses. Just like if you take a greyhound bus from Pittsburgh, Pa. To birmingham, al. You will first go northwest up to Cincinnati before heading south at all, turning an 11 hour drive into over 20. It is just how these large corporations work with these things. They move all the small ancillary routes and combine them into main hubs, then go from hub to hub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;&#39;s well below freezing at cruising altitude, so airplanes are designed to handle the cold temperatures of the lower stratosphere. In fact, it may be more fuel efficient. There will be unavoidable ice on wings, even in summer, anywhere you fly. It sounds like an excuse to attenpt to explain no real flights over Antarctica.</p>

<p>Common flight paths make most sense when you look at a flat earth map, and require convoluted excuses when looking at a round globe. There was an emergency landing in Alaska recently, flying from Southeast Asia to LA, which should have landed in Hawaii if the earth was a globe, but makes perfect sense if the earth was flat to land in Alaska, which would have been along the way. Follow common sense <em>first.</em> Then, look for excuses for unlikely scenarios if that&#39;s what you fancy. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but my first instinct is simplicity and common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it is even colder than that at flying altitude over the antartic.</p>

<p>Once again go take a basketball and string, do that test I told you, it explains the alaska landing, curved paths are shorter on round objects. That is why I am saying it is common sense for the paths to curve, because they are shorter. </p>

<p>Also, it isn&#39;t an excuse to point out how ancillary routes converge on main hubs of travel, greyhound busses do it, most subways do it, interstates do it. Acting like planes would be one of thr only ones NOT to do it seems like more of an excuse to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright let&#39;s take a step back. Let&#39;s forget about proving the earth is flat since you seem to disagree with basic math.</p>

<p>Why is it that every single instance of celestial objects like planets are spherical? We have images of all the planets in our solar system. They are all spheres.

<p>In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_flat_Earth">flat earth was nonexistent as a belief</a> even in the 14th century. It was proven by <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/%7Ethompson/1101/lecture_aristarchus.html">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> in ~255 BC (don&#39;t know the exact date). </p>

<p>I never disagreed with any math.  You made that up and so far you have no credibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that every single instance of celestial objects like planets are spherical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your statement could be argued but lets just take it as true and follow the logic.  According to your logic since all of the billiard balls are round the table should also be round.  See how that logic makes no sense?</p>

<p>Our moon is a sphere and is not, in fact, made of cheese.</p>

<p>You are assuming it to be a sphere.  It may or may not be.  It appears as a disk, whether it is or not you are relying on faith in the fact that it is a sphere. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our sun is a sphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know it is spherical.  Could it not be disk shape?  I&#39;m not claiming it is or isn&#39;t, I&#39;m just saying you cant tell by looking at it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the moons on Saturn are spheres.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have those pics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But now that we are on Earth, and Earth is Specialtm because of us, duh. So the Earth is flat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure what that means. I guess when all you have is poor logic and no evidence of this &quot;literal curve measurement&quot; it makes it hard to communicate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, flat earth was nonexistent as a belief</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally linked to a Wiki page called &quot;Myth of the Flat Earth&quot; as source. Lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was proven by Eratosthenes of Cyrene in ~255 BC (don&#39;t know the exact date). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do understand this is the #1 proof that people like you (who have never research the subject for themselves whatsoever) link to as proof after they google &quot;how do we know the earth is round?&quot;</p>

<p>Eratosthenes had to assume that the sun was millions of miles away to make it fit into a globe model.  If the sun was much closer (like it has been measured and shown to be) the Eratosthenes experiment would also work on a flat earth.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I really have no idea how in the world you think this has any grasp on reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reality is faith in NASA images and faith in a 2,300 year old experiment where a guy supposedly measured shadows 500 miles or so apart at the same time (maybe you can explain exactly how he pulled that off?) while assuming that the Sun was millions of miles away to make the globe math work.  </p>

<p>That is the grasp on reality that you have.  You have never seen Earths curve and you have never felt any of the 1,000 mph alleged spinning as we travel 67,000mph around the Sun.  That is the reality that you are grasping on to with complete faith in NASA and Wikipedia as your reality keepers.</p>

<p>At least you admit that a ship &quot;going over the horizon&quot; is a fallacy.  It has been used as a globe earth &quot;proof&quot; for years until zoom cameras independently show the ship is just out of view and not over the horizon</p>

<p>I already shot down your logic from your early post.  Remember your &quot;proof&quot; of things in the sky are spherical so earth must be too.  Do you admit that is flawed logic and not proof of anything?  Also you claim the Sun is defiantly a sphere but you never told me how you know that.  It could be a disk and look the same in the sky, but you assume it is spherical.</p>

<p>Did you already forget that you linked to Eratosthenes, a 2,300 year old experiment that takes the assumption that the sun is millions of miles away to for the math to correctly work?  </p>

<p>All of your proof relies on assumptions, can you admit that?</p>

<p>I never said the math is &quot;fake&quot;.  Just like the Eratosthenes math isn&#39;t fake it just relies on assumptions that contradict reality.</p>

<p>You are under the impression that if you can make math work that means it is reality.  You have not done any research on this subject for yourself and it is very obvious.  You are repeating all of the same religious mantras that everyone else repeats as &quot;proof&quot; that you live on a 1,000mph spinning ball.  Was this thread the first time you have even questioned/thought about why you believe in the ball earth theory? </p>

<p>As for the gyroscope claim, that isn&#39;t how aeronautical gyroscopes work. Aeronautical gyros use schuler tuning specifically because of that. Schuler tuning was made specifically so they would work on our round earth. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuler_tuning">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuler_tuning</a></p>

<p>So when was that introduced to the gyros?  Before that did the pilot have to continually push the nose of the plane down?  People have actually called the manufactures of the gyroscopes for airplanes and asked them if there is built in electronics that compensate for the curve of the earth.  The manufactures claim there is not.  Do you have any proof they do compensate for the curve besides a wiki link?</p>

<p>Yes, you can easily check the patents, talk with any aeronautical engineer, or take a few flying lessons. You have to specifically set up the schuler tuning before you take off. So yeah you manually have to set it up everytime you want to go flying. </p>

<p>Again you are obviously new to the topic.  That question was brought up years ago in an attempt to debunk.

<p>For the last time.  You are assuming that Earth is a planet when the evidence says it is a plane.  If you want to stand behind the logic that since the lights in the sky appear round then the place that we live must also be round, whatever that is your logic. </p>

<p>If the Foucault Pendulum was caused by the rotation of the Earth then solar eclipses would not effect the experiment, but they do (even when preformed indoors away from the sun).  This would not effect the experiment if the earths rotation were really causing it.</p>

<p>&quot; The rate of rotation of Foucault&#39;s pendulum is pretty constant at any particular location, but in 1954, during an experiment with one, a physicist named Maurice Allais got a surprise. His experiment lasted for 30 days, and one of those days happened to be the day of a total solar eclipse. Instead of rotating at the usual rate, as it did for the other 29 days, his pendulum turned through an angle of 13.5 degrees within the space of just 14 minutes. This was particularly surprising as the experiment was conducted indoors, away from the sunlight, so there should have been no way the eclipse could affect it! But in 1959, when there was another eclipse, Allais saw exactly the same effect.&quot;</p>

<p>The thing about the solar eclipse doesn&#39;t debunk the folcoult pendulum, chances are it is probably due to gravitational changes during the line up. Like how you can stand an egg up on its point during summer summer solstice. </p>

<p>I mean it doesn&#39;t prove anything that you saw a spec in the sky.  Considering the iss supposedly travels at 17,500 mph at 249 miles away good chance it would not even be possible to track that, so no I&#39;m not going to just take your word that is what you saw. </p>

<p>This shows your religious faith that instead of approaching the subject with an open mind you have the preconceived notion that you will debunk anything that contradicts your NASA taught believe system.  We might as well stop the conversation as you are still deep in the trance.</p>

<p>&quot;Chances are it&#39;s probably&quot;.  Chances are if that were the case the article would have said that and NASA would have said that.  Instead the article said a solar eclipse should not effect it and there was no explanation.  It&#39;s much more probable that it is something to do with electromagnetics and or the Aether that Tesla and many other great minds knew about.  Saying that the experiment is still valid and it&#39;s &quot;probably&quot; gravitational changes is a weak argument when absolutely nothing scientific points to that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all there is high altitude balloon footage that goes to 120,000 ft and there is absolutely no curve visible (that is <strong>twice</strong> the height of the concorde.)  Also all of those vaccines must have fried your brain because you are not comprehending that even if there was a curve you wouldn&#39;t be able to see it because the airplane window does not give you the 60 degree angle necessary.  So even mainstream science says that you are delusional about seeing an alleged curve from an airplane window.</p>

<p>I would assume that you should be able to see a curve at 110k feet (if there was one).  We have footage from a high altitude balloon at 110K ft (without a fisheye lens) and there is no visible curve.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one &quot;saying&quot; that about the bottom picture, you can easily pull it up in photoshop or gimp and count the pixels yourself. I said the edges of the red line are twice the distance from the horizon as the distance of the center of the line. </p>

<p>It boils down to this, you&#39;ve offered no proof for anything proving your point and you&#39;ve ignored every piece of evidence I&#39;ve supplied. To any sane person, I&#39;m not the one acting closeminded.</p>

<p><a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/7283/how-high-must-one-be-for-the-curvature-of-the-earth-to-be-visible-to-the-eye">This page </a> says that it should be plausible to see the curve a 35K ft.  but also says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that the given minimum of 35,000 feet (10.7 km) is a plausible cruise altitude for a commercial airliner, but a passenger window probably <strong>WON&#39;T</strong> give the necessary 60° field of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the claim is that you should be able to see it at 35k but NOT FROM AN AIRPLANE because you do not have the 60 deg viewing angle required.  I&#39;ve already linked to high altitude balloon footage that shows there is no curve even at 110k ft.  So that proves there is no curve if you should be able to see it at 35k (if you have a 60 deg viewing angle) but there is actually no visible curve even at 110K ft.<br/>

<p>I have no idea what the &quot;low or it skydive&quot; is. Most high altitude footage is shot using a gopro with a fisheye lens that distorts the image.  The above video did not use a fisheye lens and you will see the horizon slightly concave and convex as the balloon moves but once it stabilizes it is completely flat.  Also you will notice that the horizon always rises to eye level.  Of we were on a ball you would have to look down at the horizon the higher your rise but that is not the case as proven in this video.    </p>

<p>If the Foucault Pendulum was caused by the rotation of the Earth then solar eclipses would not effect the experiment</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t see the reasoning behind that.</p>

<p>The rotation of the pendulum is in complete agreement with the expected behavior on a spinning sphere 99.9% of the time (when it&#39;s not a solar eclipse), and it works wherever I am on Earth (it should theoretically depend on the latitude, and it does actually depend on the latitude). Allais confirmed it himself as is obvious when you read his articles.</p>

<p>The fact that we don&#39;t have an explanation for the anomalous behavior during a Solar eclipse, does not mean that we have to throw away the perfectly valid explanation that explains the behavior 99.9% of the time. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think it would be more reasonable to find a different additional force that would affect the pendulum during the eclipse, instead of discarding the rotation of the Earth as the main cause of the motion of the pendulum ? </p>

<p>Day and night cycles are easily explained on a flat earth. The sun moves in circles around the North Pole. When it is over your head, it&#39;s day. When it&#39;s not, it&#39;s night. The sun acts like a spotlight and shines downward as it moves. The picture below illustrates how the sun moves and also how seasons work on a flat earth. The apparent effect of the sun rising and setting is usually explained as a perspective effect.</p>

<p>Personally, after thoroughly researching the subject, I have came to the conclusion that none of us really know what shape the planet is. All we got is these <strong>highly</strong> questionable images. Plus, there&#39;s a lot of very weird stuff happening with the Mandela Effect, and simulation theory is now mainstream science... so what the actual fuck is this planet? We don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a great book that explains some of the problems with the heliocentric model fairly concisely as well - from Copernicus to Newton to Galileo to Halley and Cassini and many more - explains the flaws in their thinking and exactly why they&#39;re wrong - it&#39;s just over 100 pages and it was first published in 1922.  You can honestly just browse through any of the chapters and find countless proofs the heliocentric model is an irretrievable a crock of shit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s false. It does spin, but the spin is syncronised with its orbit around the earth so we only see just over one half of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this sychronous rotation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth is probably false, but then again, according to public perception it was also &quot;probably false&quot; for Copernicus to state otherwise during the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Flat Earth theorists are ridiculed for questioning accepted truths about the nature of our existence.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t really think anyone will prove the earth is flat, we should allow those that are interested to look into these theories with an open mind. </p>

<p>This debate serves to inform us all that coming up with an absolute proof is more difficult that what it may first seem.</p>

<p>To me, the evidence is clearly compelling the Earth is a Ball, but I applaud anyone who wants to test the nature of their existence through experiment and thought experiment.</p>

<p>Therefore brothers and sisters - let&#39;s not forget Copernicus when we respond to Flat Earthers. </p>

<p>I do too.</p>

<p>The problem is that most flat earthers simply repeat what they heard in youtube videos. They never actually perform any experiment themselves and simply rely on handwaving argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of interesting questions if you say no way you have not looked into it at all. Look at flight paths most interesting. How the news tries to tell you that you cant see something that its a hologram total crap they are hiding something.  Also look at every shuttle launch they dont go straight up the take a curve 90° who knows whats really going on. Not one picture of the globe you see is real they are all generated from multiple photos. Look at nasa images from the earliest one to now the size of each continent is way different. Look into it see it with your own eyes before you deny or confirm anything.</p>

<p>So no explanation for something I saw with my own eyes, eh?</p>

<p>I mean it doesn&#39;t prove anything that you saw a spec in the sky.  Considering the iss supposedly travels at 17,500 mph at 249 miles away good chance it would not even be possible to track that, so no I&#39;m not going to just take your word that is what you saw. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll debunk the video later, busy right now.</p>

<p>This shows your religious faith that instead of approaching the subject with an open mind you have the preconceived notion that you will debunk anything that contradicts your NASA taught believe system.  We might as well stop the conversation as you are still deep in the trance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>chances are it is probably due to gravitational changes during the line up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Chances are it&#39;s probably&quot;.  Chances are if that were the case the article would have said that and NASA would have said that.  Instead the article said a solar eclipse should not effect it and there was no explanation.  It&#39;s much more probable that it is something to do with electromagnetics and or the Aether that Tesla and many other great minds knew about.  Saying that the experiment is still valid and it&#39;s &quot;probably&quot; gravitational changes is a weak argument when absolutely nothing scientific points to that.  </p>

<p>Because I&#39;m not using the Foucault pendulum as evidence of anything but you are.</p>

<p>Of course I am. Why should I not take into account an experiment that have been reproduced thousands of times by many different groups of people, and that consistently give the expected result ? That&#39;s science !</p>

<p>There are only a handful of results concerning the Allais effect. Some experiments couldn&#39;t even detect anything at all. </p>

<p>Why should we throw away the conclusions of the well-documented, perfectly explained, reproducible Foucault experiment? Just because on some particular occasions, some people (not all) have detected an anomalous behavior ?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not reasonable.</p>
