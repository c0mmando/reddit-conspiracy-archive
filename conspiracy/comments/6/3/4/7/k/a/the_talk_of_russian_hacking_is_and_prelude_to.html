       They always say the russians hacked the election. The news and pundits being "they.". 
But when asked to elaborate how the election was so called hacked it's not voter fraud or machine manipulation. The answer is always social media and influencing with fake news etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where is this going ? I have figured it out.. This is a step toward complete censorship on the internet for USA citizens by the time of the next election. so we dont "get hacked" again.

       For this to happen, Trump would have to lie and say all the Russia hacking the election stuff is true, and then abdicate. Even potentially leaving himself open to criminal charges.

       Banning "fake news" also gives the power to silence anyone who speaks out.  "Oh, you have a theory about a dark cabal of paedophiles in power?  Sorry, can't allow that to get out."

       They want their narrative to be the only narrative.  Different opinions and viewpoints are a threat.  This fake news issue really should be an issue that ALL people get behind and oppose.  Doesn't matter if you like trump, hate trump, are democrat, repub, or neither. Their position when taken to its logical conclusion is CENSORSHIP. The logical conclusion is a Ministry of Truth to decide what we are told and what we can believe.  Its implying we aren't capable of deciding what we should believe or mature enough to read other points of view.  As if, somebody in washington deserveWe must all submit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its very healthy to have a a multitude of views.  It improves the quality of the discussion, allows rigorous debate, allows people to be more open minded. On the whole it benefits our democracy to have a vibrant and multi-polar media system. Are their incorrect or even disturbing ideas out there? Of course. But that is well worth it and part of freedom of speech. The second you give the power to censor things that can arbitrarily be defined by TPTB it will be massively abused.  I don't support Trump but I find the notion that all his supporters are extremists and radicals that must be stopped disturbing.  Lets have more respect for people we disagree with. Sure, disagree with them vehemently but don't try to silence them or discredit them because they believe differently than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ideas, if correct, will stand up to debate and criticism.  Reputation is important in this. If you are consistently on the right side of history and truth, time will show that and people will respect you. But the MSM has consistently been on the wrong side of history and they are desperately trying to hold on to the control they once had prior to the internet empowering the average citizen. Their ideas haven't stood up to criticism or integrity.  Don't kid yourselves, controlling the media is a huge weapon that people tend to underrate. What they want is Orwellian, plain and simple.
