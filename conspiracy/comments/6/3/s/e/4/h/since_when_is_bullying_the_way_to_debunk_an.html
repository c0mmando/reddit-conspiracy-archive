    <div class="md"><p>To be perfectly fair, any scientific evidence you present to Flat Earthers (just as an example, I promise I don&#39;t mean anything mean by it) is often dismissed as fake or otherwise manipulated regardless of how accepted that information may be. For example, saying that Polaris is around 400ish light-years away is dismissed by flat Earthers because Hipparchus&#39; trigonometry was wrong, therefore any arguments about the North Star are wrong because it&#39;s really only a few thousand miles Away. So now I have to prove Hipparchus correct before I can even begin to debate Flat Earth, which is very hard to do without using &quot;flawed trigonometry&quot; even though Hipparchus is widely considered correct. I also think this is why there is such a ridiculous amount of hostility around that theory, people find it incredibly frustrating to argue against when their argument is just dismissed, which brings out the &quot;wow you&#39;re retarded&quot; kinda things. I admit I sometimes get a little frustrated about flat Earth, which is why I use this example. I try not to flat out call people retarded though.</p>

<p>The fact that they believe these things isn&#39;t what is making people hostile to the theory, it&#39;s ignoring contradicting arguments that gets people upset</p>

<p>There is always at least one. For a long time it was Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster. Whatever is in style.</p>

<p>Go look at the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> thread from yesterday about Sandy Hook. There are more comments saying something to the tune of &quot;the people that believe Sandy Hook was a hoax also believe that the earth is flat&quot;</p>

<p>For the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to maintain it&#39;s derogatory function, there has to be a popular, yet easily discreditable, &quot;theory&quot; like flat earth or the loch ness monster, that at least some &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; actually believe, in order to discredit us all.</p>

<p>Most of the noise on these issues comes from actual disinformation shills. That&#39;s why they refuse to change their &quot;belief&quot; even when presented with irrefutable belief.

<p>That reminds me how Carl Sagan would always explain away his preposterous ideas with &quot;billions and billions and billions&quot;. If you make it &quot;extremely big&quot;, &quot;extremely far away&quot;, or &quot;extremely long ago&quot;, you can make it feasible.</p>

<p>Edit: note how you didn&#39;t even address my argument. You ignored it and presented your own. This is why flat Earth is met with hostility and dismissal.</p>

<p>You think that because I don&#39;t believe we live on a spinning ball that I should have all of the answers? Well, I don&#39;t. But you my friend cannot prove that we live on a spinning ball. You spinning ballers are making the claim; it&#39;s your responsibility to prove that we live on a spinning ball. My G-d man, we live in the 21st Century! Astronomers supposedly know in detail the exact composition of a some planet 150,000 light years away, but they can&#39;t prove that the home they live on is a spinning ball.</p>

<p>Fill in the blank in your first statement with absolutely any conspiracy theory and you can see the problem. Just because you don&#39;t like a theory, doesn&#39;t mean people shouldn&#39;t discuss it, and it doesn&#39;t mean it is a psyop, shill tactic, etc. </p>

<p>And who is say the reserve isn&#39;t true, that people try to do the same thing and dismiss and stop any <em>flat earth</em> discussion by throwing it in with what they believe to be ludicrous, whatever that may be? </p>

<p>You claim that flat earthers (who you believe to be wrong) discredit these other groups who you believe to be right: 9/11 truthers and anti-flouride crusaders. You don&#39;t have a monopoly on truth, and any or all of these three groups may be right, and has a right to discuss. </p>

Through my work I know people who designed components for GPS satalites that are in orbit right now, and have myself used GPS. I have watched the north star and its contant position. I know people from the southern hemisphere that can attest that the north star is not visible there and that there is no single star that remains unmoving, but that stars still rotate around a point.

Either way, if an individual scientist researches something outside of the approved narrative (or, if a teacher/professor, teaches outside of the government-approved curriculum) they get fired. Scientists who have threatened government narratives have had worse. This might not seem possible, since much of it is compartmentalized, and most scientists  don&#39;t rock the boat, even if they tried. </p>

<p>The rest of us can point out the videos and images of space are bogus, and they&#39;ll just call us nutty conspiracy theorists. If I could raise enough money to fly a rocket off the earth&#39;s surface, then they&#39;ll pay attention to me (I wouldn&#39;t like it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before you can look at something new, you have to consider that everything you know may be based on a lie, or wrong. Then you have to think that the new thing is not only possible, but likely, given evidence of it, and something that may threaten the people who run the world so much, that they have conspired to keep it hidden. You can <em>only</em> continue if you have any kind of visual imagination. If the earth is flat, you have to allow for ideas such as a small local sun and moon moving above a flat or slightly curved earth. </p>

<p>There is an answer for everything you mentioned. Here are the basics, 21 questions and answers:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/k0xClWgidZU">https://youtu.be/k0xClWgidZU</a></p>

<p>GPS satellites may be fake. Everything they do can be done on flat earth using antennas. Whistleblower?:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sjDWE45amzg">https://youtu.be/sjDWE45amzg</a></p>

<p>The seasons could easily be because of the path of the sun, and would be reversed depending on the circular path. The same with the sunsets varying, based on the position of the sun.</p>

<p>What you see in the telescope only proves that you can see those things. Everything else about them you can only guess and assume.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of people from the southern &quot;hemisphere&quot; being able to see stars from the northern &quot;hemisphere,&quot; which should only be possible if they were looking through the globe. Furthermore, stars and other planets may not be what you think, especially if you believe they are what science and your education have told you they are. If there is a dome, they could balls of pulsating energy, or it all <em>could</em> be a kind of hologram. They <em>never</em> change, even though we&#39;ve been travelling at a supposed 600,000 miles per hour. Flat earthers readily admit, they do not know everything about the sky or what&#39;s inside or udnerneath the earth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the earth has to be flat, but most signs point to the traditional globe model being false. There could be a slight mound, or the size of the earth is way larger than I&#39;ve been told. I don&#39;t know how an island be fully visible 100 miles away from coastline, like Elbe, or islands in Hawaii, unless earth is flat or only slightly curved. Other tests prove a round earth is wrong as well. There are many questions I have.</p>

<p>The math can be worked out correctly for a Geocentric System just like it can for a Heliocentric system.  Even Einstein admitted to this.

<p>I agree here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnzUgKZ8m2k">independant balloon footage</a> (without a fisheye lens) that goes up to 110K ft and shows no curve as the horizon rises to eye level the entire time (not possible on a ball).</p>

<p>Yet there is no proof for this.  If you try to google satellites in space all you get is a bunch of cartoons.  Satellite technology is all ground based and has been around since the 1940&#39;s.  Research the term ,skywave propagation&#39;.  Where did your belief come from that 3rd world countries actually have satellites in space?   </p>

<p>I agree these are not the dark ages and that is exactly why this subject has overwhelmingly increased in popularity since the information started to be discussed around 3 years ago.  If your theory was right this &quot;delusional fringe conspiracy&quot; would have died out a long time ago instead steadily increasing in popularity.  This topic will not be going away and the people like you that have religious faith in the &quot;space agencies&quot; look more ridicules everyday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you agree that the flat earth assumption is merely theoretical, and there is not existent evidence, by anybody, and the construction of such theory is only possible through delegitimizing current scientific theories. The only possible evidence for this theory, the edge of the world, is protected by armed forced that would kill flat earthers on sight. So this would be circular argument, &quot;your evidence is fake, and i&#39;ll never be able to provide evidence because the conspiracy itself forbid that&quot;. </p>

<p>From a considerably strategic position near the poles (not in the poles, where you think theres high risk), it would be possible to launch a low orbit balloon and confirm your theory. This is considering the perceived captured land from a video like you provided. But of course you won&#39;t even think about it, as your theory is based on pseudo science faith and would die to any real attempt to objectively find evidence. </p>

<p>And you keep mentioning the NASA, when even emerging countries like India are getting stronger space agencies, and you even avoided the private sector involved in space activities. BTW here&#39;s a link to cubesats (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CubeSats">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CubeSats</a>).</p>

<p>The flat earth theory isn&#39;t a loony delusional conspiracy, it&#39;s a extremely flawed conspiracy with very dark implications (as exposed with the logical and relativism issues). That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t die besides facts and evidence, because there are important interests behind this.

The good news is that the truth has come out and anyone that decides to prove a 1,000mph spinning globe to themselves without using NASA CGI as a source will find out the truth for themselves.  </p>

That is what gets me is the people that know the government is corrupt and lies about everything (i.e. the president, politicians, military,9/11, Gulf of Tonkin, false flags etc) but bring up NASA and somehow they think that they are the only legitimate government agency and would never lie because the only use &quot;science&quot;.

When someone appears on the scene all of a sudden to &quot;set the record straight&quot; about 9/11 or some other controversial topic, of course absolving Israel of all culpability in the process, and is highly upvoted while people who are disputing these baseless assertions are downvoted in swarms, there is brigading/shilling going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already schooled him on 9/11, making a couple simple yet devastating arguments that directly contradict his claims, which he makes with no evidence whatsoever. </p>

<p>You&#39;re conflating an abundance of words with actual substance. He literally doesn&#39;t make a single argument in his post, at all. Just says a bunch of opinions.</p>

<p>My arguments within the thread are met with downvotes while his peurile responses (saying things like &quot;lol&quot; as if it&#39;s an argument) are being upvoted. You&#39;ll just say I&#39;m butthurt about being downvoted, but that&#39;s really not what I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m saying there&#39;s no way the majority of users here can&#39;t tell the difference between an actual scientific and rational argument and fallacious assertions like the ones he&#39;s making.

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of glibly tossing around shill accusations either, but on the subject of Israel and 9/11 it&#39;s pretty much a guarantee that they will crawl out of the woodwork.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got good images, but if you&#39;d rather download it as a podcast to listen to as you drive, you can do that <a href="https://s58.podbean.com/pb/56912f1bb706daf326cd115fadbae848/58e686d9/data2/fs101/824160/uploads/The_Great_Moon_Landing_Hoax_with_Dennis_Cimino_www_MP3Fiber_com_.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the interview that first got me thinking differently about it. Then I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon</a> and even my non-conspiratorial fiancee was convinced by that point.</p>

<p>A fantastic book that&#39;s also hilarious, that I&#39;m actually reading right now, is <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Dave%20McGowan%20-%20Wagging%20The%20Moon%20Doggie.pdf">Wagging the Moondoggie</a> by Dave McGowan (RIP), which I linked to the free pdf version there.</p>

<p>A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon is great, and only 45 minutes long, but actually my favorite moon videos on Youtube are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W79mIGx9Ib4">What Happened On The Moon</a>, and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX-laeKljTo">Apollo Zero</a> and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybJMuowl0UU">Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land On The Moon?</a></p>

<p>If you search for Jarrah White&#39;s Youtube channel, which was called Moonfaker, you&#39;ll find endless hours of hoax material where he debunks the Mythbusters episode and does all kinds of experiments, etc. Very good stuff.</p>

<p>If you have a strong science background you might enjoy aulis.com, where you&#39;ll find plenty of mathematical and physical arguments by PhDs and other experts debunking the Apollo missions, analysis of photography, critique of the computing systems by electronics engineers, etc.</p>

<p>A great forum to check out is cluesforum, I&#39;ll link to the thread about the Apollo missions <a href="http://cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;amp;t=59&amp;amp;sid=da8a64190802d396658be04ffa156779">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have more stuff I could link you to or suggest if you are still interested or want more.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one more I just thought of, a lecture by a former professional photographer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nj_jCeupYQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nj_jCeupYQ</a></p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll check out at least a few of those and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>The idea that aliens are abducting millions of human beings for some sort of hybrid breeding program with the consent of a secret cabal that runs the American government is not innocuous.

To me that seems like a deliberate effort to undersell what most of us actually believe. With the recent release of the Pentagon photos it feels like there&#39;s still some effort going on to actively mold public opinion about 9/11 and make sure it coheres to the official government story as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True: Bush allowed 9/11 to happen, he was briefed on it repeatedly and ignore the briefings. The CIA and Mossad had a relationship with the Saudis to foment terrorism so they can continue to get funding and advance their geopolitical goals by stoking fears in the public. The pentagon was hit in the exact part that contained the documents documenting the missing Trillions of dollars the pentagon had announced the day before. Building 7 was demolished, and was not hit by a plane, and also contained many floors owned by the DoD.
Taking it too far: The planes were not real and were holographic. The buildings were exploded by mini-nukes. Bush personally hired people to do 9/11 and organized it himself. The Jews did 9/11. No one died on 9/11. No one was in the planes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of people probably do not know, or believe, that Israel, the United States and Saudi Arabia are all allies who support terrorism for the purposes of advancing certain geopolitical goals.  That fact alone, for most people, is probably staggering.  Even the idea that Bush was briefed on 9/11 specifically (as opposed to Al Qaeda more generally) is considered taboo.  So I am not sure that the original poster is attempting to undersell the beliefs of conspiracy theorists.  I think in fact he is probably trying to open people up to the idea that yes, there is something there, and you need to carefully evaluate the facts to determine what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Falling into this without mental preparation is extremely overwhelming. A person on reddit, who&#39;s been following socially accepted and popular norms/paradigms/philosophies they&#39;re whole life is, one day, introduced to facts that split in half what they were lead to believe they&#39;re ENTIRE LIFE. It&#39;s disorienting while simultaneously mind opening... caused by any number of realizations...such as learning that the US knew about Pearl Harbor before it happened, that we didn&#39;t destroy the top Nazi&#39;s but actually took in and incorporated they&#39;re ideas/projects/tactics (Operation Paperclip) that the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a false flag, that the Tuskegee experiments really happened on innocent people,  etc etc etc... my point being that these people learn about something on Reddit through a chain of comments and then are subsequently introduced to this sub or other forums where free thoughts are welcome. </p>

<pre><code>   The world of conspiracy is an extremely overwhelming place. The rabbit hole only gets deeper and deeper, as you delve from (what I like to call) popular conspiracy into fringe conspiracy...popular conspiracies that have steady support groups built around it to get the truth out such as 9/11, Monsanto and they&#39;re insecticides, the Federal Reserve Scam etc...and fringe conspiracies/truths that can be extremely mind blowing such as Operation Highjump, MKULTRA, MKOFTEN, the Montauk Project, and the truths about how Washington D.C. was built and its connection to Stone Henge, and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. Wild things like Shakespeare, Scottish Freemasons, Sacred Geometry, Ancient Cults of Isis and Osiris, The New Jerusalem etc... so many more truths are waiting down the path . 

   Now a redditor fresh into this Rebbit hole either begins to propagate these truths or suffer cognitive dissonance and revert back to a sheep. When you try to spread these extremely polarizing truths, you suffer from being ostracized and ridiculed. You start to see everything differently while trying to convert your friends and family, but often they are not ready to accept the truth...or do not find you credible enough to accept your truth. A sense of equilibrium, a sense of societal normalcy doesn&#39;t exist down here. Only what is true and what isn&#39;t...and the pursuit of both. By finding the truth we can consciously choose to move our lives and actions in a different, more positive direction. By finding lies, we can observe how they slither their way into the darkest crevices. The tactics and movements become apparent and obvious, and from that we continue to learn. 

    The tactics and movements from said post are obvious. In these past 2 years, the world of conspiracy is slowly becoming the new norm, and it seems we are reaching a new apex. Our new norm; the pursuit of knowledge and truth and the unrelenting acceptance that there are individuals and groups who seek to destroy both facets of our new norm and literally destroy us as people and as a community. Their tactic is the same as always... divide and conquer and disseminate falsehoods. &quot;These ideas may have some validity, however these ideas or Conspiracies are going TOO far and should be disregarded &quot;...is the definition of a shill. 

     There has been an innumerous amount of theories where I&#39;ve felt are complete bull shit, but still I walk away with knowledge of another topic or the beginnings of a new path to even more truth. It&#39;s unfortunate that this is the current state of r/conspiracy ... but it only indicates that our methods are effective and that the knowledge &quot;hiders&quot; are terrified of the knowledge seekers and will continue to pour millions of their dollars, thousands of their people, and thousands of their hours to try and stop the truth. 

     It&#39;s beautiful that we live in a time like this, and I&#39;m excited to see what will come to pass. I&#39;m positive that we will prevail...but it will and has been at a severe cost.

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook? There&#39;s so much out there about it I don&#39;t know which single place I would cite as a definitive overview. I guess the master work on it is the book that got banned from Amazon, but is not available for free online, the multi-authored <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook_final.pdf">No One Died At Sandy Hook</a>.</p>

<p>If you do want to dive into that 450 page book, I suggest you skip the introduction and go straight to the evidence. The intro is kind of cheesy and pointless.</p>

<p>But if you would rather watch a video or something, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRMkMtjukCQ">this</a>. But like I said, there&#39;s so much out there I could give you more and more depending on what medium you want and how interested you are.</p>

<p>To briefly summarize why people think it was a hoax, including me, here&#39;s a shorter article with the top ten reasons.</p>

<p>Is this true?  I know that in my own career as a freelance shill for the Discordian Society, I&#39;ve found it more memetically impactful if I&#39;m nimble and omnipresent rather than being immediately available for responses.  I can spike a dozen narratives with high-impact memetic antidotes in the time it takes to put on one rhetorical virtuoso performance in a long discussion.  Assuming that paid shills have at least as much strategic awareness as I do, it seems unlikely that shills would like to keep people in long and pointless discussions, since that creates an elevated risk that they&#39;ll draw out truly exceptional rhetoric and evidence.  On the contrary, it seems like the strategic purposes of shills would be better met by <em>suggesting</em> that shills like to keep people in long and pointless discussions, since that would cause people engaging in sincere conversation to grow steadily more annoyed at each other as they conversed on the forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up Cultural Marxism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s main goal was to collapse the West. And to do so by undermining all its basic institutions and social norms. A group of Cultural Marxisms (called the Frankfurt School) came to America in the 1920s and essentially took over our educational system. It was the Frankfurt Schoolers who removed critical thinking from the curriculum and replaced it with &quot;the Feels&quot;.</p>

<p>Rationality was replaced with Greivance. Race-hate.</p>

<p>Pitting women against men, etc.</p>

<p>In the 1930s, a Frankfurt School tactician named Herbert Marcuse invented what we today called &quot;political correctness&quot;. He called them &quot;speech codes&quot;. And he said that it was of the utmost importance to roll them out on the college campuses, to get people used to censorship. To train them to self-censor. To internalize it.</p>

<p>He said straight-up that if freedom of speech were allowed, that the Cultural Marxists would lose. In given the choice between freedom and censorship, normal, functional people would always choose freedom. So &quot;freedom,&quot; as an option, had to be removed from the choice-selection.</p>

<p>The arguments had to be framed as &quot;Do you want hate speech laws or are you a racist, instead?&quot;</p>

<p>Or: &quot;Do you want Big Government, or Bigger Government?&quot;</p>

<p>Freedom, as an option, was removed.</p>

<p>The Cultural Marxists, training new and vulnerable generations, to operate on &quot;The Feels&quot; (and rearing them on grievance) trained them to attack their perceived opponents. To bully them.</p>

<p>After all the victims of Cultural Marxism are really equipped to argue effectively. Logic and reason was weeded out of the curriculum.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not their strong suit. </p>

<p>But emotionalism and hatred are.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a darker reality in play, too. This new young generation was not just ideologically trained, they&#39;re <em>chemically</em> manipulated. The young men who are college age now have been chemically lobotimized by years of ADHD drugs. The females have had their frontal lobes damaged by birth control. Frontal lobe damage affects aggression and impulse control. [Go Google the side-effects of The Pill that have been hidden from the public].</p>

<p>When you see these kids being &quot;triggered,&quot; they&#39;re operating under dual entrainment programming, both ideological and pharmaceutical. It&#39;s very similar to MK Ultra programming techniques. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former KGB analyst Yuri Bezmenov talks about these permanently-damaged young people and their irreversible brainwashing. That shit&#39;s chemically hardwired in. You&#39;re not going to &quot;reason them&quot; into being logical, or rationally persuade them by introducing them to facts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true in an out dated view but I truly think the internet combined with human nature is a fucking powerful weapon. Guys like PewDiePie have more followers than Canada has people. And more importantly they listen, and due to his recent turmoil they are learning to question the narratives they are fed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be more than 1 thing in my opinion, besides the well known disinfo trolls that through strange writing patterns and all the moronity in this world they try to reduce all the credibility from some theories. Sharing some ideas that might be considered &quot;extravagant&quot; aren&#39;t always welcomed if you consider it&#39;s supported by underlying ideologies, or immoral, or against the perception of the establishment, or against scientific knowledge (always relative to your own conception of the world) etc...</p>

<p>If you ask me, flat earthers are absolute anti-science morons, and you can&#39;t discuss with them with evidences because of course, all the scientific evidence is fake for them. However I find the 9/11 conspiracy theory very possible from the evidence and testimonies found by the investigations. So to get involved with such group of dissenters, you have to consider it&#39;s very closely related to your own system of values and beliefs. You can&#39;t bully other people into your theory either.</p>

<p>If you ask me, there are terrible things going on in this world, and some of us are specifically and actively targeted. There are surreptitious operations disrupting and slaving us, that aren&#39;t passive global conspiracies where &quot;we get to know&quot;. The raw thing to say it, it&#39;s I&#39;m trying to expose human experimentation and the use of electromagnetic weapons (like those used against the US embassy in Russia in the 60s-70s) in domestic terrorism and targeting civilians within America and overseas. I seen some very smart and well behaved people targeted, and we all agree the good way to go is through evidences, and that&#39;s what we are trying to obtain, such as electromagnetic detectors (if you want to check biggerthansnowden.com). If you ask, of course this is less popular than flat earthers and holocaust denial, and sometimes implied with phrases as &quot;they are poisoning us&quot;, &quot;they are controlling us&quot;, &quot;they are attacking us&quot; but never spoken out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existence of reptilians is far more plausible than flat earth theory. There are stories, narratives and accounts from many places over many years for the reptilians. That doesn&#39;t mean that there is a 100% chance that they exist. It&#39;s just evidence. Proof is simply defined as sufficient evidence to believe.</p>

<p>Flat earth theory is backed by simple logic and scripture. It&#39;s challenged by photos, videos, simple and complex logic, accounts, scientific experiments, math, science, etc. To keep believing in flat earth after all of that assault of contradictory information is is quite a mental feat of stubborn, willful ignorance. Every time I hear it I can help but default to thinking we are being trolled. </p>

I understand it when someone on YouTube tells me that the horizon is obviously flat even though I swore I saw that it curves when I go to the coast because there&#39;s no maths in those videos or hard things like geometry or physics. It&#39;s much easier when I hear a YouTuber telling me that there&#39;s no such thing as gravity because now I can just laugh at the bullies who keep throwing that stupid g word at me. Just because I didn&#39;t spend much time in school and don&#39;t understand their intellectual elite crap and find comfort in explanations of the universe that are simple enough for me to grasp is no reason to pick on me or call me retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth is a psyop.</p>

<p>There is always at least one. For a long time it was Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster. Whatever is in style.</p>

<p>Go look at the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> thread from yesterday about Sandy Hook. There are more comments saying something to the tune of &quot;the people that believe Sandy Hook was a hoax also believe that the earth is flat&quot;</p>

<p>For the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to maintain it&#39;s derogatory function, there has to be a popular, yet easily discreditable, &quot;theory&quot; like flat earth or the loch ness monster, that at least some &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; actually believe, in order to discredit us all.</p>

<p>Most of the noise on these issues comes from actual disinformation shills. That&#39;s why they refuse to change their &quot;belief&quot; even when presented with irrefutable belief. It&#39;s not their job to actually believe it. It&#39;s their job to act like they do in order to spread disinformation.</p>
