      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the media calls it a conspiracy doesn't mean that r/conspiracy has to subscribe to it. If anything it's just like the last MSM
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       that end up being fake/propaganda bull shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the narrative. If it fits with the MSMs narrative, it likely needs a second look. There probably is a conspiracy in there somewhere.

       This post is straight from the David Brock playbook.  "Russia is real conspiracy, sorry it's not pizza or lizard people."  I've seen some iteration of this post at least a few dozen times since MSM went full court press with the fake Russia conspiracy a few months back.

       WaPo is known CIA propaganda.  Everyone in this sub knows Bezos got a fat contract from the CIA shortly after buying WaPo.  The Russia narrative is a clear counter conspiracy effort to de-legitimize trump.  It's extremely fake news.

       When will anyone investigate Pizzagate? When will the 22,000 employed Journalists in America each pledge to only write news about Pizzagate until every man, woman, child and pet reader knows that nobody will investigate Pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe after all citizens are compelled by force from the Govt to learn the horrible truth, that nobody will investigate Pizzagate, then the moral leaders at DEA and the last best hope of mankind at CIA and the non-partisan paragons of integrity at FBI and your local Peace Officers heavilly armed with MRAPS and anti-tank TOW missiles (strictly for defense against Abrhams tanks given to Antifa-Bolsheviks by Moderate Rebels in California) can all work together to finally investigate how to get someone to investigate Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know these times are dark days and people are hurting and losing hope that all of human consciousness will never be unified by Orbital Mind Control Satellites operated by NRO into simultaneously thinking the same a thought on the same wavelength , a Great Thought expressing Humanity's most noble potential, the Final Answer to All Problens,: when will someone make First Contact with Alien Intelligences and learn how to operate the GUI of the HyperDimensional Glowing Orbs and thereby become fluent in the Archillean language to be able to communicate to them and ask them when will anyone investigate Pizzagate when there's no one left to ask?

       Before the election this sub was fairly balanced, but the Russian bots or paid trolls owned this place during the election. It was wall to wall "Clinton foundation busted for pediphia" or "Pope Endorced Trump". 9 out of 10 top stories where Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that Trump has showed his true colors, by taking away our privacy. Now that we saw he tried to take health insurance from 24 Million Americans. Now that we see he filled his cabinet with corrupt lobbyist, the sub has balanced out a bit.

       Maybe, maybe not. But if people had taken an interest in the down ticket ballots and not just voted (R) down the line, maybe we would of had a house and Senate that weren't in the pockets of big corporations. Not a single Democratic congressman voted for this anti-privacy bill.

       Your right, both sides are corrupt. We need to clean house and remove all of the establishment politicians from both sides of the aisle.  But when it comes to civil liberties, the Republicans have a much worse track record. Had people elected fiscally conservative, socially liberal Republicans like those that voted against this bill, we would be in this mess to begin with.

       Like Rand Paul, the one who cosponsored the bill to get rid of privacy regulations? Though he's not really a full libertarian. I agree with fuck the 2 major political parties, but libertiarianism, at least the common form I see touted online, would never work. Regulations on capitalism are necessary so the little people don't get fucked. Most libertarians I know are just angry at the government and taxes, so think that the best solution is to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They seem to glorify big corporations, when corporations are just as corrupt as the government has become. They are the funders of politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, we're getting fucked by the two parties, and being unable to actually form other viable parties is severely hampering any positive changes we could make to the system.

       It's kind of sad how hard people stick to their political alignment on this sub. This should be a sanctuary for nihilists, agnostics, free-thinkers, and rhetoricians.

      <p>
       Question the status quo, but that doesn't mean what's being presented is wrong. Maybe trump and Blackwater do have major connections. Just as well, Rice did give go head on unmasking Trump admin.

       This drives me nuts, when you support a conspiracy theory not from the "right" you are called a liberal brainwashed by mainstream media. You know there is more out there then the Clinton and Obama conspiracies and some of the other ones may be right as well. Hate how political this subreddit has become.

       Thank you, the two party system is broken and both sides have every intention of tossing you down. I love this idea that PizzaGate is somehow just attacking Democrats when you have the Bush Callboy Story and the Larry King story mentioned, yet that will get downvoted because "it's just the Democrats that are being attacked". The truth of the matter is that they want to turn this partisan rather then acknowledge both sides are corrupt and guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a concentrated effort to turn this sub into a right wing Neo Nazi group and I have no doubt that there are those on both left and right who are posing as "the other" to change the perception on things here, especially since this is one of the few places where not only can you be critical of both left and right, but there is credible fact based information that can be viewed here and is damaging to the narrative. That is why we are being attacked by both the left and right.

       I'd like to see how many connections Clinton and her people have with Russia. I'm not saying this to deflect from what might legitimate claims of collusion, but we need some metric to compare against. You or I might not have connections to any Russian bankers, but a man who's been in international business for the last 30 years (or a woman who's been close to the top of international politics for the same length) and the people they hire to delegate tasks to are bound to have connections to similarly high-ranking Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is not whether Trump and his people have connections to Russians, but whether the amount is out of whack with what we should expect for someone of his stature.

       The only reason the conspiracy types around here even entertain trump is all the shilling by sellouts and bots. It's a psych operation to align the conspiracy movement with trump and it's hardly organic. They are mind fucking everyone of us.
