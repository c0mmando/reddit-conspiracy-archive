       no, because trump and his crooks were talking with known enemies of the state, so they were caught by gwb's nsa wire tapes

       How exactly are they enemies of the state? Are we at war with them? I got to conduct war games with the ruskies in 2012, they were cool as fuck. Just because Trump and his people talked to them doesn't mean they were collaborating on stealing the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still ZERO proof anything bad was conspired between Trump and Russia. But if you want to really talk about crooks why don't we discuss the entire 8 years of Obama or just Hillary Clinton in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until I see actual fact based proof anything happened between trump and Russia I will continue to believe this whole debacle is the doing of the democrats after losing the election to spite trump but its blowing up in their faces.

       What who said about Flynn? CNN? You're entire post history for the last year consists of Trump bashing on this sub with an 8 year old account with shit for karma. To me that screams share blue employee. Or your just a leftist wing nut.

       You make claims with no back up. You bash one side of the coin while totally ignoring the other. You cant scare me with your McCarthyism 2.0.

       I meant you using the Russians as a scare tactic like the entire leftist media is doing now. Just like Joe McCarthy did in the 50's. Sorry Hildawg didn't get crowned bro, but that probably saved the world or at least America.

       Right, so these conversations were reviewed and there was not only no evidence of collusion but there was no law broken period. So run that one by me again but if you could back your claim up and be clear this time it would be appreciated

       Lol you clearly didn't read the first link. What we're talking about here is if the phone calls had any sign of anything illegal going on. And nothing in the calls was illicit or illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Christ you people can't keep your narratives straight. I thought Trump was a Putin pawn who clearly tied to Russia in a multitude of ways in politics and business. But then he's going to get Eric Prince to create a back channel with Putin? So they haven't had a back channel before? Who is the Russian that Prince met with? How do we know it's related to Putin? Where's the detail where's the evidence?

       As far as Flynn do you mean him asking for immunity? If that's what you mean then you need to watch this

       Lol yes that's good deflect and don't answer any of my questions and just start making strawman arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a trump supporter you can check my history. What you're supposed to keep straight is that if any of the Russia-Trump connection claims are legitimate then having Prince establish a back channel is just stupid and doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't know why don't you tell me what Carter Page was doing? He never met with Trump so he would be a pretty shitty guy to go after to try and get close to Trump. He talked to Kislyak at the RNC but that's about all that he's been accused of while "working", albeit limitedly, for the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recall saying trump is for the little guy or that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the dossier is fake. Most of it is but that's not the issue here. A true sign of the amount of thought and effort you've put in to your research is how childish you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your shit together and do a little bit of your own research and then get back to me

       When have I ever mentioned Rice or anyone breaking the law? Take a few seconds, Look at what I've said and then get back to me. Again you're putting zero effort into thinking through and reading things. It's impossible to take you seriously when you're so hasty and just keep pulling straw-mans, deflecting and avoiding points.
