    <div class="md"><p>How exactly are they enemies of the state? Are we at war with them? I got to conduct war games with the ruskies in 2012, they were cool as fuck. Just because Trump and his people talked to them doesn&#39;t mean they were collaborating on stealing the election. </p>

<p>There is still ZERO proof anything bad was conspired between Trump and Russia. But if you want to really talk about crooks why don&#39;t we discuss the entire 8 years of Obama or just Hillary Clinton in particular. </p>

<p>Until I see actual fact based proof anything happened between trump and Russia I will continue to believe this whole debacle is the doing of the democrats after losing the election to spite trump but its blowing up in their faces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you clearly didn&#39;t read the first link. What we&#39;re talking about here is if the phone calls had any sign of anything illegal going on. And nothing in the calls was illicit or illegal. </p>

<p>And Christ you people can&#39;t keep your narratives straight. I thought Trump was a Putin pawn who clearly tied to Russia in a multitude of ways in politics and business. But then he&#39;s going to get Eric Prince to create a back channel with Putin? So they haven&#39;t had a back channel before? Who is the Russian that Prince met with? How do we know it&#39;s related to Putin? Where&#39;s the detail where&#39;s the evidence? </p>

<p>As far as Flynn do you mean him asking for immunity? If that&#39;s what you mean then you need to watch this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yes that&#39;s good deflect and don&#39;t answer any of my questions and just start making strawman arguments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a trump supporter you can check my history. What you&#39;re supposed to keep straight is that if any of the Russia-Trump connection claims are legitimate then having Prince establish a back channel is just stupid and doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know why don&#39;t you tell me what Carter Page was doing? He never met with Trump so he would be a pretty shitty guy to go after to try and get close to Trump. He talked to Kislyak at the RNC but that&#39;s about all that he&#39;s been accused of while &quot;working&quot;, albeit limitedly, for the Trump campaign. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall saying trump is for the little guy or that <em>all</em> of the dossier is fake. Most of it is but that&#39;s not the issue here. A true sign of the amount of thought and effort you&#39;ve put in to your research is how childish you are. </p>

<p>Get your shit together and do a little bit of your own research and then get back to me</p>
