       Put your self in to Assad's shoes. You have just stopped one of the biggest rebel offensives since Aleppo recently. Rebels pushed back to fighting in Idlib. Wide spread change in international support recently as well. Why would Assad try and Bomb his own people after such successes in recent weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is where turkey comes into play. Note that Turkey has proposed staging false flag chemical weapons attacks in Syria recently. This possibility is even more likely considering the closeness in proximity of Idlib province in Syria to Turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, factions in Turkey have not only been providing conventional weapons and small arms to the Syrian rebels already, but they have also provided them chemical weapons precursors.

       Rebels captured with Sarin at Turkish border:

       Because the Turkish government was planning on staging a false flag attack to justify intervention in Syria:

       And once again..we have the "White Helmets" and the "Syrian Observatory for Human Rights" as the witnesses. The reporter for "Reuters" who just happened to be there is going to be interesting. They're fast-tracking this to the UN so it's already been decided. Expect UN forces to go in by next week.

       McCain is already attacking Trump over Tillerson's statement last week. Will the media ask McCain about his "secret" trip to Syria? This is going to escalate very quickly. I believe they're going all in on this move and will go for impeachment soon.

        On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction.[1] The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days.[2]

        "Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the web we weave
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world
Invisible transfers, long distance calls,
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world
The dogs of war won't negotiate
The dogs of war don't capitulate,
They will take and you will give,
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door,
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world"
