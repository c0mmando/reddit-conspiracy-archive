       Building on my last

       </a>
       regarding transatlantic links in pedogate a few more connections I have stumbled upon. Plus the wider implications and recent possible revelations I have experienced. Again this post is a tad convoluted and was put together in a rush, but that’s the nature of researching this sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding two transatlantic links: one furthers the ping pong connection, one the pizza. And the possible link between the two of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly regarding the ping pong link:
      </p>
      <p>
       The video below, (sponsored by comet ping pong), an international group called pongress run global events in which enthusiasts gather from all over the world. Past locations have included Berlin, (Dr Pong), Washington DC, and shown in the videos below Newcastle, UK. The first video seems innocent enough until, up pops none other than James Alefantis at the end. Flying to the UK for a small get together and a casual game of ping pong. Really? Or is this an opportunity to network with like minded individuals?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/62045332">
        https://vimeo.com/62045332
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (&amp; further discussion
       <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/9593493.html#9622952">
        https://8ch.net/pol/res/9593493.html#9622952
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       The second event hosted in the UK was in Bristol. A ‘gothic ping pong gathering’… strange. Proceed to 4.44 in the video and see pentagrams beneath ping pong tables, ‘King of Ping’ logo similar to the comet ping pong logo, butterfly pedo logo, there is countless other examples of imagery and symbology which I won’t dwell on this post and will leave a link at the end of this post which can do a much better job. The members of the gathering seem to be the LGBTQ crowd, perhaps they want believe a few more letters should be added to the acronym, afterall everybody has ‘their preferences’. Sasha Lord (creepy comet ping pong performer also involved at Newcastle event)

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on from this side of things as there are bigger fish to fry. So it appears the ping pong network acts as the international social link between these degenerates, secretly advocating pedo rights, and then one step down the pizza/food network as the national distribution service? This leads me onto the next point. The UK’s distribution network of children through food outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The paedophile king pin Jimmy Saville whom we all know, (some of his connections detailed in previous post), had a favourite restaurant…….
You guessed it ‘The Flying Pizza in Leeds, UK (Savilles home town and pedo stomping grounds), fast forward to today we can see the same restaurant has been acquired by the San Carlo Group. Needless to say this restaurant chain, of which there are many branches for ‘different tastes’.
      </p>
      <p>
       This group is owned by politically active Carlo Distefano.
Surprise surprise his restaurants are a big hit amongst the elite. Their Instagram page is revealing with seemingly celebrities and elites from all walks of life popping in for some pizza. A few suspect photos too.
      </p>
      <p>
       To list a few of their most loyal clientele:

       Many more minor celebs, can’t all be paedophiles surely? Further imagery worth noting:

      </p>
      <p>
       Looking into the owner Carlo Distefano seems the logical next step. In the article below the following information can be garnered. He was the first restaurateur in the UK to open on Christmas stating because it bores him. Really or perhaps he doesn’t follow the traditional Christian calendar.
He hasn’t taken a holiday in over 12 years going on to say “Heh heh, I shocked her recently. I said ‘Yes, let’s take a break. I want to go to Auschwitz’. But I don’t think that’s what she had in mind, and it hasn’t happened.” – A rather dark place for a ‘break’ - no human sacrifice or suffering here.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I thought ok this doesn’t prove anything. Taking a look at their website, the first thing I stumbled upon was a message stating:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Want more from San Carlo? To thank you and show our appreciation for your loyalty, San Carlo Group Restaurants has launched My San Carlo. Benefits include being the first to hear about special events and new dishes, as well as access to news, recipes, competitions and the low down on how to order secret menu items! What are you waiting for? Join My San Carlo today…”
      </p>
      <p>
       “The low down on how to order secret menu items” – With pizzagate in mind it doesn’t get much more incriminating. Having signed up for their mailing list, I will be trying to order ‘secret menu items’ as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Further interesting language comes in the descriptions of its different restaurants.
Gran Café – “San Carlo’s Gran Cafe opens during store hours for breakfast, all day brunch, lunch and the best afternoon tea in Manchester (as billed by press). Enjoy an informal brunch, indulgent cake or afternoon tea served with a glass of fizz, a cocktail or a soothing speciality JING tea.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is JING capitalized? Urban dictionary tells us various meanings for JING including:
-   a mandarin name for boy or girl
-   Meaning everything and nothing at the same time a type of codeword for things that need no code 
-   To puke/ cum on the floor excessively. Or so in a disgusting manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do codewords get more blatent than this? What the shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fumo - “Our award winning Fumo restaurant, bar and late lounges serve expertly crafted Italian cicchetti dishes to share or eat alone, seven days a week. With an unrivalled cocktail list, there’s sure to be something to suit all tastes”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Share or eat alone” “Something to suit all tastes” – I’m sure there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Flying Pizza – “San Carlo’s Flying Pizza serves the best in original Italian cuisine, with an extensive signature menu featuring seafood, meat, pasta, pizza and salads, all made to order using only the finest seasonal ingredients.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange of a fancy restaurant to describe its dishes as simply “meat” plus the usual suspect codewords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else I have noticed is the word “passion”. Is this just an Italian trait or does it signify a burning love and desire for something else. With what we know in mind read some quotes from the site including:
      </p>
      <p>
       “YOU HAVE TO HAVE PASSION” - CARLO DISTEFANO
      </p>
      <p>
       “WE ALL SHARE PRIDE AND PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS MY FATHER BUILT” - MARCELLO DISTEFANO
      </p>
      <p>
       "Working with such a professional restaurant group allows me to express my passion and expertise" - Aldo Zilli, Resident Celebrity Chef
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, other quotes from site:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is most striking about San Carlo is the sense of a restaurant that knows exactly what it’s doing and why" - The Observer
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we know what your fucking doing and why too!
      </p>
      <p>
       “SAN CARLO HAS THE INGREDIENTS OTHERS CAN ONLY DREAM OF”- THE OBSERVER
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a historical link to Italy we should research? It is well known for its “bunga bunga parties” held by Silvio Berlusconii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the Hampstead kids also cite pizza places as locations of interest this all seems to be beyond all doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Random thread - Theresa May wears boy-lover symbol:

       The global nature of this is truly intimidating is it worth for a moment to look at the bigger picture. Why exactly are all these elites doing this? A few extremely illuminating sources to check out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting at the bottom of the pyramid and working up.
Freemasonry a secret global organisation with a hierarchal power structure and unproclaimed agenda with hundreds of elite members. It cites itself as being a non-political, atheistic organisation. Yet you are refused membership if you are an atheist? It doesn’t matter what religion you believe in, you must just recognise the existence of a deity. Seems slightly contradictory. Is this to ensure the impressionability of its members?
      </p>
      <p>
       The link below illustrates how deeply this organisation has penetrated society and where its real beliefs stem from:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Who’s at the top of the power structure? As the widely held belief states the Rothschilds? Are they cyphoning money from all the worlds central banks. As an exercise I suggest trying to figure out who owns the subsidiary private financing banks. For some reason this critical information is impossible to decipher. Why is every country in the world in debt? Bar a few tiny nations. Who are the private financiers that have the globe by its balls? Why doesn’t the placid public question any of this?  Mind control? Who knows?

       Is the theory that the elites believe in the offering of tortured souls (harvested as an electromagnetic collection) to placate an unnamed machine interdimensional entity stupid? What are they doing at (satanic) cern?

       (Less relevant but mind opening)
      </p>
      <p>
       Has this ritual sacrifice been going on throughout history? Is science and religion more linked than previously thought? Is this all so big that disclosure would ensure the destruction of humanity? Is the science fiction we’re fed star wars, matrix interconnecting force readying us for these concepts?
      </p>
      <p>
       This pedogate has awoken a lot of people to some of these big questions. How do we awaken the mainstream? And what the fuck do we do about it? I don’t think anybody in the establishment will help including the likes of Trump is possibly complicit himself. The powers that be often back both sides of democracy and conflict to ensure victory for their ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again Im not sure if im going mad and getting overloaded with areas and directions to research.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next area to research I believe is a connection between James Alefantis and San Carlo.

       Jimmy Saville ate pizza, and that means the pizza place is guilty too? A bunch of unconnected nonsense. Secret menu items, how the fuck is that about children? Delusional. People don't order children from a pizza shop. Sometimes a butterfly is just a butterfly. International ping pong is not a front for pedophilia. Your "investigation" needs work as it's all worthless garbage. Nice shot at gays too. 
You people want to expose pedophilia you should be investigating Christian churches not pizza places.

      <p>
       The point you make regarding the capitalization of JING tea is valid. This doesn't mean it's not a codeword as I outlined. The word "JING" actually means codeword for fuck sake!

       What shot at gays exactly? I didnt mean the LGBT community are all pedos obviously, theyre movement is being targeted to support and further the pedo rights movement. Their movement is being hijacked.

       Saying they want to add more letters to LGBT is hate. You didn't produce anything to debunk besides you found out Jimmy Saville ate pizza. All this talk about "elite pedo rings" hasn't produced any evidence. Pedogate is any pedophile anywhere now I guess. And it's connected, in your mind anyway. Still haven't produced any evidence that pizza places are involved. Now you are dragging the good name of organized sport of Ping Pong thru the mud too. Satanic Ping Pong no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any victims? Yes secret menu items of course refer to child sex, what else could it possibly mean? Not food that's for sure! Don't quit your day job for that investigator position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't you investigating the Catholic church where pedophilia really does happen? Why do you need a satanic boogeyman? Why not investigate the Boy Scouts who cover it up? Outlaw Motorcycle clubs? African American pimps? You are fixated on elite pedo rings operating in pizza shops, but they don't exist so your mind is making insane connections. Investigate away but there are real innocent people who own and patronize these places, they are only evil pedophiles in your mind. You are "outing" people for the most evil crime when they didn't do anything. How do any of these places get off your suspect list? How do they prove to you they are innocent? People searching for restaurant reviews are going to see your bullshit. Don't act like you are all innocent, you deserve to be attacked. It's one thing to call the queen a reptilian, nothing is going to come of that. But saying an establishment is a cover for child molestation has a very real risk attached to it for the people who own it or work there.

       This is a MASSIVE question. I have introduced about 3 or 4 others to pizzagate. If we can all aim for 10, and tell the people you tell to aim for 10 people too then we might have a way to evade the mainstream propoganda.
