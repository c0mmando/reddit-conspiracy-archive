    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the left rigged the primary, coerced Bernie into supporting them, pushed a fake Russian narrative, had a bunch of really weird conspiracy-food in their leaked emails, pushed a horrible candidate using obvious conspiracy-laden tactics, pushed a candidate from a dynastic family which is a hated thing here, and always has some hidden thing going on in the murky background like ties to the Rothschilds or Soros or weird upside down cross necklaces and shit. Jesus man the opposition to Trump is so dark and fucking ripe for conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Trump is boring. Even the dumb shit he does is right out in the open. The closest thing to a real conspiracy with Trump is his cabinet picks and even those can be described as blatant favoritism. It&#39;s just not interesting.  </p>

<p>What is interesting is that the obvious shill posts and comments never just make a post about something. They instead make posts about <em>why something isn&#39;t posted here</em>. That is what gives them away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying I&#39;m doing this? That I&#39;m a shill? I think it&#39;s pretty obvious I am not.</p>

<p>I get the opposition to trump was ripe for conspiracy, I think people really took advantage of that and that&#39;s why we have trump. Now that we have trump, let&#39;s examine the conspiracies around him. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s boring at all. I mean a real life spy is on the run Bc of information he leaked from russia about trump! That&#39;s undeniably interesting whether or not you believe it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can win power without a soros like figure behind you, we should be asking, who is that for trump?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is an abberation. If he had a Soros behind him, he wouldn&#39;t be getting attacked nonstop the way he is. His power comes from his cronies and his vast resources as a billionaire. His hold on things is tenuous because of this, but it is enough to allow him to maintain pressure on the opposition. As I said, he is just boring and the conspiracies aren&#39;t as interesting to post about. How many posts do we need mentioning that he hired Bannon or that Sessions is anti-pot? It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s clean, it just means once it&#39;s out in the open its not as much fun to pursue.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the left has LOADS of stuff to poke at hidden in the shadows so until they are brought to light there is just more there for a sub like this to talk about.  </p>

<p>r/uncensorednews would be a better place to post about Trump&#39;s evils that everyone already knows about. And no, I wasn&#39;t calling you a shill. I was talking about the shills.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t agree that having a soros like figure behind you protects you from MSM criticism. I mean he grew up surrounded by upper class I&#39;m sure he made SOME friends. And honestly, if you have two soros figures, they can be in battle and then the money protects no one. I mean are we going to pretend Hilary wasn&#39;t attacked during 2016 campaign?

If you believe for one second that PG and Spirit Cooking got as much airtime as the neverending attacks on Bernie and Trump then you are out of your mind. It wasn&#39;t until the very end that they got any traction at all, as she was the golden child of the MSM for 90% of the general and 100% of the primaries. On top of all of the &quot;celebs&quot; with their neverending rambles about how for some reason we should listen to <em>them</em> about terrorists and BLM as they preach from their ivory towers.

A convincing thread on 4chan could have a profound impact on the narrative here on Reddit. Let&#39;s not pretend it didn&#39;t have an impact.

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re completely comparable. PG threads galvanized a huge young voter base into GOP revivalism, old people got bussed.

Developmentally, younger generations have always been progressive, so it makes sense they&#39;d skew liberal, but we also saw a massive surge in GOP support from young people that I could never have predicted, as evidenced by the prevalence of Donald narratives on Reddit and 4chan. They memed him into influence with younger generations, something that never happened with any other GOP candidate, perhaps any candidate ever sans Bernie.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to linger on which influence was more powerful, just trying to point out that there was power behind him. Whether it was truly authentic support from an oddly conservative group of young people, or new media manipulation remains to be seen, but the phenomena is certainly interesting and worth not sweeping under the rug. New media has power, and power usually attracts money. It&#39;s kind of a chicken or the egg thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you just underestimate how bad of a candidate Hillary was when it comes to motivating the youth and why they skewed Bernie -&gt; Trump.  </p>

<p>Typically modern generations are more cynical and able to see through the BS that our older generations bought into because &quot;conspiracy&quot; stuff was always viewed as ridiculous back then. These days we know a lot of that stuff turned out to be true, so now they look at these people sideways. Hillary now and forever will be the reason the Dems lost, alongside the fact that they are a bought and paid for treasonous, corrupt party (the leaders, not the people. well, not all of them.)  </p>

<p>People like Soros are just the reason why she lasted as long as she did, in spite of the fact that many people outright did not like or trust her. People can scream all they want that she won the popular vote. She didn&#39;t win it by a landslide and she should have had it in the bag 100% other than being a suspicious old paper bag of a human whose voice grates on the ears and who is constantly surrounded by fucking scandals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I agree Hilary&#39;s poor appeal hurt the dem party. We&#39;re all biased by our perspectives though. I saw trump as the worst candidate I&#39;ve seen in my life time, the epitome of everything wrong with the upper class. He&#39;s crass, careless, poorly-spoken, lying, corrupt... but somehow people were excited for that? i hate having to think I will one day have to explain to my future children that this guy became president and how. I will emphatically make clear that he is a terrible role model, but that&#39;s the best I could do. :/ But either way, this was a good conversation. Agree to disagree, I don&#39;t think we can really push this much forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That type of pattern does narrow the playing field sometimes.</p>

<p>One way to truly identify a shill is by using empathy and connecting to the energy signature held within the post. </p>

<p>If you are looking too hard you may start to think most the people on reddit are shills. But if you calmly relax and see the tone in the message that is the best way.</p>

<p>The idea is that if they are a shill and are manipulating and pushing a script, their intentions and motivations will be in their aura, so to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. People sometimes think there is something hidden from them. Empathy and intuition are how you find those hidden things. </p>

<p>An easy way to practice observing a shill in action is by watching dick Cheney talk. There is a man who if you connect to with empathy is wicked and manipulative while he is telling you seemingly important and helpful things-Underneath that mask is the real person. So He&#39;s not hidden, either is who he is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes well when a major conspiracy story breaks, such as the president having secret meetings with someone he&#39;s been accused of working for, people tend to go to the subreddit specifically meant for stories such as that.</p>

<p>Why are y&#39;all so shocked that a conspiracy sub suddenly has an increase in viewers whenever a conspiracy esque story breaks?</p>

<p>Oh! Or maybe you&#39;re just paranoid about shills and bots and yadda yadda and anyone who doesn&#39;t suck trumps dick is considered the enemy. Maybe that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>If Susan Rice&#39;s intention was to track down information on Trump associates using foreign intelligence surveillance tools, the law is very clear that she needed a FISA warrant.  Using the unmasking process as an end run around obtaining a FISA warrant is explicitly against the law.</p>

<p>Now the sketchy thing here, in my eyes, is 1. Using Erik prince, relations to mega unqualified devos, he clearly felt indebted to that family, and blackwater is an evil organization.</p>

<p>And 2. Possible violation of the Logan act, trump was not president yet and didn&#39;t have authority to set up these meetings </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree that Erik Prince is sketchy, but from the WaPo report he sounded like the most practical option to represent Trump.  The meeting was arranged by UAE officials, Erik Prince lives in UAE, he was a Trump supporter leading up to the election and his sister is in the cabinet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that invoking the Logan Act is a purely a political red herring.  <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33265.pdf">No one in its 200+ year history has ever been prosecuted under the act (although one person was indicted before charges were dropped),</a> and it was largely ignored until 2015 when it was used to attack a letter to the Iranian government signed by 47 Republican senators.  And the letter only related their opposition to the nuclear deal and the constitutional limits of Obama&#39;s authority to reach a longstanding agreement on behalf of the US government without Senate approval.  The act very well could be unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.  I can&#39;t imagine a case actually being brought under it today, especially one concerning diplomatic communications involving the incoming administration.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your second point regarding Logan act, that&#39;s why I still don&#39;t believe this is enough ammo going forward to end the trump administration. I only meant to point out that there was indeed a legal issue with it.</p>

<p>What irks me ultimately is trumps consistent and unqualified praise of Putin. It&#39;s fine to want to improve relations, but he wouldn&#39;t even shake Merkels hand and yet he talks about how Putin is such a smart guy, and would rather talk down about America than give the guy the criticism he deserves. There is clear favoritism going on, as he&#39;s not politically careful across the board. In fact, many of his supporters would even describe him as a bull in a china shop, that&#39;s his style, and it was held up as one of the positives he brings to the table. Yet when it comes to Putin, he treats putins feelings as if they&#39;re infinitely fragile. It&#39;s just... odd. So that stuff strike a lot of us, and when these secret connections and lies start to surround their relations, it paints a very conspiratorial picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with investigating potential crimes when probable cause exists to justify more intrusive investigative techniques, and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801">knowingly engaging in clandestine intelligence gathering activities on behalf of a foreign power</a> would be a crime.  As would a foreign financial transaction that is punishable under a federal criminal statute.  The FBI absolutely should investigate any and all potential crimes involving Trump associates and apply for the proper warrants if the evidence permits.</p>

<p>However, the constant insinuations in mainstream news outlets that imply illegal Russian interactions without explicit evidence of criminal activity do not strike me as a good faith effort to determine the truth.  They are much more likely a politically motivated effort to deceive.</p>

<p>As for Trump&#39;s comments on Putin, I agree that they could suggest an improper relationship, but they could also be an attempt to manipulate him by reinforcing Putin&#39;s own self-image as a strong and effective leader.  Too much self-pride can be an exploitable weakness, and Putin has a lot of pride in his leadership abilities.  Personally I&#39;m fairly confident that Putin is a sociopath, but to his credit he is very good geopolitical strategist.  Trump&#39;s main strength is his ability to influence people by discerning what truly makes them tick at a subconscious level, and with Putin that appears to be his carefully cultivated strongman persona.</p>

I used to lurk this sub like crazy pre-election, never posted, but left when it became TD pt2. I truly believe all those downvotes u trumpets are getting are just from regular folks like me, who stop by every once in a while to see how you all deal when shit breaks ur narrative. I would love nothing more than to see this community actually engage in discussion about the most interesting and apparent conspiracy that has occurred in my life time, and the discussion here is so disappointing.

<p>If Susan Rice&#39;s intention was to track down information on Trump associates using foreign intelligence surveillance tools, the law is very clear that she needed a FISA warrant.  Using the unmasking process as an end run around obtaining a FISA warrant is explicitly against the law.</p>

<p>This idea, that people who disagree you have to be shills?  Well, it might just be that what you posted was stupid.  Ever think of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democrat have been desperately trying to push the &quot;Trump = Russia&quot; angle in order to cover up the REAL conspiracy &quot;Trump = Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>Democrats think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> people are stupid and will believe anything and have been driven into fits of rage that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t buying their false Russian conspiracy.</p>

<p>So - as Democrats tend to do - they stamp their feet and whine &quot;TRUMP HITLER CONSERVATIVES ALT RIGHT NAZI KKK WHY WONT YOU LISTEN WAAAAAH.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re completely comparable. PG threads galvanized a huge young voter base into GOP revivalism, old people got bussed. We can agree that both affected the votes, and who won? Donald trump. So is it really not comparable when it was clearly effective? I mean we can talk all day about how the cards were stacked in clintons favor, but it clearly wasn&#39;t enough. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re giving new media enough credit for its effectiveness.</p>
