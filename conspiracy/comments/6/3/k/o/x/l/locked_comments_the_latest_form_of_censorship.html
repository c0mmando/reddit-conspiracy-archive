       Lately I've noticed that, when a post starts drawing a lot of emotional comments, the mods respond by locking the comments section.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/63hduh/nyc_uber_passenger_threatens_to_falsely_accuse/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">
        Here is one example
       </a>
       (currently on the front page at #4.)
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of douchebag move is this anyways? So we're only allowed to express ourselves when everyone is doing so in an acceptable manner. Not calm and polite = not allowed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone doesn't like it when people say what they're really thinking? Locking the comments section doesn't change people's attitudes, it does nothing to promote tolerance either. What it does do is keep people's feelings bottled up and makes them even more resentful about being told they can't have their say.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one more example of trading away free speech to protect a small minority of people from "having their feelings hurt".

       In october 1, 2016 the internet's core has been moved from america to geneva, which allows further censorship. And CERN is in Geneva and it invented the internet, NOT the US millitary. So it has been came home to roost and it is a trap to see how the public thinks and to control it when the time comes.

        The internet isn't a singular 'thing' machine of piece of software, in the same way that a neuron in your head isn't the brain. You can lose a few thousand of them with no noticable effect, same with the internet and computers.

       Though ICANN could have shut down some of the more egregious "fake news," and probably would have if it was still under US control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that personally, I never came across "fake news" prior to the election. I've seen mountains of it in the aftermath. I don't think it's coincidental that the rise of "fake news" coincides with the US relinquishing direct control over the registry of domain names.

       To be fair, I don't get as many work emails in a week as some of these threads get in a couple hours, and dealing with those actually makes me money.  I've also been a moderator on forums in the past, and yes "fuck this shit, I'm not dealing with this today" is a valid response for a volunteer moderator.

       I do expect to be able to say what I want. I'm so fucking tired of this pansy bitch ass excuse that "reddit is private so they can control what you say". It's a fucking apology for someone attacking our right to express ourselves.

       And that's just it. Why should I have to think of what people are saying in terms of dirty or clean? I like it when someone gets mad and says exactly what the fuck they think. It's even better when they use the nastiest possible language to do so. I'd take one page of racist, sexist, homophobic honesty over a whole website full of politically correct pussies any fucking day.

       To me, Free Speech is like being pregnant. Either it's there or it isn't... there's no in between. As soon as you accept the idea that you can say what you like, but only in certain circumstances... you no longer have free speech.

       Reddit, as a corporation, might be privately owned and run for profit. But the internet itself is a portal. It should be seen as a form of public space. I really hope someone makes a legal challenge to this subversive concept... and the sooner the better.

       You can, and it largely is. You're free to register a website at any time, to say whatever the hell you want. Here, you can even create your own subs. Call one "/Obi's_Freedom" and allow anything and everything. It may turn into a convoluted shithole, but it's free..

       Ideologically I get what you mean, and would agree, but it's not very realistic in practice here.. on reddit.

       I too believe it often goes a bit far, but find it impossible to consider things being a wide open playground here. A line has to be drawn, somewhere. Who draws that line, and to what extent, is another level of discussion. Still, some sort of framework and expectations must be in place to maintain order in a sub. The site as a whole, especially defaults (where it concerns polarizing social and/or political fervor) is almost too large of a beast to tackle. Go against the grain too loudly in those woods, and you'll be shut right the fuck down. I know that. Far too many interests at play there.
