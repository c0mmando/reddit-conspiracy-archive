       Taxation is completely unnecessary. The government creates all money.

       Banks create money out of thin air and loan it to the government at interest. The government is given the unassignable right to create money by our Constitution but they gave that right to the bankers. If government created the money as they are supposed to and spent it into circulation, then there would be need for taxes.

       The percent the public agrees to pay without rioting.  Is it Theft when you willingly pay it?  My cable bill was $120 which I thought was outrageous then I found the fire stick and I no longer have a cable bill.  I don't like taxes, but what I dislike more are people who sit at home abusing the system.  Like some people join the military for 4 years claim ptsd without being deployed And get 50-80 percent pay for life paid for by your taxes.  There are welfare scams Medicare scams.  Trump promised to cut down on this but we shall see.

       Do you drive a car and use roads built with tax dollars?  Would you rather pay a toll for each road or is it easier for the government to take care of those things.  I don't understand the argument of absolutely no taxation because the government as a function can be good if run in a way beneficial to the people but in all cases corruption of people has led to the government declining this doesn't mean that having a government is necessarily bad, and the government functions on taxes therefore if you use anything provided by the government without paying then you see the value a government can bring its people.  Don't blame an institution that doesn't run itself for the humans that have made the institution evil by their mismanagement if that institution

       I agree it wasn't a good comparison, but options and choice aren't super important in all cases payment.

      <p>
       You don't always choose to go to the hospital, but if you wake up in the Emergency Room, you're paying the bill even though you may not have had the option of not going. Because you received a service that requires payment to exist.

       That's kind of what the thread is about.  How much taxation is necessary.  How much does the government really need from us to do the basics of governing.  Not the huge,  bloated waste that it has become,  but what is actually needed.

       That's the problem. What you consider a necessary government function, someone else considers bloat, and what you consider to be bloat, others will consider necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might consider a public welfare system to be bloat and defense to be necessary, while I consider defense to be bloat and welfare necessary.

       Yes they are. No one forces you to earn an income or buy products. You chose to earn an income and buy products with that income.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could always leave. There are many countries with much lower tax burdens (including mine), no one is forcing you to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
       You choose to stay and reap the benefits of living in your country, and as such you agree to abide by its laws. One of them is that you pay your fair share of taxes.

       Then don't pay taxes in protest no one is forcing you to pay them.  Willingly means you have freedom of will to do or not do it, since you don't agree with what is being done with the taxes you can not pay them at all or migrate to another country or go live in the woods where hopefully no one bothers you.

       100% taxation is not theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a sales tax of 100% would mean that a product being sold for $1 would cost the buyer $2. It would suck, but it is not theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theft is the unlawful deprivation of property. Tax is not unlawful and thus by definition is not theft. It's that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not like it, but tax is a lawful means of gaining revenue for a government.
