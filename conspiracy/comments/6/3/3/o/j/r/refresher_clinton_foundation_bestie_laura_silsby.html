    <div class="md"><p>My bad, I actually thought I was in t_d when I read your post... </p>

<p>I do kinda agree with you about t_d... But I&#39;m still glad it exists, it serves a very important purpose for those like myself, who support Trump (I am not a Trump fanatic though, I support him, but I don&#39;t always agree with him). r/conspiracy has much more interesting and relevant content though.</p>

<p>My opinion is that t_d is mostly entertainment,  with news and events sprinkled in. r/conspiracy is where I come for serious news and critical thought. I don&#39;t always believe everything I read in this sub though. It serves as offering another perspective, often different from that of the MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did not realize their base is pro-pedo.  That is a lazy smear.  Pizzagate is anti-partisan; it corrodes partisan identification because it <em>overrides</em> partisan identification.  Nobody&#39;s base is pro-pedo, not even Hillary Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>Have you read Trance-Formation of America?  It&#39;s by Cathy O&#39;Brien, and it&#39;s about MK-ULTRA from the perspective of someone who suffered it.  People who take this shit seriously throw their partisanship overboard and start taking up <em>any</em> candidate who will undermine the depraved systems of social control that rule over us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just got yourself confused. Whether pizza gate is bipartisan or not, (which your right, it is, same as russia using trump) that&#39;s not what I was talking about. I was talking about TD reaction to it. And how it was obsessive to the point of obviously outing itself. &quot;He who smelt it dealt it&quot; as my grandma used to say. When Milo tape of pro pedo in religion came out (disturbing to listen to that justification) TD backed him, lost, then slowed down on the pedo propaganda. Simple timeline. Not a smear. It&#39;s good that TD is more focused. Not sure how that&#39;s a bad thing in your eyes. </p>

But if you wanted to look something up and find the loose ends that no one is paying any attention to then maybe you could give me a logical explanation being that you like logic and all. All I am saying is that for all the incredible claims that people are making (which I believe for the most part through my independent research, although I do understand how hard they can be to swallow) there are no answers.

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s not exactly true. After the earthquake she was caught trafficking over 30 children, attempting to remove them from the country, which is a big deal. We can&#39;t take minors across state lines in the US, much less to other countries. Furthermore, a majority of the children were not actually orphans.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying she didn&#39;t do anything stupid, or criminal. Someone asked for a realistic explanation, and I gave one. OP only stated this woman was arrested on child trafficking charges, and is now a higher up with Amber Alert. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough information, and I&#39;d go as far as saying it&#39;s deceptive and intellectually dishonest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree OP wasn&#39;t perfect, but your explanation is too whitewashed in the other direction.</p>

<p>I&#39;d contend that it&#39;s dishonest not to mention that she was trying to take the kids out of the country, that she had been warned previously, and that many of the children had families looking for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t include those details. What I think is important though is to demonstrate intent. Is she trying to hurt children, or help them - and which one of those two possibilities is the reason she is currently working for Amber Alert?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what more you want though. She knew that she was breaking the law, a law that is in place to protect children. We will never know what she intended to do with the children, but for some reason she thought it was okay to circumvent a very serious law in the aftermath of a disaster, and her actions could have permanently separated children from their families. The fact that she was warned shows further disregard, and some would contend that it is compelling evidence that her intent was malicious. </p>

<p>IMO At the very least she should never work in any capacity with a company that exists to protect children, because she has proven herself to be at the very least woefully irresponsible and negligent to such a degree that it could have destroyed lives and permanently destroyed families.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from Wikipedia but if you go to the incident you will see that it is well sourced.</p>

<p>&quot;On January 26, the group gathered forty children and set off for the Dominican Republic. They were stopped by a policeman, who explained that their actions were illegal. [8] [9]&quot;</p>

<p>This shows they knew what they were doing was illegal and they had been warned.</p>

<p>&quot;On the night of January 29, the missionaries were arrested while trying to cross the Dominican border without proper authorization. They denied any wrongdoing and maintained that they were doing God&#39;s will by helping orphaned victims of the quake. [12] The children were sent to the SOS Children&#39;s Village orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, and it became clear that most (if not all) of them were not orphans.[13] NLCR missionaries maintained that they were told that the children were orphaned. In turn, people in Calebasse and SOS Children&#39;s Villages accused the missionaries of lying about their intentions.[10][13] Although the children&#39;s relatives were told that they would be able to visit them and eventually take them back, the NLCR&#39;s mission statement clearly outlined plans for adoption.[1][10]&quot;</p>

<p>This shows that they knew the children were not orphans and lied to authorities. Then subsequent interviews show that they misled poor families after a disaster, convincing them to give up their children for adoption in the US but telling them they would be able to see/retrieve them. Its pretty twisted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s illegal to take other peoples kids without the permission of the parent anywhere.  Don&#39;t even have to involve state lines.  I was trying to figure out why such an obvious statement was even in there when it didn&#39;t add anything to the point.  We already know what she did was against the law, the debate is about if she did it with nefarious intent or if she was trying to help out the kids.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it was just context. The way the post was written by the original commenter; &quot;taken to an orphanage after the earthquake in Haiti.&quot; Is a misleading statement because a reader wouldn&#39;t know that they were being taken out of the country. And the grammar actually does make it sound like the orphanage and earthquake were in Haiti. Its a very important detail, not down the street or across town or to an aid camp nearby, but to another country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy was asked to provide a logical alternative to the narrative the OP of this topic posted.  The topic of this thread is this lady trying to take kids illegally over the border and different interpretations of why she was doing that.  You don&#39;t have to post all the details of an article or topic again and again when discussing it.  Especially something so obvious, it makes people confused that you are referring to something they missed.</p>

<p>Like in my case, I interpreted the question he was asked as what other reasons could this lady have had to take these kids and go over the border with them.  He provided one, and then you came back with the comment that in the US you can&#39;t take minors across state lines much less another country.  That confused me, because it is such basic common sense in the US that you can&#39;t take a minor anywhere without a parent&#39;s consent that I didn&#39;t know if you were referring to something specific or not.  Hence the question I asked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will  play devil&#39;s advocate becuas . Why not</p>

<p>What if she was down in haite doing what she thought was best for the kids ? Maybe she genuinely trying to effect positive change in the world perhaps she thought the kids were in danger their? Or prehaps she was a patsy and got played herself in that lil incedent?</p>

<p>Now what if she later in life wants to dictance her self from said incident maybe she relized how bad it looked or was just in over her head.  So why not a fresh start? Name change.</p>

<p>But what about work ?i still am very passionate about and  want to defend the inoccense of children she says to herself. How can i help at risk kids here in the states?  Working for Amber alert will redeem me and fill the void inside my bleeding hart. She thinks to her self.</p>

<p>Im just spit balling here and think proper investigations are much needed i also understand thous are hard to come buy these days while the second Red Scare ensuses. </p>

<p>This exactly. The parents could&#39;ve definitely had the best intentions in mind for their children, when giving them up to Laura, but she then proceeded to lie to authorities about several different aspects of her being there, the children&#39;s destination, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over a decade ago, are we suppose to hold peoples past over them because of some dumb shit they have said or done? Pussygate is beyond stupid, and unless Trump killed someone or has actual proof of raping someone I could care less. Dirty campaign strategies are all about finding or making up dirt about someone. The fact that all the rape accusations against trump came out two weeks before election day, and that they were all debunked within hours speaks volumes about that cunt Hillary&#39;s failed strategy. If there is hard proof I would love to see it. I remain on the skeptical side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes curious ms laura silsby. I believe she is a victim of the gladio program of the CIA. They infiltrate and trick good willed folks into commiting crimes for them. Sometimes unwillingly, usually by showing manufactured evidence and emotional manipulation. I sometimes wonder if she knew though. The other prisoners seemed to hint at that. </p>

<p>Honestly people do good work over there all the time. Our media has never cared. It only started to care when it affected the dirty deeds of those in control of the system in my opinion. I believe laura just &quot;knew&quot; she would be fine was because she knows how corrupt it really is. But cannot rule out useful idiot either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really sure yet. I think it&#39;s too early to tell since it&#39;s barely been a month since the EO was signed. He said he wants to bring the “full force and weight” of the U.S. government to combat an “epidemic” of human trafficking and also said the issue is “not talked about enough.” </p>

<p>My overall point is that this is a good thing that he should receive some validation for, regardless of whether or not we care to attribute all (or even some) of the arrests to him. </p>

<p>The following outside organizations are currently assisting with the operations with more organizations being brought into the fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</li>
<li>International Justice Mission</li>
<li>Thorn: Tech Innovation to Fight Child Sexual Exploitation, co-founded by Ashton Kutcher (you might remember him speaking in front of Congress earlier this year)</li>

<p>there was a report that he hung out with the same guy Bill Clinton did. </p>

<p>If you mean Epstein, there were allegations of more than hanging out :</p>

<p>&quot;In the most recent suit, Trump&#39;s accuser asserted that while she was exploring a modeling career in 1994, she attended a series of parties at the Manhattan home of prominent investor Jeffrey Epstein. She alleges that during those parties the real estate mogul tied her to a bed and raped her. She also claimed Epstein raped her during that series of gatherings&quot;</p>

<p>There is a clear word gafuffle with all this pizza terminology, because you say that you aren&#39;t a pizzagater, whereas I consider Laura Silsby a large part of what makes &#39;pizzagate&#39; real. I feel &#39;pizzagate&#39; has become the blanket term for govt sponsored pedophilia.</p>

<p>Lets not forget that what&#39;s more damning than kids in the pool in these emails, is that it shows Clinton correspondence with Silsby for like 14 years.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more that it&#39;s raised awareness and shed light on the issue of child trafficking. Yes, there were people talking about it for a long time James Corbett, Sibel Edmonds, Ted Gunthrie, etc... but it had never been pushed into the limelight with such force. And if pizzagate ends up being true, it&#39;s likely just a small piece in much larger puzzle. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Direct evidence;
Direct evidence is evidence which, if credited by the fact finder, will resolve a factual issue without requiring the fact finder to draw any inferences, i.e. a witness testifies that he saw the defendant put a gun in a store cashier’s face, and heard the defendant say “this is a stick-up.” is direct evidence that the defendant committed a robbery.</p></li>
<li><p>Circumstantial evidence:
Circumstantial evidence is evidence which, even if credited by the fact finder, will not resolve a factual issue. Circumstantial evidence requires the fact finder to draw inferences in order to reach a conclusion about a disputed matter. Like other kinds of evidence, circumstantial evidence must be both material and probative of the proposition it is offered to prove. For example, the cashier testifies that someone that she cannot identify pointed a gun at her face and said “this is a stick-up” and took $325. A police officer testifies that he arrested the defendant later the same day that the cashier stated that the robbery occurred, and the defendant had $325 in his pocket.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since you must draw an inference that: Flynn spoke to the Russians therefore he must have been colluding and by extension the Trump campaign. Thus circumstantial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn was a member of the Trump campaign and administration. Flynn had unsanctioned and secret meetings with Russian ambassadors. This is 100% direct evidence of, in your words, &quot;this Russian thing&quot; and is equivalent to your example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a witness testifies that he saw the defendant put a gun in a store cashier’s face, and heard the defendant say “this is a stick-up.” is direct evidence that the defendant committed a robbery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above of course, is in your words &quot; in unfortunate CIRCUMSTANCE&quot; but clearly not &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;. Your weird double think is super apparent when you write stuff like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>His only wrong doing</strong> is not disclosing it to his superiors and working as an official of the US before he was confirmed by the senate. It&#39;s an unfortunate CIRCUMSTANCE but <strong>not evidence of wrong doing</strong>. </p>

<p>Many of us think that the name choice of &quot;pizzagate&quot; was a mistake because it makes it seem like it all revolves around pizza and specifically one location in DC. That&#39;s never been what pizzagate was about, but the name stuck. Pizzagate is PEDOGATE. And what you describe is exactly what pedogate is. A massive ring of people in power who use sex with children as leverage, blackmail material, and incentives to enhance and maintain their power. </p>

<p>The most horrific thing to happen on this planet since the second world war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her defense was she was taking them to an orphanage that didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>She told the police the children were orphans, but most of them had families.</p>

<p>Silsby went to communities devastated by the earthquake and put on the hard sell for her imaginary orphanage.  One family member said she showed them a brochure.  Of an orphanage?  If so, which one?  Hers didn&#39;t exist, so was it of another orphanage?  An artist&#39;s rendering?</p>

<p>Silsby and Co. were arrested with 33 children, some as young as 2 years old.</p>

<p>So these 10 missionaries were just going to &quot;wing it&quot;, with no orphanage and 33 children (some as young as 2), until they got settled and got the paperwork in order?</p>

<p>If you believe that, I&#39;ve got a bridge to sell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never read anything about the authorities saying Silsby &amp; Co were converting a hotel into an orphanage.  </p>

<p>Silsby/her lawyer might have said it, but that doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<p>Did this imaginary orphanage ever open under new management?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ignorance of bureaucracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a complete mischaracterization, and a complete lie.  Silsby claimed she had the paperwork but just hadn&#39;t submitted it.</p>

<p>With something like this, ignorance isn&#39;t mere ignorance.</p>

<p>Also, Silsby was stopped before, with 40 kids, and was warned the day before she was arrested that she would be arrested if she tried to cross the border with children.</p>

<p>She was the direct opposite of ignorant of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>On top of this, it&#39;s not really a thing to be less than sure about, is it?  It&#39;s not &quot;I wonder what the speed limit is on this road&quot;.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about taking kids from families and out of the flippin&#39; country.  It&#39;s not something you make up as you go along.</p>

<p>At the very least, it&#39;s incredibly bizarre.  Almost as bizarre as someone trying to claim with absolute certainty that Silsby was a misguided saint who just got ahead of herself.</p>

<p>Also, if you fucks were actually concerned about child sex trafficking, you wouldn&#39;t be attacking Ashton Kutcher and his amazing efforts at exposing sex rings, but the moment he spoke out about Trump&#39;s travel ban (because his wife was a refugee)  /conspiracy&#39;s narrative tried to convince subscribers that he&#39;s a pedo too.</p>

<p>Instead you guys push this stupid B.S. that is continually fought and shown to be misleading (at best, often outright made up). </p>

The two stories reinforced his popularity, and a bunch of news personalities and radio jockies all talked about him for a week or two.</p>

<p>Honestly, his testimony was the first time I had thought of him as anything other than an actor. Now I&#39;m having trouble seeming him as anything other than a force for good. Dude is intelligent and passionate, and apparently knows how to staff good and competent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean where&#39;s the proof? There&#39;s more than enough circumstantial evidence. There&#39;s more evidence that the Russians collaborated with Trump than there is evidence that Trump wipes his ass from back to front. Both of these things are ridiculous yet there is enough funny shit to bring a doubt in most peoples minds. If Hillary is a child rapist than shes a lot better at hiding the connections than Trump is at hiding his connections to Russia.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Hillary supporter, I know she did shitty things but she didn&#39;t get elected. Why don&#39;t you try and focus on someone who is actually responsible for your country? Seriously, I&#39;d rather have a child kidnapper for President than someone who is possibly being pulled by some strings. Don&#39;t you see the difference? One of them can be manipulated to go against the interests of their own country while the other one is just looking after their libido by kidnapping kids. I&#39;m coming from a completely pragmatic viewpoint if you had to choose between two evils.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Intentions of the parents don&#39;t justify the actions of Laura.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exactly. The parents could&#39;ve definitely had the best intentions in mind for their children, when giving them up to Laura, but she then proceeded to lie to authorities about several different aspects of her being there, the children&#39;s destination, etc...</p>

<p>If she had verifiably good intentions she wouldn&#39;t need to lie to get the kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly (from browsing the pizzahate sub when it existed), the lady was working with parents to get kids out of the country. Not exactly kidnapping, though they were doing it illegally. The sub had a hardon for her, but every thread about it seemed to devolve into people looking into it and saying why the fuck is this attached to pizzagate. Not surprised OP said he was drunk while posting this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He testified before Congress a little over a month ago about his new program that had been running for about 6 months and was showing amazing results, and also was very articulate in his public criticism of Trump&#39;s Ban EO around the same time. The two stories reinforced his popularity, and a bunch of news personalities and radio jockies all talked about him for a week or two.</p>

<p>Honestly, his testimony was the first time I had thought of him as anything other than an actor. Now I&#39;m having trouble seeming him as anything other than a force for good. Dude is intelligent and passionate, and apparently knows how to staff good and competent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">article</a> about the Russia counter-intelligence strategy from an author that I absolutely loathe. Despite how much I hate him, its a very informative article. Also its not from this election cycle so you can&#39;t blame it on &quot;biased media.&quot;</p>

<p>You have to be joking if you think the Russians aren&#39;t pragmatists who will use every advantage they can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really sure yet. I think it&#39;s too early to tell since it&#39;s barely been a month since the EO was signed. He said he wants to bring the “full force and weight” of the U.S. government to combat an “epidemic” of human trafficking and also said the issue is “not talked about enough.” </p>

<p>My overall point is that this is a good thing that he should receive some validation for, regardless of whether or not we care to attribute all (or even some) of the arrests to him. </p>

<p>The following outside organizations are currently assisting with the operations with more organizations being brought into the fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</li>
<li>International Justice Mission</li>
<li>Thorn: Tech Innovation to Fight Child Sexual Exploitation, co-founded by Ashton Kutcher (you might remember him speaking in front of Congress earlier this year)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s very odd that this hasn&#39;t been bigger news, imo.</p>
