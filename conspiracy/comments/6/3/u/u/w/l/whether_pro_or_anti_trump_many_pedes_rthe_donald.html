       Another 9/11, a hard hit to the U.S. and maybe the super brainwashed population would buy it. I don't think this gassing is going to have their desired effect.

       Hasn't the government been killing directly or indirectly tens of thousands for the past few years. I just don't understand why using chemical weapons rather than conventional weapons is treated so vastly different.

       If the same amount of people had been killed by a bomb, there would be no big stories on it.

       It's the way people die in the attacks.  If you're bombed there's a good chance you die in the explosion.  If not, you suffer wounds.  It's also relatively localised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical attacks target the nervous system.  They cause unimaginable pain from the inside causing convulsions, muscle spasms, system shutdown, etc.  Way, way worse.  Chemicals are also spread by the wind so there's a high probability it affects unintended targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you really need someone to spell out why chemical weapons are worse then comventional?

       Yeah and besides the fact that it's crazy painful, gas attacks can serve another purpose. Usually (in WW1) it would have been used to clear combatants from an area without destroying the surrounding buildings and roadways. Of course by spraying a gas cloud over a city, you kill a lot more than just combatants. In reality it's the perfect weapon.

       The bad thing is..do they really need the desired effect? They can just do whatever they want. If protests start to happen then just had some false flag happen at home to get everyones mind focused elsewhere. The ppl who plan this shit have some of the best psychologists on the planet with decades full of data and studies showing how to keep the masses submissive.

       Right? Ummm that's congress? But I will concede he could have vetoed. However all it did was remove a regulation. It was not a new law it was a motion to remove a regulation. And honestly I might rather have my ISP collect my info where I can say no you can't sell it rather than Google being the only data collector

       Yea, the way I see it is, Trump could do something, but I have no doubt the man has so much shit on his plate right now that he's focusing on some more critical things right now. I think this is where people cant be open minded about it. When something bad happens most are gonna jump to conclusions instead of thinking logically.

       We are being told believe 2 things without much evidence. That Syria gassed their own people at a time it makes the least sense geopolitically. And that Donald Trump is absolutely going to start a war over there because of it.
      </p>

       I think I am going to reserve judgement, I am highly skeptical of both of those conclusions.

       In any case, it's not happening. The generals refused to go along with Obama when he ordered them to support ISIS and try to overthrow Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump ordered it, and it meant going to war with Russia, there is a distinct possibility of a (well-justified) military coup.

       It wasn't just the generals. The public lit the phones of congress on fire as well. Obama was straight pissed about it too. I don't feel like people are as aware of the danger right now as they were back then.

       And I have decided that whoever is behind the desire to oust Assad is not going to stop trying to take him down. If we manage to make it through this episode, there will be another. Can't imagine who it could possibly be!

       It seems like it's the military industrial complex. We all know that bombing more people in the Middle East probably isn't the solution.

       So we've been in a constant state of emergency? like yo there just so happened to be a President who got ousted for being in cahoots with people who freaking call themselves gods man. I really wouldn't be surprised if those same people were doing the same here.

       Well if that was your reasons for letting trump win then you got played hard. Even if Trump is a Russian insider the amount of stuff the DEMs keep bringing up may force him to lash out to dispel the threats so he can stay in power.

       It doesn't matter what she was calling for.  Soviet proxy wars never lead to war, neither would have no-fly zones in Syria.

       when he gets criticized for it?  Trump does that.

       Clinton does not.  People attack "flip flopping" but if the experts told her it would be a dumb idea, she would have walked back on it instead of walking us all off a cliff.

       establishing a no fly zone entails bombing strategically placed ground to air missiles (syrian controlled) which are located in highly populated civilian cities to deter such action. to attack those targets would kill TONS of innocents and would only give ISIS more recruits.

       Honestly, I was amazed at the number of comments and their respective upvotes across various threads last night saying how they're done with Trump if he gets us involved in Syria.

       I'm right there with them.

       Not all of TD is made of republicans it's a lot of classic liberals and former bernie supporters aswell. A lot of us support trump because he could be the one to fight the establishment. If he's not we will proceed to drop him like a rock. Just look at the massive amount of posts on TD regarding Syria everyone doesn't want to go to war. We all know this is a bullshit false flag by the deep state it's pretty obvious.

       Bernie voters went as much for Trump as Bush voters went for Hillary.

       Bernie supporter here.  You're talking out your ass about something you have no clue about.  When I joined T_D (before the election) there were multiple posts a day from people like me renouncing the dems and joining team Trump.

       As far as the T_D being a safe space, do you not understand it's a subreddit dedicated to one man?  Try shitting on Brendan Frasier in his sub and see how long it takes to get banned.  You want to have an honest discussion about Trump go to r/askthedonald.

       He hasn't backed away from many promises I see this all the time you sir obviously watch to much legacy media. I'm not gonna stick with trump if he pulls some bullshit neither will a large majority of his base. We are all very well aware of deep state trying to start war and we are not for it.

       You didn't read the lobbying ban, it actually weakened many provisions and doesn't do anything to stop influence. He also has picked Wall St bankers and his own relatives, aka nepotism. How is draining a swamp?

       It seems you are projecting about being embarrassed. Sorry facts don't care about your emotions.

       You didn't debunk anything hahahahaha.  Are you really that naive and brainwashed?

       Hell, you ignored 90% of my post and even the ones you did respond to you can't back up.

       Trump said he'd have a plan to beat ISIS. He doesn't. If you think he does then post it!
      </p>
      <p>
       You said he's draining the swamp and he had his relatives at top posts and bankers in others. Would you be fine if Hillary chose bankers and Chelsea to be top advisors? Nah, you'd be losing your mind.

       Sorry if facts trigger you. But one day you're going to wake up and realize you were duped by a snake oil salesman

       It's really not a mixed bunch though. They only removed the "No dissent" rule recently I believe. For months the only posts that were allowed were 100% blind support, in fact, I'm sure that if I were to criticize Trump there right now I'd catch a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any criticism was met with a ban and accusations of concern trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an echo chamber by design. Those "as a former Bernie supporter.." are mostly trolls too.

       Member how the pedes came out as against the ISP privacy bill around the time the senate passed it? They've been deathly silent about it since Trump signed off on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When/If Trump does go to war, will the pedes continue to toe the line?

       the real conspiracy at t_d is that supporters are saying 'no war' and  mods are removing posts at crazy rates to suppress this idea as 'anti-trump'

       Bernie supporter here.  You're talking out your ass about something you have no clue about.  When I joined T_D (before the election) there were multiple posts a day from people like me renouncing the dems and joining team Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even moreso after the Wiki dumps showed how bad Bernie got screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep whining about the bogus popular vote and popularity polls though, it's a great fantasy world for you to feel safe in.
