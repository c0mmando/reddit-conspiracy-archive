Obama begged and fucking begged Congress to act. And they were like &quot;yeah, sure, we&#39;ll do it...tomorrow...yeah...tomorrow...&quot;</p>

<p>quote:But having made my decision as Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I&#39;m also mindful that I&#39;m the President of the world&#39;s oldest constitutional democracy. I&#39;ve long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve made a second decision: I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people&#39;s representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>Over the last several days, we&#39;ve heard from members of Congress who want their voices to be heard. I absolutely agree. So this morning, I spoke with all four congressional leaders, and they&#39;ve agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session. -Obama Aug 13, 2013</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope... it all started here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks</a></p>

<p>and then here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clark#Book_on_modern_wars">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clark#Book_on_modern_wars</a></p>

<p>When the US government chose to use the Sept 11 attack (assuming they didn&#39;t play a part in that attack) as justification for launching several wars of aggression against nations that had nothing at all to do with that attack, they set in motion the chain of events that lead us here.</p>

<p>If, where we are now leads to WW3, then that plan will be the cause of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are saying that the we should &quot;help&quot; out Syrian people this means military ntervention. Before this , when Trump said he wasn&#39;t gonna intervene the front page was filled with articles saying he&#39;s Putin&#39;s puppet and letting &quot;dictators win&quot;.</p>

<p>They are brainwashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, glad to see people saying this. I probably got the wrong impression because I saw there a lot of criticism when Trump said he&#39;ll not be going over Syria, people saying he was a Russian puppet etc. this is something we should all be united fighting against</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could anyone help me remember if we&#39;re still involved in Afghanistan and Iraq? I remember there was a general who said around the time of 9/11 that we were going to be involved militarily with 7 countries (I forget the exact ones but I believe Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria are three of them), maybe this will put our involvement in Syria from a proxy war to flat out war. (Also if I&#39;m not accurate on any of this please let me know, I&#39;m not entirely sure I am)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US can&#39;t do an Iraq 2.0.  You see how successful the US campaign was with the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  What do you think the US would accomplish if the US military invaded Syria? What outcome?  Would the outcome be &quot;Iraq 2.0&quot;?  So why would the US invade?  You have to really think it through; some of these OP&#39;s need to be thought out more before posting. </p>
