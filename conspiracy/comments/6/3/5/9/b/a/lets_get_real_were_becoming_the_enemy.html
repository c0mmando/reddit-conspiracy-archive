       Fellow truth seekers, I just want to write this since I don't give two shits about most anything at this very moment. But tonight it hit me; we are on our own. I mean although we are being validated by disclosures on the daily, the mainstream narrative is only growing stronger against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a warning to prepare your defenses. I'm not advocating for further division from society. I'm just saying that now is the time to figure out who your real friends are; and come up with a personal plan for a worst case scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not into fear mongering either. But it's on us to remember to be realistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will keep waking up. But those that don't will keep falling victim to the increasingly aggressive mainstream narrative. 'Conspiracy theorists' will be cognitively merged with the 'enemy'. Unless something changes, there will soon come a time when we become targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not trying to be dramatic. And you're free to disagree with what I've said. But don't be naive...the harsh reality is things would be easier for TPTB if we were all behind bars or dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why wouldn't they be working towards that?

       Still, I don't disagree. It's always been this way, to a degree. What I'm saying is not to forget we're getting closer on the radar.

       It was incredibly cathartic for me to learn that one of the greatest fight scenes in cinema history is a metaphor for the struggle woke people go through in trying to wake up their closest friends.

       That is a great metaphor. The fight lasts a really long time, and the guy just keeps refusing to put the glasses on. It's like when you show someone evidence of something, like a conspirscy, and they just refuse to open their eyes.

Hoping to get a few people to youtube it and raise questions.
If you have chrome, press F12, click on console and paste the code in the attached link. Press enter. It'll begin placing pixels...

       Yeah, been trying to tell you something....The Ocean. Such a vast, deep, and mysterious place. So mysterious, in fact, that all the knowledge of sailors past and present still only adds up to a tiny fraction of what is really out there, the very tip of the iceberg. The ocean possesses many strange unknowns, still to be discovered and learned. 
(Here is a glimpse into one of them)

       There has been some speculation on 4chan that April 3rd (today) will be some major happenings. Time will tell, but if shit starts to go south then our community really needs to stick together. The great thing about this country is that the populace is armed to the teeth and outnumber TPTB immensely. We can definitely win this.

       Do you have an idea on what could possibly happen? Also is this from the post from a while back where someone said to not go on 4chan from a particular date and some time in April something was going to happen?

       The one saying not to go on 4chan after March 15th and that happenings would occur on April 3rd were from someone claiming to be FBIanon, but the posts that they are focusing on right now are from someone they call JapAnon. This guy has come into quite a few threads with quite a few IP proxies speaking a few different languages, and he was apparently an investigator who looked into 9/11 and posted some pictures that weren't able to be reverse searched about the investigation. From what I gather on this, it may be an elaborate LARP, but he seems to be alluding to having concrete evidence coming forward linking mossad to 9/11, and possibly posting it around 12-1pm EST today. We'll see what happens with it.

       He did another one I can't find that asked people if Hillary ran to push for sharia law would that be a good platform and they said yes! Wtf? What are we doing to America? At least conspiracy theorists push for the truth and that's what scares them.

       As long as the majority disbelieves, they aren't too worried. Most people are followers. They can just point at the clowns among us and say, look how stupid that group is. If there aren't enough clowns they can easily make them. (see flat earth)
