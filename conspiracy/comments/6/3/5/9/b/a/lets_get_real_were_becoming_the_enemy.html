        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fellow truth seekers, I just want to write this since I don&#39;t give two shits about most anything at this very moment. But tonight it hit me; we are on our own. I mean although we are being validated by disclosures on the daily, the mainstream narrative is only growing stronger against us. </p>

<p>This is a warning to prepare your defenses. I&#39;m not advocating for further division from society. I&#39;m just saying that now is the time to figure out who your real friends are; and come up with a personal plan for a worst case scenario. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not into fear mongering either. But it&#39;s on us to remember to be realistic.</p>

<p>People will keep waking up. But those that don&#39;t will keep falling victim to the increasingly aggressive mainstream narrative. &#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; will be cognitively merged with the &#39;enemy&#39;. Unless something changes, there will soon come a time when we become targets.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to be dramatic. And you&#39;re free to disagree with what I&#39;ve said. But don&#39;t be naive...the harsh reality is things would be easier for TPTB if we were all behind bars or dead. </p>

<p>So why wouldn&#39;t they be working towards that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one saying not to go on 4chan after March 15th and that happenings would occur on April 3rd were from someone claiming to be FBIanon, but the posts that they are focusing on right now are from someone they call JapAnon. This guy has come into quite a few threads with quite a few IP proxies speaking a few different languages, and he was apparently an investigator who looked into 9/11 and posted some pictures that weren&#39;t able to be reverse searched about the investigation. From what I gather on this, it may be an elaborate LARP, but he seems to be alluding to having concrete evidence coming forward linking mossad to 9/11, and possibly posting it around 12-1pm EST today. We&#39;ll see what happens with it.</p>
