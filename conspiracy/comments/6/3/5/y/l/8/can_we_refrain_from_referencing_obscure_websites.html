    <div class="md"><p>A nice idea in theory, but the fact of the matter is that there&#39;s coincidentally been a strong push by the mods to have nonsense like the Daily Mail promoted here.  If you look at the posting histories of some mods here, you&#39;ll see that once they&#39;ve been promoted to mod status, somehow nearly 50% of their media posts start to come from the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>This is simply something that the users of this sub now have to deal with, the key is to be vigilant in the new section of the sub and continue to try to analyze information critically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts are hard to discern on the internet. Doesn&#39;t cost much to register a website and start spouting off about stuff. Quite different than days of old where someone had to write a book, get published, then put it to market.</p>

<p>I&#39;m apolitical on most of this back n&#39; forth stuff, but what&#39;s it to say  that maybe the Kremlin did kick out whomever?

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument is incredibly flawed. What you&#39;ve submitted above is broad and suggesting a fundamental framework in discerning information, which is swell. But then you go off on a Russian tangent which sort of negates what you&#39;re imploring others to do.
