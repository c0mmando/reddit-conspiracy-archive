<p><em>Hersh also said that a secret agreement in 2012 was reached between the Obama Administration and the leaders of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, to set up a sarin gas attack and blame it on Assad so that the US could invade and overthrow Assad. «By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria».</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few people on this sub believe the MSM version of events especially when it has to do with neocon foreign policy and middle east wars.  Saying Assad did it, against all reason, is the MSM narrative that you support.  Shouldn&#39;t be surprising it doesn&#39;t get much play here. I don&#39;t think it gets much play anywhere anymore to be honest. I think people are sick and tired of the middle east wars and foreign policy blunders.

<p>Investigations are underway to determine who was responsible for the Tuesday morning attack that left at least 70 dead, according to activists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coordinated? The reason it&#39;s popping up here more frequently is that the chemical attack—whether a false flag or not—is <em>recent</em> news. Explaining such a confluence of posts as a &quot;coordinated effort&quot; might make more sense if it were not directly related to the news, which is being discussed elsewhere on reddit as well.</p>

<p>However, if your issue is not really with the supposed coordination but rather with the claim that the attack was a false flag, then I would say &quot;welcome to r/conspiracy&quot;. You also imply say that the prevalence here of suspicions of US involvement is unwarranted and  is a sign of nefarious Russian influence on this sub. To this I say &quot;get real&quot;. The evidence of US complicity in manufacturing the whole Syrian Civil War is plentiful—including evidence of their connivance in the 2013 chemical attack. Read the following, and note the lack of Russian sources, since that seems to be something you would care dearly about lest they infect your feeble mind with their subversive influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with being skeptical about this, it&#39;s just very obvious that there are two narratives that get pushed very hard right now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was a false flag attack (conspiracy theorist narrative).</p></li>
<li><p>It wasn&#39;t an attack at all, a secret underground weapons warehouse operated by the rebels was hit (Russian narrative). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Look at the last couple of times that chemical weapons were used against civilians in Iraq and Syria: it was universally condemned but no action followed. So claiming that this is a false flag to goad the US into a war doesn&#39;t really fly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look .... if you support the other side , it&#39;s gonna turn into major shitshow , such as seen in Iraq and Libya. The point of those wars was not in overturning the dictatorships for the benefit of the &#39;human rights&#39;, the point was that those countries aren&#39;t playing by the US rules , and the game is rigged. All 3 of those wanted to be independant in their decisions , to make deals regarding oil or gas directly with Europe and Russia , and not via US and petrodollar. Thus , the wars soon started. And all 3 of those countries had better human rights and civil life benefits than all those that US supports. They were almost like european countries in their human, woman and schooling liberties, and were leaded by so called &#39;dictators&#39; because it was the only way to supress those crazy islamic millitants. US basically fucked up the arab world , probably for all times ahead. Teach yourself about who really Gadaffi was and Assad is, and not just from CNN. You have the Internet same as I do.</p>

<p>There it is again. This giant misconception that plagues so many conspiracies regarding oil and exposes everyone misusing this term as extremely ignorant. </p>

<p>&quot;Petrodollar&quot; is the surplus generated by oil sales. It has absolutely nothing to do with USD and is not a currency. </p>

<p>Iran and Iraq have already been selling oil for EURO for years (AFTER the Iraq invasion). According to &quot;petrodollar&quot; conspiracy theorist, that would be impossible and would directly lead to a war with the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it is Russian astroturfing. With the general public being more open to conspiratorial ideas in general. It does not seem so manufactured in my opinion. It is also breaking news, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> loves to speculate on false flags. Whether we get some legitimate investigation into the attack before action will be a very telling sign. Why would Assad attack a small group of civilians? Just to prove that he can while the USA military is chomping at the bits to invade?</p>

<p>There was no tactical advantage at all to this. The gas affected hundreds of civilians. Hardly a strike against the rebels he has on the run. I might be closed minded here. But I believe that Assad probably received some &quot;intel&quot; from an &quot;ally&quot;.</p>

<p>Perhaps an Intelligence agent pretending to be on his side from the USA. Stating there was an enemy rebel weapons stash. It was the day after or the same day that we proclaimed removing Assad was not a priority. So it could be possible he received this intel yesterday. The fact that it was stored improperly and ready to release the gas should be highly suspect in anyone&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>There is no ruling out Assad may have done it without proper investigation. But this has all the markers of emotional manipulation and a poorly set up false flag. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>John Mccain visited recently. States upon return. &quot;Things are going on the right path.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Attack on their ally Russia happens yesterday coincidentally. Somehow that is not important anymore. </p></li>
<li><p>Assad is in the home stretch of closing out the civil war. </p></li>
<li><p>Extreme emotional manipulation. Videos of dead children available immediately for the USA population to view. While we are not allowed to see americans dead simply because of trauma?</p></li>
<li><p>An improperly stored sarin gas weapons cache just happens to be in Al-Qaeda controlled territory in a heavy civilian area. But somehow it is definitely Assad&#39;s without question.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of assumptions with no call for investigation just constant banging of war drums and sabre rattling.</p></li>
<li><p>People claiming to use logic denouncing the idea that it could possibly be a false flag even though it was <em>proven</em> we have done it once before. Specifically to try and force Obama to act after his &quot;red line&quot; comments.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the big one. Yesterday we just happen to assert that replacing Assad is no longer a priority of America.</p></li>
<li><p>Not one relief worker is wearing protective gear when handling the victims of sarin gas from the videos we saw.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So it is possible that they are playing 4d chess and just knew the general public in america would denounce this as a false flag. As some sort of attempt to cause dissent and win support at the same time. </p>

<p>However, would you have that much faith in the general american citizen to not be sheep and parrot whatever the media tells them? Even so, this is likely to cause a major war. Why would you want your country to become a battlefield of that magnitude? Most likely to end up a tattered mess costing billions to rebuild when you are planning to start a war with the USA.</p>

<p>Why would they? It&#39;s highly volatile. By the time the relief workers arrived, it would have dissipated. </p>
