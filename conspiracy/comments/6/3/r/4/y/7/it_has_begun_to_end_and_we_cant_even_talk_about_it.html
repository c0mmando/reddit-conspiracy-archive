       We hear about it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or rather SEE it.
      </p>
      <p>
       An entire populous (or at least 75% here in the U.S.) have lost almost ALL ability to maintain a normal conversation with another human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless it's with and electronic device.
      </p>
      <p>
       An iPhone, Android, laptop, or smartwatch will do just fine to send our messages. Who needs to talk face to face anymore? These all serve the purpose of "telling our story". We text, we snap, we chat and tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We message and we receive messages that, if we don't care about them, we can choose to ignore and then feign technological difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can respond TOO quickly, come off as desperate, and then be subjected to the same abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Context is all open to interpretation. Welcome to World fucking WIDE Wild West.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as there is no one in front of us telling us we are wrong, we type that defiant text, post that revealing picture, or share that controversial story, confidently becoming, in our world, a Master Of The Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Irony is that we ALSO depend on Google and Siri and Alexa and GPS on the daily --- just to FUNCTION.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE ARE SLAVES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate irony for me is that I am writing this and sharing about it to you using the same devices I have been talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       How well can you function without them, and if they are suddenly gone, who is going to walk you through the dark forest of this world UNPLUGGED?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHICH would you rather have, the latter, or a world where all privacy is gone and we are simply digital parrots sending pics with vain glory and putting our best face forward for validation and approval?

       We have gotten more "advanced" and can communicate with people clear on the other side of the planet in literally an instant...but we can only do so by closing ourselves off to our immediate environment, type words into little boxes in our hands, and ignore the rest of the world going on directly around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is so deep that the majority of us are entirely blind to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been made more advanced, but only by allowing ourselves to become more closed off to the world around us - a thing which ultimately leads to our own degeneration and devolution.

       I've been unable to form cohesive sentences in person since before Kazaa was a thing, so I don't blame technology for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's true that we're becoming dependent on these devices (and I won't claim that I'm not), it's only a problem if you refuse to flex your muscles and practice the stuff we did before 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paper lists, physical clocks, using your eyes instead of your camera lens, even talking to yourself for self therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live the way you did before and realize that the internet and electronics are augments as opposed to replacements, it'll be okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are foolish people out there who can't live without "reminders", Facebook, recipe sites, their emoji keyboard, and are startled by someone calling to ask a question as opposed to texting. These people are totally boned in a survival situation should their grid go down. And I'm not Mountain Man myself, but at least I'd be fine if the internet went down or we were EMP'd. I'd just be irritated for ten minutes then realize I can read a book, talk to people face to face, tend to my garden, and throw rocks at cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a dumb time. But all of you reading this know better than to let the internet and electronics control you. You're the ones that'll survive.

       When speaking face to face human communication relies mainly on body language and tone of voice. Imagine saying "fuck off" depending on body language and tone this can be either offensive or said jokingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       When communicating digitally we rely only on words so we simply can't communicate in the way we always have. As OP pointed out these skills are being lost.

        It seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: That we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude. This is the, it seems to me, the ultimate in malevolent revolutions shall we say, and this is a problem which has interested me many years and about which I wrote thirty years ago, a fable, Brave New World, which is an account of society making use of all the devices available and some of the devices which I imagined to be possible making use of them in order to, first of all, to standardize the population, to iron out inconvenient human differences, to create, to say, mass produced models of human beings arranged in some sort of scientific caste system.
