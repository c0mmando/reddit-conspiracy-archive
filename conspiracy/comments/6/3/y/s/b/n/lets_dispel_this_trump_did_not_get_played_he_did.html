       Trump offered an alternative to Clinton, but his promises were hollow. He, like Obama, won on a promise of less interventionism that he never intended to keep. Trump was always meant to win because it served the purpose of crippling our political system. It was entirely meant to sow division and to stifle political discourse. His win radicalized the Left, it has led to this country virtually tearing itself apart. "Divide and conquer." More than that, it was meant to discredit the Presidency, to expose the corruption in our system to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2fMeer5Mw">
        demoralize
       </a>
       Americans so that they won't even want the system fixed, but instead would prefer it be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe people need to understand that everything happening right now advances the globalist agenda, even when it seems like it does not. They want civil unrest, political tumult, conflict, war. "Ordo Ab Chao." They are playing multidimensional chess. They are playing
       <em>
        a game
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       These attacks were always going to happen. We were always going to go to war in this region for real. This is just a reminder that Trump changes nothing other than to confirm that this is the beginning of the end. The dominoes have started to fall. The signs are only going to become more and more clearer as the days wear on.

       Donald Trump was always meant to win, angry man. Relax. Absolutely nothing you've said has anything to do with why Trump won. He won because the Democratic party spent seven years abandoning the blue collar worker and then a solid year building up a Clinton as the answer.

       Why do i need to say anything? Clearly you feel yourself the hero this world needs. Surely this is your idea to make things better, right? Right? I mean, surely if you keep pulling such refined gems of wisdom out of your ass, furthering the division between the common people, and keeping  people from focusing on the true monsters, then maybe everyone will see your fine insight onto this strange, and turbulent landscape we find ourselves. Although, admittedly, im not so sure how posting whiney bullshit is going to make anything better, but clearly you know some shit, right?

       As it relates to our entire country being destabalized because quite seriously the most unethical businessman of all time wouldn't be in control of nukes, the budget or the future of our country? Or just Syria? I am assuming the latter. Fucking Gary Johnson would have bombed Syria, that isnt the point.

       So hypothetically how would you see a Clinton presidency handling this? Everything would be exactly the same,  only liberal media would be busy covering up stuff rather than exposing everything Trump does wrong. I am not Trump supporter but I honestly think we dodged a bullet. And honestly,  dont blame his supporters he won, blame the lousy democratic party with their lousy, sick sociopath candidate as their runner up.

       Note that Trump's entire "anti-establishment" campaign was a counter-narrative to Sanders' and that he won quite a few Bernie voters over to his side after the DNC went with their anointed Clingon.

       Identifying yourself with left or right on the political spectrum is where this all starts. It reduces compicated issues into binary ones, black and white, left or right, wrong or right...we are not fucking computers and dualistic thinking is the tool of the dark side. The shadow government calls the shots and as much as I would love to get behind the "drain the swamp" addage it is all just noise and distraction. We have to stop being suckered into the binary thinking and start recognizing that we are warm loving human beings who really all want the same thing. When we "choose sides", no matter what "side", we are giving in to evil. Consciousness is what is needed here, more self awareness and no more binary thinking!
