        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump offered an alternative to Clinton, but his promises were hollow. He, like Obama, won on a promise of less interventionism that he never intended to keep. Trump was always meant to win because it served the purpose of crippling our political system. It was entirely meant to sow division and to stifle political discourse. His win radicalized the Left, it has led to this country virtually tearing itself apart. &quot;Divide and conquer.&quot; More than that, it was meant to discredit the Presidency, to expose the corruption in our system to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2fMeer5Mw">demoralize</a> Americans so that they won&#39;t even want the system fixed, but instead would prefer it be replaced.</p>

<p>I believe people need to understand that everything happening right now advances the globalist agenda, even when it seems like it does not. They want civil unrest, political tumult, conflict, war. &quot;Ordo Ab Chao.&quot; They are playing multidimensional chess. They are playing <em>a game</em>.</p>

<p>These attacks were always going to happen. We were always going to go to war in this region for real. This is just a reminder that Trump changes nothing other than to confirm that this is the beginning of the end. The dominoes have started to fall. The signs are only going to become more and more clearer as the days wear on.</p>

I mean, surely if you keep pulling such refined gems of wisdom out of your ass, furthering the division between the common people, and keeping  people from focusing on the true monsters, then maybe everyone will see your fine insight onto this strange, and turbulent landscape we find ourselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Identifying yourself with left or right on the political spectrum is where this all starts. It reduces compicated issues into binary ones, black and white, left or right, wrong or right...we are not fucking computers and dualistic thinking is the tool of the dark side. The shadow government calls the shots and as much as I would love to get behind the &quot;drain the swamp&quot; addage it is all just noise and distraction. We have to stop being suckered into the binary thinking and start recognizing that we are warm loving human beings who really all want the same thing. When we &quot;choose sides&quot;, no matter what &quot;side&quot;, we are giving in to evil. Consciousness is what is needed here, more self awareness and no more binary thinking!</p>
