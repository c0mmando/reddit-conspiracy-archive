        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This may be a shock but China, Russia, or the US couldn&#39;t give a damn about  Assad, the people of Syria and whether or not they were gassed by Assad. Forget if the attack is a false flag or not because it doesn&#39;t effect the point and that&#39;s that they all only give a shit about gas and oil.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s lay it out to highlight why toppling Assad is important to Israel, USA, and Saudi Arabia. And why keeping Assad standing is important to Russia and Turkey. It will also highlight why China and Iran don&#39;t give a fuck about what happens either way.</p>

<p>Scene is the Middle East</p>

<p>The big players are Iran, Syria, Turkey, Russia, Israel, USA, Saudi Arabia and China </p>

<p>The prize is the South Pars gas/oil field <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field</a></p>

<p>The Iranians have an insane amount of untapped gas and oil. A combination of sanctions by the US, the inaccessibility of the reserves, and scores of other more easily accessed reserves have delayed Iran developing on it. They have just started producing in the last week or so </p>

<p><a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Irans-South-Pars-Oil-Field-To-Produce-By-End-Of-March.html">http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Irans-South-Pars-Oil-Field-To-Produce-By-End-Of-March.html</a></p>

<p>The closest market for all that oil is Europe but you need a pipeline to get it there. There&#39;s a few options of where it could go through. </p>

<p>Iran doesn&#39;t give a fuck about where the gas and oil goes at all because no matter what they are getting paid. </p>

<p>China also doesn&#39;t give a fuck because they along with a French company have a 50% stake in the deal with Iran to develop the field. On top of that they are reported to be involved in investing over 42 billion dollars in developing the portion of the pipeline in Iran. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the possible routes for that pipeline once it leaves Iran </p>

<p>We&#39;ll call this one the American Express</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/335809bc5a4500918ff797c8a540c039">http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/335809bc5a4500918ff797c8a540c039</a></p>

<p>And this one the Russian Run </p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/nECpe">https://m.imgur.com/a/nECpe</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline</a></p>

<p>So starting with the American Express, we&#39;ve established that between Iran and China the development and pipeline infrastructure inside Iran is covered. Both Iran and China will make money no matter what. </p>

<p>With the American Express the next stage would be building a pipeline through Iraq:</p>

<p>Getting into the finer mechanics, the US the Saudis and the Israelis all lack control over Iran and Turkey, in other words they wouldn&#39;t be getting a cut of the profits if it goes through Turkey. Plus they have their own natural gas and oil asserts that would see a decrease in value when the South Pars starts producing full blast. So they want to make sure they are getting a cut. </p>

<p>Next they are going to want to make a route which they have total control over. The shortest route between Iran and the Mediterranean is through Iraq and Syria. So ideally you would want to take control of both of those countries to build your pipeline. </p>

<p>Iraq ✅ the US took care of that some time ago</p>

<p>Syria ❌</p>

<p>With Iraq under control that pesky Assad is all that stands in the way of the pipeline. Thank god for American aptitude at scheming to topple regimes. America is so talented at doing this that they cooked up a top shelf idea. What if you could take out 2 maybe even more birds at once with one stone? We&#39;re talking about consolidating oil/gas/energy power here and in that realm Gaddafis Libya was a major hindrance and threat to future oil/gas value and power for the Saudis and Israelis in the region. </p>

<p>The plan they hatched would solve the Gaddafi problem as well as work towards toppling Assad and they might just get lucky and bring down a couple more dictators with them. They would need a plan like this as the Russians were supporting Assad due to their interests which we will get into with the Russian Run. </p>

<p>Phase one of the plan was orchestrating and precipitating the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. The goal was to destabilize the region and spark rebellions by the people, destabilizing the region surrounding a target (Assad) is a classic regime toppling technique. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/</a></p>

<p>Phase 2 is to fund and arm a group of rebels to form an army. Once the uprising in Libya was sparked the US used their intelligence of the Libyan demographics and social structure to did their army. When Gaddafi came to power it was under the promise that strict sharia law would be the lay of the land and there would a be Sharia court that ruled supreme. He fell through on that promise and while sharia law was practiced in Libya it was not enforced in the traditional sense, he also created a civil sharia court system but it was essentially a bullshit court that didn&#39;t have the power the extremist population wanted. Gaddafi quickly grasped the country in an Iron fist with his loyal military (he was an army man) and crushed any dissenters. In other words there were many angry extremist Libyans who were upset with Gaddafi but were suppressed by his military strength. The US knew that there were some 200,000 of these extremists willing to fight Gaddafi. They sent these 200,000 &quot;rebels&quot; money and weapons, then with their friends the US bombed the shit out of Gaddafis Air Force, choking his militaries main weapon. With no airforce and a heavily armed, well funded, and angry army of 200,000 tearing through the country it wasn&#39;t long until Gaddafi fell. </p>

<p>A few goals were achieved. They stopped Gaddafi from creating a North African currency, they eliminated a threat to their control over the region, and they took control over an oil competitor. Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels of oil a day before the civil war. Just this passed year they have managed to get back to 500,000 barrels a day. Libya is no longer a competitor. </p>

<p>The main goal was that they had an army on the ground now in the 200,000 rebels. These &quot;rebels&quot; were cheated, they thought they would take over Libya and make it a sharia paradise, but the Americans did what they do and installed a puppet government. Screwed in that respect and screwed in the respect that their country was now destroyed, 100,000 of the rebels (with some guidance I&#39;m sure, we know various intelligence assets are involved with these groups in the region <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/16/reports-at-least-10-nato-military-officers-captured-by-syrian-special-forces-this-morning-in-east-aleppo-bunker/">http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/16/reports-at-least-10-nato-military-officers-captured-by-syrian-special-forces-this-morning-in-east-aleppo-bunker/</a>) decided that they would leave Libya with their guns and money and make their way on to Syria where the uprising was still going on and Assad stood as another &quot;not extremist enough&quot; leader who they could take down. On their way over they meet up with various groups that used to make up the Iraqi army. Including many former officers.
<a href="http://time.com/3900753/isis-iraq-syria-army-united-states-military/">http://time.com/3900753/isis-iraq-syria-army-united-states-military/</a></p>

<p>Together they morphed like a fucked up power ranger to make ISIS. They would wreak havoc over the region for the better half of a decade but thanks to the Russian backing Syria held strong the entire time. The plan was hitting a snag, Assad needed to fall and it looked like it would take real military intervention, but that won&#39;t happen as long as Russia backs them. Sarin gas false flag attacks are a good way to weaken Russia&#39;s support for Assad and sway public opinion to go to war. They tried that in 2013 and it didn&#39;t quite work. Obama was close and so ready to drop the bombs but he was stopped by Congress</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin">https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin</a></p>

<p>So the American Saudi Israeli faction failed to clear the way for their pipeline and we will pause there for right now. Isis is being ejected from Syria and it appears as though they are winning the civil war. </p>

<p>Now on the other side we have the Russian Run:</p>

<p>Phase 1 would be to ensure there is no path for the oppositions pipeline by supporting Assad and not letting Syria fall. Done.</p>

<p>The three (Iran Russia Turkey) even have a plan to split up Syria into control zones for themselves <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14H12V">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14H12V</a></p>

<p>Phase 2 would be to build the pipeline infrastructure for the new route.</p>

<p>This pipeline already exists and could be adapted <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz%E2%80%93Ankara_pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz%E2%80%93Ankara_pipeline</a> but this pipeline was the new option <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline</a></p>

<p>So infrastructure is nearly completed or already completed, that combined with production at the South Pars field finally starting to flow made the Russian Run a much more serious and impending reality. </p>

<p>Just look how cozy all of the players involved in the Russian Run are getting lately </p>

<p>Russia selling $10 billion in arms to Iran</p>

<p><a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/iran-and-russia-negotiating-10-billion-arms-deal/">http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/iran-and-russia-negotiating-10-billion-arms-deal/</a></p>

<p>Negotiating and agree on stuff aww money really brings everyone together</p>

<p>Turkey seems to accept Assad, see guys we&#39;re all friends now</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/world/middleeast/russia-turkey-syria-deal.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/world/middleeast/russia-turkey-syria-deal.html</a></p>

<p>They were clamping it down in Syria </p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/13784886">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/13784886</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s even a prophecy that these allies will join to fight Israel but that&#39;s more for fun. <a href="http://www.alphanewsdaily.com/Warning%206%20Russia%20Iran%20Invasion.html">http://www.alphanewsdaily.com/Warning%206%20Russia%20Iran%20Invasion.html</a></p>

<p>But there&#39;s some small snags in the Russian Run as well. Russia wants the west to have no influence over anyone involved in this deal to keep their hands off of it completely. This would include getting Turkey out of NATO (Turkey is also a key location for NATO in the region). I believe they got the ball rolling on that one by arranging for the Russian Ambassador to Turkey to be assassinated. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/</a></p>

<p>Many people were quick (including Russia and Turkey <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2438405/key-ally-of-vladimir-putin-claims-shadowy-nato-forces-masterminded-the-assassination-of-russian-ambassador-andrey-karlov/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2438405/key-ally-of-vladimir-putin-claims-shadowy-nato-forces-masterminded-the-assassination-of-russian-ambassador-andrey-karlov/</a> <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/britain-blamed-after-russias-ambassador-9488222">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/britain-blamed-after-russias-ambassador-9488222</a> ) to blame western intelligence for the assassination but I think that&#39;s a little too perfect. Just look at the situation, the only security guard on the Amb detail ends up being the shooter. Think about who controls his security schedule and who would have handled security at the venue. Sounds like an inside job if I&#39;ve ever seen one. And if it was the wests doing it would be with the purpose of souring Russia turkey relations but they would have been able to see through that easily. In my opinion it serves the will of Russia and Turkey far more, it&#39;s a precursor for Turkey to leave NATO claiming a lack of trust in other members. Don&#39;t believe me? Not two weeks after the assassination the Turks are asserting their right to close an air bases used by NATO to conduct air strikes on Syria <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/01/05/turkey-leaving-nato-asserts-right-to-close-key-base-for-coalition/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/01/05/turkey-leaving-nato-asserts-right-to-close-key-base-for-coalition/</a> they are absolutely gearing up to leave NATO. </p>

<p>With all these things falling in place for the Russian Run they are oh so close to making the pipeline and the billions of dollars attached to it a reality! </p>

<p>But as of this week it looks the the American Express is taking one last swing at conquering Syria. A second Sarin gas attack has allegedly taken place and the evidence suggests that it was most likely carried out by terrorist groups in Syria </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-06/ron-paul-zero-chance-assad-behind-chemical-weapons-attack-syria-likely-false-flag">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-06/ron-paul-zero-chance-assad-behind-chemical-weapons-attack-syria-likely-false-flag</a></p>

<p>All chemical weapons were taken from Assad in 2013 
<a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE98E01W20130915">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE98E01W20130915</a></p>

<p>ISIS manufacturing Chemical Weapons in Syria
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-manufacturing-and-using-chemical-weapons-in-iraq-and-syria-us-official-claims-10496094.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-manufacturing-and-using-chemical-weapons-in-iraq-and-syria-us-official-claims-10496094.html</a>
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34211838">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34211838</a></p>

<p>And they use them

<p>If this attack is used to precipitate a US-Syria war then it appears that the American Express is still wanting to push through. But with the Russian Run so close to completion does it really matter? Iran is going to want to start making money ASAP so if the Russian Run line is completed first (which it will) then I&#39;m sure they will go with it. Unless....some pesky US sanctions appear and force them to slow down development again </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-21/in-this-issue/general-interest/us-waives-sanctions-on-south-pars-field.html">http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-21/in-this-issue/general-interest/us-waives-sanctions-on-south-pars-field.html</a></p>

<p>To sum up my point it&#39;s too late for Syria they have played their role in scheme for Russia and Russia/Turkey are so close to the prize that it&#39;s no longer as pressing of an issue to ensure Assad stays in power. Because of that Russia won&#39;t be rushing to start world war 3 with the US. And China certainly won&#39;t because they are getting paid regardless. I think this is a feeble attempt by the controlling powers of the west to bundle in one last shot at getting Syria while at the same time creating a situation that will muddy the waters for the Trump administration. So don&#39;t fret. World war 3 won&#39;t start over this, unless the US does some bat shit insane move like invading Iran...who wanted that again? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting analysis, but there are some significant errors, and you are underestimating the real dangers here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you have airbrushed Qatar out of the equation? Qatar has the largest reserves of natural gas in the Gulf, they are the primary beneficiaries of the proposed Gulf-Europe (via Saudi/Syria/Turkey) natural gas pipeline, and they are the primary financial sponsors of the &quot;Civil War&quot; in Syria.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Russia regards Syria as being of critical strategic importance. Putin has every reason to stop this pipeline being built, because Russia is the primary supplier of natural gas to Europe, and a new pipeline from Qatar would deprive them of their main source of hard currency, and their main source of geo-political leverage over a number of European countries (via the threat of turning off the gas). In addition, Russia&#39;s only naval base outside of Russia is located in Syria - in the port of Tartus - and this is of critical strategic importance to Russia. The Assad government guarantees the continued existence of the Russian base at Tartus, and if Assad were to go, so does that guarantee. </p>

<p>There is a very strong chance that Russia will engage the West militarily if it looks like their financial/geopolotical stake in Syria is under genuine threat. This first salvo of US Tomahawk missiles at carefully selected &quot;non-targets&quot; is not a dealbreaker - it&#39;s a gesture by Trump to appease the neo-cons and the US media. The Russians and Chinese may well have given Trump the green light to do it, to put this ludicrous &quot;gas attack&quot; issue to bed, and to take some of the pressure off Trump at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to airbrush Qatar but for simplicity I left them out because them being involved doesn&#39;t really change much. They would hold nearly identical desires as Saudi Arabia but with less presence. Especially considering that yes they have more reserves but much of it is going to be extremely hard to access and Iran is expected to put produce them. And do you have a source on them being the primary funding behind the civil war? I don&#39;t doubt that at all just would like to add to my various collection of links</p>

<p>And I think you over estimate the strategic value of Syria if you consider the idea that Turkey would leave NATO for a strengthened relationship with Russia. Turkey offers the same locational advantage as well as Mediterranean access, much more access. From a strategic stand point Syria is good but Turkey would be better. And I guess I wasn&#39;t very clear, I don&#39;t mean to say that a massive conflict is not possible here but this action taken by the US is not enough to make Russia or China even blink. If a real threat of invasion/topple arises Russia will continue to block Syria from falling for the exact reason of preventing a Qatar-Saudi-Iraq-Syria pipeline. But even then it won&#39;t be enough to really hurt Russian energy profits. Soon they will have a new pipeline that bypasses the Ukraine, the Russia-Turkey Turkish Stream is finishing up, and when the Iran-Turkey line is done they will be cruising. </p>

<p>And I really don&#39;t think the threat is as high you think but I maybe wrong. </p>

<p>As I said, I suspect this initial salvo of Trump Tomahawks is not a real attack on Syria, but political theatre. The targets were probably selected carefully to produce as little real damage as possible.</p>

<p>Also, the existence of a rival pipeline will massively hurt Russian profits, because they will lose their monopoly, but worse, they lose their big stick with which to threaten/hit the rest of mainland Europe.</p>

<p>An Iran natural gas pipeline to Europe is a non-starter. The US, UK, France, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar would all strongly oppose it.</p>

<p>Turkey is not a reliable ally for anyone, including Russia. Erdogan has managed to fight both with AND against Syria, Russia and ISIS just within the Syrian conflict. Russia will stick with Syria, they don&#39;t trust Erdogan.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you realize how close an Iran natural gas pipeline to Europe is to happening. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again it&#39;ll hurt them but not as much as you think, certainly not massively. Russia has a well established network to distribute gas to Europe, an expensive network that is also continually growing. A Qatar to Europe pipeline would require much more work and development and would be much farther down the road. Remember Russia has 48.7 billion m3 of natural gas reserves compared to Qatars 24.7 billion (a lot of which is hard to access). When the Turkey-Iran pipeline goes through there will be another 33.6 billion m3 being pumped toward Europe that Russia is getting in on. Qatar has a lot but not the most. Russia and Iran have the product and the infrastructure. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes and the political landscape has developed a lot since the previous tensions between the various parties. Do you think Putin trusts Assad? No but he knows Assad is indebted to him. The same will go for Erdogan if Putin coaxed him out of NATO, the west won&#39;t be a friend to Turkey is things with Putin sour. If everyone&#39;s getting paid you&#39;d be surprised how well unlikely friends can get along </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, but I think your premise is anti-alarmist in part because it stops short.</p>

<p>You&#39;re simply assuming that we would stop short of invading/coup-ing Iran. If it is this easy to engage with Syria by using blatantly false-flag chemical attacks and white helmets at the Oscars...It would be exponentially easier to engage Iran with the American public already synchronized to the nuclear deal buzzwords associated with that country. </p>

<p>Given how dependent we are on a petrodollar system to continue selling our debt, and given how Russia, China, Turkey, and Iran have already started establishing a new, petrodollar-free paradigm using the Shanghai Gold Exchange as an intermediary for oil trade...Much like Germany after their first world war, financial considerations could force us into a conflict involving Iran, turkey, and any other nation that tries to do what saddam and Gaddafi did in dislodging from the petrodollar system. </p>

<p>Engaging Iran, in my humble opinion, would spark a greater conflict that brought the powers into conflict on a large scale....And I think it&#39;s far more likely that America goes down in the heat of battle as opposed to sitting idly by while nation&#39;s around the world start using gold for oil trade and selling off our debt...which would effectively crash our house of cards domestic economy overnight. We are 80% service industry, we have no real economy to rely upon...If the petrodollar system begins to go...I think you would in fact see ww3 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the coup de tat was a bold but calculated move by Erdogan. By pulling it off he eliminated nearly all dissent in the country. You rarely see power consolidation on that scale, I mean he took out a thousand judges in one night. Unbelievable. What I say to that is that Turkey/Erdogan is working on expanding their influence, and I think they feel limited in that aspect by being in NATO, Erdogan wants to go full bad boy and I believe he wants to cozy up to Russia and China instead of the West. So I do think Erdogan is gearing up to stand up to the US but Israel is another story.

    <div class="md"><p>Superb response. You know, we had a Prime Minister named Necmettin Erbakan who was a serious Islamist and he preached anti-Zionism. He was removed from power 1 year into his administration. Until his death, he explored Erdogan and AKP&#39;s deep ties to Israel and their support towards the Bigger Israel Project. Not to mention, Turkey will have a referendum 9 days later to introduce the presidential system instead of the current parliamentary system.</p>

<p>I believe these are all done to create groundwork for another World War. If the referendum passes, Erdogan will bring about a more authoritarian regime and divide Turkey into states to make the presidential system work out smoothly. Many places in Turkey will ask for secession and therefore Turkey will be once again divided like when the Ottoman Empire was divided in WWI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tartus is on the Mediterranean is it not? The Russians have Sevestapol in the Black Sea I think you&#39;re a little confused on that. </p>

<p>And this has been pointed out already and I&#39;ll say what I said before. The landscape and relationships are changing. Turkey will become more of an ally to Russia than ever before. Considering that look up the Turkish Naval base Iskenderun <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iskenderun_Naval_Base">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iskenderun_Naval_Base</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YG6YA">https://imgur.com/a/YG6YA</a></p>

<p>Pretty prime location for naval repair and resupply etc. </p>

<p>And look how close conveniently placed the air base that turkey wants to kick NATO out of is </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incirlik_Air_Base">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incirlik_Air_Base</a></p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m the only one who sees it but it&#39;s been clear to me ever since the assassination that Russia and Turkey are secretly scheming together to ditch NATO and consolidate control in Syria. But they won&#39;t be rushing to defend Syria after some tomahawk missiles. </p>

<p>They both want to increase their control over Syria and the end game is get rid of Assad once they have established their &quot;secure control zones&quot;. It will be an interesting play but I think you&#39;ll see Iran Russia and Turkey attempt to step up to take control of the situation and prevent further American intervention but by no means will they &quot;defend Syria&quot;. </p>

Absolutely still maintain control over Tartus but that&#39;s not being threatened by the US actions right now and I&#39;m not so sure that the Russians would need to defend Syria to keep a hold of Tartus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I did, that was in error.  Thanks for pointing it out.  That said, Russia may choose to strenghten it&#39;s ties with Turkey, but it is not intelligent in any way to give up a port in an aarea where you don&#39;t have another, even if you think you can replace it down the road.  I&#39;m not saying pretending to suggest what Putin will ultimately do, I thin that depends more on what comes next, but I do know the sole reason Russian troops and equipment are in Syria right now is to protect that port.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, but the conclusion confuses me.  If we go all in to take Syria, not just stop at removing assad, Russia is cut out the deal right? And turkey?</p>

<p>So I see why it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s Assad, but the puppet that replaces him determines who wins (Russia or America).</p>

<p>Given that, why would Russia just let us install a puppet here?  We are going to have a war over this, right?  Tillerson is already pinning blame on Russia, suggesting they didn&#39;t ensure all the gas weapons were destroyed.  Russia is saying we knew about the attacks and were prepared to bomb in advance, and have violated the un.  If the un were to conclude evidence agreeing with Russia, what happens?  </p>

<p>Finally, what I feel like you do gloss over is that Iran has more at stake here than just money.   If they allow the us to take Syria they may still make their cut, but they have lost russia who gets screwed over, and a lot of geographical power has now shifted to the nations who have actively tried to sabotage them - Saudi and America and Israel...  and don&#39;t they run the risk that whoever controls the end of the pipeline controls whether the oil is going to get sold or not, or at what price gets paid to Iran?  This is probably stupid, but what if we were to just sit on the port, refuse to let oil flow out the port, so no oil is ever sold anyway, artificially inflating the value of Saudi oil...or what if we are the brokers of the oil, and hold the power over china and Russia to just not allow them to buy what we have stockpiled in Syria should we ever need that leverage?  Wouldn&#39;t china see that, or the possibility that we could ask for a ridiculous price that is economically infeasable as a reason to fight for their ally to have control over the port?</p>

<p>Sorry if these are dumb questions, I&#39;m not very aware of how the economics of this sort work.</p>
