        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my short time here at the residential care facility for the elderly I&#39;ve had todeal with A LOT of crazy shit. Between an attempt at my life by a confused and dementious ex-marine, and having a schizophrenic AIDS carrier beligerently demand I shave his testicles, a pattern has emerged... It&#39;s men who cause the most shit to hit the fan.</p>

<p>This pattern was confirmed by my boss, a veteran of the industry and crazy shit in general; men are less accepting of their environment by nature. And with further research, this claim is reinforced. Testosterone influences agression, and this agression is understood to often stem from the increased rection to perception of unfairness.</p>

<p>So when I see the feminization of men I see an attenpt to betray our biology in an attepmt to make us complacent. Thus TPTB maintain their power.</p>

<p>I think feminization of men has miltiple  angles. Making them docile is one of them also theres an angle of population control</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a nurse and I find I like my older (alert and oriented) male patients more than my younger male patients.  It does seem like men my age and younger are pussies.  They look like pussies, they sound like pussies (effeminate vocal tones compared to older men) and carry themselves like pussies.  In my personal life I also find I get along with men older than me than men my age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched Dave Chappell last night and he made this very point. WW2 the men were sent to fight. The women had to take up the slack and join the workforce. Women now made their own money, handled their own affairs, raised children by themselves, etc. When the men returned the women were empowered and wasn&#39;t about to give that up. I found what he said thought provoking indeed. I&#39;ve seen in long term care homes that the violent outbursts are about equal. You have the manly men ready to whoop some ass, but I&#39;ve also seen those women that were forced to take up the slack absolutely bash peoples heads in.</p>
