    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make the beginning of the reversal of net neutrality right.</p>

<p>Not to mention turning every last citizen of the US into a bigger product.
Many don&#39;t use Facebook because of this exact issue; they are the product. </p>

<p>But now, we literally pay to be a product. ISPs have spent about 1.25 million bribing the Republicans to pass this so they can have their cake and eat it too. </p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t for the people, &quot;maga&quot; no he is for self and corporate interest. The American people don&#39;t mean shit to him.
Which is politician 101 but the majority of his voter base believe he is in fact &quot;for the people&quot;  but only if the people are the rich, clearly. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t say that out of malice. It is now confirmed. Not to mention his &quot;lock her up&quot; chants and immediate flip flop on that, his &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and his cabinet immediately becoming swamp creatures.</p>

<p>People wanted something different, people got the same shit;different day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting for the apologists though. &quot;Well he has to have the AG go after Clinton&quot; who is instead trying to infringe on states rights (which conservatives like to say they promote) or some B&#39;s about &quot;the swamp&quot; which we have evidence that every last Republican rep is in fact a member of with figures of exactly how much money they took in from these ISPs. </p>

<p>So if he is supposed to be draining the swamp, why is he creating an environment for it to thrive in? Rewarding bad behavior is a weird tactic....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, let&#39;s say Google came to your town and offered you a gig connection for $20 per month. As part of the  plan you agree that all your data would be sold in anonymously in aggregate. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t use a VPN or employ other measures just to fuck with the aggregate, which usually means that you just go to one side or the other of the bell curve and are discounted anyway.</p>

<p>Would you be interested in such a deal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of &quot;lol use a VPN&quot; is a shit argument. 
It is as much about principle as it is that this is NOT a good step. This is the first brick into demolishing net neutrality. We will be in a situation similar to china soon, &quot;fake news&quot; will be censored. All based on who is in office propaganda is already rampant.</p>

<p>In fact it&#39;s the same argument as &quot;if you aren&#39;t doing anything wrong why do you care?&quot; </p>

<p>Think of it this way, you are paying (depending on location) 30-100 a month for a half decent internet connection (this fluctuates between geographical areas in the US for the same quality from same company.) </p>

<p>They already have your money, making it hand over fist too. Now, you&#39;re paying them that money and they&#39;re able to throw around 1.25 million like pocket change to make corrupt politicians allow them to sell your private data (most Americans are vulnerable to this) for more money. 
And you can be sure you won&#39;t be getting any of that money or savings since they don&#39;t need to charge as much as they do anyways in most cases.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the equivalent of you paying someone to come fix something in your house; then those people going home telling their friend they noticed you&#39;ll be on vacation in a week and that you have a nice 65&quot; TV. They&#39;ll hand over the address for the same price they quoted you for the fix. </p>

<p>They are effectively stealing your stuff for their profit, after you&#39;ve already paid for their service.
Soon you&#39;ll pay premiums for Netflix, YouTube, video games, certain news sites.</p>

<p>Trump is being a hypocrite, and no one wants to call him on his shit because all the shit Clinton has done and it&#39;s &quot;Dem or Rep&quot; mentality with or against and NO ONE wants to be with Clinton. 
Proof? I had to make this thread, while conspiracy is spammed with &quot;My take on Rice.&quot; &quot;Rice lied!&quot; &quot;0/10 with Rice&quot; and so on. 
Literally being handed a divisive distraction while the elite fuck you over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is many people who are trying to make light of this even in this thread. I find it funny. Anyways, that rant is done; privacy needs to be secure as possible now, if you elect to give up some of that by using Facebook go for it, Google? Go for it. </p>

<p>Those are &quot;free&quot; services. Of course you&#39;re the product there because ad revenue makes it profitable. 
However, paying for a service then becoming the product is ridiculous there&#39;s no need for that next step outside of corporate greed. </p>
