       I don't know about anyone else but I've had it with all these asshats coming on here and trying to disrupt/ destroy what's left of Reddit and in particular one of the last havens, r/conspiracy. These people have got to be the biggest pieces of shit to play with people's mental let alone fellow Americans. Luckily, this sub has held pretty firm on not having any of their bullshit. Credit is due to both the community and the mod team. SB is trying to flip this place so bad and yet here we are holding on to what's left.. We have a lot of targets on our back and yet we dig harder, we connect more dots, we raise awareness. We must not be silenced but instead we must end their game. We are close, we must be the change.
      </p>
      <p>
       [end 1st rant]
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we ensure the integrity this sub and prevent further distruption / shillruption?
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me crazy (I mean this is r/conspiracy right ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚). We are in such a wild time of crowdsourced info here and the chan boards, fake news (disinformation) generated by MSM, paid trolls everywhere...
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get back to r/conspiracy roots.. YOU and or I want to be a member, get approved by the true community members of this place. (Some will say my account is fresh as fuck but I got my creds, this is MY sub.. I know these fucking nerds here not some paid rookie who hasn't been to Reddit before the last 6 months ago)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when we beat the shit out dem dummys, we are still being distracted to the reason why they came here in the first place. At this point I think they know they aren't fooling anyone.. That's not their point anymore. They want to stop us from any form of actual  conversations... They want to stop us. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       [end 2nd rant]
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this for what you will but at bare minimum remember.. Fuck all the haters. fuck the elite and their fucking dumb game and their $hill pawns. Continue to be a good person. Continue to love. Grow infinitely. Expand your mind. We will overcome.

       isn't a "community" - it's a message board. The shills, spammers, and trolls have lots of account, funding, and time on their hands to dominate this message board and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best you can do is realize that just because shills, spammers, and trolls post a lot of words online, it means nothing. There is no "consensus" and upvotes are just imaginary internet points, meaning nothing.

       I disagree, at one point not only r/conspiracy a solid community but Reddit in general was a pretty awesome community. Now I cringe every time I hear Reddit talked about IRL. This place was changing the way the people got their information but you don't leave this big of an Internet footprint and not have these issues..

       Upvotes put things on frontpages, thereby establishing relevance and directing discussions. This is why accounts are purchased. More karma, more credibility. It most certainly matters in realms that discuss current social and geopolitical happenings.

       The mistake is thinking that reddit is a "community" or that the system is somehow a reflection of the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not - reddit is like a talk show on TV, it's all scripted, many of the participants are "actors."
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is thinking reddit is anything other than a propaganda platform for the company that owns it.

       You're speaking, I think(?), towards reddit as a whole. Subreddits are not immune of course, but a little harder to propagandize--especially with a strong set of rules and a userbase that's pretty much on the same page. OP above is referring to this sub in particular. This place is a conundrum because of the subject itself. It's almost wide open, a perfect target of sorts. It has an inherent 'what if' at it's core. People/entities are here to exploit it, often having not much trouble. I talk about this stuff all the time. Too much. Here's a post I made yesterday hoping for some input. It wasn't received well and I'm unsure why still.

       I definitely look at anti-Trump posts with greater skepticism because I'm well aware of the tactics used by the establishment to discredit him.Their playbook is published for all to see. But Trump is no angel. Our board should always be skeptical of those holding the keys to the kingdom, and Trump's administration is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at the end of the day, it's all bullshit political theater used to distract us from self progression, introspection and real change/growth anyway. I'm as guilty as the next person for buying into it (because it's very interesting and entertaining). But we shouldn't be all consumed by it.

       Yes and that means engaging political opponents.

       How long have we been arguing about guns and abortions and gay marriage? If Kentucky wants to get rid of abortion clinics,  so what it's their state?  These same topics are always under discussion instead of anything of any real substance by our politicians. Now both sides are trying to divide us more than ever.

       Technically, they mentioned "SB" as the source of the shills. That's ShareBlue, a relatively new outlet for Democratic Party propaganda started by David Brock, the owner of multiple astroturf orgs. This means that the shills they're talking about are the pro-Democrat/anti-Trump shills, not the fools who come in here to spread pro-Trump propaganda. One could argue that's "bringing politics to this discussion". However, I would point out that I hate Trump AND the anti-Trump shills at the same time, so disliking the shareblue brigade doesn't necessarily mean anything except opposition to astroturf. And we should ALL be against astroturf regardless of our political ideology.

       It's a fight between the pro trump shills amd pro hillary shills, although it's completely pointless and amounts to two mice in a mousetrap arguing whose cheese is bigger.

       What's worse is that if you're not a member of one, you're assumed to be a member of the other.

       Non-politicized discussions can't flourish. There

       be good content until their funding dries up, and that day can't come soon enough.

       Love the post. I used to read Reddit news but since the Nazis took over, you can't post anything without being shadowbanned Or banned all together. I disagree that upvotes don't mean anything, it's good to know people share your views as well as helping to counter the shills who downvote you into oblivion.

       One of the weirdest thing about the relatively recent shill invasion has been the way that some of the most vocal people complaining about the shills themselves are using suspicious-looking accounts. They might have thousands of karma and no visible posting history, or like op here, their account might be about a week old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno op's intentions since their account is essentially blank aside from this post, and the content/tone here suggests they're legitimate, but I'm pretty sure that some of the shills come here just to complain about all of the shills. This is far from the only self-post here complaining about all of the astroturf, and it's never the regulars I recognize posting them. I think that they want us to know that they're here, they want to make us paranoid. They want us to feel like no one can be trusted.

       right on and great post by the way. im never going to stop speaking out on the evil things the demoncrats do. they hate us because they know were stronger. conservative men are on average more masculine, attractive and intelligent than democrats and this is why they support liberal cultural marxist views. it is their way to keep alpha males out of the gene pool
