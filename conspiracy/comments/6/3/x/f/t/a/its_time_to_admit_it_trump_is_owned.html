<p>For as long as I&#39;ve been alive, every president we have had there have been truthers wanting them out/replaced.</p>

<p>Its not just him, its the whole: deepstate, FED, M.I.C., Bohemian Grove, Banksters, Goldman Sachs derivatives markets/laundering, the Oil industry, Bilderberg, Trilateral commission, NATO, Skull &amp; Bones, Jesuit, Zionist, 1%&#39;er complex.....</p>

<p>How do you do that? You jut want into a bank and take the money? These 1%&#39;ers have their money spread all around in different assets, businesses, real estate.....and even if you succeed in taking money from 1, they will tell all their friends what&#39;s happening and they will move their money into offshore accounts, then what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well then you better get started now if you expect to get anything done.  i&#39;d start with the hackers, they can get you the money you would need for the rest of them to fall in line. </p>

<p>alternatively, you could keep it cheap and focus on removing money through destruction or redistribution of good and services created by the more openly corrupt corporations.  you just need a handful of clever individuals with a moderate amount of free time on their hands.  you do it like they do in prison, pick the biggest one in the yard and end them, the rest are more likely to fall in line then to risk the same happening to them.  </p>

<p>as for banks and lawyers, i wouldn&#39;t expect they would be necessary</p>

<p>You would need these guys, in order to sign over all the assets they have invested in real estate, corporations, energy, etc. If we are going to break down their organizational assets in order for redistribution then it has to be done correctly with all the paperwork in order as well.</p>

<p>You can hack banks and move money that way, but these 1%&#39;ers have the majority of their assets wrapped up in stocks and corporate/media ownership. So say you go after the guys who own MSM so you can cut off the propaganda arm, you&#39;re going to need legal paperwork in place that shows the new owners control the MSM and have to now start reporting the truth on Deepstate and all the bullshit going on</p>

<p>no one said it would be easy.  if it was going to be easy, voting or protesting would have taken care of this by now.  statistically, reddit should have all the resources it needs to stage an overthrow of our masters.  too bad that isn&#39;t what it is intended for.  </p>
