       they're building up to that, you need to change public sentiment. Right now Iraq and Afghanistan are fresh in our minds so we need to be "convinced" so to speak about invading.

       I guess you're right, I'm still looking but I thought this was worked out from a legal standpoint under Bush and expanded by Obama.

       seem to be the main excuse, although it's been trampled on by Bill Clinton, Bush, Obama &amp; Hillary and now Trump.  Especially the party where you have to provide 48hr notice to congress.  Seems like no one has ever been held accountable for itt would be nice if they were.

       Exactly, it's "legal" in the sense that taking military action without Congressional approval has been so commonplace for the last 70 years that it has created a de facto political reality where the explicit demand for Congressional approval may as well not even exist in the Constitution. Pretty infuriating, really.

       It really has been.  I've been speaking out against the powers the executive branch has been granting itself since Bush, then under Obama, and now in the hands of Trump.  This situation is literally what I have been saying the whole time, "You may like your guy in office, but what if the next guy is out of his mind?".
      </p>
      <p>
       What really scares me, is Trump just learned he can bomb a country at anytime.  He just pulled the trigger and may have realized the power at his finger tips.

       I love how it's not considered a declaration of war when we bomb the crap out of someone.

       Just some random conflicts that came to mind- not in chronological order; Grenada, Panama, Libya, Somali, Yugoslavia/Bosnia/Herzegovina, all of Central America at various points, and various African countries that I can't spell or remember.

       I'm not following your train of thought now. "My" wars? The rest of the world knows the conflicts were illegal?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a matter of perspective on the justification for the conflicts. South Koreans in the 50s would never have called US involvement in their war illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presidents have some room to move under the War Powers Act. Only Congress can declare war or authorize use of military force. As long as congress approves, it is not illegal in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm sure the Taliban felt the US invasion of Afghanistan was illegal. I also assume Saddam felt the same way and let's not forget what happened in Libya.

       Not your wars personally. I mean invasions -- such as Iraq -- that the majority of the international community either decried as illegal (by the UN) and/or declined to participate in.

       I mean, Iraq was a clusterfuck and certainly one of the biggest lies America was sold on in recent history.

       I'll take a shot at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drone strikes are seen as surgical strikes against specific targets with the intent of minimal collateral damage and hopefully 0 civilian casualties.  To this degree they're acceptable to the American public, mainly because they're portrayed by the media as only being used to take out targets using unconventional warfare(terrorists) as there are no concrete military targets available.
      </p>
      <p>
       50 tomahawk middles launched at an airbase is also a surgical strike.  But it's targeting a conventional force, and does not minimize collateral damage. In other words; an act of war.

       People are screaming WW3 like the U.S. hasn't been bombing Syria for years. The Obama administration authorized over 26,000 bombings in 2016 alone people!! You're all letting the media sway you!! Why do you think CNN was pushing so hard to wage war and when Trump takes action he's ridiculed?? THE MEDIA IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON PEOPLE

       "Doesn't matter anymore" is right, basically the way around that is they call it something else.  I guess the founders should have spelled out "we cannot attack unless we have declared war"
