        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>President Trump just carried out an air strike against the Syrian regime. Something he advocated AGAINST his entire campaign. Something he CRITICIZED Obama for. This man is a liar. Plain and simple. He had been corrupted by power even more so than he already was. I&#39;m not sure how many of the Trumpers who joined this sub were here before the election, but please please please. If you were a member of this sub before and were tricked by this conman into thinking he would change things, please realize what is happening right before your eyes. The most evil part of our country is the Military Industrial Complex. Full disclosure: I was a Bernie supporter and saw the only silver lining in Trump&#39;s presidency was his foreign policy and his stances against interventionism but he just did away with that. There is NO more silver lining. He is part of the machine and fell for the Deep State&#39;s trap. We still don&#39;t know if the chemicals that affected innocent children was perpetrated by the Syrian regime but Trump decided to attack anyway. </p>

<p>I hope you can see now, that he is going to maintain the Deep State and not only that, but strengthen it. This is sad. It&#39;s terrible. No other way to put it. Even if just one former conspiracy member turned Trump supporter decides to stop supporting him, then I have no regrets about this post. </p>

<p>Just love your families, friends and have love for your fellow humans. That&#39;s the most important thing above all else. </p>

<p>Peace. </p>

<p>yeah i don&#39;t know what to think. I do think majority of the people in his cabinet are all M.I.C. linked so they are going to sway him to their bidding like the billions reinvested in the military...for what...when we already are the biggest. Its all a fucking money play and its complex as fuck.....The bankers are against us, radical islam is against us, the globalists are against us, the M.I.C. is against us, the democrats/neocons/GOP shills are against us, the 1%&#39;ers are against us, Soros/Rothsch1lds against us, the federal reserve against us, deepstate against us....</p>

<p>Seriously, even if trump had good intentions, he&#39;s one guy at war with a few hundred 1%ers all of whom have trillions at their disposable, private mercenary groups, currency manipulation oil/energy control...</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;ll start with the phrase &quot;Actions speak louder than words.&quot; Go back and look at his own tweets where he criticized Obama for doing things more minuscule than this in Syria and he calls them acts of war. </p>

<p>I only say this, because before this election where not one person on this sub supported the president or those in power. People here were always critical and this sub needs to get back to its roots. Again, sorry for insulting your intelligence and saying those things. </p>

<p>I would just like to say that I am not a Trump supporter(anymore).  I know he went against his statements, just like all previous POTUS. However, as i said in another comment, you have to question both sides to come up with a logical answer.  Even if you don&#39;t support it.  </p>

<p>Now, about this sub and it being one sided.  Sometimes you have to stay quiet and let the people learn for themselves like alot of us have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend,</p>

<p>I was here, and still am here, after being banned dozens of times by Pro-Trump mods. This post will likely get me banned again, but no regrets.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is a shadow, a shallow shadow, of what is needed to command this nation, the greatest the planet has ever seen.</p>

<p>Trump is ill equipped to guide this nation, and the world, on a path toward peace and reconciliation.</p>

<p>Trump is a resolute warmonger and a narcissist who us consumed only by himself and his family and how the world regards them.</p>

<p>He is not fit for anything aside from what he was doing before now, which was essentially conning and stealing from anyone stupid enough to do business with him.</p>

<p>Let him be impeached and imprisoned by August and I will be happy.</p>

<p>No apologies to the Trump lovers. You bought a con and you should be revealed publicly to live with your choice.</p>

<p>Trump should die in a Federal Prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think they all got bait and switched hella hard. At a certain point, he&#39;s flipped on issues seamlessly, allowing his position to appease whoever he wanted to.. The only &quot;right&quot; move here, based on his hard stance of stamping out violence and terrorism, was what he did.. Like.. He put himself in this corner. He should&#39;ve said no. Could&#39;ve said no. The ramifications of putting in a supposed con-man in office are blatant. Even when the campaign smearing began, I hoped that if he won, he&#39;d stick to his alleged values and not be the same. And I feel like most people who looked toward him with optimism feel the same way. We hoped against hope that the gut instinct was wrong but man.. What a let down. Like I said on another thread, I hope his administration allows de escalation soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s all be honest here for a moment. When did the US goverment ever care about the deaths of civilians of foreign nations? Never, that&#39;s when. They only <em>pretend</em> to care when they can use those deaths to do what they want to do anyway -- in this case, overthrow Assad. </p>

<p>Everyone knows Assad did not gas anybody. Probably even Trump knows it. But it is being used as an excuse by the Zionists to force American involvement in Syria, which Israel has salivated after for a decade. Netanyahu is pulling Trump&#39;s string, and Trump is responding like a true bitch. This sickens me. I actually believed Trump would make a difference. But every day that goes by, the elite sink their claws into him a little deeper. He&#39;s just another puppet.</p>

<p>You elected a billionaire that was appointing other billionaires to fix a system that made them billionaires. </p>

<p>You entertain the circus that is the electoral process. It is nothing but a show. The end result is ALWAYS the same. It&#39;s a small group of people that pull the strings.</p>

The services they provide could easily be provided by a private company. </p>

<p>But hey, government must be great. It&#39;s the brilliant idea that we give a small group of people the right to kidnap, steal from, and kill us, so that we can be &quot;protected&quot; from the people who kidnap, steal from, and kill us. </p>

<p>At any rate, I posted this in another thread, but I feel it can and should be posted here too. We as a people have to start talking about breaking away from this nonsense and looking to each other as communities to help each other and survive. The government that we depend on is throughly fraudulent and has no accountability to us, only the wealthy and powerful. We need to start considering other alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Already explained to someone else here but ultimately the problem with government is that its unethical.</p>

<p>Why do you expect a system that at its core is unethical will propel mankind forward?</p>

<p>There is nothing voluntary about taxation. There is nothing free and fair about taxation. Democracy is the opposite of free and fair, because it determines beyond the will of an individual what that person&#39;s stake is in the State. If the majority want something, the minority lose. Who represents them? Someone always isn&#39;t going to be represented equally. Why must a majority preside of the affairs of the minority? If you don&#39;t freely volunteer your wages (your property) regardless, you are jailed and threatened under the sword to pay it regardless. What percentage of my work are you entitled to?</p>

<p>Taxation by definition, is compulsory. Compulsion is the opposite of free and fair consensual. </p>

<p>You can argue that it&#39;s a necessary evil at best, and that we&#39;d maybe all somehow start killing eachother if laws didn&#39;t exist or we&#39;d all suddenly stop fixing broken roads or that companies wouldn&#39;t do anything cause &quot;without government, we can&#39;t do anything on our own&quot;</p>

You really think businesses would do any better, if not worse than the government does? The difference between them is the government does actually do some good with your tax dollars (or used to, those programs are getting gutted as we speak), a business exists for the sole purpose of making itself money.

An entity that has put people in camps and has encouraged slavery. Has tried to control what we put in our own bodies; like the prohibition. An entity that kills children with drone strikes and hospitals. </p>

<p>Now do you really think a private corporation that can actually be held accountable is a worse option? Sounds naieve. Private corporations with eventually do what the people want because if they don&#39;t; they&#39;ll lose business to a corporation that does. Thats how the &#39;real&#39; free market is supposed to work. Not with regulations like you have now that limit smaller groups and make the giants have monopolies.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not gonna lie; getting responses like yours are very rare.</p>

<p>Always good to see someone with an open-mind. People usually only like truths that fit their &#39;truths&#39;. </p>

<p>Capitalism isn&#39;t &#39;evil&#39;. Capitalism can be as harmless as a kid selling lemonade. It&#39;s honestly just an exchange of goods between two people that agreed on the exchange. If two people consented to the trade, why would it be bad? Or why should anyone else care as long as the two people that did said trade are satisfied?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re more interested in these topics; you can read on &#39;natural-law&#39;. The &#39;GoldandBlack&#39; subreddit and sometimes (Trolls go there too) the &#39;Anarcho_Capitalism&#39; sub are a good place to ask questions on the topic. A good beginner book to get into everything is &#39;The Anatomy of the State&#39;</p>

<p><a href="https://mises.org/library/anatomy-state">https://mises.org/library/anatomy-state</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s really short, they have audio versions on youtube I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>If you want to good full ham on truth and knowledge, the most important you could possibly learn in a lifetime maybe; I&#39;d highly recommend Mark Passio&#39;s semminar on natural law. Can find it on youtube. It&#39;s like 6 hours long but, you can always chip away at it.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>

<p>The most disappointing thing for me is to see long-time members of this sub fall for the very same things they have talked at length about on other topics. We have articles about forum sliding in our sidebar, for example, and they merrily took part in sliding the forum. There&#39;s no shame in being a Useful Idiot. It&#39;s not their fault they were manipulated by potent psychological techniques. The shame will only come if they continue to deny that they were duped and continue to follow their pied-piper.</p>

<p>At any rate, I posted this in another thread, but I feel it can and should be posted here too. We as a people have to start talking about breaking away from this nonsense and looking to each other as communities to help each other and survive. The government that we depend on is throughly fraudulent and has no accountability to us, only the wealthy and powerful. We need to start considering other alternatives.</p>

<p>You lay into corporate billionaires yet suggest that private companies can do better even as you state that the government is only operating on behalf of corporate billionaires. I feel that you are missing the point of your own belief system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it a little ironic that you express dissent towards the one percent but advocate for a privatized government? You really think businesses would do any better, if not worse than the government does? The difference between them is the government does actually do some good with your tax dollars (or used to, those programs are getting gutted as we speak), a business exists for the sole purpose of making itself money. Just look at th state of healthcare in the US. That&#39;s just a little taste of what a privatized government would be like</p>
