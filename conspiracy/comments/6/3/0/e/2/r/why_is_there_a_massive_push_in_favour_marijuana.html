        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yeah I get it was intentionally supressed and made illegal for baseless reasons in the past. And yes I support it being legalized and ive smoked it a few times in the past as well.</p>

<p>My issue however is that isn&#39;t it kind of odd that all of a sudden you have this overwhelmingly one sided positive PR on marijuana and you hear almost nothing bad about it? </p>

<p>Ive read articles claiming everything that marijuana smoking makes you more intelligent to curing malignant brain tumors. If I google it&#39;s negative effects I find almost nothing about that. I can find more on the negative effects of masturbation then I can on weed. I find that hard to believe. Constant smoke inhalation, messing with your brain receptors and strict behavioral changes that I&#39;ve seen in long term smokers personally should induce a healthy dose of skepticism.</p>

<p>I mean is it really that far fetched to think that there is some kind of conspiracy to push marijuana and suppress its negative effects? </p>

<p>Personally I really feel like somethings going on here. Like how certain musical celebrities are pushed regardless of talent and just by the shear numbers of people listening to them, they become megastars. Sure there&#39;s a contribution of their gifts and talents but by far it&#39;s the powers that be, the old men in suits in the music industry that pull the trigger to decide that.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem that impossible for drugs. Marijuana is a huge industry tobacco once was and they need more and more people on board. It&#39;ll create more jobs in America then manufacturing and a bunch of other stuff. So really their is a very strong incentive to suppress any negative effects.</p>

<p>Our bodies just happen to have the receptors, without them, it would do nothing for us.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t find anything bad because it&#39;s not bad for humans, if you use it all day everyday, yea there is changes but nothing detrimental health related</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I just can&#39;t believe that smoking something everyday won&#39;t have a negative effect on you somehow. I&#39;ve seen two of my own roommates become reclusive, paranoid and borderline violent over the two years they began smoking marijuana regularly. Also just by virtue of the act of smoking itself one has to recognize that constant smoke inhalation just can&#39;t be good for you in the long term.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s purely tax money. That&#39;s why it&#39;s been allowed to be legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya, but you&#39;re wrong. Do more research, it cures diseases and helps many people with depression, anorexia, etc. As someone who smokes frequently, its the best thing for me, I don&#39;t drink, and smoking relaxes my mind, connects me stronger to my spirituality, gives me answers I am seeking if I&#39;m stressed, makes me laugh and enjoy life on a whole more. </p>

<p>Look at someone like Snoop dogg, dude smokes blunts and an insane amount of weed all day everyday for decades. There are thousands upon thousands of people who live that way and are completely fine. Sounds like you&#39;re roommates probably have other issues, it&#39;s not weed thats the problem</p>

<p>Except weed. Aside from getting arrested with it and doing a few years in the pokie (I know, huge exception). </p>

<p>It had no other negative impact on my life. If it would have been legal I don&#39;t even think the rest of my life would have played out how it did. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sober for years, and my life is amazing now. And I stay away from pot because I am just so compulsive it is dangerous to engage in any usage. But pot is the only thing I miss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you&#39;re not wrong my personal experience is if I smoke it multiple times a day for multiple days of the week I feel sluggish and easily irritated in the following days. Can&#39;t think as clearly and not as much motivation. I&#39;m more productive if I simply smoke once or twice a week or not at all. Everybody is different so don&#39;t go calling people wrong for talking about something they observed. You can list all the benefits and I will whole heartedly agree. I&#39;ll argue till I&#39;m blue in the face for legalization. But it&#39;s naive to think just because it has a million different benefits that it can only have positive effects on every aspect of life with every single person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man just a personal anecdote </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been smoking weed EVERY DAY since I was 16. I credit weed to my spiritual awakening. I credit weed with my creative insight. I credit weed with opening my mind and my heart. I credit weed with helping my social anxiety. I credit weed with helping me relax and unwind.</p>

<p>Daily smoke inhalation isn&#39;t great for you. But marijuana smoke inhalation is far far much better than tobacco smoke inhalation.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ve been smoking every day since I was 16. I&#39;m 24 now. My girlfriend and I live with each other. And literally smoke all the time with each other.</p>

<p>It just depends on the person really. All in all, no one has died from marijuana, and while it does make some people paranoid it&#39;s hardly something to be scared of worried of</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I own several businesses, play golf 5 times a week, swim several times a week, have a great relationship with myself, my friends, family, work and spirituality. I attribute a huge amount of my creativity, passion, success, mental health all to marijuana. My wife and I smoke all the time and have been together 6 years, no drinking, no partying, no BS. Alcohol is a poison and drinking, opiates, etc. is just not for me. To each their own but just look at the countless people who smoke all day everyday and they&#39;re doing just fine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the paranoia is because of the illegality, it&#39;s the &quot;what if i get caught&quot; factor that intensifies after consumption. cannabis is an eye opening medication. if it becomes legalized nationwide and everyone starts using it, and not limited to just smoking it, people will start aligning back with the Truth and by that i mean the <em>Ultimate Truth</em>, because cannabis makes it stick out so obviously in this world full of lies. </p>

<p>i was living in a legal state for a while and sometimes I would trip over things like the CIA is watching me...tapping into my phone, out to MKULTRA me lol....stupid things like that, but in the end its not really stupid, because we live in a reality where they actually do these things, things even when sober i have to personally deal with sometimes, its just when im sober i dont see it as important enough to trip over, which is honestly bad. i rather us all be paranoid and deal with the problems than acting complacent to it, which is what i mean by aligning back to the Truth. </p>

<p>If you are talking about the federal government, weed is atill federally illegal and banks wont allow you to process payments or deposit in accounts. Overall the industry still remains at a cash to cash. There isnt a government mandate  needed to open the doors, states simply exercised state rights to host ballots to have the people decide. California has been trying to get the proposition past for years and it finally happened along with the other states.
State votes actually matters to some extend unlike presidential elections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I buy the legal taxation angle as adequate incentive for TPTB. Perhaps state governments would be keen on the revenue, but could it top the amount of revenue the DEA and other federal entities collect from seizing assets, etc? Maybe the increase in domestic growing makes weed a less profitable crop, meaning the intelligence community won&#39;t reap the black budget dollars from importing to the US that it used to. There&#39;s also the private prison complex whose profits would suffer greatly if weed were legalized everywhere; they depend on people using and selling this nearly benign but illegal substance to stuff our prisons. All in all, there&#39;s a huge fucking gravy train that would take a significant blow under full legalization. But certainly worth deeper investigation when you see MSM pushing any narrative in unison.</p>

<p>Here are the anti marjuana people:</p>

<p>Big pharma
Big tabacco
Alcohol producers
Prison industrial complex
Fbi,cia, dea anyone involved in the war on drugs</p>

<p>A lot of the tax money goes towards school funding. Also only a few states have fully legalized and even then its still not federally legal so major banks wont accept money from dispencaries.</p>

<p>Much to your ignorance, its not old men in suits that are leading the push. Its the people and majority being small to mid size business owners running the dispencaries. There isnt a giant monsanto conglomerate growing weed, most are supplied by people growing from thier own setup. This is as middle class as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>artificially happy is what drugs do that&#39;s why you use them they release dopamine the happy brain chemical.  i think the plant is wonderful it does have medicinal uses yes but tptb will use it to control you.  i smoked  for more than 20 years i have seen dealers use it to control people, withhold to punish people, or discredit people.  as for 2 pound per year you can harvest in 3 month from germination, somebody like Monsanto grow field of the stuff would be very profitable compared to other crops there are strains just as good as the best hydro that are outdoor and they are much better for you to.  I am not against legalization but it will make your opinions on things invalid and it will be used to discriminate against you will be exploited and controlled this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at hashish usage in young men in Afghanistan, you see why it&#39;s useful for a government to push THC to the masses. In painful circumstances, people tend to run to some sorts of escape. This can be alcohol, drugs, abuse of others or self ((or even animals) as a pain redirection), or religion.  In Afghanistan, for the poor, the best escape is marijuana. It&#39;s cheap or free; grows all over the place. Opium is expensive in comparison. Even women and children are smoking it now.</p>

<p>These stoners are a complete waste. The don&#39;t earn, they don&#39;t produce, they don&#39;t protect. They perform no role in society. They are dysfunctional.  </p>

<p>Have a look at this short video &quot;The hashish Army&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2F80llZ5F4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2F80llZ5F4</a>  </p>

<p>Yes, Afghanistan is an extreme case. But sometimes extreme circumstances show you what you otherwise miss. If these young men were not constantly stoned, they could be fighting government corruption, learning or building.  </p>

<p>So my feeling on this is the following: If you allow easy access to marijuana today as a recreational drug, tomorrow when things get rough, the logical course of action would be to run to the escape mechanism.<br/>
PedoGate news got you down? get high.<br/>
Economy is bad, you&#39;re burdened with debt you can&#39;t pay off? get high.<br/>
Government corruption and injustice burning you? get high.  </p>

<p>Hashish has always been a part of culture in Afghanistan. But it wasn&#39;t abused like it is today. Whats the difference? circumstance got worst, so usage increased exponentially. There are people who spend every waking moment stoned. They don&#39;t harm anyone; they don&#39;t benefit anyone either. They just exist.  </p>

<p>Perfect control of the masses...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe with your loser mentalilty but dont make assumption for all pot smokers.</p>

<p>In case you didnt know weed isnt free. Colorado is at 10 billion dollar revenue, you tell me how to make 10 billion by being unproductive and a &quot;complete waste&quot;. Stoners have jobs too thats where they get money to buy weed. Just because your square ass is afraid of weed dont project your insecurities by generalizing an entire group of people with your shitty sources. 
If anything you are a good example of being in the demographics of the brainwash controlled mass based on your information on weed. </p>
