<p>Reddit is a captured space that has been sold out to the moneyed class, and they&#39;re waging a political war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at Russia as an adversary, not an enemy. Sure they&#39;re corrupt as anyone, but for the most part they just want to rise from the ashes, prosper, compete, maintain their borders and stop allowing U.S. interests to dictate global policy with such a heavy hand.</p>

<p>I wish more people would broaden things and stop allowing themselves to be guided so easily by back n&#39; forth nonsense. It won&#39;t stop, though. People gobble this stuff up in order to feel inclusive, debate it poorly, all while ignoring the need to first educate themselves on how things really work out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you follow conspiracy long enough you realize everything is subject to opinion. This sub used to be reserved for people that actually thought interesting things about controversial topics. Now it feels like the controversial topic isn&#39;t that interesting because it&#39;s the same old topic over and over. The worst part is most people on this sub have been pointing out this specific topic for years, maybe even before reddit was invented, and people are just now getting on board in a place that used to be reserved for all kinds of tin-foil hat wearers. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just see people being exploited for political gain. An easy mark, derived from the very nature of &quot;theory&quot;. Targeted for that reason alone and the underlying traits of people who tend to entertain them. It&#39;s a complex problem, but I know people see what&#39;s going on here. Instead of working to identify and improve things, they&#39;ll just blame the mods--who can&#39;t really do much. You cannot ban politics outright, that would be absurd (e.g Watergate), but people really need to take a hard look at what they&#39;re swallowing in regards to current events and the efforts to sway opinion here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about right or left is both sides are right about some things and wrong about others. Let&#39;s say you agree with x political person 51% because out of 100 policies this person votes 51 ways you would. The other 49% you don&#39;t approve of but the other guy or gal has far worst percentages. In the US democracy we play this game with far worst results, like politician y has 3% in your because the next one has even less percentages. Now depending on your moral understanding, family demographic, and geography among many other factors you pick a representative.</p>

<p>This person doesn&#39;t represent you in the slightest, even if you like them, due in large part to the way the numbers break down. Of course you can&#39;t get your way all 100 percent of the time, but why call it a democracy when it isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Sorry to derail, I just wish people realized the bigger picture about the politics that people take for granted. We vote of people that are supposed to vote for the majority, unless money is involved, and that changes everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problems relate to complexity and under-education. Even if you have a strong foundation in history and political science, things are enormously complex. But, people have no interest in that. It&#39;s like sports. When your local team goes to a championship game you&#39;ll see all sorts of people come out the woodwork to blindly follow along. They think they&#39;re representing their area, but forget that none of the people on that team are even from their area--and they&#39;re millionaires to boot.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to have an opinion, to feel inclusive or relevant. All the while neglecting the absolute fact that their really are no teams, as they tend to understand them. </p>

<p>Just yesterday someone told me to be happy on &quot;my bridge&quot;--insinuating that I take a convenient, easy out. No. My bridge is mobile. It moves and changes form like an Autobot. I do not vote for &quot;party&quot;. I vote for whom is most likely to improve lives and not be utterly corrupt in the process. And that has little to do with one individual person. The POTUS, for example, doesn&#39;t make sweeping decisions on his own. They have advisers, think tanks, lawyers, and all manner of other coaches directing things along. A bigger picture. There&#39;s nothing simple about it.</p>

<p>No one knows what they&#39;re talking about, but persist anyways. In all of their naivete, other, smarter people are here in this sub directing them right along. Puffing them up, keeping things simple, in hopes that the toxicity spreads forth among the lowest common denominator. But, it&#39;s the mod&#39;s fault. Horseshit. People are lazy.</p>

<p>And the links..My god. Apparently it&#39;s too much for these politically astute forum guru&#39;s to consider that a website is not proof of anything. You can make up any wild idea in your head and I&#39;ll find something to counter it. No one considers where it came from, who wrote it, where the money goes, who they&#39;re connected to, etc. Just surface stuff, and people take it as gospel. The &quot;truth&quot; is harder to find than people care to admit in this digital age..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk why but your comment made me think of flat earthers and how hard it is to convince people the world is this or that way. The thing that gets me about education is that people get indoctrinated into an institution with a set agenda, whatever that may be, and free thinking tends to take a back seat.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say NASA faked the moon landing. Ok how do we prove it, or disprove it? We can&#39;t really, at some point it just becomes faith. Do I have faith in NASA, or the US propaganda machine, or someone&#39;s opinion forced on me I cannot readily check on my own without being lead down a mysterious path of confusion sprinkled with bits of reason and excuses?</p>

<p>Politics, to me, is a warped game of catch me if you can with faith being the cornerstone. Of course the system is complex, but the amount of nonsense that is generated is disturbing.</p>

<p>The mantra these days are politicans lie always, that&#39;s how they get into office. Having any faith in that system is just difficult for me especially now with the reality TV star we have now as POTUS. And no I&#39;m not saying Hillary or Bernie would he much better.</p>

<p>I think anarchy is the way to go. Well, even that has drawbacks. Maybe a democracy based on AI that computes needs for everyone and spits it out in some algorithm we can all agree with. It can&#39;t be much worst than what we have now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading a comment recently about how we (American&#39;s at least) are taught in schools. It&#39;s all dates, memory exercises, and so forth. As adults we tend to almost view our past, present or future on wars--and that&#39;s the only significant marker. We&#39;re not taught to really look into to things deeply. There&#39;s a term that a lot of college folks like to throw around here, but I won&#39;t say it. I hate buzzwords like that. I think it&#39;s part of the problem. Not the concept, but the phrase itself.</p>

<p>We&#39;re short-term, go hard, surface level people who are led along to be patriotic and focus our attentions toward &quot;the victor&#39;s history&quot; at all times. </p>

<p>I often get into it with the pedo chasers. It boils down to one thing and one thing alone: It rests its case upon the inability to disprove something which has not yet established substance. Not a real tricky thing, but no one seems to catch on. Just blind support, laziness. </p>

<p>I have no problem speculating about things. None. It&#39;s often fun, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I just take issue in presenting ideas and &quot;what ifs&quot; as undeniable fact. In most cases it&#39;s harmless, but in terms of current political fervor it&#39;s unproductive and really painful to watch. With that pedo thing, it can be shown to be dangerous even.</p>

<p>People are being politically exploited here and it&#39;s gone to critical extremes. It&#39;s always been a slight issue, I was here 5-6 ago, but it seems the conditioning of it has crept up to a point that no one cares, or are too lazy in making an effort to combat it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it feels like we as a collective are moving in a direction to pick sides, and the ones pointing out the things that we are are left in utter disillusionment as to what is happening. Look at fake news as an example. When first recognizing just how easy it is for a publication to put a pro or anti x agenda out there you start realizing just how complicated the system can get. And this is from the outside looking in. Once you realize just how wealthy some individuals are you can start asking yourself where the incentives lie and it becomes this game of cat and mouse mentally. Looking into the rabit hole then convincing people it&#39;s worth understanding makes me realize ignorance is bliss for a reason. Too much knowledge of this stuff will drive you mad.</p>

<p>Latley, with the situation as it is, it feels like the world is in full spin mode and something happened that shouldn&#39;t have. This leads me to the inevitable conclusion (which for all I know could be taught through indoctrination) that we are headed into a world war 3 scenario. Everyday I hear something about politics that is concerning, and the part that is concerning is that people buy this or that story, not the actual story that either side could be playing a fool.</p>

<p>This leads me to question if I am the fool for thinking others simply don&#39;t see the issue that has been going on in US politics for some time now. Storytelling and who writes the story. Obviously people read them, obviously people make opinions based on the story.</p>

<p>It feels surreal, how many sides are there to this thing. Remaining divided has led us to this situation and if the past is any indicator we know where it leads us. I think there is a growing anxiety among people about this, which is good in some respects, but I fear people don&#39;t understand how to see past petty differences and accept truth for what it is, subjective. At least that&#39;s what I think it is, I could be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too much information. We have all of this knowledge at our fingertips, but have seemingly rescinded in our abilities to discern reality. It seems overwhelming, because it is. We are bombarded from a billion directions all at once, and people get real agitated when you refuse to pick a side. All of these complexities, but people are insistent on dumbing it down into 2 camps. It must be one or the other. No room for discussion, no time to waste! Choose your fighter!</p>

<p>That&#39;s ridiculous, and this latest American election really set some things in motion beyond what I&#39;ve ever seen in my lifetime. It has some really staying power. It&#39;s toxic. Everyone is covered in it. You can&#39;t go anywhere now without hearing a lazy presentation about their views. It&#39;s volunteered information, shoved down your gullet. Thing is, no one knows what the hell their talking about--just that they should be talking about it. It&#39;s maddening.</p>

<p>The media has been dead awhile now, finally in its death throes. The days of Walter Cronkite are gone, and will never return. It&#39;s been bad for decades, but this last election really did them in. I compare it to police body cameras and filming by the public. We always knew abuse happened, but was never really honest with ourselves about the depths of it until it smacked us right in the face...live and on demand!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question I&#39;ve been seeking to answer since I can remember, is there a way to run the world fairly? No ruling class, no war, no poverty, essentially a utopia.</p>

<p>My mind leads me to two things, both of which are abysmal. The first being success and the world being boring since there is no competition. The second being slavery to the system on a global scale. In either event no matter how it plays out the world will live on with or without humans and all the damage we do to it. And even if it doesn&#39;t, with the knowledge of the universe (that we have now) it would be fine without one planet that one species manage to mess up.</p>

<p>I just really like to question if we collectively have become so docile that it plays out the way dooms dayers say it will. Is it fear mongering or reality? Or are we stuck in a failing system that has pushed it&#39;s collective problems along so far it hasn&#39;t a choice but to recede and self implode?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to be optimistic about the future, but so many people are close minded to the nature of conflict. I&#39;d like to think humankind could move past their petty differences brought on by greed and selfishness. But I feel our species is just incapable of breaking the cycle of war for self betterment.</p>

<p>If we could destroy all the weapons in the world, we&#39;d fight with sticks. If we could destroy all the hate in the world, we would hate it. But maybe that is the way it is meant to be.</p>

Progressively emptying ourselves--into ourselves. Everyone moans about what they call &quot;depression&quot;, but fail to see the error in their lifestyle. Most of us do not. We&#39;re a selfish bunch. Short term everything. We enjoy dreaming of the future, better times, no wars, no one starving, a more inclusive, educated, and passive society. Sounds swell, but in practice we fail miserably. A pipe dream is all it is. </p>

<p>In my view, not only will a civil cataclysm happen, I think it needs to in order to save humankind as a whole. A reboot is inevitable, perhaps by design(?). Who knows, but we&#39;re on the wrong path.</p>

Okay enough to engage in it, debate it, give it platform. What should be done is calling these people out for what they are before their content is even considered.

<p>The truth hurts man. I have no interest in reading your post history, I honestly don&#39;t care who you are or what you are about. The simple fact that you believe ONE DOWNVOTE is worth anything says enough about you. Reddit is a game, a popularity contest, and people pay real money for upvotes. Your downvote is worthless.</p>
