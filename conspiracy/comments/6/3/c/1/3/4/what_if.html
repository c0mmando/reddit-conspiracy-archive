       What if we are supposed to think for ourselves..   What if critical thinking is what is missing..   What if all this is supposed to teach us that we are supposed to ask questions,  but not with someone giving us answers,  with us, individually,  seeking answers on our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example..   No one needs to believe me that I was spied on..   I mean who am I to be spied on.  What power do i have?   But i know i saw a nano drone.   I know that drone was real.    I know that my phone call to my girlfriend at the time was tapped..   Why?   I don't know.   But it was..  I heard the background conversation talking about my conversation.   Why,  i don't know.    But tell others,  convince others...  No.   Not important to me.   I know its real...
      </p>
      <p>
       The end game is the theory.   The conspiracy is the why.    The facts are up to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever meet someone who is not "awake". And think , " thank God,   they couldn't handle the truth".  Its like a red light or stop sign on a deserted street at night.   Its there because some people need it,  some of us don't need it to know that we are at a crossroads and to be careful.   Its there and we follow the rules because some people are not capable of thinking for themselves..  Some of us are...   Does that make sense?

       I get what you are saying, but somewhat disagree. Why do we need the stop sign and why are you implying others need said stop sign? We all have inherit feelings of danger and were always taught to look both ways when crossing the street. I should not have to be hinder because a small minority of people are dumb fucks. Let nature take it's course..  Kinda funny, actually... Was having a similar discussion with a buddy the other day...

       No.   I just know..    Some people need that stop sign.     I'm not an elitist,   because I have nothing outside the norm.   Just know a lot of people who need that stop sign.

       You're an elitist if you think you should speak on behalf of anyone else. That is the damn problem.. Too many people think they know what is best for everyone else. You could not live one day in my shoes. Same can be said about me to you... We know... Self rule....

       I'm not pissed, quite the contrary. Me and a buddy had this same arguement the other night. Tis' an interesting thought. I don't think people need "stop signs", he does... Nothing got settled then, as well. We agreed to disagree....

       Like..  Do i need a law to tell me that driving fast is dangerous...   No.   But if speed kills,  why are cars legally allowed to surpass 80 mph.   I hit a certain speed,  i know i should slow down..   Thanks for pulling me over and giving me a ticket for a speed i was handling just fine..  Lol

       It's actually the opposite, if you are curious. I have someone I know in the business/math/science. The lower speed causes more accidents than the higher speed. It's speed differential. Very interesting. When a granny is going ~50 but the rest are going ~70, it;s the granny causing the accidents....

       Oh..  I get it.   I got pulled over because an officer was confused at why i was doing the speed limit in the left lane and traffic was going much faster.   I said because i was doing the speed limit.   He thought i was on drugs.   I just wasn't in the mood to go "fast". .  I need a law to tell me how fast i am capable of driving?   No.    Its all fuxked up..  Lol

       I don't understand. Human nature doesn't have a particular destination in mind. There's no supposed to and there's no grand plan. As a whole, and over time, we are always ideally suited to our niche. Everything is always as it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some individuals possess superior critical thinking skills, and if those skills give them a survival or reproductive advantage, the human race as a whole will grow to be more like those individuals over a long period of time. But it's never the case that wherever we end up was an intended destination.
      </p>
      <p>
       For there to be a supposed to there must be a 'correct' goal or destination and many wrong ones. I don't know how to conceptualize this without a master or deity. Ya see what I'm sayin?

       Yes..  I believe in a higher power,  but i can't say that is what is right.   Maybe the higher power or master or deity that we or I believe is just natural consciousness.

       Have you ever tried to "enlighten" someone and they call you crazy.   You have never shown or done anything crazy..  Yet they suddenly tell you that's crazy talk.   So,  you just walk away thinking,  i guess they just don't get it.

       Questions can not be answered unless you ask the question and a question is never stupid if someone doesn't know the answer either. The only question you will never know the answer to is the question you don't ask. Most intellectual people understand this. Conspiracy people know this and don't just take the narrative as factual. We look for facts to back up our questions and not a narrative. So your never crazy to question something. Take children for example. No one ever called a child crazy cause they asked ask if Santa is real or not. They are not believing the narrative pushed because they see something that makes them question it.

        I know that my phone call to my girlfriend at the time was tapped.. Why? I don't know. But it was.. I heard the background conversation talking about my conversation.

       So what you're saying is whoever was listening in on your call
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       to inject their voice traffic into your conversation? There is no way in hell that would be an accident.

       It is far more likely that you are suffering from auditory hallucinations due to mental illness. But you'll never believe that, not least because the mentally ill rarely accept that they are mentally ill.

       You know, I believe you are 100% right. And everyday I forget this fact and try to red pill whenever I can. But the truth is, for me anyways, it was just a set of unlikely coincidences that lead me to conspiracy theories/truth and even then, it's taken me years to entertain some of the "wilder" conspiracy theories. It's so strange to me sometimes, how seemingly random or minor events can lead us on our path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truthfully, I think we do have a responsibility to try to wake up our friends and family, but if they shutdown right away or can't handle it, often this is because they are not ready. I agree with you as well, that there are definitely some people who will always need to be shielded from the truth as best as possible.

       I know people who function perfectly on weed.   I know people who weed is no big deal.   But i don't think  I can function that way when I'm high.   So weed is a bad drug for me.   But not for everyone.   Its illegal because some people should not be allowed to use it.    But who decided that?   Who decided that weed is not safe but alcohol is?   Money..   Power..   Its all a game of power and money and we are stuck dealing with the past.   History and our past is written by the winners...  It doesn't matter right and wrong..  Or just and unjust..   Moral and immoral..   Who won is what we are made to conform to.    I guess we have to win to make change.    But winning takes time..  And time is not a favorable proposition..

       One day there was heavy heavy spraying over my house... I was outside working in my yard with my kids and stopped counting after 50 planes. I live in an area so far in the woods it's still a sight to see aircraft... Anyways I am freaking taking photos and videos of the planes when I just happen to turn around and look behind me. A Predator B drone flying behind my house.  Not saying it was because of me or anything but it was extremely disturbing. First time I have even in my life seen that.

       I have noticed interference in the middle of some of my past phone calls. The background noise would change and I could hear breathing and voices echoing at a different sound level. I have also noticed unexplained signals and nudges from my environment and other potentially "woken" people. 
It's a scary Limbo to live in and I can only laugh about it.

       This is scarily reminiscent of somebody slowly falling into dementia.

       It's actually the opposite, if you are curious. I have someone I know in the business/math/science. The lower speed causes more accidents than the higher speed. It's speed differential. Very interesting. When a granny is going ~50 but the rest are going ~70, it;s the granny causing the accidents....
