        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has anybody else thought about this? </p>

<p>Drugs play a huge role in the awakening of humanity. Remember the 1960&#39;s and LSD? Chapelle talks about it on his new stand up comedy special. LSD and psychedelics are safe, non toxic, non addictive, and come from natural sources on earth. TPTB made sure that the people do not have access to them once they discovered their potential (CIA testing), and they branded them as dangerous substances that could damage your brain. Total lies. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.palmpartners.com/drug-myths-debunked-lsd/">http://blog.palmpartners.com/drug-myths-debunked-lsd/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ccguide.org/young88.php">http://ccguide.org/young88.php</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;16. Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>Interview with Albert Hoffman, Chemist who discovered LSD and frequently used it throughout his life. He lived to be 101 years old.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/SInkOigeGno">https://youtu.be/SInkOigeGno</a></p>

<p>So, they &quot;allow&quot; us to have alcohol and tobacco. Allowing the masses to indulge in these, not only contribute to depopulation (because they kill more people than all the illegal drugs combined), but they keep the masses in a pleasant stupor, forget their troubles, but not question the society they live in. Marijuana is an incredibly important plant, and I think it&#39;s safe to say it has contributed to the awakening of many of us, myself included. </p>

<p>They have no right to tell us what we can and can&#39;t put in our bodies. Fuck them for thinking we will bow down to that request. If I don&#39;t have autonomy over my own body, than I am not truly &quot;free&quot; at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think marijuana recreational legalization might be one of the main things that could create the change in people&#39;s perspectives that is necessary to overcome TPTB.  It is already happening in some states.</p>

<p>I smoked in my high school and college years and it made a tremendous difference; some things positive, other things negative.  Healthier ways of consumption are available such as edibles and probably vaporization although I believe vape is lacking in scientific study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s absolutely correct. The relationship between psychedelic drugs and our spiritual awakening is enough to break through the walls of deception.</p>

<p>They allow you to see the world around you for what it truly is - matter composed of energy in the form of a wave.</p>

<p>Once our government discovered this after WWII, systematic suppression of these drugs became laws in the United States. To keep you from them, of course. Not because they do you any harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, haha many times. Love Leary, and I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on the San Francisco area over the past several years. </p>

<p>There is a lot of information that has lead me to believe that the reason Leary truly left Harvard because he felt the need to be a spiritual in the very pits of hell.</p>

<p>San Francisco is a very spooky place, indeed. If you want to know the origins of the War on Drugs, it was the State of California&#39;s outlaw of LSD in 1965</p>
