</blockquote>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>My point is that anyone who hasn&#39;t been brainwashed during their adolescent years probably will come to the conclusion that modern religion and Jesus are part of the facade.</p>

<p>I think most folks who fall for religion are already looking for that type of control system in their lives. In regards to Christianity it&#39;s the longing for something after this life or a search for a higher calling due to feeling incomplete.</p>

<p>People who have decent morals, self esteem and grasp the concept of self actualization usually don&#39;t go the route of religion since it&#39;s not fulfilling any purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t consider myself religious, or very expert on the field (which is quite too big anyway for a single man to handle imo), but the conspiracy world surely helped me crack the subject deeper.
From your average hedonistic atheist i quite developed into someone who has a high respect for religion (although i don&#39;t plan on joining any).
To me religion is simply an analysis of the &quot;core framework&quot; of man and the world and of the way they interface.
It&#39;s about the functional part of the &quot;program&quot; and helps unfold what has been hidden if read correctly. 
The fact is, religious literature can&#39;t be read literally and has many roadblocks and traps.
There are things that are written in a specific way to repel a kind of people that isn&#39;t going to take the time to think it through from the start off, etc.
Even Jesus, who wanted to teach very badly and who was very much a non-occultist kabbalist for all purposes, had to employ multiple levels of interpretation to just survive 33 years. Think what the true occultists would be like, if you think they are going to make all the possible to make themselves understood or the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Now, this is just ebraism and to some degree christianity, but i also studied some buddah/tao texts and i found basically the same things.</p>

<p>Religion is basically philosophy put through a &quot;fake rethoric grid&quot; designed to make you think.
Like, if a &quot;prophet&quot; writes that a guy that couldn&#39;t swim ended up walking on the sea, it could mean through the &quot;fake grid&quot; (in the gnostic interpretation of Jesus, water symbolize emotions and earth the logic) that the guy has had a lot of problems dealing with emotions until he snapped out of them entirely.
But if you read it without knowing it&#39;s &quot;filtered&quot;, it make no sense. 
It&#39;s obvious it&#39;s filtered, but without saying it, it offers you a choice between refusing the whole thing altogether as a nutty thing and looking into it seriously, but it does polarize you between the two.
Quite intended if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume the answer is resoundingly &quot;no&quot;.  Conspiracy theory involves skepticism and critical thinking, both of which are like kryptonite to faith-based enterprises.</p>

<p>However, the deeper one gets--if they desire to do so--will lead either into deeper/alternative realms of understanding, or outright dismissal of it all out of frustration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religious belief (the notion that supernatural entities created and control the universe, often in a capricious and punitive manner) is a tool that the elites use to cement their power, and enslave the minds of the general population.</p>

<p>The purpose of this sub is surely to help people become better informed about the world we live in, or at least to recognise how we have been deceived by the elites, and to search for the truth. With that in mind, I don&#39;t really understand how someone would suddenly start believing in a supernatural demiurge (the one conveniently promoted by the elites in your particular neck of the the woods).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it depends honestly. I tend to look past most religious and supernatural aspects of conspiracy theories. They&#39;re harder to disprove and in my mind distract from information that could be pertinent to how the world operates.<br/>
Another aspect that is interesting is that no one can actually nail down who is the satanic rulers and practitioners in government and world leadership positions. Everyone can be linked and blamed through the flimsiest examples of speculation and evidence. Where as when you take out the religious aspects everything can become more concrete and less speculative.  </p>
