       I love that when there is a terrorist attack in Russia the comments are "Now I don't believe in conspiracy theory bullshit - but if Putin is involved suddenly I believe in conspiracy theory bullshit"
      </p>
      <p>
       So Putin would be capable of engaging in false flag attacks and nobody else in the west would? Give me a fucking break reddit.

       Not that I think this is a false flag - but I do think the majority of reddit are morons (myself included).

       It sounds crazy, but this isn't that far from the truth. How so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the information is out there. But not everybody is listening. Also, a lot of people prefer not to hear the truth even when you give it to them. Then you've got the fact that many people just aren't interested in the same things we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you end up with millions of people who can tell you about the latest features on a Samsung or iPhone, or the latest details on Kendall Jenner's life. But they don't have a clue about things like astroturfing or how a false flag works.

       I would have to imagine for some it would be a first step. If they get interested in a topic and research examples, some things are hard to ignore. The idea may lie dormant for years, but someday a similar event will happen or they could happen upon something in history, which they will view in a new light.
      </p>
      <p>
       These new minds should not be ignored. Through constructive criticism and patience, we could have fresh minds tackling ideas. This place could be a diverse crucible of truth. How many things have slipped by unnoticed because those who could see have no voice? How many people out there have come across information and not realize the significance of it?

       Little countries and non-state actors can also perform false flags, but their operations tend to be for more limited objectives, and more obvious ones.  The bigger the country, the harder it falls.  Big things commit big evils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is bigger in today's world?  Russia, or the United States?  I do not think Russia is bigger in today's world than the United States.  I think China might be, but all seems quiet on that front.  We do not hear much about China anymore.  There is no purpose in worrying about China when Russia's interference looms so high over us.

       I agree that not everything is a false flag. In fact I never said this event was a false flag and I agree, some people attribute everything as being that way.

       The reality is its impossible to know either way - I just get annoyed when we are prepared to say Putin would do such a thing but not us. Its ridiculous.

       You're right, but it seems you're missing his point regardless. While those you decry rush to deem the event a false flag by Putin, you seem to rush to defend him when it would be more reasonable to simply note the ubiquity of false flag attacks in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just as likely Putin is behind it as it is that he isn't. For reasons that are your own, your post seems to shy away from the first option.

       That's always been a problem. We believe that every other country does it, and can accept that our own country has done it in the distant past, but few will accept that our current government does it. Such denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't know how that really matters here. Yes, the US does it. That doesn't make Putin innocent here, it still remains to be seen. And Putin is clearly not above this stuff.

       Good points. And all of the sudden after getting more involved in Syria they have an attack. Ok, starting to make sense now. I still think most of the attacks in the US are false flags of some degree though.

       Well with regards to Chechnya, yea... pretty much. Russia and the US are both equally guilty when it comes to subjugating lesser territories they feel they have a claim on.

      <p>
       It'd be a stretch to suggest that Russia has been minding their own business.

       The major problem with Islamic terror is that A) The west has nurtured the most radical elements of a period of 30 years in order to manufacture an enemy to fight and previously to provide a bulwark against Soviet incursion into the middle east B) We are there, in the middle east and killing innocents on top of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is if you look at a list of Islamic terror attacks in the west on wikipedia... its pretty clear what is motivating them. Before 911 there were sporadic attacks, sometimes maybe 5 per decade or so. After 911 this spiked to 5 per day sometimes more. It's because we are there. Its that simple and even if we leave now, its going to take time before it settles again and we would have to weather those attacks and not react and not just blame religion before we could return to some semblance of sanity.

       Having lived under a rigid totalitarian system for three quarters of a century no one is more adept at recognising any of the tell tale signs of their own government's hand in staging events to psychologically manipulate and control the masses than the ordinary Russian people are.

       I saw a comment in r/worldnews considering the bombing today to be
       <em>
        an obvious false flag event
       </em>
       , but closing the comment with 'but 9/11 was of course not, it wouldn't make sense'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like... what kind of mind works that way?! I mean, if a plane were to hit the metro and the shit imploded in on itself, would that make it more ''
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       '' to people like these??
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still baffled by the fact that people accept the 'official narrative' from 9/11... Yet, not a single aircraft has been used in demolitions since? I know I'm getting off track here, but the only logical conclusion you could make from that day, other than we need a new intelligence agency, was that jets are perfect for demolition duties...

       Lets just stick with the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a high muslim occupancy area in russia. The russians haven't released a suspect method or motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The russians are currently engaging isis in the middle east just outside their borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the timing convenient for a false flag. Sure....
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the obvious misconceptions of 9.11 really aren't taking place here. There was no impracticable scenario here. 
No magic passports found. No announcement of every person involved same day, Or vans with questionable insignia pulled over...
      </p>
      <p>
       No its just a typical bomb taking off in a rather peaceful area where muslims and russians share a living space...
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets wait for the russian intel reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sad users are even taking false flag narratives into accounts when we are all aware of russias recent strides to eradicate a terroist regime-
      </p>
      <p>
       We should unify and send our blessings and support over this, instead of making it an 'about us' issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       People died-
My sympathy to those that lost their lives yesterday in russia. Hopefully they take it out on raqqa-
I wouldn't give a damn if we nuked that festering shit hole. 
Would probably send a rather clear message to the world on the fate of future jihadists-
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry russia for americas misguided in your time of healing. May your injured citizens find health.  With the ones that lost their lives finding peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I as an american support you and send my love in your time of loss. Its truly a tragic day for world history. :(

       I'm more confused about the opposite. Every fucking thing that ever happens is called a false flag here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, when this happens in Russia,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is like "don't look! Nothing to see here. Putin can't possibly be involved!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that Putin became some symbol of honesty and integrity on this sub as soon as it became clear he and Trump are pals? The guy gained power by killing his political opponents.

       Because of all the silly bullshit about "Putin takes on the New World Order".... in truth this order has been conflated with Anglo-American hegemony. Putin is nothing but a 2 bit thug and as much apart of any order as anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all nonsense. Its quite possible for Putin to be a piece of shit as anyone else.

       I think it was a false flag almost definitely, (almost every incidence is) but not sure if it is an eastern or western one.
Maybe Putin (or others linked to him) did it for an agenda such as preventing protests dismantling the government.
Or it could be the U.S./Israel/Saudi Arabia trying to bait Putin into conflict.
Who knows but false flag is likely. IMO teer.. orr.. ism is usually manufactured or administered by the psychopath elite/intelligence agencies.
Even if I see Putin as generally more honest, I don't necessarily trust him.
Both Russia and the U.S. have had false flags.
Nothing off the table.
We have to look at the timings and see which agendas correlate strongly with the incidence.
