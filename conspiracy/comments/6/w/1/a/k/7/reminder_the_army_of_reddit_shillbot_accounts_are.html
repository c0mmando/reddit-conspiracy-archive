<p><em>A major federal investigation has found that dozens of military officials and defense contractors, including some with top-level security clearances, allegedly bought and downloaded child pornography on private or government computers.</em></p>

<p><em>The Pentagon on Friday released investigative reports spanning almost a decade that implicated individuals working with agencies handling some of the nation&#39;s most closely guarded secrets, including the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates U.S. spy satellites.</em></p>

<p><em>One case in California involved more than a dozen individuals with ties to the Defense Department, including contractors and active members of the military — several of whom had top secret clearances. At least nine cases were closed because investigators lacked &quot;current, relevant evidence,&quot; the documents state.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your title is a lie though. Neither of your sources say Elgin FL is the second highest missing child rate. Secondly, do you distinguish children abducted versus children who ran away? This is important because the small population of Elgin (8800ish) would skew even if 15 kids ran away from home and they were counted as missing children&#39;s towards your calculations. I say ran away because it&#39;s a military base and I could totally see some angry teenagers trying to run away from home because they&#39;re mad they got moved again</p>

<p>See for yourself...use google chrome and hit &quot;find&quot; then punch in &quot;2017&quot; without brackets for each link and the search will automatically count how many times 2017 comes up and it comes up for &quot;missing children in 2017&quot;.</p>

<p>You can see the disproportionate numbers compared to populations.</p>

He&#39;s trying to connect Eglin Air Force Base to reddit manipulation for which he makes some good arguments especially the removal of the Reddit post naming it as one of the most active reddit area. But he makes no logical jump and instead just dumps missing person data.</p>

<p>So what is happening? Eglin is the center of the air forces internet manipulation mission, ok so why the air force? Doesn&#39;t seem to connect to their mission. But what is the role of the missing children? Trying to link this to pizzagate? This shit flys off the rails there.</p>
