    <div class="md"><p>True. but they have their own explanations. The greeks could figure it out right? what about modern history? our air force used flat earth maps until ww2 and tesla himself centered the basis of his scientific theory around pulling energy from &#39;nothing&#39; and believed the &#39;aether&#39; was limitless energy that powered the universe. the idea behind their arguments you have to keep in mind yourself is that there is a level of government cover up here ie area 51 , &#39;fake moon landing&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The greeks started with a lot of assumptions:</p>

<p>Assumption #1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#/media/File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg">Sun rays come parallel</a></p>

<p>Assumption #2: &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#History">may have calculated&quot; the distance from Earth to Sun</a> by measuring the size of Venus at min/max vs nearby stars. </p>

<p>How did they know how large planet Venus was or how far?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the same &quot;Circular logic&quot; that religious folks base their beliefs on? The greeks know how far the Sun was because they knew how far  Venus was.... but how did they know about Venus....</p>

<p>Its the same belief loop only its centered around numbers instead of words and stories.</p>

<p>If the Sun distance was based on belief and assumption <em>at its core</em> then the rays would have been divergent and not parallel, and the shadows formed would&#39;ve been affected mainly by the angle of light and not by the distance to the source.</p>

<p>Assumption #2b: <a href="http://www.scientus.org/Copernicus-Stellar-Parallax.html">Parallax of stars was still an issue during promulgation of the &quot;Moving Earth/Heliocentric&quot; model</a></p>

<p>&quot; No one in Galileo&#39;s time or for almost 200 years after his death was able to demonstrate this necessary effect of earth&#39;s motion around the sun. Stellar parallax was finally observed in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel, a German scientist. But it is not Bessel that is credited with finally proving that the earth moved around the earth. In 1729, James Bradley, while searching for the elusive stellar parallax, detected motion of the stars over the course of the year which did not fit the pattern of stellar parallax. He had discovered stellar aberration, which is also related to the motion of the earth. Regardless, proof of the earth&#39;s motion was not available in the seventeenth century and those arguing for it&#39;s motion had no answer for why stellar parallax could not be observed. It is a huge problem when a consequence of a theory is expected and it cannot be observed. It is enough to keep a hypothesis from being accepted as a proven theory, regardless of the number of positive arguments in its favor. This applies as much today as it did in the seventeeth century.</p>

<p>These scientists were correct that a moving earth required that there must be stellar parallax. They were also correct that this parallax could not be observed. However, their rejection of the hypothesis was based on more than this; it was also based on the assumption that the stars were millions of miles away. These stars were billions of miles away. &quot;</p>

<p>This is how equations are changed to fit the model - parallax did not support the moving through space model, so they changed the numbers until parallax was not longer expected:  from million of miles to tens of billions of miles! Equation absolved of proof.</p>

<p>A normal scientific concensus bases its models on numbers and measurements, they dont change the numbers to fit their preconceived model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. A problem I find with disproving the flat earth theories is that for some of the points raised you have to rely on theories. Which of course, the skeptic has no way of believing unless they have done the experiments themselves. </p>

<p>Here is an example. There are videos on youtube of people filming the sea and showing an island that mathematically should not be visible given the radius of the Earth and the distance (according to google maps) to the island. I checked the math and they are correct, it shouldnt be visible... assuming light will go in a straight path. The reason its visible is that the light diffracts because the air near the water has different temperature and pressure conditions as the air above water. This makes sense to someone who has done light diffraction experiments and is familiar with snell&#39;s law. You realize it doesn&#39;t take a large angle of diffraction to see the island. However, if you have never done these experiments and someone explains its because of diffraction you will probably immediately call BS. </p>

<p>The other issue is even if you do believe snell&#39;s law is somewhat accurate, then how are you supposed to know that the air&#39;s index of refraction higher above the island is larger than air&#39;s index of refraction at the height of the island? The only way to deduce that this might be true is to look at tables of measured indices of refraction at various temperatures and pressures, assume a reasonable set of conditions at the time that video was taken based on past data that has been recorded, and then use those assumptions to see if you get conditions that allow visibility of the island. Practically no one will do this, and even if you did you are relying on theories and assumptions to prove the round earth model. Its pretty much unavoidable; at some point you HAVE to take certain things on faith that you aren&#39;t being lied to. When people have been lied to so much, can you really blame them for not believing the official narrative?</p>

<p>Pretty sure the effect you&#39;re referring to is caused by <em>re</em>fraction, not <em>dif</em>raction. The former bends, the latter scatters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science is so abstract these days. I love the 1800s science era because I can grok the experiments, arguments and concepts.  Now days need a background of science history to make sense how modern science works. But no public education teaches that subject.
Thanks for long reply and effort, I always feel bad not replying in kind. Apologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think so.  I have been into conspiracy since the early to mid 90&#39;s.   One thing I have noticed is that the conspiracy community is not united.  It is made up of a bunch of different groups all have their own pet conspiracies and conspiracies  they think are not true. </p>

<p>Now I am sure some of these flat earthers are trolls, just doing it for laughs  but there 100% are true believers out there.  Long time ago most flat earthers were very religious and it was through that religious belief that they explained their flat earth beliefs.  Today there is more and more flat earthers that don&#39;t use religion to explain flat earth instead they use not very convincing YT videos and misleading photos.  Those are the ones I would be suspicious about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth is not just about the physical shape of the Earth. </p>

<p>its about much, much more than that. </p>

<p>TPTB want to separate you from God, </p>

<p>and separate you from each other. </p>

<p>to make you feel small, and insignificant, and worthless, </p>

<p>so that you sit down, and shut up, </p>

<p>so that you keep your nose to the grindstone</p>

<p>They want to shape your conceptualization of the universe, and your place in it. </p>

<p>They want you to believe that the universe began somewhere else, long ago and far away </p>

<p>They want you to believe that the center of the universe is far away, </p>

<p>and that you are just an insignificant nothing on an insignificant planet, </p>

<p>revolving around an insignificant star, in an insignificant galaxy, </p>

<p>like billions and billions of other insignificant planets, starts, and galaxies. </p>

<p>they want you to believe that your DNA is random yet predictable coincidence  </p>

<p>authority figures remind us that &quot;the universe doesn&#39;t revolve around you, young lady!&quot; </p>

<p>Flat Earth is introduced in elementary school, as part of Christopher Columbus story, where Columbus&#39; crew were Flat Earth&#39;ers.</p>

<p>in the whole scheme of things, Columbus a non-story, and yet every student in America knows Columbus sailed in 1492</p>

<p>the story is not about Columbus, but about introducing the Flat Earth model as a point of ridicule, to young, impressionable minds, </p>

<p>as part of a government mandated compulsory education. (govern = control, ment = mental)(govern ment = to control the mind)</p>

<p>in school, we are taught about the Big Bang theory </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and your ego is too big to admit that Stephen Hawking is a moron, and/or that you are also a moron for following him around like a lost puppy dog?</p>

<p>can you cite even a single piece of evidence that you have seen first-hand that would lead a reasonable person to believe the universe is expanding?</p>

<p>if you answer with &quot;red shift&quot;, </p>

<p>be aware that my follow up question will be to ask you to describe how you personally observed and measured red shift. </p>

<p>you, me, and the lurkers will all know the truth, whether you answer or not.</p>

<p>i have spent countless hours trying to make sense of creation, and i will leave you where i left off in my studies. </p>

<p>H=C</p>

<p>where H is the Hubble Constant, and C is the Cosmological constant. </p>

<p>yes, the universe is allegedly expanding at the speed of light. </p>

<p>if you don&#39;t believe me, just try to figure out exactly how fast the universe is expanding. heres a good place to start:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec</a></p>

<p>however, you are somewhat correct in that different models loosely correlate with ego. </p>

<p>and i think that science&#39;s creation myth is perhaps the least plausible of all, and furthermore was not conjured as a model of truth, but as a model of deception. </p>

<p>consider the fact that 99% of American&#39;s can&#39;t decide whether or not you have to go &quot;up&quot; to get the moon, and you soon realize that the average person is only slightly smarter than the average chimpanzee. </p>

<p>the Big Bang model is meant to crush your ego, so that you make good little slaves</p>

<p>whereas previous models relied on some sort of Creator or God, and the implied Creator-Creation-Creature allowed humans to develop a &quot;relationship with God&quot;, or to &quot;become one with the universe&quot;, like zen, etc and people who believe in God are probably less fearful of death, more confident in life, and otherwise less suitable to be good little slaves. </p>

<p>as i said in my previous comment, the flat earth theory is not just about the shape of Earth, </p>

<p>but our concept of who we are and where we fit in  </p>

<p>rene descarte: i think, therefore i am</p>

<p>can you see yourself in the mirror?</p>

<p>are you alive?</p>

<p>are you life?</p>
