       Such as. It's just that when you make a post on this sub you should typically follow up with a decent explanation of your point of view. If you haven't noticed this sub gets flooded with dozens of questions asking an audience something without giving their own feedback. Aka a shitpost.

       Puppets for the elites that get a cookie if they do as there told but If they go against the will of the elites, then there reputation will be smeared and likely to have lots of articles about how there going crazy; also likely to be taken to a hospital to receive more "treatment"

       John Lennon- major counterculture figure who influenced the youth movements of the 60s and prominent peace advocate reemerges from retirement in 1980 and has a hit record and starts getting back into piblic life, is assasinated by a man linked to the same Hawaiian brainwashing church that gave the world Jim Jones of the Jonestown Massacre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Marley- helps to curb political violence in Jamaica and bring political unity to his country, shortly there after miraculously survives an assassination attempt, starts focusing on unifying Africa, gets diagnosed with terminal cancer and dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Jackson- advocates for children and world peace and a post racist society as the largest artist on the planet, is framed as a pedophile in the public eye despite a proven fraudulent history of his accusers family and a lack of physical evidence and is forever ruined in the piblic eye, years later plots come back and dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye-starts talking and making music about the prison industrial complex and the gatekeepers who control media, popular culture, and entertainment, suddenly starts desperately  ranting about people trying to kill him in public and ends up in a mental hospital, emerges heavily medicated and changed according to people that know him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Dylan-writes the anthems that help bring white middle class youth into the civil rights movement and inspires a generation towards political activism, publicly claims he was afraid of being assassinated and only goes on to write beautiful poetic nonsense from then on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tupac-talks about inequality poverty and systemic racism, is murdered, the notorious BIG killed months later to make it look like a gangland beef.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Morrison- son of the head of Naval intelligence who staged the Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used to justify escalation in Vietnam, drops out of school as an actor and forms band with US Army vet Ray Manzarek,  which goes on to become one of the most controversial and shocking  acts of the 60s with songs that include swear words, open references to drug use, violence, sex,  incest,  and lewd public performances that are used in the media to demonize the immorality of the counterculture and to create fear in the "silent majority". After death there are countless rumors about Morrison having faked his own death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Grateful Dead- emerge from a scene  rooted in CIA sponsored LSD experiments and organized criminal biker gamgs,  go on to be the genesis of a drug oriented counter cultural movement that derails the politically oriented youth culture of the early 1960s, inspiring the hippie movement to be one focused on good times rather than achieving political aims.

       imo, not only are many of the singers mk'd, the songs themselves are full of mk-ish shit that could be used as triggers for people who have been mk'd.  same can be said of most entertainment products.  the hidden subtext/messages in these things are fairly consistent (if you know what to look for) and this alone seems to be something that wouldn't happen randomly.

       I think there are controlled lyrics, images and beats/tones definitely pushed by the major labels. But the internet has changed how some artists can still remain independent or move beyond previous foriegn country barriers.

       IMO Brendon was just showing what may potentially be going on, maybe to help people realize what’s going on. Brendon Urie is probably one of the least dangerous celebrities out there and is hella outspoken against most things mainstream.

       She was in therapy for over two years. She became super depressed and listened to emo and just wallowed in toxic tumblr and instagram stuff. She is doing really well now and is a healthy, bright and caring human. Waking her up to what this shit actually is as well as lots of therapy and support saved her.

       Not to say your lying but that videos just been out for a year. I would recommend what my dad told me use the knowledge you have to your advantage. I started looking into cryptocurrencies and investing in them between a lot of coins reading into why some are better then other then buying them low.

       In a way, it made me a totally different person. I mostly wish he would listened to me near the end I was telling him we should be more careful because he lived in ecuador were were the 1% And he was an outspoken critic of the government. At 55 he had 3 heart attacks and the last one left him a vegetable. I went to ecuador 4yrs to talk to family and family in high places. I was being followed and friends I had died mysteriously I won't go into i5 too much bc no one believes me.

       I never saw the soft-porn cable movie, and I don't remember the name of it nor can I validate it even existing, but damn, I didn't think it was MKUltra related until now.  And that soft-core porn was mixing music and sex, damn....
