       After the Charlottesville fiasco it seems like the msm just stopped talking about Russiagate. They ran stories about it non-stop for months, now I guess it's just yesterday's news. All that hysteria for nothing

       No wonder you are so ignorant and dismissive. You believe in the straw men arguements that the right and the Russian shills have been pushing.

       Russia didn't hack any of the polls. No votes were changed through hacking the polling machines.

       Dude, first of all, are you ok? You're so angry and worked up over this, you have already insulted me twice when all I've done is ask you questions. If you're so mad about this trump Russia conspiracy thing you should write a letter to your congressman or senator or something. You know, I had nothing to do with this and you have no reason to be so spiteful towards me. Anyways, yeah I am interested to know the new angle that the msm has come up with. Is it the Russian trolls convinced everyone to hate Hillary?

       Yes, I'm ok, thank you for asking.

      <p>
       I write to my representatives regularly depending on the issues.

       I'm not insulting you. It is a fact that you are ignorant of all of the surrounding information and issues relating to the Trump/Russia conspiracy.

      <p>
       Ignorance is not a bad thing on its own. Everyone has ignorance of different topics. But, being purposely ignorant is a different story.

       I'll ask you two questions and then I'll answer any wu actions you have.

       Just stumbled across if as it was referenced in another conspiracy thread and you peaked my curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind though that I deal with facts and truth. Speculation, leads and bounds to connecting ridiculous dots is not what I will believe. I believe in conspiracies but I still believe in logic too.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act">
        When the Trump team says they were talking about adoptions, that was code for sanctions.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia stole money and companies from Bill Browder ( an American citizen) in Russia. They kicked Browder out and once they received his company, Russian oligarchs used the companies documents to receive several hundred million dollars in a tax refund from the government, which is probably one of the biggest tax scams committed by the Russian government (and Putin).
      </p>
      <p>
       They did this to Browder because he was exposing the corruption of the Russian oligarchs that were sending their money to Putin, and Putin was tired of it, so he labeled him a national security threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Browder fought back, and hired Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian top lawyer, to fight back against Putin's corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well Putin got tired of it, and arrested Magnitsky, and kept him in brutal conditions in prison for a year, and then brutally beat him to death with batons while in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US retaliated with the Magnitsky Act and placed heavy sanctions on dozens of corrupt Russian oligarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Putin retalliated with the adoptions sanctions against American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whenever you hear talk about "they were just talking about adoption policy" that means they were talking about removing the Magnisky act and other sanctions on Russia's corrupt government officials.

        On January 9, 2017, under the Magnitsky Act, the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control updated its Specially Designated Nationals List and blacklisted Aleksandr I. Bastrykin, Andrei K. Lugovoi, Dmitri V. Kovtun, Stanislav Gordievsky, and Gennady Plaksin, which froze any of their assets held by American financial institutions or transactions with those institutions and banned their travelling to the United States.

       I don't see Putin named on the list? And still this has literally 0 evidence of anything to do with Trump? I'm am more confused than before you wrote that. You haven't put across any points or argues anything. Just showed me a act that seems like other acts?

       Bill Browder recently testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Magnitsky Act and how it relates to Putin, Trump, and the Trump Jr. meeting where they discussed "adoption sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/">
        Here's the transcript of the hearing
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the people that were sanction were the most powerful and richest oligarchs in Russia. Russia is a mafia state, and those oligarchs give 50% of their income and assets to Putin. So when sanctions were placed on those oligarchs, it was essentially sanctions on Putin himself and it severely impacted the Russian economy overall.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia’s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. After Khodorkovsky’s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin’s answer was, “Fifty percent.” He wasn’t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In response to these sanctions, Russia placed sanctions on American citizens adopting Russian children. Trump and his family and his lawyers admit that Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort had a secret meeting with Russian government representatives, where they discussed "adoption sanctions".
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the Russians that attended this meeting was  Rinat Akhmetshin.

       The Magnitsky Act was based off of the evidence Bill Browder brought to the House and Senate. It was a huge bipartisan effort with
       <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll608.xml">
        365 Yeah votes to 43 Nays in the house

       Except that Trump Jr. and his family/lawyers told us what was said.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by.
        <strong>
         We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government

        , but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.

      <p>
       And as I just educated you on, adoption sanctions actual means the Magnitsky sanctions. Lets use your logic - Why would Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort talk about receiving Hillary Clinton dirt and the Magnistky act in the same meeting with Rinat Akhmetshin, whom Senator Grassley said previously is a Russian GRU spy who specializes in

        Active measures
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Active measures ranged "from media manipulations to special actions involving various degrees of violence". They were used both abroad and domestically. They included disinformation, propaganda, counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration into churches, and persecution of political dissidents
       </p>
       <p>
        Retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin described active measures as "the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence": "Not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs.
       </p>

      <p>
       Past use of active measures has been revealed in the

       That's the type of people that Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with. They had a secret meeting with a litteral Russian GRU spy who specialized litterally in social media shilling and trolling.

       I know exactly where you are coming from and your argument. Mine is just that you can believe all of this full well but you are relying on TRUSTING THE GOVERNMENT OR DEFENCE PERSONNEL WITHOUT QUESTION. You see a statement and jump to "it's true coz it happened in a room that people should tell the truth", well that doesn't fucking hold up on conspiracy. Any single one of those people in any of the articles could have lied for whatever reason but you don't even entertain the idea. To you what these people say is the truth no matter what. Well I don't fucking buy it for a second.

       I said there is no way for you to prove they are telling the truth, is this a correct statement?

        TRUMP: She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that’s the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about — things.

         Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.

         We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump’s son] had in that meeting.

        As I’ve said — most other people, you know, when they call up and say, “By the way, we have information on your opponent,” I think most politicians — I was just with a lot of people, they said [inaudible], “Who wouldn’t have taken a meeting like that?” They just said——

        this story on the front page

       . It details negotiations made during the presidential campaign that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and Russian mafia member/Trump Org senior adviser, Felix Sater, made with the Kremlin to build a Trump building in Moscow.

      <p>
       Something that was never disclosed until now.

       Trump was long trying to get into Russia. If anything his attempts and failures show lack of clout and connection.

       True, but why did he completely never disclose that he had his personal attorney and a senior adviser to the Trump Organisation that was also a convicted Russian mobster negotiating with the Russian government during the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think that is something that you should disclose during an election, especially if you are being asked questions about Russia and your business acumen?

       Not really. He already has had large sources of Russian and Kazak mafia wealth pour into several different projects. He also was paid millions for the Miss Universe pageant from a company that gets it funding almost entirely from a state run Russian bank.

       If Hillary had been elected,  would the Republicans be interested in her deal to sell uranium to the Russians or the role of the Clinton Foundation in any Russia contacts,   or any back door meetings between Clinton people like Podesta with Russians?

       I think there is enough dirt to go around but I don't think there will be any impeachments or indictments,  I think its all a distraction while the deep state (consisting of neocons and neoliberals) is basically getting all the money and power it wants.

       I feel like a lot of what you are going off is based on Bill Browder telling the truth. I have seen COUNTLESS people lie under oath, why would I believe Bill?

       The Magnitsky Act was based off of the evidence Bill Browder brought to the House and Senate. It was a huge bipartisan effort with
       <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll608.xml">
        365 Yeah votes to 43 Nays in the house

       I think it's logical to think that the vast majority of the house and the senate think he's a credible source.
