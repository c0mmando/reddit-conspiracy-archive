       Noticed there haven't been any posts about Dr John Piesse who has recently come under fire in Australia for his choices with vaccines. This is a developing story that I feel could use some discussion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dr John Piesse is one of very few Australian doctors who took his oath to “first do no harm” seriously. Recently, he has come under fire for standing up against the tyrannical Victorian government who are stripping away basic human rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon reflecting on his records, Dr Piesse observed that
        <strong>
         approximately 50% of his infant vaccine recipients became quite ill
        </strong>
        .  More tragically,
        <strong>
         2 post-vaccination infant deaths came to his attention, both deaths brushed off as SIDS
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        What he found was truly shocking. Not only were there no gold standard studies proving the efficacy of vaccination – an inconvenient truth for a profession that prides itself on being scientific, but according to Dr Piesse, “One analysis indicated that national infant mortality rates were proportional to the number of vaccine doses
       </p>
       <p>
        Grant McArthur, a reporter from the Herald Sun who is believed to have colluded with Jill Hennessy (Victorian Health Minister) on a fabricated tweets saga blaming “anti-vaxxers” for abusing her, broke this story with the alarmist title ‘Secret Melbourne cell of anti-vaxxer doctors under investigation’. His article leads readers to believe Dr Piesse is guilty of serious misconduct. Some basic investigation will show that not only is this untrue, but everything Dr Piesse did was perfectly legal and medically indicated.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Most doctors are not aware that the Immunisation handbook doesn’t even meet its own mandatory guidelines for gold standard evidence. For example, there are no links to any safety studies on the MMR vaccine and a textbook reference is used to claim the MMR is effective. That textbook is co-written by Dr Paul Offit, a doctor who has profited in excess of $13 million from the rotavirus vaccine he produced with Merck, a company which also holds a monopoly on the production of the MMR vaccine”.
       </p>

       You could endorse the benefits of slavery 1 year before it's abolition by saying that no one has refuted X years of slavery. Not that strong of an argument.

       But the alternative to slavery is being free, which we like. The alternative to vaccination is disease, which we don't like.

       I would argue that the systems we have don't represent freedom and that the opposite of vaccination isn't disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other ways of preventing illness than a single solution and those other ways don't involve the risks that vaccines do.

       Why do people freak out about discussing risks about a medical intervention? They knew xrays were bad for pregnant women and their babies, but waited until they had the unltrasound before they said so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women were encouraged to smoke during pregnancy! Everyone was, for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers are not liable for death or injury. Vaccines are not tested using a double-blind study with a saline solution, as is the norm for evidence-based medicine. They are tested against other vaccines, adjuvants, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the ingredients listed are not tested for carcinogenic and mutating effects, nor for it's effect on fertility. The FDA gives a "safe" limit for aluminum of up to 5 mcg/day for a newborn, but this is for ingesting; there are no statements about inoculation, and each vaccine has upwards of 250 mcg..... No newborn in existence has the nature kidney function to detox from 16 shots every two months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some damage is happening. It may be sudden and severe or delayed and chronic. Aluminum is abundant in the brains of dementia and Alzheimer's patients. Don't think fluoride doesn't play a part.
