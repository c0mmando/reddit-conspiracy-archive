       Everyone who rode out the last year on this subreddit knows that the biggest baddest slop-bucket in the known world of global dirty politics landed in our lap. We didn't ask for it. We weren't looking for it. It just happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That issue is NOT pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That issue is the full-out response from deep state, controlled media, with an unprecedented, insane, never-before-seen level of propaganda and disinformation regarding that single, multi-faceted line of inquiry into how exactly the intended candidate for POTUS missed it, and we ended up with the guy who was built up in order to lose it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have chosen to ignore it all, like they did the 9-11 questions. Instead they chose to react clumsily, unconvincingly, and to flat-out deny and censor it. Now they are doubling down in every direction. Why, why, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are anonymous public bulletin boards that powerful? Will they be able to kill this one? How will we all stand straight and still, quietly, peacefully, knowingly in this space?

       Personally, I think it's a mistake to believe that just because most people in the government hate Trump, that means there is some "dep state" plot to discredit him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely plausible that many people
       <em>
        just think he's an incompetent fool,
       </em>
       because, well, he IS an incompetent fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure what you mean by mass censorship. Haven't seen any evidence of that myself.

       there is actually no evidence to support the fact that he is a billionaire, and since he lies constantly about everything, I see no reason to believe that either.

       I didn't ask for links to removed content. Which by the way, considering the existence of archiving sites, that actually isn't as dumb as you implied it is.

       But regardless, that's not what I was asking for. I was asking for sources to back up those claims.

       Wikipedia is not a primary source, but the article is well sourced. You can follow any of the 347 source articles if you wish. However, I doubt you're posting in good faith considering your reddit submissions are all crazy right-wing propaganda posts.

       Here's a few things wrong wth the Russia Wikipedia page you linked (lol @ Wikipedia). First, it uses way too many "opinion" articles. Opinions are not facts, by definition. Second, it actually uses the Steele dossier as evidence.. our IC has said, a bunch of times, that it was not accurate. It was also done by FusionGPS, which is basically an arm of the DNC at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, it uses CrowdStrike for a lot of its evidence but also conspicuously ignores that it was CrowdStrike who started the whole investigation into Russia by claiming it was Russia who hacked the DNC. That's likely because much of the CrowdStrike "proof" relied on the fact that Russia apparently hacked the Ukraine using the same tools.. turns out, they
       <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreycarr/the-gru-ukraine-artillery-hack-that-may-never-have-happened-820960bbb02d">
        likely didn't
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, which is really just an extension of my last point -- much of this narrative hinges on the DNC/Podesta leaks. If Russia didn't hack the DNC, the whole thing falls apart. Turns out,
       <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/15/what-if-the-dnc-russian-hack-was-really-a-leak-after-all-a-new-report-raises-questions-media-and-democrats-would-rather-ignore/">
        evidence overwhelmingly shows
       </a>
       the DNC "hacks" were actually leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth - The amount of anonymous sources in those "347 sources" is baffling. I can find you 347 sources citing "anonymous sources close to the situation" that say the whole thing is a made up plot by lizard people. Would you believe it?

       No, that's not curious at all, as you'd know if you actually looked up the reason why her Visa was extended. Also, it's highly unlikely Lynch knew anything about that Visa, as that's not the type of thing she'd oversee personally. You're grasping at straws here.

       Oh, it goes much farther back than thenation's article. The information presented by thenation is just a rehash of information that's been getting passed around reddit and *chan for a couple months.

      <p>
       As for "debunks", DuckDuckGo doesn't give a single debunked story in the first page or two of results. Maybe Google is biased? (Hint: They are, and have proven as much lately).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only article I can find debunking it is
       <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/08/why-that-file-copy-forensics-of-dnc.html?m=1">
        this one
       </a>
       . It offers no evidence for why it's wrong, only that the conclusion drawn is one of many. So it doesn't actually debunk the claim at all :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's also address one of the biggest reasons they say this hack was the Russians. It was because a Russian left a footprint in the file's metadata.
       <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/">
        This article
       </a>
       covers it, some what.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they left a flashing "RUSSIA WAS HERE" sign should be red flag number 1 for you, but it probably isn't because we apparently believe Russian hackers are stupid. Red flag number 2 should be that the metadata was
       <a href="http://g-2.space/">
        actually fabricated
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, "multiple sources" have not discredited the claim that the DNC was not hacked by the Russians. In fact, all evidence suggests it was a leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, btw, I linked to Salon because I have a sneaking suspicion you'd believe them over me linking to Fox, RedState, etc.

       The idea that the Steele dossier is evidence of anything tying Trump to Russia is absolutely 'inaccurate'. The information within the document cannot be verified, per our IC, and therefore cannot be used as supporting evidence for anything.

      <p>
       And the fact that Wikipedia cites it as evidence calls into question the accuracy of the Wikipedia article.

       I didn't lie? I clarified my wording, yes, but I stand by what I said 100%. You can't blame me because you refuse to actually read what I say and acknowledge my position.

       What I said is correct - they've said it's not accurate. To me, in order for something to be accurate it has to be verifiable. If you cannot verify the accuracy, it's inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I mean, if I have to stroke your ego so you can get your internet point: "Let me clarify -- what I meant was that our IC has said they've been unable to verify the claims in the document. Since the information cannot be verified, it's not anything that can be used as proof of collusion between Russia and Trump. Using it as such is inaccurate because, again, our IC said the information cannot be/has not been verified."

       No, but the "evidence" you provided, Wikipedia, absolutely tries to make that claim. I was refuting your source of "Russian interference" because it's biased, and uses faulty "things" as evidence to support their claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this, ultimately, is the problem with the whole Russian narrative. So much bullshit has been peddled, there's literally nothing believable left. It's become, quite literally, the boy who cried wolf. And it's too bad, because there
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       be something there. We'll never know, though, since people continue to bush biased, unverified claims as if they accurately represent reality.

       What, that I'm in fantastic company? Absolutely goes without saying. I fucking love it though, because you clearly haven't read anything I've posted about Trump. You just see I post there so therefore I must be a rabid "ideologue" because that's easier for you than face an actual discussion. I see it with you in KiA as well :P

       Difference is there's no way to post in T_D as an outside voice without getting banned; I posted there precisely once, innocently, and got banned. The fact that you have lots of submissions there says quite a bit about you.

       Incorrect. I've stated there, numerous times, that I don't agree with everything Trump has said or done. I'm still not banned, though I can't say I'd care if I was.

       Not sure why it fucking matters where I post, though. As I've said, it's just you using an ad hominem because you apparently can't address someone without trying to discredit them as a person rather than their argument.

       You know what sticks out the most, though? Not a single article even remote neutral to Trump. Not a single. fucking. one. Literally zero. They are all open and blatant attacks on Trump using weasel words, feelings, and "this guy's opinion". I get he's had a bad week, but this past week isn't unique for Politics. It's literally all attacks on Trump, all the time.

       <em>
        still

       This is a lot of separate points to respond to. I wonder if the conversation would flow better if I just picked the first few. I'm not cherry picking here, if there's certain ones you'd rather me respond to I will.

       Clearly 'meltdown' is subjective, so I don't see how you can call this 'fake'. His rally was almost universally criticized as being further polarizing rather than healing, which is what people wanted after Charlottesville. And 'off-script' generally means 'off the teleprompter', and it's completely verifiable. Note that 'off-script' doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, but in this case, it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       One specific instance that was highly unlikely to be scripted is when he looked at the cameras and claimed that (paraphrasing) 'CNN doesn't want you to see this, look at the red recording lights turning off'. Of course, many people heard this
       <em>
        as they were watching the rally on CNN
       </em>
       , and CNN didn't turn it off, so how can you interpret this as anything but a blatant lie?

       Apparently you have an issue with anonymous sources. I don't know what to say to you on that--anonymous doesn't mean it's fake. There's a very good reason that these sources have to remain anonymous, and it's not because they're made up. I can probably find 100 stories in the last 6 months that all cite anonymous sources from NYT, WaPo, etc. that all turned out to be completely true--remember when people slammed the 'anonymous sources' for talking about Don Jr.'s emails/meeting? In this particular instance, it would be very easy for McConnell to refute the claim and humiliate NBC. He hasn't. It's almost certainly a reliable source.

       What? This is like someone making a claim saying '100% of the in the marbles in this room are blue' with cherry-picked photos of blue marbles, and then a reporter comes in and shows a photograph of red marbles in the room and you call
       <em>

       It's 'fake' because, in this context, 'fake' doesn't mean '100% not true'. I wrote a long post about what "Fake news" means to Trump supporters/anti-media people. I really don't want to rehash it, but it doesn't mean "this is not true". It has everything to do with how the facts are being spun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article is being spun as if his speech was
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       . That's a subjective thing that's being presented as fact. It's not. In fact, nearly all Trump supporters thought it was one of this best speeches. It's biased propaganda (Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause).

       No, this is like someone using a photo of red balls and saying "no blue balls exist in this room!". But really, it's not actually like that at all.

      <p>
       It's like Person A saying the room is 80% blue balls and providing a cherry picked angle to show that. Person B then says "no, the room is 80% red balls" and provides a cherry picked angle to show

       That's what this story is. Trump people used a picture that made the room look more full, and that article used a picture to make the room look more empty. There both have an agenda, and they are both using cherry picked angles to push that agenda.

       The story didn't 'fizzle out', it was based on verified leaks and then the leaks stopped, there's nothing more to report currently. We now know Mueller is looking into it, and people trust him to do his job, so it's not in the news cycle anymore.

       Give me a break. They effectively zoomed out and showed the room was half empty. 'Agenda' would be zooming in on the empty part.

      <p>
       Trump has a really really bad history with 'crowd size' arguments. Just look at his rhetoric over his inauguration. It was so ridiculous that T_D was all over stories about the pictures of the weak turnout being faked due to the clock time being incorrect. Remember that? Total bullshit. Trump supporters, including prominent ones like Ingraham, actually posted pictures of the 2016 NBA Cavs rally and tried to pass them off as people at the Phoenix rally.

      <p>
       There's a few points here. First, I can independently verify things by reading the same story, with the same claims, from multiple sources from multiple political ideologies. If I do, I can safely say the claim holds some water. If I'm only reading it from someone who's shown their bias, there's a good chance it's just biased reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads into the second point -- I do not trust the media. I never have. There are a few reporters I trust, but they are by far the minority. The main stream media has given me little reason to trust them. And this isn't new with Trump, I haven't trusted them in a very very long time. It's only gotten worse once Obama undid the "anti-propaganda" laws we had.

       You can say it hasn't "fizzled out" but it absolutely has. Look up the definition of fizzled out. If the fact that there's nothing left to talk about is why you won't say it has fizzled out, then ask yourself why the media is
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       talking about the PissGate dossier? Or any of a number stories that don't have leaks anymore, but the media is still pushing. If the story was the smoking gun we were sold it was, it wouldn't have stopped being in the news cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that wasn't even my point. My point was that story is a prime example of the media, their rhetoric, and their bias doing harm to a story that could actually be something. That story could actually be meaningful, and few paid attention because the media has shown themselves to be biased. They cried wolf one too many times.
      </p>

      <p>
       That's actually exactly what they did. They zoomed out from the back corner of the room to highlight the empty part. You'd have more of an argument if they showed multiple angles. They didn't. They found one angle that showed an empty and used that to shame Trump supporters. They literally did the same thing as the people shaming them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the pesky detail that this isn't the first time the media has done this. Remember when they used pictures of before and after Trump's inauguration to try and show how few people were there for it (this doesn't mean Trump's claim of a billion million people is right, either)? That sort of ruined their credibility in this instance. That was the straw because they also did that
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       during the campaign. They also used favorable angles to show that Clinton had huge crowds when she didn't.

       So does the media. Not to excuse Trump overselling himself, but there's a big difference between Trump and the media. Trump is a sales person, selling himself. The media is supposed to giving us an unbiased look at the facts. Trump has no obligation to do so (even though we'd all prefer it if he did).

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I think you and I remember that example differently, given my reply above. I remember using pictures of different times to show a weak turn out, all in order to strengthen their "everybody hates Trump" argument. You are ignoring that, and instead choosing to focus on where Trump lied. It's like you can't accept that both are pushing an agenda, and both are biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, all of this is pointless. You asked me where politics was pushing propaganda. I found you a bunch of links where, by the definition of the word, they were pushing propaganda. You also ignored a bunch of the links I posted, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too bad, too, because I was really looking for your justification for a main stream media outlet needlessly shaming an innocent man strictly because he was pro-Trump. I was hoping you had a good defense for why that was such a high ranking link on politics last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really hoping you could tell me what this private citizen's personal life had to do with politics, and why people over in politics thought it was so important to know about.

       Alright, but you don't get to redefine words to suit you as it's convenient, otherwise communication breaks down. Fake news isn't biased news. Someone calling Trump an 'idiot' isn't fake. Someone calling Obama a 'disaster of a president' isn't fake. The stories published on Infowars are almost all fake. The stories posted on Breitbart are heavily biased, but usually not fake.

       We've been over this, and maybe this is my fault for not expanding on my point and being too lazy to dig through my history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that "fake" is being redefined, it's that "fake news" means something entirely different than you think it means.. at least to the vast majority of people who buy into the idea of "fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about being inaccurate, it's about being heavily biased and misrepresented/clear agenda pushing. A great example is how the media reported Trump talking to the vets way back during the campaign. The media claimed that Trump said vets with PTSD were "weak". They quoted that sentence properly, so it's not literally fake.. but they also misrepresented his position, achieved by leaving out context.
      </p>
      <p>
       He never said anyone with PTSD was weak. What he said was people who come back from war need help, and they aren't getting help. That's a vastly different statement then what (many) in the media spun.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just a single example, there are thousands more.

       No, it doesn't. 'Fake news' isn't something people 'buy into', it's a real thing that everyone agrees exists. It is not what you're saying it is according to popular definition.

       I don't care what wikipedia says. I care about what I mean when I say it, and what the term has morphed into meaning. Taken literally, "fake news" means, basically, lies. I don't dispute that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except the term has morphed into meaning something far more, which I've explained. It's not really my problem if you have no interest in understanding what people mean when they speak.

      <p>
       Misogyny: "Misogyny is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls.". Calling a single woman a slut is contempt towards a single woman, not "women" (i.e: as a group).

       Give me a break. Next you'll tell me that calling a black person the N word isn't racism, because it's just a single black person and not black people. Your argument is bad.

       First off, I knew you'd latch onto this point. You seem to find one thing to pick on while ignoring the rest.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your argument is bad and I am now having trouble believing you're being serious anymore.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, first off, "nigger" carries so much history than "slut", and I'm almost positive some black people would be rather offended to hear you equating the two. They're not even close to the same connotation/weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second off, racism and misogyny mean different things. Racism is judging
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       (an individual) based on their race (a paraphrase). Misogyny is the contempt for
       <em>
        women
       </em>
       (i.e: the gender). The scale is vastly different.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you use misogyny by the
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       definition. It's been redefined by people who wished to use it as a cudgel. As I said, it's ironic you chastise me for redefining words yet you're using a word that's been redefined.

       You know what, I took this claim of "fake stories and propaganda" to heart and went and looked. I went through the first 5 pages of "Top &gt; All Time" and the first 5 pages of "Hot".

       Videos about antifa violence were absolutely removed from YouTube. I can't actually give you evidence, because they've been removed. But just because some still exist doesn't mean none were removed.

       Seth Rich is conjecture/conspiracy at this point. You absolutely cannot call it a "fake story" because there are no facts either way as to what really happened. Nobody is investigating it, so we'll never know. Just because
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       disagree with the conspiracy doesn't mean it's fake. It is literally a "he said, she said" story.

      <p>
       I will admit, them using
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       to shame the DNC is wrong. Just like people using the Steele dossier to shame Trump is wrong.

      <p>
       Even though all the conservative commentators and Trumpers have been screaming at the top of their lungs "FAKE NEWS!" since day one, many qualified investigators have been diligently looking into Russia's involvement into the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       And every time they turn over new evidence, it looks worse for Trump. Oh, and by the way, this whole "there is no evidence of MUH RUSSIA!" nonsense is, well, just nonsense. There are mountains of evidence that Russia used propaganda and social media and hacking to fuck with our election.

       It's not really evidence, though.  A story gets put out there every time things seem to be settling down.  The media runs with it like crazy until it is either disproven or is in fact true, but turns about to be close to nothing of any concern.  Even if I assume the Podesta and DNC leaks were in fact hacks, they appear to be true and if the truth swayed voters well, good.

       Assuming you're using that symbol to mean 'null set', I still don't know what point you're trying to convey. Brevity is the soul of wit, but in this case, it wouldn't hurt you to use a few more words to explain. Thanks.

       We'll stand knowingly and still because that is about all anyone ever does then it's back to binge watching, eating, drinking, and game playing.  Even if everyone on Reddit, including the shills all agreed, still nothing would happen because everyone is still sitting on their ass.

       Like Adam Curits said, only people with nothing lose will initiate radical change. America will continue to sit on its collective ass and watch the free entertainment along with the commercials.

       I don't want to kill all Jews. I want them to stop subverting White nation's politics and culture. And of course Jews run everything. The media, the banks, ZOG, etc. they admit as much.

       The real problem is a subset of Jews called Zionists. All of the Zionists aren't even really Jews, they're fake Jews. Masquerading as Jews. It's pretty clever.

       Government is a lie, an abstraction to insulate powerful and wealthy elite from the common people, and maintain that dominance. Worrying about which bureaucrats are "in charge," or anything other than creating a function alternative, is a complete waste of time.

       In fact, they are far more believable than the Russians hacking a political party and leaving a footprint that literally says "RUSSIA WAS HERE" (which is the evidence CrowdStrike claims exist, fucking lol).

       The idea that the Steele dossier is evidence of anything tying Trump to Russia is absolutely 'inaccurate'. The information within the document cannot be verified, per our IC, and therefore cannot be used as supporting evidence for anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that Wikipedia cites it as evidence calls into question the accuracy of the Wikipedia article.

       It's 'fake' because, in this context, 'fake' doesn't mean '100% not true'. I wrote a long post about what "Fake news" means to Trump supporters/anti-media people. I really don't want to rehash it, but it doesn't mean "this is not true". It has everything to do with how the facts are being spun.

       The article is being spun as if his speech was
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       . That's a subjective thing that's being presented as fact. It's not. In fact, nearly all Trump supporters thought it was one of this best speeches. It's biased propaganda (Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause).

       This is just a terrible defense. One example: DWS has never denied that she was helping the Awan brothers steal information for Pakistan. So that makes those stories true? Soros has never denied being behind all the civil unrest in the US, so clearly those stories are true as well?

       Yeah, and what happened with that meeting? Nothing, the story fizzled because it turned out to be far less of a smoking gun as we were sold. As I've said, that's the problem with our media. That story
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have been bigger, but that's impossible when everything is literally "THIS IS THE END OF TRUMP!". People just don't believe the media anymore, and it hurts everyone. That's the problem with "fake news". It's something politics is
       <em>
        very

       good at pushing, which I believe I've shown pretty conclusively.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, this is like someone using a photo of red balls and saying "no blue balls exist in this room!". But really, it's not actually like that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like Person A saying the room is 80% blue balls and providing a cherry picked angle to show that. Person B then says "no, the room is 80% red balls" and provides a cherry picked angle to show
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what this story is. Trump people used a picture that made the room look more full, and that article used a picture to make the room look more empty. There both have an agenda, and they are both using cherry picked angles to push that agenda.
