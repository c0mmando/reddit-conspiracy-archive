<p>I bet it&#39;s not easy to deploy, because it&#39;s such a unique architecture. I know a half-dozen programming languages, but setting up a reddit copy is still way outside my wheelhouse. It&#39;s not easy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very good at modifying existing code though and tweaking it, so if you ever get a reddit clone set up and are ready to start tweaking it to make improvements, give me a PM and I&#39;d love to contribute. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There&#39;s a chance the search functionity would take significant effort to get running not on Amazon (officially uses Amazon CloudSearch) but it&#39;s probably doable. I would have to do some testing. You need a server with at least 8gb ram and plenty of storage space, and more servers if it takes off.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s something ive been wondering. Ideally I&#39;d like to build most of the RES features in to it, but I know that&#39;s a tall order and will take a lot of time.

<p>I know someone who does a lot of hosting and could get us some space to just at least host the thing and get it running so it could be worked on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing, you&#39;re so great for spending time on this. Step 1 is to get it functional, step 2 is to put it up on an online server.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice, I&#39;m impressed. I spent 9 hours last night trying to get it to work. I got the host runnning on ubuntu but it always gives a 503 error when it&#39;s accessed, probably because of how haproxy is configured. I couldn&#39;t get past that point, I&#39;m still bashing my head against it. </p>

<p>Reddit search has always been broken, for 10 years now, I wouldn&#39;t worry about the search too much. </p>

<p>So it sounds like you&#39;re ready to throw it up on a webserver? I think I might set up my own webserver here to avoid paying rent while it&#39;s developed. But I guess I&#39;d have to re-deploy everything, which kind of puts us back where we are. </p>

<p>If I got an online webserver for like $10/mo would you be able to set it up again on the server? I am having serious issues with ubuntu hanging and crashing after I run the reddit install ubuntu script. </p>

<p>Did you use vagrant, or did you use the ubuntu install script on the github page? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey. Your night was a lot like mine then, I think I spent 6 hours bashing my head against this, mostly on getting solr itself running, which I failed at. But reddit was up and running and I loaded it with sample data and was able to post and see what the admin interface is like.</p>

<p>I used the ubuntu install script on ubuntu 14.04. I ran into this issue at some point, can&#39;t remember if it held up the installer script from completing or if I encountered it after: <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1815">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1815</a> I also messed around with reddit config files for too long before realizing I should just put everything in example.ini. (it triggered something to update that myreddit.update did not).</p>

<p>Were you on 14.04 and running the install as sudo? Were you on a VM? This stack runs so many services on so many ports that maybe something was conflicting for you.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;d be happy to install the reddit stack wheverever you want. Everything seemed to run okay but slowly on my VM with 2.5gb of ram. Eventually I will get the process down pat and have good documentation for it, so setting it up multiple times shouldn&#39;t be as big of an issue. That seems reasonable to save money on hosting while it is in development. Ideally you would just pass the database dump around to different environments, like to put your changes on staging to show people.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will keep plugging away at solr because I feel like I&#39;m close. I found the extra cron jobs somewhere that need to be configured for solr to work too, which are not in the official docs. Whenever you are ready for an environment, let me know. I can give you a public ssh key for access and you can remove it once I&#39;m done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey that&#39;s great, it sounds like you made more headway than me. </p>

<p>I did the same ubuntu install script on 14.04. </p>

<p>I could never find the example.ini file... is it in ~/etc/reddit/r2 ? I think my computer I was using was having RAM issues, it seems like once it was able to generate a 503 error (showing the host was running) my computer would slow to a crawl. It&#39;s a pretty old computer. I think I&#39;m going to try again on my desktop and try a virtual machine or dual boot. I was not doing a VM before, I was doing a fresh install of 14.04 after wiping the whole disk on an old laptop. So I really should not have had any conflicting issues, seems about as clean a way as it can be done, but I guess the computer was not good enough. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already installed Ubuntu and run the process seven times in the last 24 hours, LOL. Linux keeps flaking out on me, probably because of the computer. But I&#39;m getting fast at it too. </p>

<p>It might be worth the $10/mo to have something that&#39;s on 24/7 that multiple people can work on easily. I&#39;m still trying to figure out what is best. Perhaps I&#39;ll run my own machine for a couple weeks, and then we can move to paid webservers once we get it running at a reasonable level. </p>

<p>Sorry, but how does solr come in to this? This has been an issue for me, I tried setting up apache2, but it was fighting for port 80 with haproxy. Apparently solr is an apache thing, but is it part of the reddit-install.sh package? Is it necessary to make it work? </p>

<p>I tried making ubuntu a LAMP stack before running the script, but it just seemed to cause apache and haproxy to fight over port 80. I feel like I&#39;m missing a part of the puzzle here, and maybe solr is it? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be in touch when I get some hosting set up, either on my machine or a 3rd party server. It&#39;s in the works</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dang, it sounds like your install should have worked. That is a clean way to do it and as good as a VM. It sounds like a hardware problem, maybe there are linux drivers for that laptop. 7 times in 24 hours is nice, you are going to me the Rain Man of old ubuntu installs. </p>

<p>It might be worth the $10/mo to have something that&#39;s on 24/7 that multiple people can work on easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, especially if you have these people ready to go. I can pitch in on the server costs too if that is an issue. </p>

<p>Solr is the search service running on the Java Tomcat web server. It grabs posts from the postgres db and indexes them for fast keyword searching off in its own internal db. Reddit proper uses Amazon CloudSearch instead, but it does the same thing. So without Solr the search page says sorry under load or error or whatever.</p>

<p>Yes port 80 is already taken by whatever is serving the python reddit app. The missing piece is that the web server is already good to go with the install script. I don&#39;t know what the web server technically is, python has different stuff, but HAProxy is probably routing the requests. So just install the install script and nothing else.</p>

<p>Nice, I&#39;m glad things are in the works. The timing feels right.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Nice work.</p>

<p>I love the RES focus... if we add new features then we are the next reddit/a competitor and not just a reddit clone. I think we can easily make RES work with our cloned site, I will have to look into the best approach for that.</p>

<p>But over the long term, we can gradually move features out of the RES browser plugin and into our cloned reddit code base so that they are native features. Some of them probably will take a long time, but we can do it one feature at a time. I would love to work on stuff like that and I&#39;m amenable to working with other developers as well. </p>

<p>We should prioritize which RES features are the most important after we get launched. Eventually we should get a mission statement together, and maybe even a legal framework to protect you/the site&#39;s ownership. Ideally we will install infrastructure monitoring tools onto the server too, so select people can keep an eye on things like disk space and CPU load. We will also need to get daily offsite database backups in place, so that if someone is able to take us down, all is not lost. But baby steps, Rome/Khazaria/London was not built in a day. This is exciting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your approach of porting the RES features one at a time, that seems like a good approach over the long term. Porting the features is not a high priority though at the moment, but we&#39;ll get there. </p>

<p>Anyway, you made a very outrageous claim. I&#39;m calling you out on it; the purpose is not to get you banned. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d get banned anyway for pointing out a thread full of fake comments unless you personally responded to those people calling them shills.</p>

<p>To me, it looks like you&#39;re avoiding taking responsibility for your 80% claim the minute I ask you for some examples or evidence. Not cool.</p>

<p>Is it really against the rules to point to a <em>thread</em>, rather than a specific <em>comment</em>, and say that 80% of the comments are fake? I honestly doubt you&#39;d get banned for that, considering the rules are about accusations towards specific users.</p>

<p>I do understand his concern, but pointing to a thread isn&#39;t against the rules. He knows this, but also knows he&#39;s unable to back up his claim, hence his overly aggressive attitude.</p>

<p>Yes, rules 2 and 10 are broad enough that if a user is concerned they&#39;re already on thin ice, their paranoia at doing what you&#39;re asking is not entirely unfounded.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To illustrate how futile your insistence at the point is.  If you can&#39;t be certain one way or the other already, how is what magnora says going to make any difference.  </p>

<p>You two could go back and forth all day swapping examples but you&#39;re both too skeptical to make any headway and it would be a waste of everyone&#39;s time.  </p>

<p>Because of this, what you&#39;re repeatedly trying to get them to do comes across as subversive and an attempt to diffuse legitimate concerns and frustration as nonsensical fluff, exactly the kind of tactics people are fed up with seeing around here.</p>

<p>I get the need for supported claims, and this post is veering close to violating rule 12 anyways, but at least in this context it isn&#39;t as clear cut as &quot;Well if you&#39;re so certain than prove it.&quot;  </p>

<p>Yes, DukeNukemsDick, that&#39;s totally a reasonable takeaway from what I just said.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve admitted you couldn&#39;t even prove the alternative POV on this issue if you were pressed.  Yet you&#39;re so certain theirs is &quot;bullshit&quot; because they can&#39;t do the same? Because they can&#39;t do what you&#39;ve admitted can&#39;t be done...?  </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the guy claiming a teapot is orbiting the earth is crazy until he can prove otherwise. </p>

<p>Fine, that sounds rational.  </p>

<p>Until the point where you acknowledged we have evidence of teapots orbiting other planets (ie. shills do exist to some extent on the internet and you can&#39;t be sure who&#39;s who).  </p>

<p>Now the guy sounds a little less crazy.  Still, you probably have the rational upper hand. </p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s laws against talking about how a teapot finds itself in orbit? And you&#39;re asking someone to prove that a teapot is in orbit?  </p>

<p>Well, now a confrontational response from the guy that&#39;s been trying to talk to people about teapots in orbit without breaking the law about talking about teapots in orbit seems a bit more understandable.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s grant that an obsession with teapots in orbit is a questionable obsession.  It doesn&#39;t change the fact that the plausibility for <em>this</em> teapot it isn&#39;t as nutty as it is sometimes portrayed.</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe I&#39;m just overthinking the legal stuff (policies, terms of service, management, etc etc - I&#39;m not a lawyer). </p>

<p>I guess a poll would need to be done about what kind of a website people would  want, and how similar to reddit people would want (feature wise, both on the front end and back end of things). I think making it a minimal paid for service could clean up some of the crap that reddit deals with.</p>

<p>I stopped caring about that a long time ago. You cannot operate yourself like this, in fear of being banned from a stupid website for stating facts and speaking your opinion. Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re here to do? Stop letting them win by enforcing a spectrum of debate you must adhere to. Do that and they win. The rules are meant to protect the mods. The mods don&#39;t deserve protection. Expose the truth if that means bending the rules. Break them. Get banned if you have to. Make a new account and proceed like nothing happened. Or make a new account to post your potentially banworthy thing. We are not even people with identities here, we are users, screen names, with opinions to share and spread. Names mean nothing. This is your true power and there is not a damn thing that can stop it.</p>

<p>I could literally make a list of people in this thread who I think are not acting in good faith, but I&#39;d get banned for it and nothing would come of it. I&#39;ve been there, done that. </p>

<p>I&#39;d rather talk about the issue, with this name that has recognition. There&#39;s no reason to go that next step when the mods and admins aren&#39;t genuinely trying to fix things and will instead punish me for having the audacity to call anyone out specifically. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, that&#39;s an ok idea. I can see shills doing that as well. </p>

<p>I think there should be a system where people can flag people they suspect as trolls or shills, and if they accumulate enough flags they get looked at by the admins. And if this system is kept up with, the majority of users would be legitimate, so the flagging system itself wouldn&#39;t be gamed too hard</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably making some difference, but it certainly doesn&#39;t feel like it a lot of the time. It feels like an extremely uphill battle, because everything is swimming in disinfo and shills. That&#39;s why I&#39;d like a new site. We could get back to what reddit was like 8 years ago. It was amazing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone just needs to re-create reddit. I edited the OP so there&#39;s a link to the source code, which is open source. </p>

<p>Someone just has to pay a programmer to re-host this open-source code, and then we will have a functional reddit clone. Or do it themselves, but it&#39;s not easy. Should cost like $500 or less, hopefully. </p>

<p>Then once it&#39;s up, we can tweak it and so on. I could help with that, I&#39;m good at modifying and improving existing code, but I unfortunately don&#39;t know how to set it something like reddit.</p>

<p>Then it&#39;s a matter of finding cheap/good server space, and adding features and content to the site to make it a good reddit replacement. Then people will start to come over from reddit. </p>

<p>There is no turning point. It does not work that way, because the mods and admins are mostly in on this. So it will not reverse. Plus history shows us this is usually the case, it&#39;s a one-way thing. Websites have a natural life cycle, and I think we should accept that. </p>

<p>In fact, I think watching the stories posted and the canned responses gives a lot of insight into the mind of the &quot;enemy&quot;.

<p>The Joe Arpaio pardon story and comments are a perfect example.  Conspiracy theorists don&#39;t make strong emotional appeals or statements, and the comments in that story had ZERO to do with conspiracy, at all.

<p>That ship has sailed, sorry to tell you. It&#39;s not going to happen, unless you can do some computer hacking wizardry. </p>

<p>Reddit is dead. I think  we&#39;d be much better off starting a new platform than trying to fight the tide. </p>

<p>But your idea of starting an investigation is interesting. However I&#39;m not sure how much traction you&#39;ll get since the PATRIOT act legalized propaganda from what I understand. So they can say whatever they want, even if it&#39;s propaganda to start a civil war. There might be some angle you could take here that would work though. </p>

<p>I agree it goes way beyond ShareBlue and Cambridge Analytica. These are just prominent figures in a sea of companies doing this same thing. I think most people don&#39;t realize what is going on and how pervasive this is becoming. Perhaps a public education campaign about this issue would be good? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that authorization extends to private organizations. Seditious conspiracy to overthrow the government is still a high crime, right up there with treason. The legal justification for legalized propaganda is ostensibly for use as a weapon against the enemy in a time of war or as needed to protect national security. The only way Reddit, Media Matters, and CNN are protected legally is if they are operating on behalf of the CIA or perhaps some other federal agency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol i get ya.  im saying we need a catch phrase better than&quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; because when it comes down to identifying groups the masses like something catchy.  if we do it right we could start a new way of thinking for most people.  if we can catch on as a group of people who simply want to examine life and inly seek the truth maybe we will sway society with us.  one thing is for sure we have to start acting upon our words.  its one thing to keep talking about these topics but what good does it do in the end if we just sit and bicker amongst ourselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree. I don&#39;t know if a catchy name is needed, just a good website for people to visit. Any -ism or whatever label you can put on it will just become a reason for others to smear you. I just like talking the facts, I&#39;m not a fan of labels.

    <div class="md"><p>the reason i think its important is because of the negative connotations associated with &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  if pedogate or something else big comes out and we are right then a cat hy new name could be the key to spreading the knowledge.  it may seem insignificant to you but marketing is something we conspiracy guys are not good at.  even if were right people have the pre concieved notion in thier head already.  to combat that notion we have to be different and be right.  no false claims no speculation without evidence.  if we do that and start at a fresh site and verify users, we could unite everyone who wants to know the truth and creat a powerful movement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a &quot;conspiracy guy&quot; though. I&#39;m just a guy who likes the truth.</p>

<p>Pigeonholing yourself like that in the first place is doing your message a huge disservice. You just want to be telling the truth that maybe gets overlooked, so I think this whole &quot;conspiracy&quot; angle should be shed entirely. Most of the really important stuff in this sub over the years <em>should</em> be on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> (and used to be) but then they started censoring the hell out of it and this sub was the only thing left. </p>

<p>I agree though that there&#39;s a lot of potential out there, which is why I think someone really needs to make a new reddit. Like yesterday </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious by the people&#39;s attire they are prone to possible violence. They went as a &quot;counter-protest&quot; to a protest of the removal of a confederate statue, that is a fundamental difference in ideology. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if these people can work out their differences in talk. People are incredibly stubborn. I sure hope they just stop going out there though.

<p>Maybe this is a dangerous line of thought, but it makes me want to fight fire with fire. Buy bots, shills etc for our side. Unfortunately most of us are fairly ethical and don&#39;t have unlimited funds at our disposal. I mean, Jesus we have 4,000 users here now, when I joined about a year ago it was in the few hundred range. Even then it was pretty bad, now it&#39;s awful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your words. It is pretty depressing to see what happens to the threads on this sub now. Your idea of fighting fire with fire is interesting, however the caveat is that our fire wouldn&#39;t have the support of reddit admins and thus would probably be detected and removed in a matter of days after beginning to use it. </p>

<p>It would be really funny though to make a post calling out ShareBlue and Cambridge Analytica, and then buy votes to force it to the #1 spot on the front page. There are companies that just sell votes, so we could pool money and do that. Or if someone is clever, we could do it ourselves like you said. But I still think it&#39;d get shut down quickly, so you&#39;d probably only be able to get a post or two off before we&#39;d all be permabanned. That&#39;s my guess at how it&#39;d go down if that route was tried </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we just did what shills now do, it would work. Route all traffic through AWS servers, code an app that allows switching between multiple IPs and handles easily, set up say 20 accts, scrounge together some funds, hire a passionate alt-righter, and have them wreck votes and posts in the same infuriating way, but for the things that spez likes instead (I still have not seen proof that Cambridge shills; they deal in targeted ads and profile building, judging from the information available). </p>

<p>And we&#39;d have him be fucking obvious. We&#39;d want people to notice and think that something is very wrong. Like, maybe in one thread, we have him go in and tell everyone the exact same message, like &quot;Hi I&#39;m one of your new team of shills! My name is fuck you, and I have access to 300+ accts. I use Amazon AWS to spoof my traffic, so reddit can&#39;t stop me. </p>

<p>We are here to demoralize the shit out of you guys and pervert your message so that you cannot communicate effectively.</p>

<p>Every conversation that you want to have, we will be pedantic, litigious, and intentionally misunderstanding, and we will be there with 10 accts a piece, multiples of us in each thread you care about. 
We will call you stupid for not taking the time to relieve me of my responsibility to educate myself. </p>

<p>When you think you are gaining traction, we will downvote everything you would like to see upvoted. </p>

<p>We will fill your feed with pages and pages of useless junk, making this sub into something that we want it to be, and you&#39;ll just have to sit there, dealing with the injustice of it all, unless you can somehow make this illegal, but you won&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>Then you just repeat that same message from like 50 accts all over the place, with a bunch of open windows at once, just over and over and over, then we just fucking get down to it. </p>

<p>Then, we do the idea that <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a>  was talking about, and we artificially upvote a ton of the posts, all in one day, to the FP. Votes are not that exensive, and we&#39;d have limited spoofing abilities with our AWS range.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to invest in this. I know some people who could code a functional app in no time, I&#39;m sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whomever controls the servers and the code can always suppress and push whatever they want.  This is a private organization that is built upon private servers that offer zero transparency and zero guarantee of message or vote authenticity.  A distributed (mesh networks,) encrypted (think block chain tech), and open source (with 3rd party code verification of nodes designed in) system needs to be designed from the ground up for all social networks (e.g. Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn.)  The general technical know-how of the population is the biggest barrier to the deployment of a balanced systems that provide what I consider public utilities that can&#39;t be so easily manipulated to the detriment of its users.  Our social networks (read: our society) is too important to be left in the hands of private or governmental entities.</p>

<p>P.S. It will always difficult (if not impossible) to remove vote manipulation and suppression, but we can make it extremely more complicated for those that would choose to do it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just assume the voting isn&#39;t real. If someone responds to your comment with a logical fallacy and gets double the upvotes as you, then it gives the impression that there are a lot of really dumb people who were convinced by some charlatan shill. That could really do some damage to your motivation and make you want to give up. However, if you realize the voting isn&#39;t real, then you may realize that there really weren&#39;t that many people who fell for the logical fallacy. For all you know, your comment that is stuck at -2 convinced nearly everyone who read it. </p>

<p>Try using a different account. Try that with a different IP address. If you are a prolific poster who they consider to be a thorn in their side, disrupting their propaganda from time to time, then they very well might be monitoring your account or may have placed some kind of handicap on how many votes you accumulate. </p>

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p><a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/07/Troops-Trolls-and-Troublemakers.pdf">Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation</a></p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the above post by u/flyPeterfly. Creating a new reddit is not a bad idea in itself idea, but, to also use the analogy of the battleground, wouldn&#39;t this be similar to retreat and regroup, only to wait until the enemy catches up to us again, and then what? I don&#39;t think the admins are that much of a guarantor for security. Just think about the AI in a few years, they could easily infiltrate any site with thousands of bots posing as seemingly real users.</p>

<p>So what to do? I&#39;d say fight the battle right here, right now. And if an enemy is as strong as in our case, we need to upgrade our arsenal. I&#39;m thinking along the lines of a new digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck">Operation mindfuck</a>.</p>

<p>They pose as real users feeding propaganda to the masses? Let&#39;s poison their well with which they booze the sheep, let us induce a facilitation of the conspicuity of the general status paradoxus. This current state, which is the effect of this overwhelming machine of propaganda and ideologization, is our battleground.</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a large part of it is because of the younger generation using Reddit now. They don&#39;t care or even think about propaganda, only &quot;dank memes&quot;. Look at the top you tubers. It&#39;s that valid anti-intellectual bullshit that they eat up. I&#39;m sure some of it is an intentional distraction, manufactured idiocy, but there are others that just hopped on the gravy train. One of the reasons I think Trump supporters, at least on Reddit, are young is because of how much importance they place on memes. Most people don&#39;t care about propaganda if their side is winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voat only has two admins, or one I guess now. @puttitout who took over for the founder @atko.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of bans on voat.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Moderator bans, which are permanent.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer bans via downvoating, which are temporary. If your CCP (karma) goes below neutral (I think it is neutral 0, could be below 100, not sure) you are only allowed 10 posts/comments a day. When your CCP is low you are also more limited via &quot;wait 7 minutes&quot; type messages.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is the most bizarre. The masses will ramble on and on about how voat is &quot;Free Speech&quot;, then down voat brigade you until your account is unusable. Talking about this form of censorship on voat is the best way to get brigaded into silence.</p>

<p>The admin posted an announcement last month declaring he&#39;d be lifting the karma restrictions, but I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath. His favorite pastime seems to be rolling voat back to old code after fucking shit up, then blaming it on ddos attacks. The site is currently in a barely usable state, as it has been many times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think of the idea that there&#39;s an irreconcilable difference between &quot;useful online discourse&quot; and anonymity??</p>

<p>Essentially, anonymous voices can be multiplied by astroturfing, social media account management, sock puppetry, and soon on a much greater scale by AI.</p>

<p>You can make as many new sites as you like. Infiltration, by voices pretending to be what they&#39;re not, will be directly proportional to the interestingness and popularity of the latest site.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that there are no benefits to anonymity. Maybe people could be anonymous in one place but &quot;one person one vote/voice&quot; in some other designated place... And I don&#39;t even know how it would work (yet).</p>

<p>But currently there are motives to &quot;cheat&quot; forums like reddit. And this problem will migrate to every other site like it.</p>

<p>I still think anonymity is the way to go, personally. There&#39;s too many chilling effects when people&#39;s names are exposed. There are ways to do anonymous forums where the established community can remove bad actors. It&#39;s not easy and never lasts forever, but it&#39;s doable. </p>

If you mean Voat, think about this one: At least people are allowed to voice their hatred or opinion etc. 
One can always counter post with good arguments and evidence if one doesn&#39;t like the comments. I do.
That is preferable to being banned from saying anything that isn&#39;t of someone else&#39;s liking. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

<p>It would be more likely that the people running this site created ShareBlue to create an impression there is opposition. </p>

<p>And just what would a site look like that you would like, r/conspiracy is more conservative now than it was the first 4 years, and back then it was a young libertarian kind of place not this hard core Bircher/libertaran operation it seems to be now. </p>

<p>So what does a dream site look like to you.  </p>

<p>You want some liberal posters to bash. </p>

<p>But not too many? </p>

<p>Because if you want straight up conservative sites there are hundreds.</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh of course that was very big too, and took over T_D and other subs. Trump&#39;s company was named Cambridge Analytica. </p>

<p>But from what I understand, shareblue has a wider reach and hires more employees to comment on more websites. Cambridge Analytica may have had the most bots, but that doesn&#39;t meant they&#39;re the biggest. </p>

<p>They&#39;re both a problem, and it&#39;s not really important which is bigger. The issue is that it&#39;s happening at all, and that people should be extremely aware of this happening constantly on both political &quot;sides&quot;. It&#39;s the digital version of an agent provocateur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice collection of info.  I had a 9+ year old account I deleted during the election last year when Reddit decided it would change it&#39;s front page algorithms to basically eliminate the_donald, deleted pizzagate sub, and other BS.  The censorship.  I only created a new account just so I could keep subscribed to this sub and a few others.  It is really sad this site was once a proponent for unfiltered open and free information but has completely sold out.  Reddit is probably being ran by CNN now for all I know.  I&#39;ll keep coming here (for now) to check a few things but this site has been dead and full of propaganda for awhile now.</p>

<p>Ie auntie sue is old school so we need to make this negative Hilary headline appeal to her sense of authority in order for her to click. Oh that didn&#39;t work? Well she also has a brother in the military so let&#39;s try slightly changing the wording so that it sounds like Hilary is anti-military. All done automatically by AI. This specific ad targeting aunt Sue may only ever actually be viewed by aunt Sue on her Facebook, while aunt Sally the old hippy gets something about Hilary hating pot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who shilled for israel on r/worldnews during the 2013 conflict with gaza. It was part of a community service component of their scholarships and was coordinated via a twitter aggregator that linked to specific posts or even parent comments. I think it worked too tbh because the target audience and the site at that time was just so prone to blindly believing whatever the top comment was. The only reason I didn&#39;t fall for it was because I had been overseas during the 2007 conflict with lebanon and seeing non-anglo coverage showing israel&#39;s atrocities and then coming back to america and seeing clips of jews running into shelters as an alarm sounded was really eye-opening. If I had just been a normal 18 year old average reddit user I would&#39;ve walked away from those r/worldnews threads thinking &quot;well shit I guess both sides are bad&quot; that I&#39;m sure most on here think due to idf. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m banned on worldnews and got heavily targeted by JIDF shills a few years ago. Israel and the Israeli army definitely have a huge web presence. It&#39;s a cheap way to get good PR (that most people believe is organic community commentary). </p>

<p>JIDF even hijacked a subreddit I made. I created a backup after <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> became censored, called <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a>. If you check it out, you&#39;ll see they took it over with a trick that I fell for (made it so there was no mod on the sub, which apparently allows them to go claim ownership of it in another sub, which is how they became a mod) and put up the JIDF flag as a &quot;fuck you&quot; to me, and then posted a bunch of gory and disgusting and defamatory content in the subreddit. </p>

<p>The whole thing is a mess. They push so much harder to gain control than people realize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cambridge Analytica spread political ads on facebook. They analyzed data and picked out specific people to spread ads to. To my knowledge, it has never been shown or admitted that they hired shills. However, exactly how they spread those ads to people on Facebook may have been through shills. I wouldn&#39;t know because I don&#39;t have facebook and don&#39;t know much about it. I gave up trying to figure out exactly what CA did. I also asked others to explain a few times but nobody has. </p>

<p>That said, someone out there hired pro-Donald shills.</p>

<p>The &quot;5 to 1&quot; bot ratio on Twitter was actually measured in tweets. The pro-Donald bots tweeted 5 times as often. (or 4 times, whatever it actually was)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than four times as many tweets were made by automated accounts in favour of Donald Trump around the first US presidential debate as by those backing Hillary Clinton, a study says.</p>

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been around these parts for a long time, and what you&#39;re complaining about is not new. That being said, it has gotten much worse in the past couple years. </p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s my personal opinion that <em>most</em> top comments on Reddit (and any large online platform for &#39;public&#39; discourse) are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Vote-rigged/brigaded</p></li>
<li><p>Paid for by corporate entities as an advertisement, or public relations move</p></li>
<li><p>Paid for by nation state entities for &quot;reasons&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is very little organic discussion to be found anywhere. It&#39;s almost all PR/Propaganda with the aim of either pushing a narrative or to foment more &quot;us vs them&quot; between the underclasses, or for more traditional propaganda.</p>

<p>Oh, a lot of them are just plain old advertisements as well.</p>

<p>Now, on to the scarier things that I have noticed recently.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A lot of purportedly esoteric truth posts that seem to have a &quot;left hand path&quot; or &quot;satanist/luciferian&quot; undercurrent. Reminds me of how pretty much any cultish group (ie ISIS) recruits disaffected people (ie conspiracy theorists). </p></li>
<li><p>A lot of purportedly &quot;truth seeking&quot; posts that have a decidedly anti-Semitic tone. (Not anti zionist, I know the difference).</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of posts pushing obvious disinformation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I think has happened is that in order to slow the inevitable trickle of information about the actual conspiracies in the information age, the disinformation campaign designed to cast doubt on those who dissented against the conclusions of the Warren Report has been ratcheted to 11. Eg. Any news report about flat earthers says there are literally hundreds of them &quot;officially&quot; registered in the US. Hundreds! Yet I see flat earthers commenting every day (hopefully ironically or for the lulz). </p>

<p>Anyways, this has been quite disorganized as I am commuting home, but my point is this: Reddit is broken, the internet as the great leveller is broken, and I am not sure that we can ever recover.</p>

<p>Gotta go back to beer hall discussions, only this time with longer haircuts and less racism.</p>

<p>Still gonna read <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> though... </p>

<p>I&#39;ll end this rambling rant with my own original conspiracy theory: America/Western Capitalism is on its last legs economically and TPTB actually wanted Trump to get elected so that he could be the fall guy when SHTF. My opinion is the shit hitting the fan will be an even bigger financial crisis than in 2008. Hopefully I am wrong as I too live in the west...</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m just some old fogey who&#39;s read way too many conspiracy theories. I&#39;ll see myself out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I agree with everything you said. </p>

<p>Especially the &quot;fall guy&quot; theory with Trump. I think that is 100% going to happen, be it a stock market crash, a war (and the false flag that will likely precede it), or both. The media signalling is far too obvious and coordinated, laying the groundwork for the scapegoating to come, they want everyone to hate this guy, and to be divided and worked-up as possible. </p>

<p>I just hope enough people can see through the charade to not be fooled. Some will be fooled, of course, but hopefully enough will see through it that we can stem the bleeding instead of just getting 100% yanked around by the powers that be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your last theory since a crash is coming. Would have happened regardless of a Clinton or Trump presidency. It will make 2008 look like nothing. We can even use history as a rough guide. There was a crash in 1920 IIRC. A big one. What followed was the  roaring twenties; a huge bubble financed by debt and other forms of predatory capitalism fueled with massive amounts of new technology due to the expansion of electricity.(sound familiar?) Nobody even thought the 1929 crash was a big deal at first cause they had gotten &quot;through&quot; 1920 one. </p>

<p>That being said, I think you&#39;re giving HRC too much credit though. Groupthink is real and they can&#39;t fathom the system they&#39;ve built is set to collapse. </p>

<p>As a counterpoint to that, maybe the reason HRC was such a blatant warmonger was she knew the system is collapsing and the only way to prop it up is more imperialism? Our economy is heavily finacialized and we would probably have collapsed already if we weren&#39;t an empire with specious things that could go away propping us up like the petrodollar.</p>

<p>Sigh. We&#39;re fucked. I just hope we don&#39;t take the place of the Germans. (Aka &quot;are we the baddies?&quot;)</p>

<p>Look at the way in which they&#39;re blatantly plundering the government. The U.S is a corpse by this point, like the Roman empire after the sack. </p>

<p>That said, I think all the Satanic/Luciferian buzz is disinfo. MAPs just pushed the FDA to accept the medical legitimacy of MDMA. Ayahuasca is the secret to Christianity. Jesus probably drank Soma and encountered this Ayahausca who is tied to DMT, LSD, and mushrooms. He saw her in his consort, Mary.

    <div class="md"><p>My own personal belief is that the reason trump was elected was because he makes a great figure head for division.
Since he has been elected people have automatically assumed that if you are a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; or if you dislike corporate media you love trump and are a bigoted moron.<br/>
He has been used to hate the media which causes people to want to trust said media, to spout random conspiracies and then try to associate those conspiracies with bigotry and stupidity. He has made himself hated and loves at the same time by so many by driving a wedge in the population.
Basically with him as president they&#39;ve thrown a huge wrench in public opinion towards people who want real change on all sides of the debates. It&#39;s almost impossible now to have a decent conversation with either party as they seem so dug in on their views and immediately think you&#39;re for the opposite team rather than actually listen to what you have to say. 
It was a brilliant move on their part and I for one didn&#39;t see it coming as I was pretty positive Hillary was the choice candidate for the banking cartel but as I watch trump in action I realize that he is no different and is pushing the same agenda she would have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well seeing as those aren&#39;t exactly the agenda I was referring too probably not. Obviously the two parties have minor differences to try and convince people that their choice matters. But when was the last time a president actually stood up to the banks? Or how about the war machine as it rolls onward towards any country that dares resist said banks. Some great examples is North Korea and Iran. Both whom the media and trump are very angry at and seem gung-ho to start a war with. The last president I know of who actually stood up to our military and our banking system ended up dead. 
As I said I believe trump is exactly what the deep state needs and wants. </p>

<p>If all you do is consume and inundate yourself with conspiracy theories as your sole source for &quot;news&quot;, you&#39;ll easily become paranoid, dejected, confused, and ultimately apathetic.  Step out of the echo chamber, leave your bias at the door, and let credible facts guide you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Economic guy here. I agree with your assessment of said coming crash. Nothing from 2008 was fixed.  The proverbial can was just kicked down a road paved with massive amounts of debt. The only way this is avoided at this point in time is if they can keep that can rolling until 2024ish. This is when the largest generation (millennials) hit their peak spending years. It should be a period of time similar to 1993-2007. That, or an invention that rivals the industrial or computer revolution. Something that truly changes how we work and live. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this entirely. Even if the US becomes a fully Communist country on the surface, there will still be that underground Capitalist element. One thing I&#39;ve noticed in some of the countries that are Communist or used to be &quot;fully Communist&quot; is that they still have the black markets which essentially is Capitalism. Unregulated Capitalism where you may get rat meat instead of beef or chicken or you may get plastic rice or dirt passing off as pepper or, in the case of Venesuela (I know socialism not Communism), products from the black market that only the rich can afford but still its Capitalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say I disagree. Sometimes the world seems like a bad dream or a dangerous video game like GTA 5. It&#39;s just a giant joke on some level, being had at our expense. But likewise, playing GTA 5 is only scary if you&#39;re taking the game seriously. If you don&#39;t care about the game, the game cannot hurt you. </p>

<p>In a way, life on earth is kind of like this. It&#39;s unreal, in a way. Who is to say that this isn&#39;t a game too, on some level? We are all going to die someday, just like in GTA 5. We cannot live our lives carrying the suffering of the entire world on our shoulders, it is simply too much to bear, and it is not our burden to bear in the first place. </p>

<p>Compassion and helping others is so important. But you cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You deserve compassion too. The compassion of being free from the burden of suffering, of yourself and others. There&#39;s a balance, and it&#39;s hard to find. Good luck out there. </p>

<p>I may still try and write a bit in the future, I&#39;m just very frustrated with reddit so I made this post. I should really be thankful for my sub and the 1400 subscribers who care enough to follow the articles I write. What should I write about next? I was thinking CIA media stations worldwide, or how national borders were intentionally drawn to divide and conquer ethnic groups all over the world like the Kurds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sound good!   I think the national borders issue might be more eye-opening for the &quot;regulars&quot; around here, who I think are already well aware of CIA media infiltration.  But the nefarious intentions behind the placement of some of the international borders definitely needs more exposure.  Goes back to the Great Game era or earlier I would imagine?  The way the Ottoman Empire was carved up definitely reeks of long term divide and conquer strategies and we&#39;ve seen it play out over many decades now.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, the CIA media thing has been talked about a lot. </p>

<p>Totally agree on the Ottoman empire remains being carved up. I wonder if other collapsing empires left behind a wake of countries that were divided and conquered like the Kurds. Like maybe when the USSR collapsed. Or when Pakistan was separated from India. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i get that shills are like a bad virus, but what i&#39;m wondering is if there&#39;s a larger solution than just reversing the bad.  what if a website can be made where shills can exist yet no matter what they do they can&#39;t harm the site.  a system where anyone can exist.  no banning.  like some online version of non violence.  something that doesn&#39;t fall to the same fate as the rest.  an incorruptible system.</p>

<p>not saying i have such a thing figured out.  but a vision like this can be a start of some kind, i suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you just described 4chan.</p>

<p>No banning means if the trolls/shills have enough people commenting, they essentially take over the forum. Which in turn pushes the legitimate users away, which puts the ratio more in their favor. This creates a feedback loop until the site is <em>mostly</em> shills. 4chan is kind of approaching this, imo</p>

<p>Reddit suffers from a similar problem. Half the problem is they don&#39;t ban people who poison the well, and the other half is they DO ban people who call those people out. So before the mods were corrupted, reddit worked great, but now that the mods are overtaken, it&#39;s <em>accelerating</em> the ratio of bad to good users. </p>

<p>So unfortunately I think a banning system is necessary, but it must be closely watched by the community at large, and trolls and shills must be removed instantly because they fester if they&#39;re not. And the banning system must never be overtaken by trolls/shills or the whole thing is lost. Like reddit. </p>

<p>Honestly I think websites just have a lifecycle, and reddit has reached the end of its lifecycle. </p>

<p>Indeed, being a mod presents similar challenges. Alas, I think both your writing and moderating to thwart those who seek to censor this subreddit are beneficial on the whole so I do hope they both continue :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, because the admins can ban these bots and people pushing agendas. Which is how reddit functioned for 5 years, it worked great. Then the admins got bought out, and the mods changed to protect those who should be banned, then it all went bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ok sure I agree. But who is to say the same thing won&#39;t happen again? A new reddit may be fine for a while, then get bought out (it will be too tempting for the owners), and then again go to shit. </p>

<p>A new &#39;reddit&#39; or something similar needs to be able to run on it&#39;s own without interference (apart from keeping servers up etc.).</p>

I hate this shitty website. I only stay for the entertaining conspiracies and Indian food recipes (r/indianfood)
The rest is bullshit and circle jerking garbage.
If you don&#39;t follow the narrative you get shit on.
People hold fake internet points on a pedestal and conform their ideas to gain them, which is an extremely fucked up concept.</p>

<p>Good luck introducing new ideas or opinions to r/worldnews or any other default sub.
This site is definitely fucked up beyond all repair.</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

Media are pumping lies and propaganda to fire up a minority of fools and making this happen, America didn&#39;t get stupid overnight.

By the time I was old enough to love it the party was over.  So many 3rd albums just sucked ass when shit became over produced. Then you end up with Creed which you actually miss when Nickelback comes along.  All the while the music scene evolves and carries on.  </p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools. </p>

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p><a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/07/Troops-Trolls-and-Troublemakers.pdf">Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation</a></p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

The problems are: upvoting/downvoting, anonymity, and karma. Get rid of all those things and a Reddit-like site might work. Otherwise, it&#39;s doomed to the same fate as the current Reddit.</p>

<p>In case you do.</p>

<p>Go into the real world now and do what you&#39;ve been trying to do here. That&#39;s how you spread truth.</p>

<p>Trying to educate people on internet forums is mostly a waste of time, if the intention is to teach them. Most don&#39;t want to learn, just an experience. Self learning is probably the main purposeful goal of web forums. Some times lessons repeat. Sometimes people get lucky.</p>

<p>I think what helps are improved web search tools. A radical change would be a way to access the crawlers of internet data. Revealing in real time, what&#39;s actually going on, with say, corporate power users of the web.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just more sifting of data. Bound to happen as the web grows. We just get better at searching. As you learn, things get more nuanced and complicated. If we&#39;re that lucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve always written some good posts Mag, it would be a shame if you pulled out from this site. I do still think there is hope. Especially on some smaller subs there are still plenty of amazing discussions going on. Even r/conspiracy has not yet been completely infiltrated. Yes there is a lot of noise, yes it&#39;s a battleground in a sense, but there is still plenty of interesting threads of conversation. Nearly every thread will have paid-for comments and paid provocateurs, but if you&#39;re used to it you can get used to just tuning that out.</p>

<p>But to be fair, I do suggest that people posting things here should also post them somewhere else, like a blog or general website. 
Especially quality posts  -  and you definitely have made some high quality posts, as have many others. I suggest making your own site/blog. I have done so myself (link to site - <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com">embraceyourexperience.com</a>)   , I haven&#39;t been updating it much recently due to the lack of time but the future may bring more content to it (it&#39;s not strictly conspiracy related, more alternative psychology, esoteric/metaphysical thought, spirituality and simply basic ideas on how to find inner peace, compassion and spread it, which I think is one of the fundamentals of humanity&#39;s ability to be free from external control and sociopaths coming and staying in power - a united, empathic and internally fulfilled populace cannot be controlled, it&#39;s just not possible... you cannot create hate when peace is the norm).</p>

<p>Anyway, with the amount of stuff your write here, you should probably have created your own site ages ago. But you can still continue posting here and keeping the dream alive. If everyone that makes quality content simply disappears, Reddit truly is going to die. Now it&#39;s more like a harsh battleground (on the main subs at least, some smaller subs can be amazing - like CST for example imho).</p>

<p>Creating a new Reddit is going to be difficult. This is where the people will stay. If you want an audience to spread the awareness this is the place to be. It was obvious Reddit was going to be infiltrated because it has grown so popular. This is destined to happen to all forums and sites that have millions of visits per day. Reddit is huge, it&#39;s absolutely one of the most popular websites, so it&#39;s not a surprise this is happening. I agree that there should be a new place, but I do still think that from time to time people should post some good stuff here as well, simply to be the light in the darkness - and that light is what Reddit so desperately needs right now.</p>

<p>Stay well man. If you truly feel it&#39;s done for you here, then maybe find another active forum + start your own site/blog, or perhaps simply post on smaller, more sane and less controlled subs. It&#39;s going to be a while before a new Reddit can appear (and become populated to this degree - but who knows maybe it can happen).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest the up/downvote system is broken. I would think an upvote only system, or a system where you can sort by most viewed, would be best. Voat has no good mobile app, and 90% of my Redditing is done on mobile. What Reddit did that was revolutionary is the way the forums are organized by subs and that the posts have a comments section which is organized. Most other forums still use this old ass confusing format from the 90s. Where you click on a thread and it&#39;s just a bunch of comments in chronological order. Whereas Reddit makes it easier to follow a conversation cause you can comment on a comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question: What happens if the new platforms become taken over/coopted by the types of people you complain about? I&#39;ve seen many Youtubers and people from Twitter talking about leaving the platforms and going to alternative sites and everything. That&#39;s all well and fine for now but if those platforms become popular it will bring the same types of people into those places and we&#39;ll be right back to where we are now. While I respect your ideas I don&#39;t know if abandoning the site is entirely the only possibility. Something has to change. Something significant. I wouldn&#39;t know where to start though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that there&#39;s a few bad subs here and there. It&#39;s that MOST of reddit is a propaganda-fest shit-show, and it&#39;s systemic to the point where hundreds of millions of people are being influenced by this crap, thinking it&#39;s &quot;popular&quot; when it&#39;s just manufactured votes that aren&#39;t real </p>

<p>Totally agree on the Ottoman empire remains being carved up. I wonder if other collapsing empires left behind a wake of countries that were divided and conquered like the Kurds. Like maybe when the USSR collapsed. Or when Pakistan was separated from India. </p>
