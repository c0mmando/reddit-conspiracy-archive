       This website is done. It's 90% lies, and 10% truth at this point. It's really not even worth trying to save anymore. The whole site should go down, forever. The state it is in, gives the false appearance of public acceptance of abhorrent ideas, because ShareBlue runs the site now but so few realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone needs to make a new reddit, a new voat, and everyone can leave reddit to go there. The leftist extremists can take what's left of reddit, and the rightist extremists can take what's left of voat. And the rest of us sane people can move to the new site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will someone please make a new reddit?

       Bless you for even trying at all. I understand the loss of motivation. But it's just one bad programmer, perhaps the next one will be able to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet it's not easy to deploy, because it's such a unique architecture. I know a half-dozen programming languages, but setting up a reddit copy is still way outside my wheelhouse. It's not easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very good at modifying existing code though and tweaking it, so if you ever get a reddit clone set up and are ready to start tweaking it to make improvements, give me a PM and I'd love to contribute.

       As in I'd be happy to customize and add new features to Reddit or Steem's code, but starting from nothing is very time consuming. It took Voat's from scratch code like a year to get stable and they almost went broke.

       I would strongly suggest against amazon hosting, that gives them censorship control. I would recommend a small server company that specializes in anti-censorship practices. Although the amazon servers might be ok at first

       Agreed. There's a chance the search functionity would take significant effort to get running not on Amazon (officially uses Amazon CloudSearch) but it's probably doable. I would have to do some testing. You need a server with at least 8gb ram and plenty of storage space, and more servers if it takes off. Would love to help anyone that's liberty minded with this stuff.

       I will just do a local/offline/vm test and let you know. I don't want to pay to host this or be a mod or anything. I'm just offering voluntary tech services to someone so inclined. Tech is stupid and shouldn't hold anyone back.

       Yeah, that's something ive been wondering. Ideally I'd like to build most of the RES features in to it, but I know that's a tall order and will take a lot of time. But if you get it functional, I'd just love to see that and see where we're at. It's probably just like the 2007-ish reddit setup, I would imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know someone who does a lot of hosting and could get us some space to just at least host the thing and get it running so it could be worked on

       Amazing, you're so great for spending time on this. Step 1 is to get it functional, step 2 is to put it up on an online server. Step 3 is to tweak it for a while to get it functional in the desired way. Then Step 4 will be to attract users and seed content and continue tweaking. Let's focus on completing steps 1 and 2. I'll talk to my server hosting guy

       Nice, I'm impressed. I spent 9 hours last night trying to get it to work. I got the host runnning on ubuntu but it always gives a 503 error when it's accessed, probably because of how haproxy is configured. I couldn't get past that point, I'm still bashing my head against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit search has always been broken, for 10 years now, I wouldn't worry about the search too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it sounds like you're ready to throw it up on a webserver? I think I might set up my own webserver here to avoid paying rent while it's developed. But I guess I'd have to re-deploy everything, which kind of puts us back where we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I got an online webserver for like $10/mo would you be able to set it up again on the server? I am having serious issues with ubuntu hanging and crashing after I run the reddit install ubuntu script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you use vagrant, or did you use the ubuntu install script on the github page?

       Hey. Your night was a lot like mine then, I think I spent 6 hours bashing my head against this, mostly on getting solr itself running, which I failed at. But reddit was up and running and I loaded it with sample data and was able to post and see what the admin interface is like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the ubuntu install script on ubuntu 14.04. I ran into this issue at some point, can't remember if it held up the installer script from completing or if I encountered it after:
       <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1815">
        https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1815
       </a>
       I also messed around with reddit config files for too long before realizing I should just put everything in example.ini. (it triggered something to update that myreddit.update did not).
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you on 14.04 and running the install as sudo? Were you on a VM? This stack runs so many services on so many ports that maybe something was conflicting for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I'd be happy to install the reddit stack wheverever you want. Everything seemed to run okay but slowly on my VM with 2.5gb of ram. Eventually I will get the process down pat and have good documentation for it, so setting it up multiple times shouldn't be as big of an issue. That seems reasonable to save money on hosting while it is in development. Ideally you would just pass the database dump around to different environments, like to put your changes on staging to show people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I will keep plugging away at solr because I feel like I'm close. I found the extra cron jobs somewhere that need to be configured for solr to work too, which are not in the official docs. Whenever you are ready for an environment, let me know. I can give you a public ssh key for access and you can remove it once I'm done.

       Hey that's great, it sounds like you made more headway than me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did the same ubuntu install script on 14.04.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could never find the example.ini file... is it in ~/etc/reddit/r2 ? I think my computer I was using was having RAM issues, it seems like once it was able to generate a 503 error (showing the host was running) my computer would slow to a crawl. It's a pretty old computer. I think I'm going to try again on my desktop and try a virtual machine or dual boot. I was not doing a VM before, I was doing a fresh install of 14.04 after wiping the whole disk on an old laptop. So I really should not have had any conflicting issues, seems about as clean a way as it can be done, but I guess the computer was not good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already installed Ubuntu and run the process seven times in the last 24 hours, LOL. Linux keeps flaking out on me, probably because of the computer. But I'm getting fast at it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be worth the $10/mo to have something that's on 24/7 that multiple people can work on easily. I'm still trying to figure out what is best. Perhaps I'll run my own machine for a couple weeks, and then we can move to paid webservers once we get it running at a reasonable level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but how does solr come in to this? This has been an issue for me, I tried setting up apache2, but it was fighting for port 80 with haproxy. Apparently solr is an apache thing, but is it part of the reddit-install.sh package? Is it necessary to make it work?
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried making ubuntu a LAMP stack before running the script, but it just seemed to cause apache and haproxy to fight over port 80. I feel like I'm missing a part of the puzzle here, and maybe solr is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be in touch when I get some hosting set up, either on my machine or a 3rd party server. It's in the works

       Dang, it sounds like your install should have worked. That is a clean way to do it and as good as a VM. It sounds like a hardware problem, maybe there are linux drivers for that laptop. 7 times in 24 hours is nice, you are going to me the Rain Man of old ubuntu installs.

      <p>
       Agreed, especially if you have these people ready to go. I can pitch in on the server costs too if that is an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solr is the search service running on the Java Tomcat web server. It grabs posts from the postgres db and indexes them for fast keyword searching off in its own internal db. Reddit proper uses Amazon CloudSearch instead, but it does the same thing. So without Solr the search page says sorry under load or error or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes port 80 is already taken by whatever is serving the python reddit app. The missing piece is that the web server is already good to go with the install script. I don't know what the web server technically is, python has different stuff, but HAProxy is probably routing the requests. So just install the install script and nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice, I'm glad things are in the works. The timing feels right.

       I'm still looking at server options. I'm realizing my anonymity is likely going to disappear though if I associate myself with a server registration... I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to preserve it before moving forward.
      </p>

       I will do some digging but I'm not aware of any way to do it anonymously. Creating an LLC or non profit would do it if you knew anyone willing to register in their name. Speaking of, a non profit liberty oriented company/chsrity might just be the best kind of group to host the next reddit... Maybe this is the heroes quest and you name will be required. Man crazy shit.

       If you have any interest, I found out that RES is also open source. It'd be cool if we re-tooled RES to work with the new site. That would give us a ton of upgrades like showing individual up/down vote counts and other useful stuff.

       I love the RES focus... if we add new features then we are the next reddit/a competitor and not just a reddit clone. I think we can easily make RES work with our cloned site, I will have to look into the best approach for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But over the long term, we can gradually move features out of the RES browser plugin and into our cloned reddit code base so that they are native features. Some of them probably will take a long time, but we can do it one feature at a time. I would love to work on stuff like that and I'm amenable to working with other developers as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should prioritize which RES features are the most important after we get launched. Eventually we should get a mission statement together, and maybe even a legal framework to protect you/the site's ownership. Ideally we will install infrastructure monitoring tools onto the server too, so select people can keep an eye on things like disk space and CPU load. We will also need to get daily offsite database backups in place, so that if someone is able to take us down, all is not lost. But baby steps, Rome/Khazaria/London was not built in a day. This is exciting.

       I like your approach of porting the RES features one at a time, that seems like a good approach over the long term. Porting the features is not a high priority though at the moment, but we'll get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we'll start bringing in some other developers to help in a couple weeks, once we can get the framework running. I don't want a "too many chefs in the kitchen" scenario too early on. But this is something I'll definitely start thinking about and planning for.

       Yeah I don't think so anymore. I think 80% of comments and votes on this sub are fake now. No reasonable person is hanging out here anymore, they've driven them all away with manufactured insanity masquerading as popular opinion.

       I've been fighting this shit for years, and it's gotten to the point where I just don't care anymore. I'd rather reddit metaphorically burn to the ground than it continue another day. I think it's a net negative on humanity at this point, because people trust it and it's lying to them, and the admins are letting it happen.

       You've been a good contributor - try to remember that people read but don't necessarily respond; especially when it's a nonstop real life example of the gentleman's guide to forum spies. Who wants to put themselves out there just to get attached by people who are only here to control conversation?

       Okay. It's obviously hard to point to votes and differentiate either way. But there's 27 comments right now in this thread, as of writing this. By your measure, around 21 of those are 'fake'. Can you point to a single one you suspect of being fake?

       So, which is it? Let's assume you meant this sub, because that's what you said originally. Find a thread from the past week on this sub that has a good amount of comments, and show me just a couple that you think are fake. This should be trivially easy to do; I'm letting you cherry pick.

       I literally just said to find any thread you want. Please read what I'm writing before replying. It's pretty rich for you to complain about my reading comprehension when you aren't even attempting to read what I wrote. Allow me to quote it for you:

       Okay, wait a second, step back. Are you going to admit that
       <em>
        you

       are actually the one who failed at reading comprehension when I said pick

       Anyway, you made a very outrageous claim. I'm calling you out on it; the purpose is not to get you banned. I don't think you'd get banned anyway for pointing out a thread full of fake comments unless you personally responded to those people calling them shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it looks like you're avoiding taking responsibility for your 80% claim the minute I ask you for some examples or evidence. Not cool.

       Actually most people don't read this deep into a comment chain, so I doubt 'everyone' sees it. But all I'm doing is asking you for evidence of your claim. I don't think that's particular nefarious.

       i have to agree with this guy.  i am curious after being in reddit for 10 years how easily you can do it.  not trying to be a dick, i want to know for my own how to spot fakes and shills.  i agree they are here but what are some red flags? not everyone who disagrees is automatically a shill so how do you differenciate? its an anonymous chat with millions of users.  how do you spot them?

       Just know that a lot of people that don't normally visit this sub are newly interested it in because of Trump-Russia issues. Whether you believe it's all fake news or not, it's a fact that it's pretty mainstream news, and it's unsurprising that this sub would see a fairly large influx of members due to it.

       Unless you're a mod it's against sub rules for magnora to point out a specific post to you.  Though they seem fed up, they're a consistent and legitimate contributor to this sub and this is probably not how they're looking to go out.

       Is it really against the rules to point to a

       , rather than a specific
       <em>

      </p>
      <p>
       I do understand his concern, but pointing to a thread isn't against the rules. He knows this, but also knows he's unable to back up his claim, hence his overly aggressive attitude.

       Yes, rules 2 and 10 are broad enough that if a user is concerned they're already on thin ice, their paranoia at doing what you're asking is not entirely unfounded.

       To illustrate how futile your insistence at the point is.  If you can't be certain one way or the other already, how is what magnora says going to make any difference.

      <p>
       You two could go back and forth all day swapping examples but you're both too skeptical to make any headway and it would be a waste of everyone's time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, what you're repeatedly trying to get them to do comes across as subversive and an attempt to diffuse legitimate concerns and frustration as nonsensical fluff, exactly the kind of tactics people are fed up with seeing around here.

       I get the need for supported claims, and this post is veering close to violating rule 12 anyways, but at least in this context it isn't as clear cut as "Well if you're so certain than prove it."

       You've admitted you couldn't even prove the alternative POV on this issue if you were pressed.  Yet you're so certain theirs is "bullshit" because they can't do the same? Because they can't do what you've admitted can't be done...?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying the guy claiming a teapot is orbiting the earth is crazy until he can prove otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fine, that sounds rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the point where you acknowledged we have evidence of teapots orbiting other planets (ie. shills do exist to some extent on the internet and you can't be sure who's who).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the guy sounds a little less crazy.  Still, you probably have the rational upper hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, there's laws against talking about how a teapot finds itself in orbit? And you're asking someone to prove that a teapot is in orbit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, now a confrontational response from the guy that's been trying to talk to people about teapots in orbit without breaking the law about talking about teapots in orbit seems a bit more understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's grant that an obsession with teapots in orbit is a questionable obsession.  It doesn't change the fact that the plausibility for
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       teapot it isn't as nutty as it is sometimes portrayed.

       Yup. I know it's not, just a friendly reminder. And, yea... it's become a sad state of affairs all around. I've seen it coming. I think a new website needs to be created, but it would be very difficult without the proper funds. The coding is the easy part, it's the managing (technical/legal) aspect that is the truly tough part, imo.

       lol, about us agreeing with each other, here. It's quite telling.

       Yeah, maybe I'm just overthinking the legal stuff (policies, terms of service, management, etc etc - I'm not a lawyer).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess a poll would need to be done about what kind of a website people would  want, and how similar to reddit people would want (feature wise, both on the front end and back end of things). I think making it a minimal paid for service could clean up some of the crap that reddit deals with.

       There's a lot of interesting developments like bittorrent style (?) encryption to make it impossible to influence communities as badly as here and other major sites today.

       know he's not someone you should be spending your energy on. I really like your sub (and you as a user by extension lol), so don't let these people make you feel like there's not a shit ton of normal people who see through this the same way. I don't know ANYONE in real life who isn't fed up with this, they just stay quiet because it's so absurd that it's borderline scary.

       I think your clumsy use of precise numbers like "80%" and "60%" based on your own impression is causing a bit of pushback--especially when your response is to simply insult the skeptical responses and accuse them of being shills themselves, rather than provide any evidence at all, or at least moderate your extraordinary claims so that they are less easily dismissed by skeptics.

       I stopped caring about that a long time ago. You cannot operate yourself like this, in fear of being banned from a stupid website for stating facts and speaking your opinion. Isn't that what you're here to do? Stop letting them win by enforcing a spectrum of debate you must adhere to. Do that and they win. The rules are meant to protect the mods. The mods don't deserve protection. Expose the truth if that means bending the rules. Break them. Get banned if you have to. Make a new account and proceed like nothing happened. Or make a new account to post your potentially banworthy thing. We are not even people with identities here, we are users, screen names, with opinions to share and spread. Names mean nothing. This is your true power and there is not a damn thing that can stop it.

       I'd rather talk about the issue, with this name that has recognition. There's no reason to go that next step when the mods and admins aren't genuinely trying to fix things and will instead punish me for having the audacity to call anyone out specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will literally help nothing, and will give me a big headache.

       I have no doubts that vote manipulation happens on a larger scale than most people realize. In a sense, reddit is a victim of its own success, it's just too easy to game.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've seen no evidence that a smaller sub like this one would be the target of such manipulation, and his claim was that 80% of
       <em>
        comments
       </em>
       (as well as votes) on this sub are fake. I haven't seen anything remotely resembling that, so I was looking for examples.

       Politics is very left leaning. But that's just how polarized communities work; Trump supporters flocked to T_D, everyone else stayed in
       <a href="/r/politics">

       The fact that we use to have websites logging all the removed posts that were later made unfunctional by reddit admins, showing ONLY stuff negative of Clinton or positive of Trump was immediately removed. The fact the sub hated Clinton and loved Bernie and it all changed in a day. And more.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Perhaps, that's an ok idea. I can see shills doing that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there should be a system where people can flag people they suspect as trolls or shills, and if they accumulate enough flags they get looked at by the admins. And if this system is kept up with, the majority of users would be legitimate, so the flagging system itself wouldn't be gamed too hard

       thats also a good idea.  my thinking is this thi.  if we move to a new site there will be all kinds of new names, etc.  if we build a community here and get to know each other it will be harder for them to infiltrate us.  they WANT us to move around to keep the groups from actually becoming something real.

       Yeah I agree, but at this point they've poisoned our home base and I think we'd be better of migrating to somewhere else. The groups will become something real, because the groups are humanity. Humanity just needs to keep having these discussions until world culture changes.

       im sorry dude but this comment sounds dumb.  you want us to move base because were compromised and instead of staying to fight you want to leave to go start a new convo about whats happening.  sorry man but im going to stick around here and get to know these shills and how they operate.  im not much for running away.

       how will you move on? to where? will anyone worth talking to follow? idk there are people who are here that arent shills.  it may seem like you have been trying to change the sub for years but maybe now your just starting to make a difference.  i have been on reddit for a long time and an active member for at least 3 years now.  i believe tou have your own sub, no? i enjoy speaking with you and the others here.  maybe i can help you post more to show what is being done by the mods? it wasnt until this post today that i had any idea the depths to which they will go to disband us.  just saying maybe your making a difference and there is no percieved effect but in reality you may be opeing peoples eyes

       I'm probably making some difference, but it certainly doesn't feel like it a lot of the time. It feels like an extremely uphill battle, because everything is swimming in disinfo and shills. That's why I'd like a new site. We could get back to what reddit was like 8 years ago. It was amazing.

       well lets keep this post alive and active because i completely agree that its a problem.  problems dont get solved unless we talk and take acton.  so what can we do to stay here? if we cant stay here, what is the best way to form a new place to converse? i suck at computers so i dont know if its possible but could we somehow link a new app built just for us to talk in? as new users join they just have to verify with a pic of them just like reddit.

       Someone just needs to re-create reddit. I edited the OP so there's a link to the source code, which is open source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone just has to pay a programmer to re-host this open-source code, and then we will have a functional reddit clone. Or do it themselves, but it's not easy. Should cost like $500 or less, hopefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then once it's up, we can tweak it and so on. I could help with that, I'm good at modifying and improving existing code, but I unfortunately don't know how to set it something like reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's a matter of finding cheap/good server space, and adding features and content to the site to make it a good reddit replacement. Then people will start to come over from reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my ideal plan, and I think it's doable too

       how could users be verified.  its easy enough to make throwaway accts and bot accts.  if that part gets solved then it would be more feasible to me.  as it is now if you just clone reddit; you just clone reddit... all the good and the bad come with ut.  some modifications would be needed and for that, someone very trusted would have to write the code.

       I don't think verification is good. It acts as chilling effects, and people are afraid to say what they think because they could get fired or whatever.

       The new reddit would be fine, as long as the admins do a good job. Reddit did fine for 5 years, until the admins sold out and started protecting those pushing disinfo.

       It could do something similar to chess playing websites. To get acknowledged for a title such as master or grandmaster you need to prove your identity to the site owners(there are various ways non intrusive ways). However, unless you publicly disclose your name people only see you have a verified title. I guess this would be similar to you tubes verified or twitters verified.

       I hear you but evil win when good does nothing. I'm not even worried. I think we can take over the other subs eventually as well but we need a turning point. Once the shills are defunded, they will be gone. They need funding to survive.

       I agree. I don't want to do nothing. I want a new site.

       There is no turning point. It does not work that way, because the mods and admins are mostly in on this. So it will not reverse. Plus history shows us this is usually the case, it's a one-way thing. Websites have a natural life cycle, and I think we should accept that.

       They have funding. They have nearly unlimited funding. The federal reserve is probably more interested in keeping people focused on politics than anyone, and they own the money printing machine.

       Welp, so do I, so I deal with Reddit.  There's still good people on here, and I honestly find the whole ordeal fascinating.  ESPECIALLY mod response to it, or the apparent lack thereof in most subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I think watching the stories posted and the canned responses gives a lot of insight into the mind of the "enemy".  All seem to have the intent of straddling the line between saying good intentioned things that most normal people would agree with, while at the same time not advancing logical discussion or outright demeaning dissidence of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Joe Arpaio pardon story and comments are a perfect example.  Conspiracy theorists don't make strong emotional appeals or statements, and the comments in that story had ZERO to do with conspiracy, at all.  Top comments were things like "Disgusting.", with tons of upvotes.  How exactly is that related to conspiracy?

       I'm sad to say I agree with you. I remember thinking I would never stop fighting the shills in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Why should I give up and let them win? Well, eventually I did give up. That subreddit is a fucking joke now. It's completely futile to jump in there and battle shills because they have the numbers to drown everyone else out. I stuck around longer than most, but everybody has their limit and the shills know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm terrified to see this transformation happen here. I've been speaking out about it in the comments for months, but these changes come from the top down with admin and moderator guidance. Now I'm even worried I'll be banned for pointing that out.

       Glad to hear someone has had a similar experience and is brave enough to share it. I know that feeling of defeat, it's just so upsetting to see it all go to shit and know that millions of people think it's real too... it's just upsetting. But really all we can do is detach and build something new, because we can't win on their terms, especially when they've got the admins and most of the mods in their pocket. We simply have to build a new platform that makes their existing platform obsolete.

       The internet considers censorship to be damage, and routes around it. We have to facilitate that as much as possible.

      </p>
      <p>
       We need a new strategy. Perhaps I should spend some time drafting up a petition to have Reddit and Media Matters for America investigated by the DoJ for seditious acts and conspiracy to foment rebellion. What they are doing goes far beyond anything the world has ever seen. They are attempting to manipulate information and beliefs for political purposes and to overthrow the current president.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about way more than Bernie Sanders and CTR or Donald Trump and ShareBlue. This is about the formation of a propaganda social media machine and total control over the (once) free exchange of ideas on the internet. They must be stopped at any cost.

       That ship has sailed, sorry to tell you. It's not going to happen, unless you can do some computer hacking wizardry.

       Reddit is dead. I think  we'd be much better off starting a new platform than trying to fight the tide.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your idea of starting an investigation is interesting. However I'm not sure how much traction you'll get since the PATRIOT act legalized propaganda from what I understand. So they can say whatever they want, even if it's propaganda to start a civil war. There might be some angle you could take here that would work though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree it goes way beyond ShareBlue and Cambridge Analytica. These are just prominent figures in a sea of companies doing this same thing. I think most people don't realize what is going on and how pervasive this is becoming. Perhaps a public education campaign about this issue would be good?

      <p>
       I don't believe that authorization extends to private organizations. Seditious conspiracy to overthrow the government is still a high crime, right up there with treason. The legal justification for legalized propaganda is ostensibly for use as a weapon against the enemy in a time of war or as needed to protect national security. The only way Reddit, Media Matters, and CNN are protected legally is if they are operating on behalf of the CIA or perhaps some other federal agency.

       Well it's a pretty interesting idea. Sounds like it could work. I'm terrible with legalese, but if we can't do it, then we can keep talking about this idea over the next few months and maybe someone with some legal capability will see the idea and do something with it.

       lol i get ya.  im saying we need a catch phrase better than"conspiracy theorist" because when it comes down to identifying groups the masses like something catchy.  if we do it right we could start a new way of thinking for most people.  if we can catch on as a group of people who simply want to examine life and inly seek the truth maybe we will sway society with us.  one thing is for sure we have to start acting upon our words.  its one thing to keep talking about these topics but what good does it do in the end if we just sit and bicker amongst ourselves?

       Yeah I agree. I don't know if a catchy name is needed, just a good website for people to visit. Any -ism or whatever label you can put on it will just become a reason for others to smear you. I just like talking the facts, I'm not a fan of labels. But if you come up with a clever one, go for it

       the reason i think its important is because of the negative connotations associated with "conspiracy theorist".  if pedogate or something else big comes out and we are right then a cat hy new name could be the key to spreading the knowledge.  it may seem insignificant to you but marketing is something we conspiracy guys are not good at.  even if were right people have the pre concieved notion in thier head already.  to combat that notion we have to be different and be right.  no false claims no speculation without evidence.  if we do that and start at a fresh site and verify users, we could unite everyone who wants to know the truth and creat a powerful movement.

       I'm not a "conspiracy guy" though. I'm just a guy who likes the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pigeonholing yourself like that in the first place is doing your message a huge disservice. You just want to be telling the truth that maybe gets overlooked, so I think this whole "conspiracy" angle should be shed entirely. Most of the really important stuff in this sub over the years
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       (and used to be) but then they started censoring the hell out of it and this sub was the only thing left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though that there's a lot of potential out there, which is why I think someone really needs to make a new reddit. Like yesterday

       Not really. 6 months ago, or before the election, I might've agreed. But now it's just vacant and then some misleading post gets upvoted to the top every day. All the comments are going against the posts, and anything real gets downvoted to zero and stuck in the new tab where no one will see it.

       Same went for the Sanders supporters via politics. They all got the boot from establishment neoliberals, that dominate the sub since after the DNC convention. The same narratives the shareblue shills are spreading. Reddit should be a circle jerk for anti establishment views if the demographics data is any indication. Somehow that data does not seem to apply here.

       I think misinformation is deliberately upvoted to the top. It allows dismissed the sensationalized article/headline without giving the topic any kind of discourse. Prime example lately would be the DNC lawsuit, though there're many more.

       Oh, I just recognize your name from recent posts. Doesn't really seem like it. Feel free to link me a post you made about political right extremists. I gave up after scrolling and seeing reposts.

       There is an easy way to test reddit. Make r/fuckantifa and see how it does. Also I don't know if you reported the subreddit but go ahead and limit their speech too for funzies.

       If you believe I'm stirring up hatred by disagreeing with people and having an opinion, I can't stop you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even after a removal of all deep state cabals from either sides of all political spectrum people will still have fundamental ideological differences and opinions. If someone can't handle a difference of opinion that results in hatred well... humans are animals after all, can't fault, let's hope they don't kill each other over it like all of human history before.

       Some people are of the opinion of "fuckantifa". A lot of people directly compare them to Nazis. Some people make lots of posts pointing that out to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious by the people's attire they are prone to possible violence. They went as a "counter-protest" to a protest of the removal of a confederate statue, that is a fundamental difference in ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if these people can work out their differences in talk. People are incredibly stubborn. I sure hope they just stop going out there though. The moment we see antifa actually holding their own rallies that doesn't involve protesting Trump then I think we can worry a whole lot more.

       Yes, but they don't call themselves nazis. They call themselves neo-nazis. I agree they're not nazis. They ARE neo-nazis though. There is nothing that term references that is more accurate than the way they use it for themselves

       Yes there are a few good subs left out there, but they'll get destroyed soon enough. Just like the rest. Just like this sub. It's a constant treadmill of people starting a new sub, it growing popular, then it getting overtaken and used to push propaganda.

       Paint the sub in a bad light? You're the one with the stats regarding the amount of trolling and shilling is taking place and calling for a mass exodus.  To this subs credit, I get on here and argue with people all the time about bullshit like pizzagate and sandy hook, and the mods have allowed me to continue on.  I guess Soros will be sending me a check since I don't agree with most of the shit that gets posted here.

       Seriously, just step away from the computer for a while. You've made literally dozens of comments because you got banned from a sub you don't agree with. Some people get their entire families murdered and move on faster than you do. You're angry over what is ultimately nothing. Nobody cares that reddit is fucked because we're here voluntarily. People who don't like reddit don't use it. You're in the wrong place.

       Kinda depressing watching these swarms, sliders, and trolls prove your point. Herein lies the difficulty of starting a new site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is a dangerous line of thought, but it makes me want to fight fire with fire. Buy bots, shills etc for our side. Unfortunately most of us are fairly ethical and don't have unlimited funds at our disposal. I mean, Jesus we have 4,000 users here now, when I joined about a year ago it was in the few hundred range. Even then it was pretty bad, now it's awful.

       Thanks for your words. It is pretty depressing to see what happens to the threads on this sub now. Your idea of fighting fire with fire is interesting, however the caveat is that our fire wouldn't have the support of reddit admins and thus would probably be detected and removed in a matter of days after beginning to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be really funny though to make a post calling out ShareBlue and Cambridge Analytica, and then buy votes to force it to the #1 spot on the front page. There are companies that just sell votes, so we could pool money and do that. Or if someone is clever, we could do it ourselves like you said. But I still think it'd get shut down quickly, so you'd probably only be able to get a post or two off before we'd all be permabanned. That's my guess at how it'd go down if that route was tried

       I think there are a number of ways to take that (admittedly a bit left handed) path. I see many users talking about having made numerous accounts and using tor and vans and all that.

       If we just did what shills now do, it would work. Route all traffic through AWS servers, code an app that allows switching between multiple IPs and handles easily, set up say 20 accts, scrounge together some funds, hire a passionate alt-righter, and have them wreck votes and posts in the same infuriating way, but for the things that spez likes instead (I still have not seen proof that Cambridge shills; they deal in targeted ads and profile building, judging from the information available).
      </p>
      <p>
       And we'd have him be fucking obvious. We'd want people to notice and think that something is very wrong. Like, maybe in one thread, we have him go in and tell everyone the exact same message, like "Hi I'm one of your new team of shills! My name is fuck you, and I have access to 300+ accts. I use Amazon AWS to spoof my traffic, so reddit can't stop me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here to demoralize the shit out of you guys and pervert your message so that you cannot communicate effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every conversation that you want to have, we will be pedantic, litigious, and intentionally misunderstanding, and we will be there with 10 accts a piece, multiples of us in each thread you care about. 
We will call you stupid for not taking the time to relieve me of my responsibility to educate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you think you are gaining traction, we will downvote everything you would like to see upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will fill your feed with pages and pages of useless junk, making this sub into something that we want it to be, and you'll just have to sit there, dealing with the injustice of it all, unless you can somehow make this illegal, but you won't."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you just repeat that same message from like 50 accts all over the place, with a bunch of open windows at once, just over and over and over, then we just fucking get down to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, we do the idea that
       <a href="/u/magnora7">
        /u/magnora7
       </a>
       was talking about, and we artificially upvote a ton of the posts, all in one day, to the FP. Votes are not that exensive, and we'd have limited spoofing abilities with our AWS range.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be willing to invest in this. I know some people who could code a functional app in no time, I'm sure.

       Whomever controls the servers and the code can always suppress and push whatever they want.  This is a private organization that is built upon private servers that offer zero transparency and zero guarantee of message or vote authenticity.  A distributed (mesh networks,) encrypted (think block chain tech), and open source (with 3rd party code verification of nodes designed in) system needs to be designed from the ground up for all social networks (e.g. Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn.)  The general technical know-how of the population is the biggest barrier to the deployment of a balanced systems that provide what I consider public utilities that can't be so easily manipulated to the detriment of its users.  Our social networks (read: our society) is too important to be left in the hands of private or governmental entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. It will always difficult (if not impossible) to remove vote manipulation and suppression, but we can make it extremely more complicated for those that would choose to do it.

       Chans have had this problem longer than reddit even. Reddit used to control it, until the admins were likely paid to turn a blind eye. And then it slowly took over reddit one subreddit at a time.

       I just assume the voting isn't real. If someone responds to your comment with a logical fallacy and gets double the upvotes as you, then it gives the impression that there are a lot of really dumb people who were convinced by some charlatan shill. That could really do some damage to your motivation and make you want to give up. However, if you realize the voting isn't real, then you may realize that there really weren't that many people who fell for the logical fallacy. For all you know, your comment that is stuck at -2 convinced nearly everyone who read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try using a different account. Try that with a different IP address. If you are a prolific poster who they consider to be a thorn in their side, disrupting their propaganda from time to time, then they very well might be monitoring your account or may have placed some kind of handicap on how many votes you accumulate.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I'm just mad at how the #4 site in the US is so absolutely garbage and completely full of propaganda. It's bizarre more people don't see it. The only think this site has left is it's reputation, which is quickly going in the toilet because of all the shilling

       It's size is its main problem. You could start 100 similar sites in 100 different countries. Any one of those sites becomes as big as reddit is now and you would likely have the same degree of control of the narrative. Only the illusion of free association and exchange of ideas is permitted.

       I agree with the above post by u/flyPeterfly. Creating a new reddit is not a bad idea in itself idea, but, to also use the analogy of the battleground, wouldn't this be similar to retreat and regroup, only to wait until the enemy catches up to us again, and then what? I don't think the admins are that much of a guarantor for security. Just think about the AI in a few years, they could easily infiltrate any site with thousands of bots posing as seemingly real users.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what to do? I'd say fight the battle right here, right now. And if an enemy is as strong as in our case, we need to upgrade our arsenal. I'm thinking along the lines of a new digital
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck">
        Operation mindfuck
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They pose as real users feeding propaganda to the masses? Let's poison their well with which they booze the sheep, let us induce a facilitation of the conspicuity of the general status paradoxus. This current state, which is the effect of this overwhelming machine of propaganda and ideologization, is our battleground.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

         I'm heavily involved in the anti-Trump community on reddit, and I believe /r/MarchAgainstTrump needs to be stopped. Vote manipulation, botting, ban evasion, etc. Reddit needs to nuke that sub.

       I think a large part of it is because of the younger generation using Reddit now. They don't care or even think about propaganda, only "dank memes". Look at the top you tubers. It's that valid anti-intellectual bullshit that they eat up. I'm sure some of it is an intentional distraction, manufactured idiocy, but there are others that just hopped on the gravy train. One of the reasons I think Trump supporters, at least on Reddit, are young is because of how much importance they place on memes. Most people don't care about propaganda if their side is winning.

       Voat only has two admins, or one I guess now. @puttitout who took over for the founder @atko.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two kinds of bans on voat.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moderator bans, which are permanent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Peer bans via downvoating, which are temporary. If your CCP (karma) goes below neutral (I think it is neutral 0, could be below 100, not sure) you are only allowed 10 posts/comments a day. When your CCP is low you are also more limited via "wait 7 minutes" type messages.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The latter is the most bizarre. The masses will ramble on and on about how voat is "Free Speech", then down voat brigade you until your account is unusable. Talking about this form of censorship on voat is the best way to get brigaded into silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admin posted an announcement last month declaring he'd be lifting the karma restrictions, but I wouldn't hold my breath. His favorite pastime seems to be rolling voat back to old code after fucking shit up, then blaming it on ddos attacks. The site is currently in a barely usable state, as it has been many times.

       What do you think of the idea that there's an irreconcilable difference between "useful online discourse" and anonymity??
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, anonymous voices can be multiplied by astroturfing, social media account management, sock puppetry, and soon on a much greater scale by AI.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make as many new sites as you like. Infiltration, by voices pretending to be what they're not, will be directly proportional to the interestingness and popularity of the latest site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting that there are no benefits to anonymity. Maybe people could be anonymous in one place but "one person one vote/voice" in some other designated place... And I don't even know how it would work (yet).
      </p>
      <p>
       But currently there are motives to "cheat" forums like reddit. And this problem will migrate to every other site like it.

       You make good points, especially with the technology being what it is and being able to (somewhat poorly) replicate human thread comments.

       I still think anonymity is the way to go, personally. There's too many chilling effects when people's names are exposed. There are ways to do anonymous forums where the established community can remove bad actors. It's not easy and never lasts forever, but it's doable.

       lol its a good site design. More transparent then reddit, but still susceptible to corporate shills.

       At least digg was honest about the massive change. They had a huge update, and suddenly we couldn't vote anymore.
       <br/>
       Here it's all secret and nefarious manipulation. Basically we're being lied to on a massive scale, and reddit admin are complicit.

       Yes, I agree. Digg was a little underhanded when they did the new user interface upgrade and tried to pretend advertisements were user-upvoted content. But what reddit does is several levels of deceptiveness above this. It's really disgusting. Hundreds of millions of people are being lied to and propagandized every day, and they don't even realize it.

       It's bad for the corporation too, since eventually people (advertisers) will realize that half the participation on this site is shills and bots.

       Yup, but they're addicted to the short term. And I wouldn't be surprised a tiny bit if they were getting paid by ShareBlue to turn a blind eye. Thus it would still be profitable for them, and all their actions make perfect sense.

       I'm sure the admin are trying to figure out a way to sell votes directly without admitting the totals are bullshit. They're gonna make a mistake, and reveal the whole thing.

       Which one, Voat or reddit?
If you mean Voat, think about this one: At least people are allowed to voice their hatred or opinion etc. 
One can always counter post with good arguments and evidence if one doesn't like the comments. I do.
That is preferable to being banned from saying anything that isn't of someone else's liking.

       Take a deep breath. I know you and like you and your sub although I am pretty much a lurker. Let these fake users downvote you and then act as if you're saying or implying things you didn't. You know it's all the same inane shit from their script. "Bye bye, see you on Voat then! Lalalalala!" as if you ever even implied that etc. Basic button-pushing.

       Yup, and this sub just recently got fully taken over by the same shills that you see on most of the other major subs. I still post here anyway because there are still plenty of thinking people to discuss things with.

       You thrive on the attention you're getting. I'm sorry your real life is so empty that you feel like causing a scene on reddit is your only way to get human interaction.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Oh I can promise you, ShareBlue is lucky to get to insert a post or comment here and there they are not running this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be more likely that the people running this site created ShareBlue to create an impression there is opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just what would a site look like that you would like, r/conspiracy is more conservative now than it was the first 4 years, and back then it was a young libertarian kind of place not this hard core Bircher/libertaran operation it seems to be now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does a dream site look like to you.

      <p>
       You want some liberal posters to bash.

      <p>
       But not too many?

       You would be wrong, and you have done no research on what shareblue is or how it operates, apparently. You just want to downplay it as much as possible. I wonder why

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I also hate CambridgeAnalytica which did the same. The reality is that they're both bad, but ShareBlue is bigger.

       Fun fact, by election day this past november, highly-automated pro-trump bots outnumbered pro-clinton bots by 5:1 on twitter.

       Now I know that's twitter and this is reddit, but it'd make sense to assume similar efforts were made on every social media platform. Why assume shareblue is so much bigger?

       Oh of course that was very big too, and took over T_D and other subs. Trump's company was named Cambridge Analytica.
      </p>
      <p>
       But from what I understand, shareblue has a wider reach and hires more employees to comment on more websites. Cambridge Analytica may have had the most bots, but that doesn't meant they're the biggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're both a problem, and it's not really important which is bigger. The issue is that it's happening at all, and that people should be extremely aware of this happening constantly on both political "sides". It's the digital version of an agent provocateur.

       how did you come to this understanding? from what i can see, people just like to use ctr and shareblue because its not exactly hidden, and because of partisan reasons.

       Because ShareBlue's presence on reddit is much more visible than Cambridge Analytica's, so I assume they have more workers working with them.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Nice collection of info.  I had a 9+ year old account I deleted during the election last year when Reddit decided it would change it's front page algorithms to basically eliminate the_donald, deleted pizzagate sub, and other BS.  The censorship.  I only created a new account just so I could keep subscribed to this sub and a few others.  It is really sad this site was once a proponent for unfiltered open and free information but has completely sold out.  Reddit is probably being ran by CNN now for all I know.  I'll keep coming here (for now) to check a few things but this site has been dead and full of propaganda for awhile now.

       With a name like Cambridge they seem like classier shills. If they exist at all. Shariablue is omnipresent.  Although recently the has been a backlash.  Non Trump folks are mocking the shilling from the left.  Askreddit users have grown a set of libertarian balls in some humorous threads that usually get shit all over by sanctimonious SJW types.

       Far more frightening than twitter bots are CA's ability to generate and microtarget something like 100,000 ads an hour on Facebook through a genius mixture of personality profiling and automation.

       Ie auntie sue is old school so we need to make this negative Hilary headline appeal to her sense of authority in order for her to click. Oh that didn't work? Well she also has a brother in the military so let's try slightly changing the wording so that it sounds like Hilary is anti-military. All done automatically by AI. This specific ad targeting aunt Sue may only ever actually be viewed by aunt Sue on her Facebook, while aunt Sally the old hippy gets something about Hilary hating pot.

       Plus there are many other media-management organizations than those two, and I don't mean to paint it like those are the only two companies doing anything. They're just the biggest players. There's dozens of companies and governments doing this.

       There's a lot more than 30 people being hired to do this. I'd estimate it's in the hundreds. Usually college students getting paid scraps, or at least that's how the JIDF did it.

       I have a friend who shilled for israel on r/worldnews during the 2013 conflict with gaza. It was part of a community service component of their scholarships and was coordinated via a twitter aggregator that linked to specific posts or even parent comments. I think it worked too tbh because the target audience and the site at that time was just so prone to blindly believing whatever the top comment was. The only reason I didn't fall for it was because I had been overseas during the 2007 conflict with lebanon and seeing non-anglo coverage showing israel's atrocities and then coming back to america and seeing clips of jews running into shelters as an alarm sounded was really eye-opening. If I had just been a normal 18 year old average reddit user I would've walked away from those r/worldnews threads thinking "well shit I guess both sides are bad" that I'm sure most on here think due to idf.

       Yeah I'm banned on worldnews and got heavily targeted by JIDF shills a few years ago. Israel and the Israeli army definitely have a huge web presence. It's a cheap way to get good PR (that most people believe is organic community commentary).
      </p>
      <p>
       JIDF even hijacked a subreddit I made. I created a backup after
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       became censored, called
       <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">
        /r/undeleteundelete
       </a>
       . If you check it out, you'll see they took it over with a trick that I fell for (made it so there was no mod on the sub, which apparently allows them to go claim ownership of it in another sub, which is how they became a mod) and put up the JIDF flag as a "fuck you" to me, and then posted a bunch of gory and disgusting and defamatory content in the subreddit.

       The whole thing is a mess. They push so much harder to gain control than people realize.

       As much as I think the democrats are corrupt, their base does lean anti-israel and I think if another prolonged conflict arises, their establishment's hypocrisy will become unavoidable. Hell, it could've even happened with the boycott but it seems msm doesn't want to touch that for obvious (((reasons))).

       Cambridge Analytica spread political ads on facebook. They analyzed data and picked out specific people to spread ads to. To my knowledge, it has never been shown or admitted that they hired shills. However, exactly how they spread those ads to people on Facebook may have been through shills. I wouldn't know because I don't have facebook and don't know much about it. I gave up trying to figure out exactly what CA did. I also asked others to explain a few times but nobody has.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, someone out there hired pro-Donald shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "5 to 1" bot ratio on Twitter was actually measured in tweets. The pro-Donald bots tweeted 5 times as often. (or 4 times, whatever it actually was)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More than four times as many tweets were made by automated accounts in favour of Donald Trump around the first US presidential debate as by those backing Hillary Clinton, a study says.

       And sorry to go there, but I'm pretty sure Putin's online propaganda army was gunning for Trump throughout much of the election as well. I noticed the pro-Putin posters and the pro-Trump posters on news sites become on in the same long before any allegations of a Russia conspiracy.

       WHO is in control of reddit, and it's not goddamn Cambidge Analytica. Not by a long shot. The fucking admins are overtly political, and uhh I don't think they voted for Trump, to say the least. Every fucking major subreddit has been

        overtly political, often in direct violation of the subreddit's rules.

       And it's NOT to sing the praises of Libertarian government or Trump. This website is an extension of the Democratic National Committee, full stop.

       Maybe.. just maybe, most reddit users don't like Trump. And political content is ramping up because the national discourse on politics is much more prevalent now. Not everything is a conspiracy theory, some thing can be explained by common sense.

       What is the reason you come to reddit? News, entertainment, comradery? You can find all of that elsewhere on the internet... places like you want do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a clusterfuck, but theres not much one person can do to change that... I don't think reddit will ever be "fixed" but I betcha you can find a place with a a bit more intellectual honesty.

       Yeah, I enjoy the variety of discussions too, but damn some days it feels like reddit goes "All conservatives are racist idiot neo-nazis!" and then you got to voat and they're like "Libtard idiots sure love those violent muslims that are ruining our country. They're bringing about a second USSR, and they're all basically Bolsheviks!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just stop and wonder where the middle ground went. Where's the grey area for the 99% of us who aren't ideological extremists? That's the real shame here, imo

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.
       </p>

       Interesting idea. It'd take so much effort to get the proposal ready though and there's a very little chance Notch would approve it, so it could be a wasted effort. It doesn't even need to be big, we just need another reddit that's functional

       It won't ket me do the insert link thing because I guess Reddit doesn't know it's a valid URL.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, it's very conservative sided currently because it doesn't have very much publicity in the liberal spheres if that affects anything, and it's formatted kind of like Reddit and Twitter combined into one.

       Is this a tactic to get everyone to go? Why?

      <p>
       Also -  I don't get that no one here seems to accept that everyone all over Reddit comes here to join in a conversation or two, because this is considered the free speech area. There is inevitably going to be new people every day, depending on what is trending in news and society in general.

       I've been around these parts for a long time, and what you're complaining about is not new. That being said, it has gotten much worse in the past couple years.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it's my personal opinion that
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       top comments on Reddit (and any large online platform for 'public' discourse) are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vote-rigged/brigaded
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paid for by corporate entities as an advertisement, or public relations move
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paid for by nation state entities for "reasons".
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There is very little organic discussion to be found anywhere. It's almost all PR/Propaganda with the aim of either pushing a narrative or to foment more "us vs them" between the underclasses, or for more traditional propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, a lot of them are just plain old advertisements as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, on to the scarier things that I have noticed recently.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lot of purportedly esoteric truth posts that seem to have a "left hand path" or "satanist/luciferian" undercurrent. Reminds me of how pretty much any cultish group (ie ISIS) recruits disaffected people (ie conspiracy theorists).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lot of purportedly "truth seeking" posts that have a decidedly anti-Semitic tone. (Not anti zionist, I know the difference).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lot of posts pushing obvious disinformation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What I think has happened is that in order to slow the inevitable trickle of information about the actual conspiracies in the information age, the disinformation campaign designed to cast doubt on those who dissented against the conclusions of the Warren Report has been ratcheted to 11. Eg. Any news report about flat earthers says there are literally hundreds of them "officially" registered in the US. Hundreds! Yet I see flat earthers commenting every day (hopefully ironically or for the lulz).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, this has been quite disorganized as I am commuting home, but my point is this: Reddit is broken, the internet as the great leveller is broken, and I am not sure that we can ever recover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta go back to beer hall discussions, only this time with longer haircuts and less racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still gonna read
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       though...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll end this rambling rant with my own original conspiracy theory: America/Western Capitalism is on its last legs economically and TPTB actually wanted Trump to get elected so that he could be the fall guy when SHTF. My opinion is the shit hitting the fan will be an even bigger financial crisis than in 2008. Hopefully I am wrong as I too live in the west...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'm just some old fogey who's read way too many conspiracy theories. I'll see myself out.

       Well said. I agree with everything you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially the "fall guy" theory with Trump. I think that is 100% going to happen, be it a stock market crash, a war (and the false flag that will likely precede it), or both. The media signalling is far too obvious and coordinated, laying the groundwork for the scapegoating to come, they want everyone to hate this guy, and to be divided and worked-up as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope enough people can see through the charade to not be fooled. Some will be fooled, of course, but hopefully enough will see through it that we can stem the bleeding instead of just getting 100% yanked around by the powers that be.

       I like your last theory since a crash is coming. Would have happened regardless of a Clinton or Trump presidency. It will make 2008 look like nothing. We can even use history as a rough guide. There was a crash in 1920 IIRC. A big one. What followed was the  roaring twenties; a huge bubble financed by debt and other forms of predatory capitalism fueled with massive amounts of new technology due to the expansion of electricity.(sound familiar?) Nobody even thought the 1929 crash was a big deal at first cause they had gotten "through" 1920 one.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think you're giving HRC too much credit though. Groupthink is real and they can't fathom the system they've built is set to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a counterpoint to that, maybe the reason HRC was such a blatant warmonger was she knew the system is collapsing and the only way to prop it up is more imperialism? Our economy is heavily finacialized and we would probably have collapsed already if we weren't an empire with specious things that could go away propping us up like the petrodollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sigh. We're fucked. I just hope we don't take the place of the Germans. (Aka "are we the baddies?")

       I also agree that Trump is the fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the way in which they're blatantly plundering the government. The U.S is a corpse by this point, like the Roman empire after the sack.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I think all the Satanic/Luciferian buzz is disinfo. MAPs just pushed the FDA to accept the medical legitimacy of MDMA. Ayahuasca is the secret to Christianity. Jesus probably drank Soma and encountered this Ayahausca who is tied to DMT, LSD, and mushrooms. He saw her in his consort, Mary. Church slandered this by demonizing snakes and associating them with Satan.

       My own personal belief is that the reason trump was elected was because he makes a great figure head for division.
Since he has been elected people have automatically assumed that if you are a "conspiracy theorist" or if you dislike corporate media you love trump and are a bigoted moron.
       <br/>
       He has been used to hate the media which causes people to want to trust said media, to spout random conspiracies and then try to associate those conspiracies with bigotry and stupidity. He has made himself hated and loves at the same time by so many by driving a wedge in the population.
Basically with him as president they've thrown a huge wrench in public opinion towards people who want real change on all sides of the debates. It's almost impossible now to have a decent conversation with either party as they seem so dug in on their views and immediately think you're for the opposite team rather than actually listen to what you have to say. 
It was a brilliant move on their part and I for one didn't see it coming as I was pretty positive Hillary was the choice candidate for the banking cartel but as I watch trump in action I realize that he is no different and is pushing the same agenda she would have.

       Well seeing as those aren't exactly the agenda I was referring too probably not. Obviously the two parties have minor differences to try and convince people that their choice matters. But when was the last time a president actually stood up to the banks? Or how about the war machine as it rolls onward towards any country that dares resist said banks. Some great examples is North Korea and Iran. Both whom the media and trump are very angry at and seem gung-ho to start a war with. The last president I know of who actually stood up to our military and our banking system ended up dead. 
As I said I believe trump is exactly what the deep state needs and wants.

       If all you do is consume and inundate yourself with conspiracy theories as your sole source for "news", you'll easily become paranoid, dejected, confused, and ultimately apathetic.  Step out of the echo chamber, leave your bias at the door, and let credible facts guide you.

       Economic guy here. I agree with your assessment of said coming crash. Nothing from 2008 was fixed.  The proverbial can was just kicked down a road paved with massive amounts of debt. The only way this is avoided at this point in time is if they can keep that can rolling until 2024ish. This is when the largest generation (millennials) hit their peak spending years. It should be a period of time similar to 1993-2007. That, or an invention that rivals the industrial or computer revolution. Something that truly changes how we work and live.

       I don't believe this entirely. Even if the US becomes a fully Communist country on the surface, there will still be that underground Capitalist element. One thing I've noticed in some of the countries that are Communist or used to be "fully Communist" is that they still have the black markets which essentially is Capitalism. Unregulated Capitalism where you may get rat meat instead of beef or chicken or you may get plastic rice or dirt passing off as pepper or, in the case of Venesuela (I know socialism not Communism), products from the black market that only the rich can afford but still its Capitalism.

       Friend, the whole fucking world is fucked. Aliens should have hit the delete button on us a long fucking time ago. The fact that they haven't means either no other intelligent life in the universe has found us, or that intelligent life is inherently evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk which is scarier, but the fact that this much human suffering has been allowed to go on is pretty fucked IMO. Some alien species should detonate a black hole weapon and end it already.

       Can't say I disagree. Sometimes the world seems like a bad dream or a dangerous video game like GTA 5. It's just a giant joke on some level, being had at our expense. But likewise, playing GTA 5 is only scary if you're taking the game seriously. If you don't care about the game, the game cannot hurt you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, life on earth is kind of like this. It's unreal, in a way. Who is to say that this isn't a game too, on some level? We are all going to die someday, just like in GTA 5. We cannot live our lives carrying the suffering of the entire world on our shoulders, it is simply too much to bear, and it is not our burden to bear in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compassion and helping others is so important. But you cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You deserve compassion too. The compassion of being free from the burden of suffering, of yourself and others. There's a balance, and it's hard to find. Good luck out there.

       Not necessarily, if intelligent life existed where had gone through a similar history in order to advance as a civilization, it's possible they would have a prime directive to stay hands off in order for species to go through the same growing pains. That or complete annihilation.

       I may still try and write a bit in the future, I'm just very frustrated with reddit so I made this post. I should really be thankful for my sub and the 1400 subscribers who care enough to follow the articles I write. What should I write about next? I was thinking CIA media stations worldwide, or how national borders were intentionally drawn to divide and conquer ethnic groups all over the world like the Kurds.

       Both sound good!   I think the national borders issue might be more eye-opening for the "regulars" around here, who I think are already well aware of CIA media infiltration.  But the nefarious intentions behind the placement of some of the international borders definitely needs more exposure.  Goes back to the Great Game era or earlier I would imagine?  The way the Ottoman Empire was carved up definitely reeks of long term divide and conquer strategies and we've seen it play out over many decades now.  IDK what I'm rambling about, I need a nap, anyway, rock on my friend. ;)

       That's true, the CIA media thing has been talked about a lot.

       Totally agree on the Ottoman empire remains being carved up. I wonder if other collapsing empires left behind a wake of countries that were divided and conquered like the Kurds. Like maybe when the USSR collapsed. Or when Pakistan was separated from India.

       i get that shills are like a bad virus, but what i'm wondering is if there's a larger solution than just reversing the bad.  what if a website can be made where shills can exist yet no matter what they do they can't harm the site.  a system where anyone can exist.  no banning.  like some online version of non violence.  something that doesn't fall to the same fate as the rest.  an incorruptible system.
      </p>
      <p>
       not saying i have such a thing figured out.  but a vision like this can be a start of some kind, i suppose.

       I think you just described 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       No banning means if the trolls/shills have enough people commenting, they essentially take over the forum. Which in turn pushes the legitimate users away, which puts the ratio more in their favor. This creates a feedback loop until the site is
       <em>
        mostly
       </em>
       shills. 4chan is kind of approaching this, imo
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit suffers from a similar problem. Half the problem is they don't ban people who poison the well, and the other half is they DO ban people who call those people out. So before the mods were corrupted, reddit worked great, but now that the mods are overtaken, it's
       <em>
        accelerating
       </em>
       the ratio of bad to good users.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unfortunately I think a banning system is necessary, but it must be closely watched by the community at large, and trolls and shills must be removed instantly because they fester if they're not. And the banning system must never be overtaken by trolls/shills or the whole thing is lost. Like reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I think websites just have a lifecycle, and reddit has reached the end of its lifecycle.

       You are a dishonest person. The mod team has been locked for a while now because a few of you will not take the necessary steps to curb the brigading or even acknowledge the massive shilling the sub is under from astroturfing organizations.

       When the few mods that were taking a stand against that took steps to reorganize the mod team to break the stalemate YOU immediately contacted your buddies on the admin team to stop the changes.

       Indeed, being a mod presents similar challenges. Alas, I think both your writing and moderating to thwart those who seek to censor this subreddit are beneficial on the whole so I do hope they both continue :)

       A new reddit based on the same code might work at the beginning but would soon also be infested by bots and agendas. It's the way reddit works at its core that promotes the propaganda etc. that's the problem.

       I disagree, because the admins can ban these bots and people pushing agendas. Which is how reddit functioned for 5 years, it worked great. Then the admins got bought out, and the mods changed to protect those who should be banned, then it all went bad.
      </p>

       The reddit system is not bad, what's bad is that the shills control it now. It's akin to a regulatory capture situation, almost

       Well ok sure I agree. But who is to say the same thing won't happen again? A new reddit may be fine for a while, then get bought out (it will be too tempting for the owners), and then again go to shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the entire reliance on admins to keep things on the level is what is wrong with the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new 'reddit' or something similar needs to be able to run on it's own without interference (apart from keeping servers up etc.).

       If the site owner is not bought they can be banned when they start to shill and get caught. It is hard to shill while appearing organic. Often it takes years to start become credible. If all you do with a new account is argue a certain position in one subcategory it is almost obvious.

       I agree, and it makes me feel like I need to have attitude to be listened to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then when I have attitude, people call me out on it.

       There's more to Reddit than just political subs (and yes, conspiracy is indeed a political sub because most of the commonly discussed conspiracies revolve around politics. Hell, a decent chunk of conspiracies are actually floated by politicians for cheap political gain, but I digress). While I do spend an unhealthy amount of time here and in other political subs, there's a whole ecosystem of fun subs to hang out in that you're missing out on.

       Let me recommend
       <a href="/r/nonononoyes">
        /r/nonononoyes

       as a breather sub. They generally have some good videos.

       I hear u bro.
I hate this shitty website. I only stay for the entertaining conspiracies and Indian food recipes (r/indianfood)
The rest is bullshit and circle jerking garbage.
If you don't follow the narrative you get shit on.
People hold fake internet points on a pedestal and conform their ideas to gain them, which is an extremely fucked up concept.

       Good luck introducing new ideas or opinions to r/worldnews or any other default sub.
This site is definitely fucked up beyond all repair.

       Let me tell you, and ive been here a long time; readit is not fucked up or rigged. It is a place where people come to share ideas and mentally fuck each other. It is not rigged, your mental process is rigged... When people don't upvote your ideas it doesn't mean there is a conspiracy it just means you're intellectually lower class. Its not rigged its a free market place buddy, sorry.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I was watching an OWS protest from 2011 earlier, not that I particularly supported them, but I didn't really disagree with them either. It was interesting that there was a large multi-racial crowd all chanting 'The People United, Will Never Be Divided', and now it's all violence and screams of 'NAZI!'or 'Terrorist' depending on if you support a particular side. Media are pumping lies and propaganda to fire up a minority of fools and making this happen, America didn't get stupid overnight. Nazi's ain't never gonna be a threat to anyone and violence solves nothing. Ask yourself, why would the media want a civil war in the US? It's probably going to happen and I hope the police can keep order, they might need some more toys and vastly increased powers to do it though.

       Has anyone ever considered that this is what the internet was always supposed to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a world where everything is a good idea until it is exploited.  The infancy of the internet was the good idea, the golden age.  Now people exploit the reliable information it provided by muddying the waters with disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only possible outcome for everything is exploitation.

       Hit the nail on the head.  Everything gets corrupted/co-opted in its ascendency. Look at history, from towns that sprang up near the mines in the Old West. Bleed it dry make a buck.  There was a brief glorious moment then the decline.  For me, I'm reminded of my own experience listening to grunge-alternative 92-95.  By the time I was old enough to love it the party was over.  So many 3rd albums just sucked ass when shit became over produced. Then you end up with Creed which you actually miss when Nickelback comes along.  All the while the music scene evolves and carries on.

       There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       </a>

      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I've recently taken a hiatus from alot of the more left/right focused battle subs and even some of these types and stuck primarily to the gaming/TV show subs and it's been a much needed break. There's not a neutral ground for most discussions anymore, so I've just found different discussions to participate in.

       The problem is that TPTB will be quicker to infiltrate any new site.

       I think it took them so long for Reddit (et al) because they didn't understand how important it was/would become.  When they finally did realize that, they needed to come up with a plan.  So, now they have a plan in place for any subsequent Reddits.  :/

       Perhaps, but if the admins are paying attention they can keep out and ban any new people like that, so it won't be able to grow much. Shareblue is only so big on reddit because reddit admins are being paid to turn a blind eye

       The problem with Reddit is in the design. If you reproduce the existing site you're going to end up with the same problems. The problems are: upvoting/downvoting, anonymity, and karma. Get rid of all those things and a Reddit-like site might work. Otherwise, it's doomed to the same fate as the current Reddit.

       Trying to educate people on internet forums is mostly a waste of time, if the intention is to teach them. Most don't want to learn, just an experience. Self learning is probably the main purposeful goal of web forums. Some times lessons repeat. Sometimes people get lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what helps are improved web search tools. A radical change would be a way to access the crawlers of internet data. Revealing in real time, what's actually going on, with say, corporate power users of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just more sifting of data. Bound to happen as the web grows. We just get better at searching. As you learn, things get more nuanced and complicated. If we're that lucky.

       basically you gotta start lurking in the non administrated forums and accept all the crazy people with their sick posts. 4chan is full of some sick crap, but its open to everyones ideas and there is a wealth of unadulterated opinions which I find very honest.

       You've always written some good posts Mag, it would be a shame if you pulled out from this site. I do still think there is hope. Especially on some smaller subs there are still plenty of amazing discussions going on. Even r/conspiracy has not yet been completely infiltrated. Yes there is a lot of noise, yes it's a battleground in a sense, but there is still plenty of interesting threads of conversation. Nearly every thread will have paid-for comments and paid provocateurs, but if you're used to it you can get used to just tuning that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to be fair, I do suggest that people posting things here should also post them somewhere else, like a blog or general website. 
Especially quality posts  -  and you definitely have made some high quality posts, as have many others. I suggest making your own site/blog. I have done so myself (link to site -
       <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com">
        embraceyourexperience.com
       </a>
       )   , I haven't been updating it much recently due to the lack of time but the future may bring more content to it (it's not strictly conspiracy related, more alternative psychology, esoteric/metaphysical thought, spirituality and simply basic ideas on how to find inner peace, compassion and spread it, which I think is one of the fundamentals of humanity's ability to be free from external control and sociopaths coming and staying in power - a united, empathic and internally fulfilled populace cannot be controlled, it's just not possible... you cannot create hate when peace is the norm).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, with the amount of stuff your write here, you should probably have created your own site ages ago. But you can still continue posting here and keeping the dream alive. If everyone that makes quality content simply disappears, Reddit truly is going to die. Now it's more like a harsh battleground (on the main subs at least, some smaller subs can be amazing - like CST for example imho).
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating a new Reddit is going to be difficult. This is where the people will stay. If you want an audience to spread the awareness this is the place to be. It was obvious Reddit was going to be infiltrated because it has grown so popular. This is destined to happen to all forums and sites that have millions of visits per day. Reddit is huge, it's absolutely one of the most popular websites, so it's not a surprise this is happening. I agree that there should be a new place, but I do still think that from time to time people should post some good stuff here as well, simply to be the light in the darkness - and that light is what Reddit so desperately needs right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay well man. If you truly feel it's done for you here, then maybe find another active forum + start your own site/blog, or perhaps simply post on smaller, more sane and less controlled subs. It's going to be a while before a new Reddit can appear (and become populated to this degree - but who knows maybe it can happen).

       First of all you're wrong about reddit being 90% true...did you see the post with the guy and his dog that bought upvotes to get to the front page of r/videos?
Reddit is the piece of shit father who has a child, runs from responsibility and failes to pay child support....or the murry povich of websites.

       I don’t know about you, but I find myself engaging in much more conversation with people IRL these days, spending less time on reddit has been quite good and given me a lot of hope for Millenials and iGen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general I hope the trend is towards Balkanization, decentralization, and IRL communities forming to actively create alternative presents/futures.

       The circlejerk was strong even before the astroturfing. We need active reality creators, information sharing can be helpful for that but reddit has never been a good platform for actualization.

       I've been lurking a bit these past few months and the forum sliding is absurd. Shills are lame as ever though (always a good thing). My guess is ShitBlue is rotating employees from staying to long here, lest they go native tinfoil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, a little change would be good. I'll gladly contribute via crypto to costs for a new venture such as this, but it would be best if everyone also used crypto and TOR over VPNs in order to register and run the site.

       Would be bad idea to create a conspiracy/free speech site completely "naked" IMO.

       To be honest the up/downvote system is broken. I would think an upvote only system, or a system where you can sort by most viewed, would be best. Voat has no good mobile app, and 90% of my Redditing is done on mobile. What Reddit did that was revolutionary is the way the forums are organized by subs and that the posts have a comments section which is organized. Most other forums still use this old ass confusing format from the 90s. Where you click on a thread and it's just a bunch of comments in chronological order. Whereas Reddit makes it easier to follow a conversation cause you can comment on a comment.

       I had this idea that if it's on your screen for long enough,  you auto-upvote it. This way what you look at sort of determines how the site grows. Then you can downvote if you don't want to auto-upvote. I think a system like that might be interesting.

       Go to steemit. It's a social media platform where people get paid in cryptocurrency with upvotes. It usually means better content with less ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it will really take off when it's not just filled with people that are complaining about the status quo, but when steemit becomes the status quo and people can talk about stuff that matters.

       Question: What happens if the new platforms become taken over/coopted by the types of people you complain about? I've seen many Youtubers and people from Twitter talking about leaving the platforms and going to alternative sites and everything. That's all well and fine for now but if those platforms become popular it will bring the same types of people into those places and we'll be right back to where we are now. While I respect your ideas I don't know if abandoning the site is entirely the only possibility. Something has to change. Something significant. I wouldn't know where to start though.

       We prevent the co-opting in the first place. Perhaps we cannot do it, perhaps we can for a time. We will see.

       It's not that there's a few bad subs here and there. It's that MOST of reddit is a propaganda-fest shit-show, and it's systemic to the point where hundreds of millions of people are being influenced by this crap, thinking it's "popular" when it's just manufactured votes that aren't real

       Well we can call them racist extremists then. But the point is there are a couple thousand of them in the US. I don't think they pose any real threat to anything though, and should be ignored

       well lets keep this post alive and active because i completely agree that its a problem.  problems dont get solved unless we talk and take acton.  so what can we do to stay here? if we cant stay here, what is the best way to form a new place to converse? i suck at computers so i dont know if its possible but could we somehow link a new app built just for us to talk in? as new users join they just have to verify with a pic of them just like reddit.

       That's true, the CIA media thing has been talked about a lot.
      </p>

       Totally agree on the Ottoman empire remains being carved up. I wonder if other collapsing empires left behind a wake of countries that were divided and conquered like the Kurds. Like maybe when the USSR collapsed. Or when Pakistan was separated from India.

       If the site owner is not bought they can be banned when they start to shill and get caught. It is hard to shill while appearing organic. Often it takes years to start become credible. If all you do with a new account is argue a certain position in one subcategory it is almost obvious.
