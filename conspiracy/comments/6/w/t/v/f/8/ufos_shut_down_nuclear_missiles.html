<p>In March 1967 Robert Sallas was stationed at Malmstrom AFB in Montana as a missile launch officer for the minuteman 1 ICBM. Sallas and his commanding officer Frederick Mywald at the Oscar Launch Control Center had operational control over 10 minuteman nuclear missiles.</p>

<p>Each of the 10 missiles operated independently and  had its own power and backup power. The command and control of these missiles was entirely located within the command capsule and <strong>there was no means outside of the capsule to affect the missiles</strong>. </p>

<p>On March 24th 1967 Sallas received a phone call from a security officer about unidentified lighted objects flying above the facility making very strange maneuvers. Salas took little interest in the first phone call. Later, the security officer called in to the capsule a second time to <strong>report that a 30-40ft diameter large oval pulsating red object was hovering above the front gate of the facility.</strong></p>

<p>Salas began to inform his commander but was interrupted by the missiles shutting down. Alert status on the missiles was lost for all ten missiles while the object was above the facility. The error reporting software indicated there was a guidance and control problem. There were also indicator lights on for security violations at two of the launch facilities where the missiles were physically located</p>

<p>The security alert team was sent to those launch facilities to investigate.<strong>The team reported that the object was hovering above the two affected sites. When they approached the object the team&#39;s communication gear malfunctioned and they lost radio contact.</strong></p>

<p>After speaking to the wing command post Lt. Mywald informed Salas that <strong>a similar incident had occurred a week earlier at Echo flight</strong>.</p>

<p>The first audio from Colonel Walter Figel who was the deputy missile crew commander at Echo Flight describes an incident in which a UFO is hovering above the facility before the nuclear missiles were disabled.</p>

<p><strong>In the second audio Mywald and Salas are talking about the security team that went to investigate the silos that had a security breach indicator. The two men returned terrified by their encounter and had to be relieved of duty never to return to guard assignments</strong></p>

<p>A more detailed investigation of these two incidents revealed that the missiles all had logic coupler failures which triggered the guidance and control error indication.<strong>Robert Kaminsky who led the investigation at Echo flight stated that the event was virtually impossible.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES!  Now this is some grade A+ <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right here!  Thanks OP!</p>

<p>Now, this happened 1967.  50 years ago.  This creates a lot of questions.</p>

<p>No. 1:  Have all nukes been deactivated by ETs and the threat of nuclear war is a farce?</p>

<p>No. 2:  If all nukes have not been deactivated, then after this event I would assume measures have been taken to prevent this from happening, what would those measures be?</p>

<p>No. 3:  Who, exactly, were the ETs disabling the nukes?</p>

<p>No. 4:  Why was this necessary?  What would be the purpose of disabling the nukes (other than the obvious of preventing nuclear war.....why would ETs care about human annihilation?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some food for thought without actually attempting to directly answer your questions. Have you considered the possibility that Earth is integral to, and part of, a larger system? That because of this association we are required, by outside intelligence, to maintain our planet? That this is not for <em>our</em> benefit, but for the outsiders benefit? That we, earthlings, must not be allowed to destroy our planet? I think these were some of the concerns being addressed by the OP.</p>

In the early 50&#39;s there is a fun/interesting theory that Eisenhower met with them several times to broker a treaty. Purportedly they waned us to stop all nuclear testing and eventually dismantle our nuclear weapon capability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the general outline for a fun story my would read to us sometimes as a kid.</p>

<p>The heroes were the pleiaidans, and they were trying to help us, while knowing they were using the earth as a prison. Basically the last of the evil races of this universe were chased to our solar system, and eventually kept to the earth.</p>

<p>So the idea here is there&#39;s many alien races, one is evil and been manipulating for eons(this is where I think we get the story of Adam and eve, and the garden- we left because we were slaves...)</p>

I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s fair to dismiss something because it is seemingly ridiculous at first glance, we&#39;re already talking about ETs or hidden tech that flies in the face of modern science with things like faster than light travel, zero point energy, and antigravity. We can entertain ideas without believing in them, even if they are seemingly impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the universe is energy, frequency, vibration.  The planet Earth is all three of those things, just as you and I are.  The Earth lacks a mind, in our way of thinking, but the Earth has an energy, a frequency, and a vibration, and is tied to the overall consciousness.  </p>

<p>Is it a being, like a human?  No.
Is it conscious, like a human?  Yes.</p>

<p>Consciousness and awareness of the senses are two separate things.  We are very aware of our senses, usually not very aware of our consciousness.  Based on your language, I&#39;d bet you are unaware of your consciousness.</p>

<p>This is gonna sound &quot;new age nonsense,&quot; but gaining awareness of your consciousness is powerful stuff, and not all that hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open minded, but only to things that have any proof and reason behind them. The earth is a lump of rock. If I were to put nickel and iron inside  a rock and give it  a a magnetic field, would it  I become conscious? No, obviously not.</p>

<p>Moleculess a number of things, that doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>Do you have any proof behind your claims? What do you mean, in your own words by &quot;frequency&quot;?<br/>
And what &quot;energy&quot;? Kinetic energy?</p>

<p>There is absolutely no proof at all of what you&#39;re saying. The earth is literally a ball of rock and nickel. Consciousness needs complex chemical and electrical reactions - does the earth have those? No, as of our current knowledge, it doesn&#39;t. Is the moon also a being? No, it too is a lump of rock.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to believe it&#39;s conscious, that would be cool, but there&#39;s absolutely no proof at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that it&#39;s more probable, actually. We don&#39;t know the extent of how likely other beings existing in the universe are, or even less about the probability of traveling backwards in time. Time travel from the future is basically impossible at this point, and we have no idea as to how life came to be. But we do know that you can travel to the future. And we do know that lost civilizations of humans lived as recently as 100k years ago. So it could be likely that a race of beings or human cousins evolved to a point that they got off this planet so that they could check on it&#39;s habitable status in the future, periodically checking in on and guding the current race of humans so that the two can converge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those LHC&#39;s do something that&#39;s certain. I don&#39;t agree with particle physics anymore but the existance of the accelerators doesn&#39;t guarantee the validity of the concept.</p>

<p>Within the geocentric model of the solar system we didn&#39;t understand retrograde motion. It seemed wierd to us that a planet would go back and forth in it&#39;s circular/elliptical orbit around us.
We decided these were epicycles where, for no reason, the planet would do a little circle whilst going round the main circle of it&#39;s orbit. 
Astronomers at the time got it wrong even though the telescopes were looking at the same night sky that could tell them the same truth.</p>

<p>When we think of it now that seems ridiculous because we understand we have a heliocentric solar system. The model you generate will depend on the scale of view you have and how you cut the object.</p>

<p>Maybe what we see as particles - electrons, protons and sub atomic particles are actually obvious boundaries that we notice when we observe a universe that is based more upon vibration and frequencies than particles. </p>

<p>Using particles to explain some things works well because it fits the observations, but maybe sometimes we stick to the particle idea so much that we force these &#39;epicycles&#39; into our theories instead of remembering that what we see as a particle is really just a bunch of sychronised vibrations and doesn&#39;t need to always act like a particle just because we want to think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of documentaries, and along the same lines of the government taking part in disinformation- check out the doc Mirage Men. It&#39;s all about what the govt did during when the ufo phenomenon started cranking up: misinform, make ufo believers seem like crazy people, plant their own operatives in investigative ufo cells to steer in the wrong direction, they did it all. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not some shitty YouTube video, production value was pretty good. Think it was on Netflix as well at one point. </p>

<p>This will make my tinfoil show a little but you can extrapolate these disinformation practices beyond UFOs into any issue that needs covered up and see them employed even today- even here on reddit</p>

I do not have any more info like that but I&#39;m certain info will be released about it in a decade unless we are forced to use it before then of course.</p>

<p>Again this is just based off of someone I trust telling me about a different project that mainly focuses on using energy shielding for space crafts so space debris won&#39;t rip through them like paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like the plasma defense that they were working on in Israel. Basically, a hot blast heats up the surrounding air / materials to get so hot that it turns into plasma. That plus the outward force would immediately disable any rpg / explosive coming it&#39;s way.</p>

<p>This, on the other hand, sounds like some sort of electro magnetic disruption, or something similar to that.  Like instead of a microwave that vibrates electrons randomly, it would target specific molecules and restructure them in a way that made a device inoperable.</p>

In X-Men: Apocalypse the titular character Apocalypse (representing superior alien life) disarms all the nukes humanity possesses by launching them into space where they float harmlessly. In Logan we find that a mutant haven in an in-world comic book series contains the actual coordinates to a mutant haven in real life in the movie, thus signifying that print media disguised as fiction actually discloses truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on everything I&#39;ve ever read nuclear weapon proliferation was one of the primary reasons they are more active here. There is also the universal need for free will. It&#39;s like raising children, sometimes you have to let them make their own mistakes. Finally, what was dropped in Japan, while devastating is nothing compared to the nukes we have had since the 60&#39;s. The testing was supposedly allowed under a treaty that was agreed to by humans and aliens. </p>

She def has some sort of higher consciousness going on, but she tweeted that aliens are disarming nukes and I was like ok well that&#39;s a bit far fetched, but now I think she is on to something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also possible, although less possible imo. The &#39;future&#39; is open-ended, it can be tomorrow or 1 gazillion years from now.
Whereas the past is 4.5 billion years since the planet formed (could go further back if we talk about ETs from the past). </p>

<p>So we have  a fixed past and an open-ended unlimited future. Since nothing &#39;substantial&#39; in our past history points to evidence of time-travelers or advanced tech the odds are in favour of them being from the future. </p>

<p>But anything&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that it&#39;s more probable, actually. We don&#39;t know the extent of how likely other beings existing in the universe are, or even less about the probability of traveling backwards in time. Time travel from the future is basically impossible at this point, and we have no idea as to how life came to be. But we do know that you can travel to the future. And we do know that lost civilizations of humans lived as recently as 100k years ago. So it could be likely that a race of beings or human cousins evolved to a point that they got off this planet so that they could check on it&#39;s habitable status in the future, periodically checking in on and guding the current race of humans so that the two can converge.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a miracle because it got that close in the first place. Common sense prevented a million other nuclear scenarios.</p>
