        About this image
Hubble Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 mosaic of crater Copernicus. Hubble's crisp bird's-eye view clearly shows the ray pattern of bright dust ejected out of the crater over 1 billion years ago. Hubble can resolve features as small as 600 feet across in the terraced walls of the crater, and the hummock-like blanket of material blasted out by the meteor impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        The telescope is 43.5 feet (13.2 meters) long, weighs 24,500 pounds (11,110 kilograms) and cost $2.5 billion. Hubble's six cameras and sensors see visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.
        <strong>
         At the heart of Hubble is its 8-foot-diameter (2.4 meters) primary mirror.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In comparison, a Schmidt Cassegrain 11" is ~$2,000 and also shoots through the atmosphere.

       That's the 2.499997 Billion dollar question. By comparison
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6wtrwz/moon_from_hubble_moon_from_11_amateur_telescope/dmaq341/">
        look at the images the VLT telescope
       </a>
       (Earth based) takes, of Nubulae, long range targets, and the moon (compared to an 11 inch).
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is also scary with the choice of processing in the Hubble images. If one simply
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W4qVMHR.png">
        inverts the color channels
       </a>
       immediately it appears to be clearer. It's appears the release was a false color image. But no explanation as to why they would do that at all.

       Why would you expect that if they are operating in visible light with larger mirrors. Is that based on an understanding of optics or simply what is parroted in media when people ask very sensible questions?

       In fact, Hubble sucks at taking photos of the moon. It can't change its focal point fast enough to track the moon because the moon moves too fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also why Hubble cannot be used to take photos of Earth. While its lens should be able to resolve the date on a dime, it could never fixate on a single spot because the ground is moving so fast that even a single exposure allowing enough light to create an image would be blurry beyond recognition.

       Observations of the moon aren't easy for Hubble. The moon is a difficult target because it moves across the sky faster than Hubble can track it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, observations in visible light are very brief and lack detail. Long exposures require a LOT of Hubble time, and since Hubble wasn't built to image the moon, they simply don't get that priority.

       If the Hubble orbits the Earth every 90 minutes it's quite amazing it can track anything then. Imagine the night sky rotating every ~28-36 mins instead of 12-16 hours &amp; imaging during that short window.

       Hubble is quite amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The objects Hubble is designed to observe are distant. They are essentially fixed points in the sky, so Hubble only has to adjust for its own orbit to remain fixed on these points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Moon, on the other hand, orbits Earth at nearly 1 km/s, in a different inclination than Hubble, so to image the moon, Hubble has to account for its own orbit, and for the Moon's orbit!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hubble doesn't have that capability, so instead, they take very short exposures (so it isn't blurry), complete an orbit, and then take another short exposure from the same angle, and over and over again until they have enough light to make an image.

       They really aren't. Not if you are spinning 365 degrees over 24 hours. And Hubble does that in 12-16 hours.
       <strong>
        That's a lot of slewing buddy!!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you map the outer circumference of Hubbles orbit compared to Earths, plus its orbit, it then makes the relative position of Hubble to the "fixed point" targets, less desirable than on Earth. Lots of slewing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth's diameter (STB) is 6371km - Circumference ~40,000km. The circumference of the orbital path of Hubble is ~42,000km, yet instead of a 12-16 hr night it passes that path 28-36 mins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it can make up 12-16 hours slewing time in ~28 minutes there's absolutely no reason why it wouldn't be able to keep up with the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hubble isn't said to have thrusters. Oops.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The HST can't use rocket engines or gas thrusters to steer like most satellites do, because the exhaust gases would hover near the telescope and cloud the surrounding field of view.

       The telescope can "slew" as fast as its orbit requires it to "slew." In fact, its motors can cause it to change its orientation by 90 degrees in about 15 minutes. To make an observation (maintain an orientation pointing at a distant, non-moving object) from one side of the planet to another, would take about 50 minutes, allowing it to "slew" the full ~185 degrees required to maintain a fixation on a distant point with a few minutes left over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distant objects are not moving relative to Hubble (Well, they are, but because of perspective their movement is neglibile.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon, on the other hand, is moving quickly to the west compared to Hubble's eastern orbit. So fast, in fact, that Hubble cannot keep up with it to take long exposures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't uderstand this dynamic, I can't help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your view of the sky from Earth's surface does not apply to Hubble. Hubble is not on the surface of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while I made no mention of thrusters, Hubble uses its thrusters to maintain its orbit, not to orient its observations. It uses motors to turn itself for observations.

       Try this. Make a fist. Hold a pencil in the other hand between your thumb and index finger. Put the fist directly above the pencil, and hold the pencil parallel with the floor and pointing at a distant object on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, keeping the pencil parallel to the floor, orbit your fist with the pencil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tip of the pencil should maintain its orientation pointing at the distant object quite easily. And it doesn't matter how fast your orbit the pencil around your fist, you can keep it constantly pointing at that distant object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, have your friend orbit his fist in the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       direction of your pencil and notice how much you have to move the pencil to keep it pointed at that other orbiting object. It will be very difficult, even in this example.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the difference between maintaining orientation on a distant object and trying to track a moving object a few hundred thousand kilometers away.

       The Hubble has filters to protect it from moon reflection because they can destroy the optics that allow it to take pictures of things billions of lightyears away.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your very very very stupid logic then our eyes are a "conspiracy" because they can resolve my feet whereas my 8" Orion telescope can't..... because it's too fucking close.

       Seriously, you're

       . I have many filters for my DSLR. None of them prevent the others from working.

       No not exactly. Simply look for things that do not add up entirely.

       The moon has always fascinated me. I'm always wondering why I don't really understand it's position and movements. Rather, why what I've been taught doesn't line up with what I observe. What if the moon is actually fairly close to earth, and Hubble is a hoax? Have you seen photos of stars shining through the moon / clouds behind the moon? Anyway, I appreciate your question. I concur, it's strange.
