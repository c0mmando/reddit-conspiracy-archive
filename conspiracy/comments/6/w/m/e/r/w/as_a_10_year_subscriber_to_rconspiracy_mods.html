<p>At the same time, I think our mod team should be as transparent as possible, and that means allowing users with legitimate gripes or suspicions to be able to speak their mind without fear of retribution. I don&#39;t think we as a mod team have given the community that opportunity nearly enough. </p>

<p>Scary words.</p>

<p>Get on with the job and don&#39;t pay attention to people&#39;s words - your actions speak louder than anything. Limiting a user&#39;s criticism (even in the case that it is unwarranted) is bad, just plain bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Again, I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the team, but there&#39;s a certain aspect of needing to present a somewhat united front to the community, even when we have internal disagreements, which are pretty much daily even when there&#39;s not the type of drama we&#39;ve had over the last few weeks. There are forces, TMoR to say the least, who would love nothing more than to jump on any perceived division and try to exploit it. </p>

<p>I hope that in the next few days, we can be a little bit more forthcoming about the events of the last few weeks. I will be pushing for it. </p>

<p>Valid criticism is one thing, but this is just a bald insult - no content, no context, just an offensive personal slight. </p>

<p>Most people come here to discuss conspiracies with an open mind, and pretty much nothing is off limits, which makes this subreddit a very unusual place. But because we discuss taboo subjects, this tends to attract a lot of deniers and haters whose main aim is to disrupt and denigrate. That is why, in the interest of promoting free discussion, WE DO NOT PERMIT USERS TO <strong>INSULT</strong> OTHER USERS OF THE SUB. If you are inside the tent, you can piss outside the tent all you want, but if you piss inside the tent, you will be removed.</p>

<p>As you can see if you look at my mod history, the majority of the user comments I remove are for Rules 4 and 10 - attacks against other users (including the mods). The vast majority of the users I have banned were repeat offenders of Rules 4/10, and since your account is new, yet you appear to have strong negative feelings about me, I guess I probably banned one (or more) of your previous accounts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking from experience, but I&#39;ve only had good interactions with Assuredly. He and I were both on the mod team for pizzagate when that was around. Up until that sub started tipping 20,000 subs (so the first 1-2 weeks) all modding was done well and communication between mods and users was great. Obviously it changed when the numbers of users massively increased shortly after as shills, trolls and the odd idiot led to the banning of the entire sub. But yeah that&#39;s just my 2 cents. </p>

<p>Just to play devil&#39;s advocate:</p>

<p>Who started the sub? What if he was a &quot;plant&quot; by the admins with the foresight of knowing the sub would be shut down and it was a move to group all the content in the same place to shut it down effectively in one swoop.</p>

<p>The deletion of that sub was big, and while its obviously outside of the mods control and it legit had dox info in it, I wouldn&#39;t be shocked to find out they had an &quot;inside man,&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>Just throwing that out there to entertain the idea, not because I believe in it.</p>

Nah I get you, it&#39;s definitely important to ask those questions. And to always be mindful of that possibility. But again from my own personal experience I don&#39;t think he was a plant. He asked me to mod based on my posting/comment history. I can&#39;t remember many of the other mods but I know that there were quite a few more added as the number of subscribers massively increased and it&#39;s possible that at least one of them was a plant, but based on the way mods were selected I don&#39;t think it was likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/stormfront">/r/stormfront</a> was created by the notorious digg/reddit troll JCM267, the exact same person that created <a href="/r/the_d">/r/the_d</a>****d. He deleted his account - my guess is that he got doxxed - people had been trying to doxx him for <em>years</em>. The same guy created <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> for the express purpose of mocking conspiracy theorists.  he and his crew also spent untold hours mocking Rachel Corrie or anyone who tried to memorialize/lionize her.  It was a very provocative crew with weird motives.  I&#39;m very curious what became of them in the New Age of Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s as been in this sub from the beginning, the true heart of this sub was imo, is it ran much like r/reddit.com and wasn&#39;t taken over like pikitics, news, worldnews.  I&#39;m of the belief that a lot of the sub rules are created to control the content by selectively enforcing tge rules l.  I hope we don&#39;t loose our sub to heavy handed mods looking to control what is discussed.  There have been mistakes imo with moderation in this sub, but it nothing compared to any of the larger subs who have been around just as long.  </p>

<p>Most are subs I created..well off the beaten path of already existing much more established subs on the subject-focus of the sub.</p>

<p>I like to read.. ..sometimes I like to come back to read something again, or send it to someone.. ..having lots of subs makes it easier to find, etc.</p>

<p>Not really a &#39;power thing&#39; .. ..maybe more a &#39;comfort thing&#39;? If I&#39;m a mod I feel more comfortable posting there.. ..dump-/flood- posting at that.. ..vs disrupting the general community flooding <em>them</em> with my iver zealous obsessivenesses.</p>

<p>My life/style caters to reading &amp; posting the news and such. Just <em>because</em> I&#39;m reading about other people&#39;s lives doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t have one of my own. &lt;shrugs&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check his last comments about Witkowski&#39;s Cayce Society book through the publisher who gave Farrell his first advanced for his Giza book.  He consistently makes suggestions from JF&#39;s private boards for discussions.  That same book from Witkowski gets zero play in American media or his english facing media site as it would discredit all his &#39;research&#39; on Die Glocke.  Which has spread itself through alternative media.</p>

<p>Not a personal attack on AP as they are good at pointing at peculiarities but they are involved distantly with &#39;former&#39; American intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a hundred interviews floating around Youtube where Farrell talks about either of his early WWII books and how he started speaking with Witkowski.  Most of AP&#39;s larger posts are writ large in theme from his private forums however if it is intentional or just consuming the same media, I would not speculate.</p>

<p>However the religious college Farrell teaches remotely for in California is covered up in various traditional right wing organizations from the MacArthur post-war intelligence diaspora.</p>

<p>Well, I founded <a href="/r/josephpfarrell">/r/josephpfarrell</a> and am a self-admitted fanboy (I have most of his books) but that&#39;s about when that connection ends.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also admit I found out about Witkowski via Farrell, but in the context of another book (The Truth of the Wunderwaffe, an expose of Nazi research into exotic tech...I&#39;ve never been able to get my hands on a copy).</p>

<p>A number of years ago I found out that Witkowski wrote a book on the connections between the civilizations on Easter Island, Angkor Wat, etc and it&#39;s pretty damn fascinating (the language similarities especially).</p>

<p>I picked it up again recently, and mentioned it because it was very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6winfu/remember_the_ancient_sites_with_multiton_blocks/">relevant to this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Your perspicacity is certainly something else though :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly agree with you on your points about the scientific method and the creation of new falsifiable models, but I have to say I&#39;ve been somewhat diappointed with <a href="/u/ParsingSol">/u/ParsingSol</a>&#39;s transparency so far. In order for us (or anyone) to evaluate how accurate the models are, we need to be able to analyze <em>all</em> the data and predictions, and see how they match up with reality. As far as I know, he has not provided this community with such long term data yet. </p>

<p>This is somewhat of a problem in the scientific community, where results that are not novel or do not support the researcher&#39;s hypotheses are not published. This creates a bias toward positive and significant results, which is not helpful in the long run for our scientific understanding. If I perform the same study 5 times, and produce a significant result only once, publishing that one but not the others, it makes it look like I might have discovered something new, when in fact it might not be. A meta study a year or two back found over 50% of published psychology papers could not be reproduced. </p>

<p>But second I point out that science doesn&#39;t proceed by hanging on to models that <em>have been falsified</em>, such as is the case here. Science throws the falsified models on the scrap heap post haste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple times does not a statistical analysis make. What&#39;s your confidence interval here, how certain are we that the model does not perform better than chance?</p>

<p>Do you think a scientist runs a few interactions of an experiment and then just goes, &quot;ok looks like that doesn&#39;t work, next!&quot;? </p>

<p>If you cannot provide the statistical analysis (and you can&#39;t, it hasn&#39;t been done and there likely have not been enough iterations to yet do a meaningful analysis), then the model has not yet been falsified. </p>

<p>You look at the evidence and have a hunch that the model is junk. And that&#39;s fine. But that&#39;s not science, that&#39;s not a falsification. It&#39;s a hunch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are totally right about all of that. </p>

<p>However. At this point the model itself is also no more than a hunch. It has exactly nothing else going for it that would make it distinguishable from a hunch in the ways of supporting evidence. And the larger point here is that while you are right that I am unable to assemble the rigor required to formally disprove the hypothesis/model, with serious things such as earthquake predictions it is far more harmful to present the model itself as anything more than a hunch, and at this point preferably (if intellectual honesty and scientific ambition is the agenda rather than alarmism, attention seeking or greed) with prominent disclaimers regarding the multiple failed predictions that constitute its track record so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d absolutely agree that at this point it is essentially an untested hypothesis. Where we disagree is that I haven&#39;t seen it presented as anything but that. I see a guy putting the predictions of his model in the public sphere, hoping for positive hits that will allow him to actually test his model properly.

<p>Well, to be fair it has been tested a few times (predictions are tests). Let&#39;s agree on a &quot;not conclusively disproved hypothesis&quot;?</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m not really naming names - certainly not you, but also not the model maker. What I am cautioning against is basically when a model like this &quot;gets feet&quot; among others than those possibly interested in scientifically evaluating it. Getting the idea into the hands of other interested professionals or amateurs for scientific scrutiny is the right and honest thing to do, for sure, but making it more generally available to the public at large who have no trouble imagining the consequence if the model is correct but very little time to rigorously evaluate the model for flaws is less responsible. Sure, I know I&#39;m talking in a sub where readers are expected to deal with the suggestion that the government is scheming to poison your water in a calm and collected manner, but earthquake stuff is the kind of thing that can easily get out of hand, and quickly spread beyond happy, seasoned tin foil hatters.</p>

<p>Emphasis on the <em>essentially</em> untested. It&#39;s my suspicion that there haven&#39;t been nearly enough tests to evaluate the model. We are saying the same thing here at the end of the day though, just wanted to clarify.</p>

<p>As to the rest of your point, I do see where you&#39;re coming from. At the same time, it seems sorta self-correcting. If this ever does blow up big enough to cause the sort of problems that you&#39;re worried about, that influx of attention should lead to the model being more rapidly rejected if it isn&#39;t valid. </p>

<p>So yeah, advising caution and disclaimers does seem reasonable to me. I only object when folks insist that this has been disproven, tectonics is a &quot;proven&quot; theory, or some other thing that conflicts with my understanding of the science.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been here for a long time. This is unrelated but I just became so exhausted by the shillery. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even say you can&#39;t really tell. You can. </p>

<p>But besides that...there is definitely some larger corruption going on.</p>

<p>I did start my own sub <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a> if anyone is interested. It is not a sub that can be politically labeled. All viewpoints are welcome. But be warned I have a few rules:</p>

<p>1) topminds users banned immediately. They do nothing to contribute to good discussion and are only there to mock.</p>

<p>2) Collegial discussion. No attacks allowed. </p>

<p>3) No shills. This one is harder but I am enforcing it.</p>

<p>Why can you trust me?</p>

<p>1) I have no agenda (other than maybe spiritual). I really want a space like this sub used to be.</p>

<p>2) You can check my post history to see that I truly care about the people here.</p>

<p>3) I try to be fair when banning. I really really am doing my best.</p>

<p>I hope to see you all there. I have been extremely fair about no advertising my sub on this sub, but they seem to have larger things to worry about.</p>

He literally dedicates almost every comment to lambasting anyone who talks shit about Trump and defending him at every turn while calling anyone who talks about Trump&#39;s illegal actions and fucked up political practices a shill...

    <div class="md"><p>Because he&#39;s been part of this sub (and a mod) for years, he&#39;s not a shill, and he tried to protect this sub from being taken over like so many before.  I may not agree with his politics, but I respect the dude because he&#39;s earned it.  </p>

<p>With him (unlike you) I can actually have a conversation without bringing fucking Trump into it.  Trump is an awful president, sure.  But so what?  Every president since Eisenhower has been awful except Kennedy and maybe Carter, Trump is nothing new, so stop trying to make everything about Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can have plenty of discussions without bringing up Trump. I brought it up here because it is completely relevant. Flytape was completely dedicated to defending Trump and clamping down on anti-Trump opinions around the sub. It&#39;s impossible not to make this about that. Like I said, it is what defined him and his zeal for Trump ultimately led him to try and take over the fucking subreddit to undoubtedly try to make it a safe space for Trump supporters. He ended up making his own subreddit for that purpose. It&#39;s painfully obvious what his intentions were. And come-the-fuck-on, acting like Trump&#39;s behavior and actions as president are &quot;nothing new&quot; is fucking completely disingenuous or willfully ignorant. Comparing him to any of those other presidents and saying he is behaving like a normal president is just willfully being obtuse. You know he is different. You know he is crazy. Unless of course, you are a supporter like I originally thought. Hmm.</p>

<p>What I have been using to inform my opinion in which side to trust is twofold. </p>

<p>The first, broadly is what have been discussing. What we can infer about the ethics and trustworthiness of the actors involved as evidenced by their actions in this situation. </p>

<p>I find authoritarian, unilateral, <em>retributive</em> action disgusting, particularly when used against unanimous consent. </p>

<p>Further, we can judge others by their affiliates. </p>

<p>Flytape was neck deep in this and a plague of cancers upon this sub. Birdmask webcast? Rolling out the red carpet for the insane cultural mismatch of T_D(a proud groupthink incubator, the literal inverse of /C.)? Doing everything in his power to turn this place into a safe space for same, and instead creating a cratered, divided and conquered hellscape. </p>

<p>No, the way this played out hasn&#39;t ruffled my feathers at all. Looks to me like the unjust party ruining this sub got caught nakedly grabbing power and was justly spanked for it by a stopped clock that&#39;s gotta be right some time. (admins not mods)</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for noticing me, finally.</strong></p>

<p>In the modmail I laid down some pretty heavy evidence backed by irrefutable cites. You&#39;ve seen it, sourced from public forums that are accessible to anyone who knows where to look, yet I would not disclose this to the public eye, as doing so would constitute a violation of both courtesy and confidentiality - things that I take <strong><em>very</em></strong> seriously.</p>

<p>I would go to bat for you in a heartbeat IF ONLY you would communicate, stating your case honestly and openly. So far you have not. Not with me, and not with the other members of the mod team. As it stands, the &#39;defense&#39; you have offered for your rash. unannounced and apparently TREACHEROUS actions does NOT look good.</p>

<p>I am not political. Remember: I did NOT ask to be a mod. In fact, I rejected offers on multiple occasions, and when I finally accepted, after repeated entreaties by different senior mods, I made it CLEAR that my commitment was to <strong><em>maintaining the integrity of the Sub</em></strong>, which I cherish as a rare jewel where virtually any thought, idea or theory can be openly expressed and discussed without being CRUSHED by ideologically driven censorship.</p>

<p>I stand by that commitment, and will not waver as long as I draw breath. </p>

<p>If you are working toward the same goal, CONVINCE ME! Because so far, the evidence I have compiled and laid out in the modmail points to the opposite conclusion. You know well what I mean.</p>

<p>You can answer here (best!), in the modmail (okay) or via PM, if necessary, but you must answer. Failing that I shall have no choice but to assist in the pursuit of whatever course of action is necessary to enforce the verdict of the overwhelming majority of mod team members.</p>

<p>To be, or not to be?</p>

<p>Communicate, Make your case.</p>

<p>Respectfully, Amos</p>

He consistently makes suggestions from JF&#39;s private boards for discussions.

Which has spread itself through alternative media.</p>

<p>However the religious college Farrell teaches remotely for in California is covered up in various traditional right wing organizations from the MacArthur post-war intelligence diaspora.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you are totally right about all of that. </p>

<p>However. At this point the model itself is also no more than a hunch. It has exactly nothing else going for it that would make it distinguishable from a hunch in the ways of supporting evidence. And the larger point here is that while you are right that I am unable to assemble the rigor required to formally disprove the hypothesis/model, with serious things such as earthquake predictions it is far more harmful to present the model itself as anything more than a hunch, and at this point preferably (if intellectual honesty and scientific ambition is the agenda rather than alarmism, attention seeking or greed) with prominent disclaimers regarding the multiple failed predictions that constitute its track record so far. </p>
