       Personally, I'd like to set up such a thread sometime in the coming week or so, but I'd have to see if the rest of the mod team would be on board. In general, I think it's a good idea to limit attacks against the mods (or against any user of this sub), as it would certainly be abused to derail threads having nothing to do with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I think our mod team should be as transparent as possible, and that means allowing users with legitimate gripes or suspicions to be able to speak their mind without fear of retribution. I don't think we as a mod team have given the community that opportunity nearly enough.

       Get on with the job and don't pay attention to people's words - your actions speak louder than anything. Limiting a user's criticism (even in the case that it is unwarranted) is bad, just plain bad.

       The job is keeping this space open for the free discussion of conspiracies, and every thread devolving into attacks against users and mods does nothing to further that goal. I don't mind the criticism against me, warranted or unwarranted, but there has to be a time and a place for it. This is a sub for serious discussion of world events, not a drama sub.

       I just think all of the users here in conspiracy need to be on guard for this type of shit and make sure we question mod changes extra hard and examine them with extra scrutiny, seeing as this is one of the last places of actual free speech on reddit.

       I agree with you. Again, I can't speak for the rest of the team, but there's a certain aspect of needing to present a somewhat united front to the community, even when we have internal disagreements, which are pretty much daily even when there's not the type of drama we've had over the last few weeks. There are forces, TMoR to say the least, who would love nothing more than to jump on any perceived division and try to exploit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that in the next few days, we can be a little bit more forthcoming about the events of the last few weeks. I will be pushing for it.

       Valid criticism is one thing, but this is just a bald insult - no content, no context, just an offensive personal slight.

       Most people come here to discuss conspiracies with an open mind, and pretty much nothing is off limits, which makes this subreddit a very unusual place. But because we discuss taboo subjects, this tends to attract a lot of deniers and haters whose main aim is to disrupt and denigrate. That is why, in the interest of promoting free discussion, WE DO NOT PERMIT USERS TO
       <strong>
        INSULT
       </strong>
       OTHER USERS OF THE SUB. If you are inside the tent, you can piss outside the tent all you want, but if you piss inside the tent, you will be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see if you look at my mod history, the majority of the user comments I remove are for Rules 4 and 10 - attacks against other users (including the mods). The vast majority of the users I have banned were repeat offenders of Rules 4/10, and since your account is new, yet you appear to have strong negative feelings about me, I guess I probably banned one (or more) of your previous accounts?

       But it should be said that all the mods have censored discussions at some point, and stroked each other's chickens at the behest of real researchers. It's annoying and makes little sense for such a sub. Repeated racism and harassment should be dealt with, and doxxing of course, but that's about it IMO.

       Speaking from experience, but I've only had good interactions with Assuredly. He and I were both on the mod team for pizzagate when that was around. Up until that sub started tipping 20,000 subs (so the first 1-2 weeks) all modding was done well and communication between mods and users was great. Obviously it changed when the numbers of users massively increased shortly after as shills, trolls and the odd idiot led to the banning of the entire sub. But yeah that's just my 2 cents.

       Just to play devil's advocate:
      </p>
      <p>
       Who started the sub? What if he was a "plant" by the admins with the foresight of knowing the sub would be shut down and it was a move to group all the content in the same place to shut it down effectively in one swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deletion of that sub was big, and while its obviously outside of the mods control and it legit had dox info in it, I wouldn't be shocked to find out they had an "inside man," so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just throwing that out there to entertain the idea, not because I believe in it.

       <br/>
       Nah I get you, it's definitely important to ask those questions. And to always be mindful of that possibility. But again from my own personal experience I don't think he was a plant. He asked me to mod based on my posting/comment history. I can't remember many of the other mods but I know that there were quite a few more added as the number of subscribers massively increased and it's possible that at least one of them was a plant, but based on the way mods were selected I don't think it was likely.

       And this is why I am ok with what has happened. It's not perfect but I've already seen over the last few days that this place has become much more bearable and isn't just another t_d mirror.

       As someone who's as been in this sub from the beginning, the true heart of this sub was imo, is it ran much like r/reddit.com and wasn't taken over like pikitics, news, worldnews.  I'm of the belief that a lot of the sub rules are created to control the content by selectively enforcing tge rules l.  I hope we don't loose our sub to heavy handed mods looking to control what is discussed.  There have been mistakes imo with moderation in this sub, but it nothing compared to any of the larger subs who have been around just as long.

       I'd like to specifically address your last sentence and state that I agree whole heartedly with it. This sub, comparably to other large veteran subreddits, has conducted itself far better then it's veteran counterparts.

       This sub's greatest protection is the name itself...the word "conspiracy" has successfully (via propaganda) been connected with all manners of quackery.

       Because it's so easy for "them" to dismiss anything with the label "conspiracy", it actually gives us more freedom to discuss whatever we want here.

       Sorry I know this is an older post, but I'm just seeing it now.  Can you explain why you like having shills here?  You get to observe how they behave? The actual community is being bullied by the thought police in their own sub. How is that something that you like? Its disruptive, it's disrespectful and it's fracturing the sub.

       As far as I understand it, that was in response to the mod team voting Sarah out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to point out that this decision shouldn't have been made in the first place without at least some kind of community input. If the mod team as a whole has decided there is something more going on, or Sarah is corrupt, or whatever there reasons are, they should present them to the community and let us decide as a jury imho.

       Whatever heppened beyond that is largely out of our control and seems to have clearly gotten out of hand an only confused the issue.

       There already is a sticky post about it. The mods voted to make someone else head mod and Sarah responded by demodding everyone, then the admins stepped in and remodded them. Not sure what confusion you're talking about.

       i am curious what drives you to mod so many places? is it a power thing? are you just bored? wouldn't it be more fulfilling to invest in a few subs that you have true passion for? not trying to tell you how to live your life just curious.

       Why not mod 'em?

      <p>
       Most are subs I created..well off the beaten path of already existing much more established subs on the subject-focus of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to read.. ..sometimes I like to come back to read something again, or send it to someone.. ..having lots of subs makes it easier to find, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really a 'power thing' .. ..maybe more a 'comfort thing'? If I'm a mod I feel more comfortable posting there.. ..dump-/flood- posting at that.. ..vs disrupting the general community flooding

       Check his last comments about Witkowski's Cayce Society book through the publisher who gave Farrell his first advanced for his Giza book.  He consistently makes suggestions from JF's private boards for discussions.  That same book from Witkowski gets zero play in American media or his english facing media site as it would discredit all his 'research' on Die Glocke.  Which has spread itself through alternative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a personal attack on AP as they are good at pointing at peculiarities but they are involved distantly with 'former' American intelligence.

       There are a hundred interviews floating around Youtube where Farrell talks about either of his early WWII books and how he started speaking with Witkowski.  Most of AP's larger posts are writ large in theme from his private forums however if it is intentional or just consuming the same media, I would not speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the religious college Farrell teaches remotely for in California is covered up in various traditional right wing organizations from the MacArthur post-war intelligence diaspora.

       and am a self-admitted fanboy (I have most of his books) but that's about when that connection ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also admit I found out about Witkowski via Farrell, but in the context of another book (The Truth of the Wunderwaffe, an expose of Nazi research into exotic tech...I've never been able to get my hands on a copy).
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of years ago I found out that Witkowski wrote a book on the connections between the civilizations on Easter Island, Angkor Wat, etc and it's pretty damn fascinating (the language similarities especially).

       Also I think someone that is that active (90 mods) and posts non stop might not actually be a single individual but an account ran by multiple people. Whether they do this on their own accord or by a 3 letter agency or propaganda group I cannot say.

       The earthquake guy seemed pretty decent at first but I'm starting to agree with the people who believe he is just a scammer. His latest prediction for the largest earthquake of 2016-2017 just fell completely flat and he's been silent ever since. Not to mention that he was asking for donations to help buy a house before that.

       It is also how science is actually supposed to be performed. You create a new model that you feel better describes the phenomenon in question and generates testable predictions. You test those predictions and refine, reject, or accept your model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is supposed to be constantly challenging and recreating itself. The failure of a new model is not a failure of science, but a success. At the need of the day we know more than we did before. In fact, it is only through failure and falsifiability that we gain new knowledge of the world. Nothing is even proven, just disproven or not yet disproven.

       No it's either disproven or proven, or unproven. You prove or disprove something by following the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parsingsols methods are unproven and his predictions have been wrong just about every single time. It's time to accept that his model is wrong.

       If you think the scientific method ever
       <em>
        proves
       </em>
       anything, you are straight up flat out wrong. Seriously, this is like the bedrock foundation of scientific thought. Science is all about falsification. All theories are provisional, nothing is proven ever. This isn't ba debatable point, you can get through an entry level college science course(to say nothing of high school, honestly) without this point being hammered on. It is literally the idea that scientific thought is based upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without running the statistics, you have absolutely zero idea if the model can yet be rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, but it's terribly obvious that you are not qualified to speak on the subject.

       I certainly agree with you on your points about the scientific method and the creation of new falsifiable models, but I have to say I've been somewhat diappointed with
       <a href="/u/ParsingSol">
        /u/ParsingSol
       </a>
       's transparency so far. In order for us (or anyone) to evaluate how accurate the models are, we need to be able to analyze
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the data and predictions, and see how they match up with reality. As far as I know, he has not provided this community with such long term data yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is somewhat of a problem in the scientific community, where results that are not novel or do not support the researcher's hypotheses are not published. This creates a bias toward positive and significant results, which is not helpful in the long run for our scientific understanding. If I perform the same study 5 times, and produce a significant result only once, publishing that one but not the others, it makes it look like I might have discovered something new, when in fact it might not be. A meta study a year or two back found over 50% of published psychology papers could not be reproduced.

       First that I agree with you that it is through the creation of falsifiable models that science proceeds and that if anyone could predict earthquakes, it would be that way.

       But second I point out that science doesn't proceed by hanging on to models that

       Multiple times does not a statistical analysis make. What's your confidence interval here, how certain are we that the model does not perform better than chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think a scientist runs a few interactions of an experiment and then just goes, "ok looks like that doesn't work, next!"?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cannot provide the statistical analysis (and you can't, it hasn't been done and there likely have not been enough iterations to yet do a meaningful analysis), then the model has not yet been falsified.
      </p>
      <p>
       You look at the evidence and have a hunch that the model is junk. And that's fine. But that's not science, that's not a falsification. It's a hunch.

       Actually you are totally right about all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       However. At this point the model itself is also no more than a hunch. It has exactly nothing else going for it that would make it distinguishable from a hunch in the ways of supporting evidence. And the larger point here is that while you are right that I am unable to assemble the rigor required to formally disprove the hypothesis/model, with serious things such as earthquake predictions it is far more harmful to present the model itself as anything more than a hunch, and at this point preferably (if intellectual honesty and scientific ambition is the agenda rather than alarmism, attention seeking or greed) with prominent disclaimers regarding the multiple failed predictions that constitute its track record so far.

       I'd absolutely agree that at this point it is essentially an untested hypothesis. Where we disagree is that I haven't seen it presented as anything but that. I see a guy putting the predictions of his model in the public sphere, hoping for positive hits that will allow him to actually test his model properly. Maybe he should go further in sticking disclaimers on his stuff, but again I don't recall this ever being presented except as something provisional.

       Well, to be fair it has been tested a few times (predictions are tests). Let's agree on a "not conclusively disproved hypothesis"?

       However, I'm not really naming names - certainly not you, but also not the model maker. What I am cautioning against is basically when a model like this "gets feet" among others than those possibly interested in scientifically evaluating it. Getting the idea into the hands of other interested professionals or amateurs for scientific scrutiny is the right and honest thing to do, for sure, but making it more generally available to the public at large who have no trouble imagining the consequence if the model is correct but very little time to rigorously evaluate the model for flaws is less responsible. Sure, I know I'm talking in a sub where readers are expected to deal with the suggestion that the government is scheming to poison your water in a calm and collected manner, but earthquake stuff is the kind of thing that can easily get out of hand, and quickly spread beyond happy, seasoned tin foil hatters.

       Emphasis on the

       untested. It's my suspicion that there haven't been nearly enough tests to evaluate the model. We are saying the same thing here at the end of the day though, just wanted to clarify.

      <p>
       As to the rest of your point, I do see where you're coming from. At the same time, it seems sorta self-correcting. If this ever does blow up big enough to cause the sort of problems that you're worried about, that influx of attention should lead to the model being more rapidly rejected if it isn't valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, advising caution and disclaimers does seem reasonable to me. I only object when folks insist that this has been disproven, tectonics is a "proven" theory, or some other thing that conflicts with my understanding of the science.

       Going to have to say if I was crowd sourcing it wouldn't be a scam. Scams imply criminal actions. Crimes such as online stalking, harassment, and ccyber bullying. Thise are crimes. Crowd sourcing for donations. Completely legal.

       Spoke to him at the 2016 Reddit Meetup in San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asked him why they didn't have the ability to vote mods out of power. He said they've looked into it but it wasn't a priority and they had other things they had to fix first.
      </p>
      <p>
       This issue isn't exclusive to this sub. It's a flaw in Reddit really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't really know all the details of what went down. But a mod vote is not a function of Reddit. It's an outside gesture but not a feature of Reddit. Obviously they didn't want to give up the spot if they took such drastic action.

       Thank you for your clarification.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have inside confirmation that the purge was initiated because of this vote. I'm not sure what else you need to know, that is absolutely damning to me. If the vote was non-binding, that just makes it so much worse, in my opinion.

       If all the mods vote someone above them out they don't have a means to enforce the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people above absolutely have the authority to remove anyone below them. Doesn't mean I agree with it, but that's how Reddit works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of surprised the admins stepped in really in such a situation since the higher level mod was in the position of authority to do so. Again, their vote wasn't official if the person voted out is above them on the mod order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't know the details but I do know how Reddit works and there's certainly two sides to this situation. Don't like it either way.

       They won't hire me. I've applied but they won't even interview me. Which is fine, I'd rather consult directly with Spez anyway, but that isn't a relationship I was ever close to establishing. Talked to the guy once and my main concerns were censorship, shilling, and moderation.

       I have been here for a long time. This is unrelated but I just became so exhausted by the shillery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even say you can't really tell. You can.
      </p>
      <p>
       But besides that...there is definitely some larger corruption going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did start my own sub
       <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">
        /r/conspiracyundone
       </a>
       if anyone is interested. It is not a sub that can be politically labeled. All viewpoints are welcome. But be warned I have a few rules:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) topminds users banned immediately. They do nothing to contribute to good discussion and are only there to mock.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Collegial discussion. No attacks allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) No shills. This one is harder but I am enforcing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can you trust me?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I have no agenda (other than maybe spiritual). I really want a space like this sub used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You can check my post history to see that I truly care about the people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I try to be fair when banning. I really really am doing my best.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to see you all there. I have been extremely fair about no advertising my sub on this sub, but they seem to have larger things to worry about.

       Your opinion. Many were deeply distrustful of Flytape, at the very least. Regardless, not an appropriate decision to make by fiat.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're you aware that Flytape left the mod team by his own choice? The way you have framed the issue, you don't seem to know that fact.

       Go on conspiracyright and talk to him.  He quit because he thinks the entire mod team has been compromised.

       So you call the biggest Trump worshipping mod a hero why? He literally dedicates almost every comment to lambasting anyone who talks shit about Trump and defending him at every turn while calling anyone who talks about Trump's illegal actions and fucked up political practices a shill... Why is he a hero to you if you don't like Trump? The amount of times I see people hiding their support for Trump after getting called out on there nonsense is too damn high so I am very skeptical of your honesty at the moment.

       Because he's been part of this sub (and a mod) for years, he's not a shill, and he tried to protect this sub from being taken over like so many before.  I may not agree with his politics, but I respect the dude because he's earned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With him (unlike you) I can actually have a conversation without bringing fucking Trump into it.  Trump is an awful president, sure.  But so what?  Every president since Eisenhower has been awful except Kennedy and maybe Carter, Trump is nothing new, so stop trying to make everything about Trump.

       I can have plenty of discussions without bringing up Trump. I brought it up here because it is completely relevant. Flytape was completely dedicated to defending Trump and clamping down on anti-Trump opinions around the sub. It's impossible not to make this about that. Like I said, it is what defined him and his zeal for Trump ultimately led him to try and take over the fucking subreddit to undoubtedly try to make it a safe space for Trump supporters. He ended up making his own subreddit for that purpose. It's painfully obvious what his intentions were. And come-the-fuck-on, acting like Trump's behavior and actions as president are "nothing new" is fucking completely disingenuous or willfully ignorant. Comparing him to any of those other presidents and saying he is behaving like a normal president is just willfully being obtuse. You know he is different. You know he is crazy. Unless of course, you are a supporter like I originally thought. Hmm.

       Thinking Trump is any worse than previous presidents is obtuse.  He's a bit of a knob, but so far he isn't as much of a warmongering mass murderer as Obama, he didn't pull 9/11 like Bush and Clinton, he didn't introduce 'trickle down' economics that gutted the middle class like Reagan, he didn't create the CIA like Truman.

       Another angle: shill accusations have long been forbidden in this sub. It inevitably devolves into a finger-pointing which hunt. Given this, how on Earth could it possibly be appropriate for two mods to go on their own witch-hunt shill purge? Are the authorities which govern us not bound by the same rules and principles which we must follow?

       The main beneficiary of the no shill accusation rule is productive discourse. Finger pointing, which hunting, and a one-size-fits-all dismissal of any opinion you disagree with benefits no one but those who wish to divide and conquer.

       No, but power does have a pronounced tendency to corrupt good intentions, even the silly watered-down version of internet community power.

       Right but how do you know who's got the sub's interest at heart? We spend all our time watching how groups get manipulated, how that is how power works. So to suggest that it's a power grab by two mods is a little too obvious. In fact it's downright suspicious considering how much this sub has been under attack.

       Probably everyone involved has the sub's best interest at heart, in whatever way is important to then or that they have justified to themselves. It's not really the right question to be asking.

       What I have been using to inform my opinion in which side to trust is twofold.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first, broadly is what have been discussing. What we can infer about the ethics and trustworthiness of the actors involved as evidenced by their actions in this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find authoritarian, unilateral,
       <em>
        retributive
       </em>
       action disgusting, particularly when used against unanimous consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, we can judge others by their affiliates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape was neck deep in this and a plague of cancers upon this sub. Birdmask webcast? Rolling out the red carpet for the insane cultural mismatch of T_D(a proud groupthink incubator, the literal inverse of /C.)? Doing everything in his power to turn this place into a safe space for same, and instead creating a cratered, divided and conquered hellscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the way this played out hasn't ruffled my feathers at all. Looks to me like the unjust party ruining this sub got caught nakedly grabbing power and was justly spanked for it by a stopped clock that's gotta be right some time. (admins not mods)

       They're moderating to make sure ShareBlue and deep state talking points live and any questioning of the media makes us all r/T_D. It's so transparent and stupid. Go to Voat. This place is not for thinkers.

       One correction...the vote was to
       <em>
        demote
       </em>
       SC not
       <em>
        remove

       SC. I was not involved in that vote and it was unanimous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many months ago he offered to demote himself and it never materialized.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the proposal was readdressed, he made a series of unfortunate unilateral decisions which prompted admin involvement, which is dangerous to the future of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       We never wanted him removed, just out of a position that could potentially compromise
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I could probably find out by reading the site rules, but I might still not get it right so I'll just ask: Is there always
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       in the mod team who will be in a position to potentially compromise the sub (and the recent shuffle only changed who that is) or have you somehow managed to restructure in such a way that the sub becomes more robust?

       Mod powers are a hierarchy by age. Mods can kick and change permissions of anyone under themselves. They have demoted / removed the last of the old-guard mods. Time to embrace the new-age, light-on-substance/heavy-on-feels theme for this sub.

       This is the first time that you have directly addressed ME, Amos_Quito, since May 28. And that was in the Slack channel that
       <strong>
        <em>
         you
        </em>
       </strong>
       created.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have approached you repeatedly, in Slack, via PM, and in the modmail, asking you for explanations for your extended silence, your inaction, and your extremely RASH actions that had to be resolved by Admin intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Thanks for noticing me, finally.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the modmail I laid down some pretty heavy evidence backed by irrefutable cites. You've seen it, sourced from public forums that are accessible to anyone who knows where to look, yet I would not disclose this to the public eye, as doing so would constitute a violation of both courtesy and confidentiality - things that I take
       <strong>
        <em>
         very
        </em>
       </strong>
       seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go to bat for you in a heartbeat IF ONLY you would communicate, stating your case honestly and openly. So far you have not. Not with me, and not with the other members of the mod team. As it stands, the 'defense' you have offered for your rash. unannounced and apparently TREACHEROUS actions does NOT look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not political. Remember: I did NOT ask to be a mod. In fact, I rejected offers on multiple occasions, and when I finally accepted, after repeated entreaties by different senior mods, I made it CLEAR that my commitment was to
       <strong>
        <em>
         maintaining the integrity of the Sub
        </em>
       </strong>
       , which I cherish as a rare jewel where virtually any thought, idea or theory can be openly expressed and discussed without being CRUSHED by ideologically driven censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand by that commitment, and will not waver as long as I draw breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are working toward the same goal, CONVINCE ME! Because so far, the evidence I have compiled and laid out in the modmail points to the opposite conclusion. You know well what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can answer here (best!), in the modmail (okay) or via PM, if necessary, but you must answer. Failing that I shall have no choice but to assist in the pursuit of whatever course of action is necessary to enforce the verdict of the overwhelming majority of mod team members.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be, or not to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Communicate, Make your case.

       This always happens on subs that are attempted to be taken over on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll try to make it look organic and if it doesn't work they'll call the mod "racist, sexist, hateful, TD subscriber" etc to try and force a removal.

       The small mod-team has expanded its ranks in the last couple of years to cope with the influx of bullshit. Ironically enough this new mod team then wanted to oust the old mod team - and the man leading the charge moderates 90 other subs.

       Check his last comments about Witkowski's Cayce Society book through the publisher who gave Farrell his first advanced for his Giza book.  He consistently makes suggestions from JF's private boards for discussions.  That same book from Witkowski gets zero play in American media or his english facing media site as it would discredit all his 'research' on Die Glocke.  Which has spread itself through alternative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a personal attack on AP as they are good at pointing at peculiarities but they are involved distantly with 'former' American intelligence.

       There are a hundred interviews floating around Youtube where Farrell talks about either of his early WWII books and how he started speaking with Witkowski.  Most of AP's larger posts are writ large in theme from his private forums however if it is intentional or just consuming the same media, I would not speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the religious college Farrell teaches remotely for in California is covered up in various traditional right wing organizations from the MacArthur post-war intelligence diaspora.

       Actually you are totally right about all of that.

       However. At this point the model itself is also no more than a hunch. It has exactly nothing else going for it that would make it distinguishable from a hunch in the ways of supporting evidence. And the larger point here is that while you are right that I am unable to assemble the rigor required to formally disprove the hypothesis/model, with serious things such as earthquake predictions it is far more harmful to present the model itself as anything more than a hunch, and at this point preferably (if intellectual honesty and scientific ambition is the agenda rather than alarmism, attention seeking or greed) with prominent disclaimers regarding the multiple failed predictions that constitute its track record so far.
