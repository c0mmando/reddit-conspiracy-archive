    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a reason why Mac took Mayweather&#39;s back during the fight. And why he clinched when he did. In MMA it&#39;s called dominating your opponent. It&#39;s not really relevant in boxing but it adds to breaking your opponents psyche. It was Mac&#39;s way of toying with Mayweather.</p>

<p>Essentially the point is that Mac, during MMA, focus solely on striking. He won 75% of his matches by knockout. That&#39;s incredibly high for MMA fighters. </p>

<p>If Mayweather were to pass into the MMA side Mac would have him down no problem. Mayweather simply doesn&#39;t have the defensive awareness. And even though Mac is a striker he would be able to employ tactics he&#39;s familiar with defending to outfight Mayweather.</p>

<p>In the boxing atmosphere he lost from an early [BS] call. Simple as that. Mac, threw a half dozen shots into the top of the skull, which were points deducted as back of the head. In MMA every fighter walks the line and practices hitting just outside the area of &quot;back of the head&quot;.</p>

<p>They chose to count each shot near this as a foul (in the boxing match). Mac won at least 6 rounds but refs had him at 4 by the time the fight was over and Mayweather 5. </p>

<p>If it had been 6-3 and TKO by Mayweather it would be believable, but it appears as though the fixers simply hedged their bets. They gave Mayweather the adv on the scorecard and also on the call.</p>

<p>Actually, anyone who knows fuck all about boxing or Mayweather&#39;s style, knows that Mayweather was just toying with him and playing defense and letting McGregor tire himself out. And McGregor knew that literally the only chance he had was landing some haymaker KO punch in the first few rounds, so he went as hard as he could, all teh while Mayweahter just played defense and laughed to himself until McGregor couldn&#39;t hold up his mits anymore, and Mayweather finished him off.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds like you don&#39;t know anything at all about boxing, based on your analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between fighting defensively and not keeping up with your opponent. It was the latter in the first 4 rounds yet the judges still scored it Mayweather.</p>

<p>If you are confident in Mayweather&#39;s ability you should feel more robbed than McGregor since it would&#39;ve been a better finish by a true KO.</p>

<p>I think the ref made the absolutely correct call. Boxing isn&#39;t about trying to kill your opponent or sustain permanent brain damage. Just look at this <a href="https://gfycat.com/TangibleBlushingIberianemeraldlizard">https://gfycat.com/TangibleBlushingIberianemeraldlizard</a></p>

<p>I count 8 punches to McGregor&#39;s head, in a row, unanswered and with his arms dropped by his side, totally defenseless. If the ref had let this go for just 5-10 seconds more, McGregor would have gone done for a certainty. And in going down, he could have been very seriously injured or even killed. That&#39;s not what the sport is about. When a man can&#39;t lift his gloves anymore and is just a punching bag for the opponent, it&#39;s time to end the fight, even if that man can still stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you reacting like this to a well made breakdown of the gif?</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd how you are trying to dismiss the other side&#39;s argument by calling them a troll. I hope this is not common for you.</p>

<p>(and yes, McGregor was completely gassed by then, legs shaking. And no, he did not get hit 8 times in the head during the last round, he was still actively dodging.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not a &quot;well made&quot; breakdown at all, and the claim that McGregor was &quot;dodging as well as any fighter&quot; at the end is just laughable, it&#39;s so absurd and wrong that it barely merits a response.</p>

<p>Any one can look at the video and see McG with his gloves down, wobbling around, getting punched in the face over and over again, stumbling into the ropes.</p>

<p>If someone tells me that the sky isn&#39;t blue and shows me a picture of a blue sky, am I supposed to engage in a serious debate with that person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The breakdown he made is accurate. Most of Mayweather&#39;s strikes did not connect. Do you disagree with this? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with his assessment of: &quot;dodging as well as any fighter&quot;. It was very obvious from round 9 on that McGregor was completely exhausted, but I&#39;d say it was stopped bit too early</p>

<p>Have you seen sumo wrestling? Another fixed sport that is way more physical. This fight was fixed from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Yep, pretty much this. Connor&#39;s bet was to get a lucky KO early, but Floyd was too good for that and managed to pull his usual routine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>complete fix.</p>

<p>the fight was put on by MAYWEATHER PRODUCTIONS.</p>

<p>Prior to this fight Mayweather was going down in history as a complete jackass because HE IS.  This fight was nothing more than a paycheck for both fighters and also to make the Mayweather name go down in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely fixed. 1st off McGregor won at least  6 rounds by the midpoint, that&#39;s being frugal. The ref called the fight long before it should&#39;ve, at the very least give him a 10 count. He&#39;s recovered in far worse situations in UFC. It was a quick grab to end the fight when the opportunity presents itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Mayweather when he said that his plan was to tire Mc out. However, I believe Las Vegas used the ref to watch the fight in the early rounds. Mayweather had this habit of turning around in the fight that I found interesting because in boxing turning around isn&#39;t a way to protect yourself, however, the ref acted like it was ok and would stop the fight for Mayweather instead of deducting point from him. The ref also pulled Mc off May when May was in trouble a few times and the ref ignored some bs Mayweather did. Mayweather won the fight but he barely won overall until the late rounds when Mc was gassed. </p>
