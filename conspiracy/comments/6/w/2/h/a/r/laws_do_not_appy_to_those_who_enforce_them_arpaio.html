       So just to confirm, when he mishandled a rape case and the city had to pay out a 3.5 million dollar settlement... that's part of his job? Look at how many times the word settlement appears on wikipedia... all of that was part of his job?

       I was born in 1967. Hillary Clinton was a bad candidate, likely involved in a lot of criminal activity. Even people who supported her could admit she was flawed. Even wildly popular presidents like JFK and Reagan can be criticized without their supporters falling into apoplectic fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a silver spoon narcissistic who's bankrupted multiple businesses and can't string together a simple sentence is suddenly a 'God Emperor'. A thrice married, admitted adulteror who builds gold monuments to himself is embraced by the Christian right. There's something behind this.

       This I can get behind.  I'm not one who admits Clinton was a great candidate, but much of the shit on her was years of slander by political rivals.  Started with her husband and migrated to her after he served his terms.  I'm from New York and watched it get dirty during her Senate runs here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to think that because she's not the best, somehow Donald J Trump is the best president ever?  Come on.  If she was bad, he's a nightmare.

       Exactly. No one is going to become president unless they've been vetted and approved by TPTB. No one wants to admit that they unknowingly carried water for the prison industrial complex to prop up this freakshow of an administration. He's no outsider and he never was.

       I get that people can have stupid opinions, but at least get your basic, grade-school level civics right. The 14th Amendment applies the Constitution to "to any person within its [the United States'] jurisdiction." And there's an unbroken chain of Supreme Court precedent, beginning with Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1896) that affirms this basic fact.

       Wasn't even that hard, this is less than a month and I found some good ones.  My favorite is the one where you accuse normal people of shouting in traffic that they want to murder whole groups of people like that's a normal behavior.  You've clearly done this, no?  You get mad and want to murder the entire race of the person who you feel wronged you?  You know what that behavior is, my dude?  Racism.

       Depending on how the PDF was produced it could very well have layers. I'm not sure what you mean by ""Scanned" images are never in Photoshop format", that doesn't really make sense, PDFs can't contain images in photoshop format, literally impossible back then and I'm pretty sure it's still that way, they embed images in their own format. Not only that, but there was a question as to what PDF they were even examining. There was literally no chain of custody, and they were most likely not using the original PDF that was sent.

       Either that, or... there happened to be some ignorant people who initially upvoted your comment, and along came some rational people who downvoted it. The claim that forensic analysts could prove that his birth certificate was fake based on metadata and oddities in a PDF is laughable, and it banks on people who don't know how the technology works to buy into a vague and baseless accusation.

       Anyone could download the PDF that Obama put on Whitehouse.gov.  It contained an image in PSD(Photoshop) format.  We know it was in PSD format because anyone with Illustrator could right-click on the image and convert it to RAW.  Which allows you to see the original  PSD image with 2 layers.  It's impossible that it was truly a scanned birth-certificate and then converted to PDF if it had multiple layers.

       Again, literally impossible. Images in PDFs are (at least back then, probably still true) embedded in a proprietary format.

       I'm not a photosohop expert, i only know about PDFs. But i can safely say that this is bullshit, again because images in PDFs are embedded and can't be reverted back to whatever format they originally came from. I'm going to assume that you can convert any image to raw from photoshop, since it's photo software.

       Nope, there were plenty of PDF printers and converters back then that would keep layers intact.

       I got through about 2 minutes of the guy pointing out some oddities that all PDFs and scanned electronic documents of any kind would have, again depending on the software used to produce the PDF. I'm not going to go through the whole thing, it doesn't seem to really have anything to do with photoshop specifically, he's pointing out oddities with PDFs that can be found using a lot of different software. But if you want to ask a specific question please feel free to do so.

       You're actually right. I was thinking of the first claim. This press conference is "hey, some stuff looks like the same on 2 documents produced 2 weeks apart by a bureaucratic office". Well then... i'm convinced.

       I love comments like that. It's so obvious. They're so concerned with "making sure the big picture stays how we like it!" that they forget that people are pixels in that big picture, and if you go around deleting the ones you don't like, and changing others to ones that don't fit, your "big picture" is going to be either too dark, incomprehensible, or obviously faked. Stay strong, dude. Remember, we do what we do for free. Your opinion was valuable before, but now they have to
       <em>
        pay

       to decry it? Delicious, I think.

       Our "law and order" president just pardoned a man who has been convicted of and admittedly violating the constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and court injunctions against him.

       Sherrif Joe ignored rampant sexual assaults,

        rapes of children and pregnent women

       This is factually a bad move. The top comment you hijacked lists the facts. Joe is bad. His tactics were bad. Trying to get rid of illegals is not an excuse to ignore rape and other horrible crimes.

       I believe he's referring to the trump being a racist "jab". Wanting to deport illegal immigrants is not racist, and not reporting/prosecuting sex criminals is wrong no matter who the victims are.

       This thread is literally about Trump pardoning a verified racist who violated the constitutional rights of minorities and you still go with the weak "muh deporting illegals is not racist" excuse? No, indeed, wanting to deport illegal immigrants is not racist. Defending white supremacists, calling Mexicans violent rapists, pardoning racist sherrifs however calls into question these "totally not racist" motivations for deporting illegals. That's what the OP was referring to, and it's an excellent point. Trump is "totally not racist" and "totally just wants to deport illegal immigrants". It just so happens that coincidentally he also says racist things, defends racists and pardons racist. Really makes you think huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think people say Trump is racist because he "just wants to deport illegals" you haven't been paying attention. He
       <em>
        literally just pardoned one of the most racist scumbags in the entire country
       </em>
       . That's why people think he's racist.

       It's not unique to Trump, "law and order" has been a meaningless catchphrase that appeals to scared white people for decades now.

       Even now, when militarization of the police is an oft-discussed issue, when America locks up more people than any country on earth (and those people are disprortionately minorities), when violent crime has been on a downward trend for years, when private prisons are making bank off contracts that demand a minimum amount of occupied beds, calls for law and order still work on naive people frightened by a boogeyman.

       I have yet to be convinced racial profiling is unreasonable when you're looking for illegal immigrants 150 miles from the Mexican border.

       Checking ID's and status on, say, Asian people, would be a complete waste of everyone's time in that locale.

       Because America is based on individual rights, and individuals aren't responsible for the crimes other people commit, even if they share the same skin tone.  There are around 300,000 illegal immigrants in Arizona.  There are over 2 million legal Hispanic, Native American or other similar looking people in Arizona.  Which means the vast majority of the time, the individual is just a normal, law abiding person getting stopped repeatedly because of the color of their skin.  If a white person can walk down the street unmolested, while the exact same person gets stopped simply because they have brown skin,  a violation of that minority's 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law regardless of race.

       You know the Sheriff had 2 different law enforcement forensic document analysis's done proving it was completely fake right? And not even a good fake. These are the people who's testimony is used in court trials. It doesn't get any more verified as fake as the Sheriff has proven.

       Do you mean PDF layers. There are lot's of reasons a PDF produced by a scan would contain layers, depending on the software used to create it. They use layers for zoning of tables and images, they use it for annotations, they use it to make OCRing easier (converting images of text to searchable text) so that the software is only OCRing text and not images.

       I got through about 2 minutes of the guy pointing out some oddities that all PDFs and scanned electronic documents of any kind would have, again depending on the software used to produce the PDF. I'm not going to go through the whole thing, it doesn't seem to really have anything to do with photoshop specifically, he's pointing out oddities with PDFs that can be found using a lot of different software. But if you want to ask a specific question please feel free to do so.

       The graphic design software(AKA Illustrator) was used to create the Whitehouse.gov PDF file.   So it's pretty important to examine this PDF.

       No, it wasn't. The PDF was created by some mac OS software called PDF quartz. Furthermore, it wouldn't have really mattered if it was created by Illustrator. Debunking your bs requires knowledge about PDF documents and what they can and can't do, not graphic design software that is unrelated to an electronic document format that was created by the same company.

       I'll give you one better. I'll show you how to check for yourself. Find the original PDF that was released, and open it with acrobat or acrobat reader (free version). Then fread these instructions in the "To check how the file was created" section at the top.

       The press video is a joke, it's a baseless reenactment of what someone can do with a PDF without any actual proof of what happened. It was a tutorial for idiots on a couple of cool tricks with PDFs and adobe software, nothing more.

       If you want a better reply you'll have to come up with something better than asking me to look at a press conference that I've seen and debunked before. That purpose of that press release was to get people like you who don't know a thing about the technology they were using to buy into their presentation, and it wasn't anything close to actual evidence. I have better replies in this thread that are more related to that technology in this thread, but those were direct replies to ignorant statements about PDF documents. If you would like to ask a more specific question, please feel free to do so.

       I have no idea what their intelligence level was, nor have a logical way to compare it to mine. You must have missed it, so I'll reiterate, they put on a weak presentation and hoped to get ignorant people to buy it. You could have ended the conversation a while ago, because you were done way before now.

       In this context, the burden of proof was on those who claimed the birth certificate was fake. They didn't do that or anything close. What they did was put on a weak presentation during a press conference by moving objects around in a PDF and pointing out some oddities that most all PDFs have, depending on how the PDF was produced. PDF files can't be forensically analyzed by the methods they were using, and I challenge you to find me one case where their process was used and not laughed out of court.

       You know I usually wouldn't even bother responding to someone who likes to mix their conspiracies like a nice convenient cocktail. But I think I can safely assume that you deny the thousands of experts who debunk all of the WTC conspiracy theories, but for some reason you're completely willing to buy the analysis by a whopping 2 experts that Arpaio found to help his case.

       It's used to say something or someone is Jewish, because it's a taboo to mention their crimes, and is a crime itself in many western nations. It sucks that it has to be this way, but there have been many cases of such things in censored cultures throughout history. Once, Wagner wrote a piece about the pain of his people, and because he captured it so well, and the people weren't allowed to express it at all, it's said that the audiences who first heard it openly wept when they realized that it was safe to feel what they were feeling, and that they all felt it together to a one. I don't think we're quite to that point, yet, but I think we're headed there, and the brackets are just a cobblestone along that path.

       You literally cannot defend anything on its own merits. Your only defense is "but what about this other Democrat". That's how flimsy and shallow your beliefs system is. It's sad.

       This may be true and if so, he should be charged and prosecuted for this. However, he wasn't and that's not what he was pardoned of, the circumstances of the contempt of court charge laid upon him was a blatant political move against current immigration law. Arguing that the law should be changed, everyone agrees with (though they disagree on whether it should be loosened or tightened), but targeting law enforcement officers for law maker's decisions is a bad road to travel down.

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the problem that he was racially profiling Latinos - pulling them over to search on the basis of nothing more than their race? In Arizona, that means that practically half the population could be pulled over and searched without cause (or rather, with race as the cause), which seems... a little unsound, legally speaking.
      </p>

       He was told to stop it, and continued, and was then found in contempt of court.

       The order was for him to implement body cams and additional training to his officers, which he did. The judge should have held another hearing and ordered further measures be taken, instead it was an arbitrary "you did what I told you, but the problem hasn't been fixed, so your now in contempt". The objective measures of the order were met and the result wasn't satisfactory - new measures should have been implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I would have ordered an outside team to evaluate and implement new disciplinary policies or reviewed them and ordered changes to them. The alternative option is that the judge should have sent a recall petition to the AZ state legislature; and would have plenty of ground to; as although the objective goals of the order were met, the ability for the department to successfully change its culture could now only be done under new leadership.

       Arpaio committed a crime, contempt of court, and was convicted.

       Why, other than for pure political purpose, does the POTUS excuse him from his crimes?

       It's an affront to justice, and a demonstration that laws are only meant for some - not the powerful or politically connected.

       Seems extremely anti-American to me, especially given the circumstances of this case. Its a minor thing, but an enormously symbolic gesture. A big fuck you to justice.

       You're right. However the pardon is most often used in a very different context, and under different circumstances. That's an important nuance to this situation.

       It's fair to be cynical about the justice system in the US, it certainly isn't perfect. However, we are a nation founded on laws and of equality where no person is supposed to have special privilege in terms of law over any another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite it's flaws it can work. It can even convict a powerful sheriff when he thumbs his nose at the law (and of you follow Arpaio you'll see that's exactly what he did - he felt he was above the law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The justice system, slow as it was, found him guilty. His sentence wasn't severe - six months tops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does POTUS need to intervene? Was he more privvy to the situation and the law than the judge? Or, was there some ulterior motive on the part of the POTUS?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems pretty obvious that POTUS had an ulterior motive in this case, and as such he said a big f-u to justice.

       No. But in this case, they were. He admitted violating court orders, and they used that as evidence. When the man confessed to his own crimes, that's him thinking he's above the law.

       You can't just say "look into it" without any further explanation. Arpaio was racially profiling. Courts told him to stop. He continued racially profiling, and admitted to it. Was found in contempt of court. Did I miss something?

       haha, I'm not even one of them, but there's a good 60% of the population that would blow your mind. You should get out more! Take in some sights, learn some local culture, get a feel for the opinions of the people. It's way fun.

       Long time Maricopa County resident (and Trump voter) here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Joe is not well liked here. The only reason he stayed in office for so long is because we have a disproportionate population of elderly, conservative retirees who voted for him election after election because "muh Tough on Crime!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast, vast majority of people aged 60 or younger have been trying to vote that assclown out for a very, very long time, largely because the way he ran his prisons was inhumane. Tent cities - outdoor housing for inmates in 120 degree heat, pink underwear, feeding them rotten food --- how does any of that make them better people once they are released from prison? It doesn't. It just mentally fucks them up. And, once they are released, who has to deal with them? Sheriff Joe living in his swanky digs in North Scottsdale? Heck no! It's the average citizen living in one of the many, many shitty suburbs that got to deal with those damaged souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe was tough on illegal immigrants. But, we don't actually dislike illegal immigrants her in Phoenix. Sorry to say, but the illegal immigrants are the landscapers, nannies, cafeteria workers, janitors, and all other underpaid hard laborers. They are generally dirt poor, family oriented, damn friendly, and work their asses off without complaining for shit wages. They are our neighbors and friends. The way Arpaio treated brown people in this county was downright shitty. My brother in law is Guatemalan, my FIL Portugese, both legal, tax paying citizens for the past 20+ years. I have literally lost count of how many times they have both been pulled over for doing nothing other than "driving while brown".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, those of us living in Maricopa County have no love for Sheriff Joe. It's the alt right and conservative media that sing his praises. But they don't live here, and they don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had my druthers, Sheriff Joe would be spending his summer living in his tent city, wearing pink underwear, eating a rotten baloney sandwich on moldy bread and digging ditches on the chain gang in 120 degree heat, just like he's made tens of thousands of inmates do.
Screw Arpaio, and screw Trump for pardoning him.

       If the allegations against Arpaio are true, then this is terrible news. I honestly don't know much about Arpaio and the strength of the allegations, but what I do know is that people with power (apparently even those with a little bit of power like him) tend to get lesser punishments compared to the general public.

       <p>
        In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, [who was the U.S. attorney general under Obama], seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in [when deciding whether to prosecute bankers for the 2008 financial crisis]. “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute — if we do bring a criminal charge — it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” -

       Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To be clear, the decision of whether to indict a corporation, defer prosecution, or decline altogether is not one that I, or anyone in the Criminal Division, take lightly.  We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs, and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating for their client.  In my conference room, over the years, I have heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict, that innocent employees could lose their jobs, that entire industries may be affected, and even that global markets will feel the effects.  Sometimes – though, let me stress, not always – these presentations are compelling.  In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders, just as we must take into account the nature of the crimes committed and the pervasiveness of the misconduct.  I personally feel that it’s my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation.  In large multi-national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake.  And, in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor.  Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement. -

       Except every time you people make this statement it gets up voted, every single time. So no, that is proof it isn't. Maybe if you all didn't upvote each others's anti t_d comments every time it might be believable, but when every single thread has "this is t_d", it is clearly not "t_d".

       It's pretty interesting how a bunch of different accounts all parrot the same talking point about how Arpaio has supposedly proven Obama's birth certificate to be a fake. I'm sure we'll see this undeniable proof real soon though, just like the incredible finds by the researchers sent by Donald in Hawaii.

       Your proof is some guy who has no idea what he's talking about. I mean, at several points he's unable to even figure out how illustator works.
      </p>
      <p>
       He rants about the background being erased behind the text like that means something. It's a scanner, not some sort of magic x-ray machine. How the hell would it see the background behind ink? That makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And apparently he's never heard of OCR before. It's this wonderful software that comes can look at features on a page and determine if they're actual characters. To test my theory, I just took a total original document off my desk, scanned it with my office scanner as a PDF, and opened it in illustator. Look what happens: imgur.com/a/oobE3
      </p>
      <p>
       Random layers! And while I'm not going to show you the document because it has personal info, if I click the layer second from bottom... All the text dissappears!
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, if that's your indisputable proof, you're the sucker that you're claiming everyone else to be.

       IIRC, there are some stamps, typewritten letters, and signatures on his birth certificate that are identical to ones found on other birth certificates made near the time of his birth.

       For example, the pressure patterns on the stamps and the direction they were pressed across the forms are identical. The typewriter letters and signatures are also exact copies.

       So you're telling me that an employee at a bureaucratic office that repeats menial and tedious tasks happened to place some stamps in identical places from 2 separate documents over a 2 week period? I'm shocked.

       The evidence is actually a bit more damning than that. The birth certificates were not stamped in identical places; the marks of the stamps were identical... Open your mind, relax your biases a bit (no offense), and check out the evidence in the video. I don't know why you're trashing it without watching it. It's long, but there's probably a summary at the end.

       I was very anti-fake birth certificate before I watched it. There was just no proof for the theory; it was all speculation. But this video left me with doubts. It might actually be true...

       Maybe you should open your mind and realize that Arpaio only held this press conference as a last stand last year because by then he had already been caught for at least 5 years of shit.

       I watched part of it, it's a joke. If it was presented to a Jury they'd be hoping that the jury is either really biased, or that the other side wouldn't find examples of the same thing in other bureaucratic offices.

       Regarding the stamps - they are not the only evidence presented. There is also the typewritten letters and signatures (maybe something else, I don't remember). Taken together, the case for the birth certificate being a forgery starts to show itself as something deserving of serious consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not decided one way or another. This evidence has made me drop my strong held idea that 'this was a republican witch hunt' with no evidence.

       Almost everyone on that list only had probation by the way. So the the pardons were mostly for show. and if you actually look at the list the VAST majority were pardoned AFTER they served their sentence.

      <p>
       Also you don't think it odd that he pardons this guy at this time, when the country has THIS divide? You don't think that's fucking weird at all? Then you're fully fucking stupid

       Funnily enough, while crime over all Arizona went down during that time, his county saw the
       <em>

       decrease in violent crime out of the whole state. Which is kind of the opposite of what you said.

       A conspiracy among criminals to not police their own? I'm not sure it's worth asking if you understand how stupid you sound. The job of police is to enforce the laws. Criminals are not responsible for enforcing the laws.  Unless you want to consider the police criminals. I'll hear that out.

       Not OP, but I assume he means that more people agree Sheriff Joe is a piece of shit that shouldn't be pardoned than think this pardon is a "victory".

       The other explanation is that all of these comments saying "yeah that guy was scum and here's a list of scummy things he's done" are some of the more advanced AI in use by the Shill Gods, but when I hear hoofbeats, I think horses, not zebras.

       Oh no, I wouldn't argue that at all. Whether the majority is right is up for debate; I was just saying it's more likely that more people think that than it is that everybody in the comments saying so is paid to do so.

       Oh, I disagree. This is a very politically motivated stance to take, with a great amount to be lost if the conversation were to be allowed to take place organically, and that shilling is a very prominent feature of 2017 is pretty hard to deny.

       But you're coming into it with the assumption that the conversation
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       taking place organically. Yes, saying that Joe Arpaio is a piece of shit is a very politically motivated stance to take, particularly since Trump just pardoned him. Your argument for why it's not organic, though, seems to be "there are more comments and upvotes for the 'Joe Arpaio is a piece of shit' side". And... wouldn't that be exactly what an organic conversation would look like, where more people just think that Joe Arpaio is a piece of shit? Especially on liberal-majority reddit? Even more especially in a conspiracy sub that hates government officials abusing power?

       Long time Maricopa County resident (and Trump voter) here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Joe is not well liked here. The only reason he stayed in office for so long is because we have a disproportionate population of elderly, conservative retirees who voted for him election after election because "muh Tough on Crime!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast, vast majority of people aged 60 or younger have been trying to vote that assclown out for a very, very long time, largely because the way he ran his prisons was inhumane. Tent cities - outdoor housing for inmates in 120 degree heat, pink underwear, feeding them rotten food --- how does any of that make them better people once they are released from prison? It doesn't. It just mentally fucks them up. And, once they are released, who has to deal with them? Sheriff Joe living in his swanky digs in North Scottsdale? Heck no! It's the average citizen livingbin one of the many, many shitty suburbs that got to deal with those damaged souls.
      </p>

       Joe was tough on illegal immigrants. But, we don't actually dislike illegal immigrants her in Phoenix. Sorry to say, but the illegal immigrants are the landscapers, nannies, cafeteria workers, janitors, and all other underpaid hard laborers. They are generally dirt poor, family oriented, and work their asses off without complaining for shit wages. They are our neighbors and friends. The way Arpaio treated brown people in this county was downright shitty. My brother in law is Guatemalan, my FIL Portugese, both legal, tax paying citizens for the past 20+ years. I have literally lost count of how many times they have both been pulled over for doing nothing other than "driving while brown".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, those of us living in Maricopa County have no love for Sheriff Joe. It's the alt right and conservative media that sing his praises. But they don't live here, and they don't know.

       Thanks for identifying yourself as a troll by reflexively screaming Obama or Clinton any time someone mentions anything you don't like. Get back to me when you find out how many sheriffs Obama pardoned, sheriffs who violated the Constitution to fight a "war on drugs".

       So just to confirm, when he mishandled a rape case and the city had to pay out a 3.5 million dollar settlement... that's part of his job? Look at how many times the word settlement appears on wikipedia... all of that was part of his job?

       For example, the pressure patterns on the stamps and the direction they were pressed across the forms are identical. The typewriter letters and signatures are also exact copies.
