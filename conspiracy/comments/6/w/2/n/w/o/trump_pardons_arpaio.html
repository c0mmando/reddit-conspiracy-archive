<p>... huh. Over 500%. Wow. </p>

<p>In his defense, I&#39;m quite sure he didn&#39;t know that the fake infographic he retweeted was made by an actual neo-Nazi with a swastika for a profile pic and everything. So he&#39;s just a racist, not a full-on Nazi like some people claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... yes, he absolutely did. The infographic he retweeted claimed that blacks were responsible for <em>8 out of 10</em> white murders, which, again, is a figure that exaggerated the true number by 500%. The bureau said infographic &quot;cited&quot; is non-existent. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of it. Now are you going to claim the stats are accurate, so I have to link to the <em>actual</em> records from the FBI?</p>

<p>If Manning is a hero, so are the hackers who leaked the DNC emails. Nothing of importance was learned from the Manning leaks in regards to heroism or helping the situation. Arguably it made things worse. Trade knowledge about abuses in Iraq for the Arab Spring and years of more terror worse than anything we did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people liked him in Arizona. I wasn&#39;t a fan of all his policies but he did have some I liked. Then he started bringing up new evidence of Obama&#39;s birth certificate being fake and they took him down through the legal system, not with a vote.</p>

<p>If you noticed, the MSM never really goes after Trump for being a &quot;birthed&quot; that much anymore. Maybe a reminder here and there while they tell you how crazy that conspiracy theory is, it&#39;s rarely brought up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from a 2010 deposition in the case. </p>

<p>Question: Do you think it&#39;s racial profiling if your deputies look for Latinos with respect to immigration violations, given the fact that the majority of illegal immigrants in Arizona are Latinos?</p>

<p>Arpaio: No.</p>

<p>So... that&#39;s racial profiling. Argue as much as you like about whether we <em>should</em> have racial profiling, but it&#39;s cut-and-dry racial profiling. Arpaio doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s racial profiling, but him saying no to that seems like pretty cut-and-dry proof. </p>

<p>And you can think what you want. I was a journalism major, and I do freelance stuff with visual design. I&#39;m not very <em>good</em> at it - I do more things like emblems and stuff than anything you&#39;d find in r/photoshopbattles - but still. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Generally speaking, <em>at its worst</em>&quot; did precede that example. My point was that racial profiling can be entirely devoid of racism, and I don&#39;t understand why it seems like you&#39;re trying to defend Arpaio of racism when I&#39;m not accusing him of that. Pulling over Latinos because they&#39;re more likely to be illegal immigrants doesn&#39;t mean you hate Latinos, or think Latinos are lesser, or any of that. It just means you&#39;re racially profiling.</p>

<p>But even in those instances, it&#39;s still illegal. You&#39;re arguing that it shouldn&#39;t be, and in certain cases I&#39;d agree, but Arpaio clearly broke the law. Was it an unjust law that unfairly limits the police? Maybe! Did he break it? Definitely!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s refreshing to see somebody say they voted for Trump but disagree with one of his actions. That&#39;s a healthy approach, I&#39;m from an EU country where there is usually a much wider spectrum of voting choice. There is also plenty of criticism even of your choice of party that is in power. This all or nothing support/deflect/twist of your chosen candidate is too prevalent, from all sides in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo, it&#39;s about intellectual honesty. I voted for Trump because he seemed anti-establishment, and the establishment hated him. &#39;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&#39; Drain the swamp? Heck yes!! Plus, Hillary is just...evil. I honestly think we would already be embroiled in WWIII had she been elected.</p>

<p>But, now that Trump has been in office for almost 7 months, I have to judge him on his merits. I don&#39;t like much of anything he&#39;s done, and he seems to have no intention of &#39;draining the swamp&#39; judging by his cabinet choices. I don&#39;t see him as any different than any other politician at this point.</p>

<p>I think an important thing to consider is this: Many anti-establishment type citizens voted for Trump. His campaign promises and rhetoric gave them hope at a point in time when all hope for politics was lost, at a tine when it was difficult to have fairh that things might ever get better. Despite what the media says about job growth &amp; unemployment, the state of affairs of the average American has been in the shitter since the 08 housing crash. Things never got better, we just learned how to make due with less.</p>

<p>Admitting that Trump is not who he said he was means giving up hope - the <strong>hope</strong> that there can be a shift in the power dynamics in Washington DC, <strong>hope</strong> that the career politicians and crooks will be held accountable and stripped of their power, **hope that there might be some justice or equality for the working poor (which cobstitutes 40-60% of the population, in my estimation). </p>

<p>Giving up on Trump means relinquishing hope that shit will ever change, relinquishing hope that things will get better in the next 4 years for the acerage American. Those who still support Trump and refuse to see his faults are heavily vested in the hope that Trump will make things better. I understand why it is so hard to give up that hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The root problem is people thinking they can elect one person who will fix all their problems. This went for Obama as well. Unfortunately, you have to roll up your sleeves, spend some time informing yourself, and participate in government from the local level and up.</p>

<p>As the first rational Trump voter, I have run into, I am curious, how much did you look into Trump&#39;s past before voting?</p>

<p>My statement says nothing about Barry Bombs being better or worse than Trump. Though now that you bring it up, Trump&#39;s racist ass is about 1 zillion times worse. </p>
