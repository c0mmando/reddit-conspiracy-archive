<p><strong>T-Mobile &quot;Babysitter&quot; commercial features a sleeping/dead child inside a pizza box</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/If1irTx.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/If1irTx.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uk6pm/tmobile_babysitter_commercial_features_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uk6pm/tmobile_babysitter_commercial_features_a/</a></p>

<p>So the top comment is someone saying the child is moving but from what I remember of the video the child was not moving but it might have been a different version of the commercial where I first viewed it and that was just <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rfhDHhu.jpg">made private</a></p>

<p>And just recently T-Mobile has updated their &quot;Babysitting&quot; commercial on television to remove the shot of the child in the pizzabox and NOW it shows the child thrashing around on the ground in the background not once but twice in the commercial.</p>

<p>Was T-Mobile scared of something?...too close to home perhaps?...</p>

<p><strong>T-Mobile US sued in infant death case</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170512005916/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/11/tmobile_us_sued_infant_death/">https://web.archive.org/web/20170512005916/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/11/tmobile_us_sued_infant_death/</a></p>

<p>Now I will delve into reality manipulation a bit and as it resembles the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/christopherhudspeth/crazy-examples-of-the-mandela-effect-that-will-make-you-ques?utm_term=.daX88RaAK#.uayyyxewj">Mandala Effect</a> and with the T-Mobile Babysitting commercial and that I might never know if there was a version of the video with the not child moving in the background.  What I do remember is going over the video multiple times looking at the background and such and NEVER seeing the child move and I KNOW I also saved the video but now cant find the original.</p>

<p>The child &quot;sleeping&quot; pose even resembles Marty McFly&#39;s <a href="http://i.imgur.com/L2MXGEp.jpg">Back to the Future sleeping pose</a> and as you know he was able to manipulate reality by changing the past.</p>

<p>We know for a fact <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/23/reddit-ceo-apologizes-for-editing-comments-critical-of-him-following-pizzagate-ban/">Spez manipulated the past</a> and changed a reddit post to his liking.  And now the pizzagate.wiki was just removed like <a href="http://archive.is/f8Ucc">yesterday</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Admins are editing our posts guys. It&#39;s over.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ekt1o/admins_are_editing_our_posts_guys_its_over/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ekt1o/admins_are_editing_our_posts_guys_its_over/</a></p>

<p><strong>The Admins are suffering from low energy - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124014821/https://sli.mg/a/xj1P4C">have resorted to editing YOUR posts.</a> Sad!</strong></p>

<p>So what if {THEY} have admin/backend access to everything even our reality to change things and to hide evidence?</p>

<p>The closest I can describe what is goin on is from these video clips;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been wondering what the TPTB are using Trump to cover for, I think the Mandela Effect is a important part of it. It also seems odd to me that right when conspiracy could have been looking more into the Mandela Effect that it got slammed with tons of political trolling and shilling. </p>

<p>Also flat earth has been spreading quickly on YouTube with many trying to tie it in with every other Conspiracy. It&#39;s almost like the government pays them to sell this idea to people to make looking into any conspiracy look foolish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, flat earth is the result of intelligent citizens noticing the plethora of lies their government has been spoonfeeding them. These lies finally reached a critical mass and people stopped blindly believing indoctrinated education and instead started to learn by teaching themselves through observation based data collection. The result is finding many holes in modern science and math to the extent that its all just fake confusing bullshit aimed at dulling the mind to deter investigation into founding principles.</p>

<p>The result of all this is real scientist waking up and attempting to fire their own rockets into space (with cameras) and to no surprise they smacked the firmament.</p>

<p>Second. at the point you are saying it hits the dome the air speed indicator shows it still is moving upward.  Had it hit anything at that speed it would have exploded into little bits.</p>

<p>Most flat Earthers use the edited video that doesn&#39;t contain the air speed gauge.</p>

<p>What holes in math?</p>

<p>I am sorry but gravity is real, math works, the sun is fusion reactor, planets are real, the moon eclipsed the sun, and you can talk to the ISS and bounce radio signals off the moon.</p>

<p>GPS also works as they say, curvature is taken into account when needed, saying water doesn&#39;t curve isn&#39;t rational, and Jerain doesn&#39;t know what the hell he is talking about.  Neither does DITRH, Globebusters, Morgile, or any of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1984 by George Orwell is EXTREMELY relevant to what you are saying. If you haven&#39;t read it yet please do. The main character works at the &quot;Ministry of Truth&quot; and his job is to take old newspaper clippings etc, and modify them to reflect what the government want the people to believe. There are harsh consequences for anybody who questions the Ministry of Truth. Please do read it, or if not then at least read the plot summary on Wikipedia. It&#39;s a great summary.</p>

<p>Also I have witnessed what you are talking about first hand. There was a video around before Trump started running for office. I can&#39;t remember who was conducting the interview, however they ask Trump if he&#39;d ever consider running for office. He replies : &quot;No, but if I ever did I&#39;d run for the republican party because they&#39;re the dumbest group of voters. I could say anything and they&#39;d still vote for me.&quot; This video has been completely wiped from existence, however I, and 100&#39;s of others know we have seen it. If you search for it on Youtube now it doesn&#39;t exist, however in the comments of the videos that do show up you can see the huge amount of people that know it existed as I do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not pushing any political agenda here, I&#39;m British for one and Trump was a way better candidate than Hillary IMO, even though he did definitely say that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%. Like Pizzagate and Seth Rich. As soon as both started gaining ground, Snopes is there with the inevitable DEBUNKED status on both stories STRAIGHT AWAY. Like how is it debunked? Because Snopes says so. When everybody started researching these stories I had so many people on Facebook etc link to Snopes to <em>prove</em> that they were &quot;debunked&quot;. Like how the fuck do you even debunk an investigation. I don&#39;t know if either stories are true but still, they aren&#39;t debunked by any means. The worrying thing about Snopes is how blindly people just accept their version of events. I can see why it can be appealing to not have to do any research yourself and just go look at a big TRUE or FALSE on Snopes to tell you how to think, but fuck that am I right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you trying to prove? I&#39;ve seen the video. And I quote from the Snopes link you&#39;ve sent me :</p>

<p>&quot;Despite People‘s comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that quoted his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme.&quot;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist, just that they couldn&#39;t find it. It&#39;s been wiped from existence which is exactly what this whole thread is about... You are the embodiment of the negative things we were discussing above, if Snopes is a hard left leaning website then why do you trust anything they say at all?

    <div class="md"><p><strong>1984 Manipulation Quote</strong></p>

<p><em>And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed – if all records told the same tale – then the lie passed into history and became truth. &quot;Who controls the past,&quot; ran the Party slogan, &quot;controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&quot; And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. &quot;Reality control,&quot; they called it: in Newspeak, &quot;doublethink.&quot; (1.3.18)</em></p>

<p><em>Winston believes that as long as a person’s perception (or memory) of the truth can be externally verified, then even a lie can become truth. Such is the Party’s method of control.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can believe that digital revisionism is a real phenomenon.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is a classic example, but it at least maintains a change log so it&#39;s possible to see the history for a particular page. Technically there is nothing stopping Wikipedia&#39;s sysadmins from invisibly altering the entries in the change log, but I have seen no evidence they are doing that.</p>

<p>The &quot;Mandela Effect&quot;, on the other hand, is pure nonsense. How would one ever go about proving it exists? The underlying premise is that every instance of a particular detail somehow gets changed in the current timeline, leaving the only evidence for the original state tucked away in your memories.</p>

<p>That should be a huge red flag: human memory is atrocious at remembering specific details, and excellent at filling in blanks to make something internally consistent, regardless of whether those completions are true or not. Ask eyewitnesses to describe what they saw and you will always get some discrepancies.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Human memory cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>Honestly people know how memory works and most that believe the Mandela is based on something real know very well that Memory isn&#39;t %100. It&#39;s more than small spelling details or a logo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it common for people to think JFK had two-terms? I&#39;m not a US citizen so no particular opinion either way on that one.</p>

<p>My point is, there isn&#39;t a single example of ME a I&#39;ve seen that can&#39;t be attributed to misremembering, nor is it even possible to present an example because the theory itself is completely infalsifiable. It relies on all examples of that detail being changed in the timeline, so there can never be actual proof, unless you consider the phenomenon of collective misremembering.</p>

<p>Human brains all work in similar ways. It stands to reason that if one person misremembered a detail then lots of people (and especially lots of people raised in the same era, with the same sensory inputs) might end up misremembering the exact same thing.</p>

<p>Not that anyone currently that I know of believes he had two terms. Though about half of the people I run into remember him being in a 2 row 4 seat car when killed. </p>

<p>I have seen crap be one thing officially one day and be changed the next day with other people that don&#39;t believe in any conspiracy&#39;s be amazed.

<p>It&#39;s more than one detail to many people. People have been trying to save proof but only non exact copies can be saved. Again I get why your skeptical but I just thought I would point out there is more to the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, thanks for clarifying about JFK.</p>

<p>I see why the ME is appealing because we&#39;ve all had moments that fit the definition. The problem is that without an objective way to test if the theory is true, all we can do is speculate and find people who agree with a particular example. If we can find even one person who remembers it differently, that casts doubt on the validity of that consensus based proof.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the core problem with the Mandela Effect. If physical proof can ever be obtained then this proof, by definition, actually proves the Mandela Effect must be false because <em>that evidence should have changed too.</em></p>

<p>To misquote Douglas Adams:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; says --God-- <em>The Mandela Effect</em>, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic. &quot;Oh, that was easy,&quot; says Man.</p>
