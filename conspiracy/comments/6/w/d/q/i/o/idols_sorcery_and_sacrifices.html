       Eminem is a top satanic Illuminati idol and cult leader inside the United States. Eminem is trained in witchcraft and satanic mind control. Marshall Mathers' rap lyrics are geometrically designed in sync with the mainframe that the electronic grid is resonating into society. Eminem's songs are satanic mind control spells. This gives words and phrases more geometric structure and links them with their encoded subliminal messaging. Words and sounds like letters of the alphabet create vibrations and those vibrations have numeric values. The NSA database is like a giant central processing unit that controls the electronic grid and this includes modern electronics, electrical substations, telephone poles, transformers, and the USAF's HAARP. The NSA through the electronic grid resonates an artificial program into society and they call this program Zion. Through this artificial program they can link words with other words or symbols through numeric codes. This is how they are mind controlling society and individuals. Many members in the entertainment industry like rappers, musicians, and writers are trained in developing spells based on this artificial program they call Zion. The Church of Scientology is deeply involved in this and work closely with Silicon Valley which develops electronics and computer software. The Church of Scientology has a church in Silicon Valley.
      </p>

       Eminem is one of the most destructive mind controllers in society. His spells are designed to influence human sacrifice, spousal abuse, pedophilia and many disturbed behaviors in society and his disturbing lyrics are the evidence for this. Eminem made a song about a fictional fan that was obsessed with him who kills himself and his girlfriend while Eminem plays himself in the song presenting himself as if he is rational and normal. This is completely sociopathic, manipulative, and egotistical. Eminem is also propped up as a demonic cult leader within the secret societies including Wicca, Anonymous, and New Age cults and he uses signs and codes to communicate with them as well as using messengers through the Dark Web. The reason Eminem is important in the satanic community is because he has a massive following with tens of millions of fans. Eminem is also worth 190 million. Eminem's satanic cult is called Legion in reference to the legion of devils mentioned in the Bible. Marshall Mathers sacrificed his friend Proof who was shot and killed. Eminem made the music video called "Like Toy Soldiers" where his friend Proof gets shot and killed in the music video right before he was literally shot and killed. This is called lesser magic in Satanism. Eminem authorized and lead in the sacrifice of Brittany Murphy that was carried out by the satanic Hollywood cult. Brittany Murphy was in the movie 8 Mile with Eminem. Eminem is one example of a satanic idol and mind controller.

       Hollywood and their scientific electronic cult of sorcerers are a defense for the Black Nobility and royal families. The military and intelligence agencies oversee the Church of Scientology and Silicon Valley and have outsourced their persecution to Hollywood. Satanic idols manage and command secret societies which are spread through out society and they also carry out persecution, cyber stalking, and gang stalking for payment. Fully initiated members of secret societies are considered citizens of Zion.

       What is? I believe you are a Satanist coming in trying to make a defense with your vague accusation that has no substance to it. Nothing in your comment has anything to do with what I wrote. You call me a propagandist for exposing Satanism in Hollywood so I am calling you a Satanist. That has more backing than your false accusation.

       I don't care if you call me a satanist, because I know better. You however, think what you're saying is real, but it's not your fault you're so entrenched. We are what we consume, and you're obviously very interested  in sacrifices and other dark magics.

       No, it's easy to see the satanic symbolism within the music and Hollywood industries. It's everywhere. And if you don't believe it, that doesn't mean it isn't happening.

       Even if Satan isn't real, real people are worshipping him and those ideals and to them that makes it very much real!

       You make no sense. Humanity made up evil. We generally agree that certain things that are harmful to others, or excesses like the perils of greed over life are evil. But there's no great force of evil thriving off of sacrifices, and almost nobody believes that except some here and other locations. Licifarian satanists are just even crazier Christians. People don't belong to a satanic cult led by emenin, this is literal garbage, meant to mock this community, and engage religious zealots and schizophrenia prone introverts.

       As far as the name.. own your misdeeds, so you may learn from them. Even scriptures would back me up, regardless of how I feel about much of that text, there's some good lessons there.

       No, I don't sacrifice people. I also don't  listen to rap music, so there goes that, non do I engage in celebrity worship or television broadcasts.

       What? Dude, I don't usually pull the whole have you been taking your meds bit, but... have you been taking your meds? Where's your caretaker? Are you okay? I'm not trying to gaslight you, you come off as a classic schizophrenic without more context. ( and in context too, yikes)

       If they censor you, they likely only censor the things you say are true. Why is this post still up? Does that not prove it's true, or is this your super secret account on a super secret board that's totally not monitored?

       Magick is the manifestation of ones will into reality. Music is an excellent medium for Magick because of this. If you write a song, you create thoughts and emotions in peoples mind, inspirations, hopes, ideas, that may never have existed if you had not evoked them through your music. Music is one of the most powerful mediums for Magick and for accessing the human psyche, and as such can be used for good or evil. I had never read about the Eminem connection to satanism before, interesting stuff, good post.

       Sorcery is the unnatural manipulation of unseen forces. Good and Evil is what they call their artificial matrix or Zion. An illuminati upward pyramid of their so called good and an occult downward pyramid of evil. Both sides are evil, meddling, and unnatural.

       Interesting, are you using the term Sorcery in place of the term I used, Magick? Asking for clarification. I find much of what you have to say very interesting, but I have to disagree with you on this one point. I believe absolute good and evil exist outside of this power structure, as more than mere concepts of control from the elites. I believe any individual being can commit evil or good deeds without subscribing to their power matrix, as you call it. Because of this belief I think that Music can be used for good or bad purposes, but I think you and I might not be able to see eye to eye on this point because of our different interpretations.

       I rang the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother,
covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel.
I said, "I need a room so I can try to get some rest." 
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cess
and told me that's just for starters;
Satan will be in to see me later, 
to see if I'm interested in being partners.

       I think if you tried to work on your grammar and formatting you would have your ideas taken more seriously.  You are jumping from point to point too quickly without much explanation.  Try to summarize it into a few claims as possible and support then with evidence.  Interesting thoughts, even if disorganized.
