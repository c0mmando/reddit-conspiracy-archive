        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eminem is a top satanic Illuminati idol and cult leader inside the United States. Eminem is trained in witchcraft and satanic mind control. Marshall Mathers&#39; rap lyrics are geometrically designed in sync with the mainframe that the electronic grid is resonating into society. Eminem&#39;s songs are satanic mind control spells. This gives words and phrases more geometric structure and links them with their encoded subliminal messaging. Words and sounds like letters of the alphabet create vibrations and those vibrations have numeric values. The NSA database is like a giant central processing unit that controls the electronic grid and this includes modern electronics, electrical substations, telephone poles, transformers, and the USAF&#39;s HAARP. The NSA through the electronic grid resonates an artificial program into society and they call this program Zion. Through this artificial program they can link words with other words or symbols through numeric codes. This is how they are mind controlling society and individuals. Many members in the entertainment industry like rappers, musicians, and writers are trained in developing spells based on this artificial program they call Zion. The Church of Scientology is deeply involved in this and work closely with Silicon Valley which develops electronics and computer software. The Church of Scientology has a church in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Eminem is one of the most destructive mind controllers in society. His spells are designed to influence human sacrifice, spousal abuse, pedophilia and many disturbed behaviors in society and his disturbing lyrics are the evidence for this. Eminem made a song about a fictional fan that was obsessed with him who kills himself and his girlfriend while Eminem plays himself in the song presenting himself as if he is rational and normal. This is completely sociopathic, manipulative, and egotistical. Eminem is also propped up as a demonic cult leader within the secret societies including Wicca, Anonymous, and New Age cults and he uses signs and codes to communicate with them as well as using messengers through the Dark Web. The reason Eminem is important in the satanic community is because he has a massive following with tens of millions of fans. Eminem is also worth 190 million. Eminem&#39;s satanic cult is called Legion in reference to the legion of devils mentioned in the Bible. Marshall Mathers sacrificed his friend Proof who was shot and killed. Eminem made the music video called &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; where his friend Proof gets shot and killed in the music video right before he was literally shot and killed. This is called lesser magic in Satanism. Eminem authorized and lead in the sacrifice of Brittany Murphy that was carried out by the satanic Hollywood cult. Brittany Murphy was in the movie 8 Mile with Eminem. Eminem is one example of a satanic idol and mind controller.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood and their scientific electronic cult of sorcerers are a defense for the Black Nobility and royal families. The military and intelligence agencies oversee the Church of Scientology and Silicon Valley and have outsourced their persecution to Hollywood. Satanic idols manage and command secret societies which are spread through out society and they also carry out persecution, cyber stalking, and gang stalking for payment. Fully initiated members of secret societies are considered citizens of Zion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make no sense. Humanity made up evil. We generally agree that certain things that are harmful to others, or excesses like the perils of greed over life are evil. But there&#39;s no great force of evil thriving off of sacrifices, and almost nobody believes that except some here and other locations. Licifarian satanists are just even crazier Christians. People don&#39;t belong to a satanic cult led by emenin, this is literal garbage, meant to mock this community, and engage religious zealots and schizophrenia prone introverts. </p>

If you write a song, you create thoughts and emotions in peoples mind, inspirations, hopes, ideas, that may never have existed if you had not evoked them through your music.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, are you using the term Sorcery in place of the term I used, Magick? Asking for clarification. I find much of what you have to say very interesting, but I have to disagree with you on this one point. I believe absolute good and evil exist outside of this power structure, as more than mere concepts of control from the elites. I believe any individual being can commit evil or good deeds without subscribing to their power matrix, as you call it. Because of this belief I think that Music can be used for good or bad purposes, but I think you and I might not be able to see eye to eye on this point because of our different interpretations. </p>

covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel.
I said, &quot;I need a room so I can try to get some rest.&quot; 
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cess

Satan will be in to see me later,
