       The idea of a planet that comes every 3600 years beyond our solar system was originated from a guy, named Zacharia Sitchen. He has never disclosed any credentials or degrees on knowing Sumerian. In other words, people trusted him on blind faith alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now back when he was claiming these things, there were no other authorities on translating the Sumerian tablets. Since then, we have discovered a dictionary (another Sumerian tablet) that translates from Sumerian to Arcadian. Based off of this dictionary, we have came to light that Sitchen was very inaccurate in his interpretations. We have also learned that there were no mentions of Nibiru or idea of Gods being extraterrestrial for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the ancient astronaut theorists revolve their work around Sitchen. Even David Icke bases a lot of his work off of Sitchen. At this point I feel confident in suggesting these guys can be written off. Any doomsday prophecy regarding another planet can also be safely thrown out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend you guys all do your own research and help spread the word that there is no such thing as Nibiru in this subreddit and other places. Even sensationalists like David Icke or others who share Sitchen's views are very questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some resources to get you all started:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I wanted to throw it out there that I do believe in other beings, dimensional and extraterrestrial. But unfortunately I think there is a lot of disinformation in these kind of topics, thanks to guys like Sitchen.

       False. Nibru-ki is mentioned plenty of times. "Experts" officially translate it as a shrine, yet it is spoken contextually as a place or realm of the gods, where men of renown or Kings have come and gone from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "expert" translations are not 100% accurate. Neither were Stichens. He really mucked some things up but he was also on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very liberal use of interpretation in many of the records, "officially."

       I guess I should've been more clear that I meant no reference of 'planet Nibiru' in which has a 3600 year rotation claimed by Sitchen. As for the use of heaven, it is not clear if it really meant extraterrestrial as in another planet.  If you have any hard evidence suggesting so, I'd like to see them.

       In which case those from heaven would be "inter-dimensional" or inter-realm beings. That's the point.

       If something exists outside of earth they are then extra-terrestrial. Not really the cookie cut definition from space-alien movies but we are talking about intelligently parsing information, not adhering or manipulating analytics to match public belief systems/narratives.

       I feel like you're missing the point. You can argue the semantics all day and nobody will come top. The whole point of this article was to dismiss planet Nibiru as claimed by Sitchen, which sounds like you agree already.

       Yes, but Stitchin's work is about as reliable as the "experts". So while I would caution against taking his work literally or as
       <em>
        entirely accurate
       </em>
       , the same recommendation could be made with the official translations as well.

       No translation is perfect, but I am confident is saying Sitchen's work was a lot less reliable. Hell you even referenced an article that refuted Sitchen. As for translating Sumerian to Arcadian to English, well shit of course there will be semantic issues, but base meanings usually hold.

       Not really. For instance in Hebrew
       <em>
        Satan
       </em>
       is simply "adversary". Yet in English translations it gets translated as a identified being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sin, is also "to miss the mark". Yet it was translated into something entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the best example of something being skewed for political or religious agenda.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Another interesting translation for biblical texts is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsN8v8h7v4">
        Mauro Biglino's literal translations
       </a>
       . Though he may exist in some agenda, he worked for Vatican publisher until he began releasing his books.
      </p>
      <p>
       His literal translations suggest Elohim is plural. That 'ruach' or the breadth of Elohim, were a physical manifestation. That "an image of god" implied DNA engineering. That the actual verb for creation was never used in biblical text, but instead taking over something that pre-existed. Etc so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literal translations are always interesting because they remove added in interpretations and 'explanations' which are incredibly subjective.

       You should understand the context of things before blabber stuff out. As for the word 'sin,' it means miss the mark as in missing the standard of perfection established by God. As far as I am concerned, the way we interpret sin today is essentially the same in a holistic way. As for Satan, there is no one-in-all agreement as to what it means today in English. But I think most would agree that it is a title for someone who opposes God as an adversary. See?

       And what exactly about their gods? That they came from another planet and needed gold to repair their atmosphere? Ya OK, please give evidence that proves you can actually research and think on your own as opposed to blindly accept other people's premises.

       Have a little sympathy for Sitchen.  When he did his work, he was the first.  The Sumerians had previously been a myth, someone we had no confirmation of.  Then we got confirmation, and it was "impossible to translate" but Sitchen dove in anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're unreasonable if you expect perfection in that capacity.  And that being said, Sitchen's detractors have had decades to prove him "completely wrong" and not everything he produced was incorrect.  Yes he made some mistakes, but that's part of academia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt you've read Sitchen's work in enough detail to really comprehend it, but getting say 50% of the material correct is amazing in any new field, be it science or archaeology or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, even if you take away 100% of sitchen's translations, there are still things about Sumerian culture that do not add up unless you adopt part of Sitchen's views.  No matter what "current experts" in a dead language claim, Sitchen's hypothesis does an unparalleled job of explaining Sumerian origins and culture in a way that no modern researcher has yet matched.

       Sitchen misinterpreted the tablets materially to serve his own agenda. The tablets make no mention of planet nibiru nor did the gods came to mine gold to repair their atmosphere. He also makes a lot of downright mistranslations that kind of proves he didn't know much Sumerian.

       I don't think you've read his first book.  I'm not sure exactly what I believe about this whole subject, but the topic of gold and atmospheres is hardly mentioned.  The book is more about actual archaeology.

       Sorry but if you've never read the book I cannot take a this conversation seriously.  You've only read what detractors have to say, gotta read the source material itself to have a valid opinion.

       That actual historical Sumerian records and Sumerian "stories" line up exactly with what Sitchen's says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       Pantheon
The majority of Sumerian deities belonged to a classification called the Anunna (“[offspring] of An”), whereas seven deities, including Enlil and Inanna, belonged to a group of “underworld judges" known as the Anunnaki (“[offspring] of An” + Ki). During the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Sumerian pantheon was said to include sixty times sixty (3600) deities.[7]:182
      </p>
      <p>
       Primeval deities
Nammu was the primeval sea (Engur), who gave birth to An (heaven) and Ki (earth) and the first deities; she eventually became known as the goddess Tiamat. An was the ancient Sumerian god of the heavens. He was the ancestor of all the other major deities[11] and the original patron deity of Uruk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlil and his family
Enlil was the god of air, wind, and storm.[12]:108 He was the patron deity of the city of Nippur.[13]:58 Ninlil was an air goddess and Enlil's primary consort. She was one of the matron deities of Nippur; she was believed to reside in the same temple as Enlil.[14] Ninurta was the son of Enlil and Ninlil. He was worshipped as the god of war, agriculture, and one of the Sumerian wind gods. He was the patron deity of Girsu and one of the patron deities of Lagash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki and Ninhursag
Enki was god of freshwater, male fertility, and knowledge.[15]:75 His most important cult center was the E-abzu temple in the city of Eridu.[15]:75 He was the patron and creator of humanity[15]:75 and the sponsor of human culture.[15]:75 His primary consort was Ninhursag, the Sumerian goddess of the earth.[15]:140 Ninhursag was worshipped in the cities of Kesh and Adab.[15]:140
      </p>
      <p>
       Inanna
Ancient Akkadian cylinder seal depicting Inanna resting her foot on the back of a lion while Ninshubur stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334-2154 BC.[16]:92, 193
Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love, sexuality, prostitution, and war.[15]:109 She was the divine personification of the planet Venus, the morning and evening star.[15]:108-109 Her main cult center was the Eanna temple in Uruk, which had been originally dedicated to An. Deified kings may have re-enacted the marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi with priestesses.[15]:151, 157-158 Accounts of her parentage vary;[15]:108 in most myths, she is usually presented as the daughter of Nanna and Ningal,[16]:ix-xi, xvi but, in other stories, she is the daughter of Enki or An along with an unknown mother.[15]:108 The Sumerians had more myths about her than any other deity.[16]:xiii, xv[17]:101 Many of the myths involving her revolve around her attempts to usurp control of the other deities' domains.[18]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ereshkigal
Main article: Ereshkigal
Ereshkigal was the goddess of the Sumerian Underworld, which was known as Kur. She was Inanna's older sister.[19]
      </p>
      <p>
       Celestial deities
Utu was god of the sun, whose primary center of worship was the E-babbar temple[20] in Sippar. Nanna was god of the moon and of wisdom. He was the father of Utu and one of the patron deities of Ur.[21] He may have also been the father of Inanna and Ereshkigal. Ningal was the wife of Nanna,[22] as well as the mother of Utu, Inanna, and Ereshkigal.

      <p>
       It's interesting to note what the "underworld" is defined as. Since for heavenly beings their underworld would be Earth. And Earth's would be yet another. If you apply this to ancient myth it opens up a whole different context of interpretation.

       I don't blindly trust/believe NASA. What I'm saying is, they are finally admitting it,
       <em>
        because they have to
       </em>
       . The ancients knew about it, it was suppressed, and is now finally being uncovered by the public. They have to slowly roll it out to the wider public.

       They didn't confirm anything. They simply are suggesting that it might exist. I'd like to see a NASA article and not some sensationalist journalism that supports what you said.

       Okay let's backtrack a little bit. First you said NASA confirmed planet X. Now you say there's a soft disclosure.

       BTW that segment of the video is found on the NASA article I referenced. And the host blatantly says there's no proof of another planet. All he says is that there might be.

       I'm not lying. There is also a TED talk and others about the topic, as well. You'd know that if you'd watch the video. NASA is confirming it, albeit it slowly and methodically.

       i like how your attacking his sources as not credible.  it may be in youtube but the contents of the video are all MSM from different countries and a ted talk from a scientist.  what more evidence do you want? what kind of evidence would convince you?

       I don't need to watch a full hour-long video where they repeatedly say it isn't confirmed to know that it hasn't been confirmed ... keep trying to spread info which is directly contradicted by what you linked, it's hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't disclosure, it's you making assumptions and then spreading falsehoods.  The paper on the subject still literally says "could" and you're acting as if NASA confirmed the existence of Nibiru ...

       All I am suggesting is that Sitchen didn't know what he was talking about, which I standby 100%. And also why would you believe in Nibiru unless you have seen strong evidence for it? Strong claims need strong evidence. You give people on this subreddit a bad name.

       Well other scientists have found that there is most likely a large planet skewing orbits, your criticism of the word may is pretty dumb.  They use the word May because they haven't found but based on everything they know the explanation given is the only cause they can think of.  Many scientist and astronomers have said this though they don't say it is nibiru.  I am sure you didn't read the article, you probably just read the title.

       Well you see, since you are a complete moron, I will try to break it down.  They haven't found the planet that perturbs the orbits of planets like Neptune And beyond, but they know something is out there causing it.  The most likely case is a large planet.  In this article a planet that has been found with a elongated orbit of 1,100 years to highlight the fact that such orbits are possible.  Based on science It is likely that a large planet with an elongated orbit is effecting our solar system. I know you just want to disprove stitchen which is fine, but scientist discovered this before he even started his research.   Hopefully your not a complete idiot and you understand that scientists have been studying this for nearly a century

       I am neutral in this shit.
But disagree on your reply. You answer sounds like you don't agree with the dude so you need to answer him. But you have done in the wrong moment on the wrong topic because, if you read careful, cordeezy was talking about "evidences". And if you are honest for one second, the only world "may" prove it is not an evidence, fact. We just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about the original post were he want to end everything it makes sense, but here nope, because Cordezzy link doesn't prove anything.

Fine. He wrong. Then what?

No?
Just as long as we dont believe that guy?
Could you at least present an argument then of the text he mistranslated?
"Well this means 'sky people' so you can't say it's 'Gods'." --is a crap argument because the understanding is close enough to get the meaning...

       Well you live at an airbnb rental, that means you probably haven't made many other great decisions in your life.  It also indicates that your intelligence level is not that high not to mention the fact your being accused of abusing your roommates pet, so I wish I could have the minutes of my life I wasted on you back

       What's wrong with living at a AirBnB Rental when it is saving money? Also I find it sad that you have to resort to attacking people personally because you can't find substantial evidence to back your claims. All you're doing is "this article vaguely says a planet may exist, that's my evidence." Anyways you have proven that you are poor at tackling arguments. Let me know when you find something worth debating. Thanks

       The idea that cataclysms come around every few thousand years comes from far more sources then one historian. Mayans, Aztec, Native American Indians, Australian aboriginies, Pacific islanders, Hindus, Chinese, African and Arctic cultures all have legends and myths about cataclysmic events. There is astronomical evidence of something causing havoc in our solar system in the past.  NASA's position on a planet x has gone from its bullshit, to its probable, to its there we just can't see it. And that has only been in the last two decades.  I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the notion.

       OP has not even read any of Sitchen's work.  He is literally incapable of making any valid criticisms of it.

      <p>
       He is simply reposting what others have to say on the subject, but OP has no actual understanding of the subject himself because he has not done the necessary academic research.

       Nibiru is one name. The vatican calls it wormwood which is in the bible. They have an observatory on Mount Graham in Arizona looking for exoplanets, and I think they are watching it based on what I've heard. All major governments know about this, but it's highly classified. The navy is expecting to lose all their ports when this comes around due to the rising ocean levels as the poles shift. It's why the CIA moved to Colorado, and the new capital of the US will be Denver for continuity of government.

       If you really want to hear the truth about it, you need to watch John Moore with military intelligence connections. This was from a conference a few months ago.

       I don't need to watch a full hour-long video where they repeatedly say it isn't confirmed to know that it hasn't been confirmed ... keep trying to spread info which is directly contradicted by what you linked, it's hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't disclosure, it's you making assumptions and then spreading falsehoods.  The paper on the subject still literally says "could" and you're acting as if NASA confirmed the existence of Nibiru ...

       Because through other research you see that NASA has never stated that they are certain there is another planet.  There's other sources of information than Youtube videos you know?

       i like how your attacking his sources as not credible.  it may be in youtube but the contents of the video are all MSM from different countries and a ted talk from a scientist.  what more evidence do you want? what kind of evidence would convince you?
