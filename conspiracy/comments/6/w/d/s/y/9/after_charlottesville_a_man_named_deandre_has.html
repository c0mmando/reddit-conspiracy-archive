        The Daily Mail
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Deandre was just
       <em>
        peacefully
       </em>
       protesting White supremacists when he was ruthlessly attacked for
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       no reason. Well, that is certainly what the media is going for. They even charged an 18-year-old for assaulting Deandre. And he is quickly approaching 200k
       <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/i-was-beaten-by-white-supremacists">
        on his GoFundMe
       </a>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for everything wrong with the story. I can't link directly to Facebook, but at 1:03:28 in this Buzzfeed Livestream we see the beginning of the altercation that led to Deandre's wounds. /BuzzFeedNews/videos/1601555486532130/ is the link if you want to watch it yourself, or
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/heS8J">
        here are screenshots from the video
       </a>
       . So what happens? First let's figure out who the guy doing the smashing is. Black sweatshirt, blue jeans, long White socks.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZhZjXjh.jpg">
        Yep, it's Deandre.
       </a>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Deandre's group tries to steal an old man's flag.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the process they pull the old man into them, and then Deandre senselessly bashes him with a bat. Somebody else on the right smashes him with a bat, too, moments later.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The White protesting group pushes Deandre down and peppersprays him.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now this alone is damning evidence, because in the law you don't get to start an altercation and claim self-defense when you get your ass kicked in. But it's much worse than that. When Deandre is down
       <em>
        he is still wielding his bat
       </em>
       , His first instinct after being pushed down
       <a href="http://imgur.com/7Z7NRzq">
        is to run BACK INTO the altercation.
       </a>
       Not only did he start the initial altercation with assault, but he
       <em>
        continued
       </em>
       his presence into the altercation. The screenshot that the media has been using occurs only 10 seconds after Deandre started it, and only 5 seconds after he ran back into the crowd of people. In this amount of time it's impossible to determine what his intentions are and is clearly a case of self-defense.
       <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/crime/pd-former-mason-high-school-student-charged-in-charlottesville-attack">
        However, the guy doing the defending is currently being charged and ruined in the media.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, check out the background events
       <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=29c_1502587724">
        in this liveleak
       </a>
       . Deandre and his gang follow and harass the White supremacist protesters for a full 4 minutes. At 3:26 and at 4:11 they throw something at them. So much for being innocent, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just goes to show you just how much "journalism" our media does. Virtually none. All they care about is narrative. Hopefully we can get this info out and save an innocent guy from being jailed, and hopefully we can instead find charges for Deandre.

       There is no left-wing media that favors Democrats.

       The media outlets you're thinking of are CIA mouthpieces. And the CIA sure as hell isn't

       The mainstream media as a whole will support both left and/or right to propagate the current narrative to the masses.

      <p>
       The one person the western world's mainstream media does not support, at all, is the current president of the united states. Given that the former is always true, this is an interesting and, I think, unprecedented situation.

       Bull fucking shit. Fox News - the epitome of mainstream propaganda to distract people from reality -
       <em>
        literally talks directly to Trump

       because they know he's watching.

       Fascists and shills for the establishment/Trump talk shit about "mainstream media" while ignoring Rupert Murdoch's very real and very influential propaganda, which has moved the Overton Window so far right that now Nazis are literally murdering people at their hate marches. The
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       MSM propaganda and lies speaks directly to the fascist president. Propaganda and lies that they went to the Supreme Court to fight for the right to spread.

       Fox has probably shown the least contempt for Trump, but they are far from being his cheerleader.

       I don't have much time for anyone who actually believes fascists and nazis are a serious problem. You seem a little too invested in this latest media narrative to be able to comment objectively.

       Fox is not the epitome of mainstream propaganda lmao they are alone. There's 5 major liberals networks and 1 conservative one. I see people make your argument daily in this sub and you all seem to forget this vital detail. The epitome? What? Where the conservative snl? Where's the conservative Colbert? Where are the conservative colleges that brainwash their Ivy League students? Where the hell do you get your shitty opinions from?

       Fox is still a propaganda outlet. Don't forget Faux news during the whole Bush admin, rattling sabers and propagating the CIA pro-war / invasion narrative.

       People on this sub are so fucking stupid. Watching this sub go from anti-establishment to pro-establishment has truly been astonishing. This place use to reject the mainstream narratives and now most of you gobble it up and swallow it like a cheap hoe. The fact there's a vastly overwhelming, one sided liberal presence in the media means nothing to you all when it should be raising a huge red flag. CNN, MSNBC,ABC, NBC, CBS, SNL, and all of late night television all recite the same bullshit narrative and you guys actually believe it's genuine. Not only that you guys seem to think that Fox somehow has more influence than all those media outlets combined. The place has gone full retard. Like full out, lick a window and pull your pants down in public retarded.

       I'm arguing against this point, which you clearly made. Fox is a massive mainstream media outlet, and I believe they are controlled opposition to many of the other "liberal" outlets. Perhaps they are not the epitome, but they are up there with the rest.

       I don't get why you are so upset. Nothing in my comment suggest I subscribe to any mainstream narrative.

       It's telling that your first reaction to multiple white supremacists brutally and mercilessly beating a black man on the ground who cannot defend himself, all while another white supremacist in riot armor and armed with a gun scares off anyone who tries to stop it, is it frame it as white supremacists defending themselves.

       Sorry, Deandre, but if you want to be taken seriously you'll need to find a factual basis for disagreeing with the points I made above. White supremacists are entitled to the right to self-defense as much as any of us. The evidence points to the use of self-defense by white supremacists against Deandre's gang. The frame of the White supremacist hitting Deandre on the floor needs to be put in the context of the following actions: Deandre pummelling an innocent man in the head; Deandre being pushed to the ground -- bat in hand -- only to get up and further the altercation; Deandre getting pushed down again upon furthering the altercation, and hit until he longer posed a threat. I imagine it's the last part you have trouble with? If Deandre hadn't sought to continue the altercation then I don't think he should have been hit when trying to get up. However, because he did try to continue the altercation then it's reasonable to assume that upon getting up he would cause further violence.

       It's totally okay and reasonable to say both sides were wrong for being violent, and whoever instigated the first physical altercation (maybe even more video footage will debunk this guy's post and swing it back to the nazis) is ultimately responsible. It's okay to say that.

       They ain't saying both sides are bad. They're implying one side has been unfairly painted as Nazis and saying they were defending themselves by grabbing three people to beat a black teen with metal poles while a gunmen scares people off when they try to stop it.

       Being at a rally where everyone is waving Nazi flags and chanting blood and toil, makes you a white supremacist. The fact that the man himself was known to be a white supremacist by his classmates is only further proof. But naturally you all will say "oh but they're just lying about him!". As if people need to lie about a man who beat a black man at a Nazi rally being a white supremacist.

       They're also scumbags matching with nazis. There were literal Nazis there we have plenty of evidence to that fact. I personally would never march side by side with Klan members, others chanting blood and soil and Jews will not replace us.

       The media narrative about the event:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everyone there was a "white supremacist"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These "white supremacists" wanted violence
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their goal is to kill all non-whites
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But...they were vastly outnumbered by counter-protesters, were under physical attack
       <em>
        with weapons
       </em>
       by these "peaceful" protesters, the police were standing around allowing it to happen, they many of them were armed with guns while this was all going on...and yet, not a single shot was fired. Weird.

       "Now this alone is damning evidence, because in the law you don't get to start an altercation and claim self-defense when you get your ass kicked in."
Not entirely accurate. An accused can claim self defense at anytime to relieve legal culpability. And it does not have to be responsive, but can be preventive. Whether it is successful depends on many factors.
And you're conflating two different events. One event involves Deandre swinging the bat ("starts an altercation" in your words). The other involves the group that gangs up on Deandre to get revenge ("get you ass kicked in").

       Interesting. So everyone involved was a piece of shit.

       Of course you won't get this info out - the narrative is set.
      </p>

       Seeing these protests just makes me wonder why the police handling these is so incredibly incompetent and can't ever seem to separate the protesters from the counter-protesters to prevent this kind of shit to happen.

       I had not seen that, thanks. From the looks of it he pointed away so as to not hit anyone, meant to intimidate. Definitely not OK, that should be jail time IMO.

       It being a different angle doesn't mean much, all it means is he shot at his legs rather than the gun's head. Luckily the guy is too stupid to known how to operate his gun and didn't have one in the chamber.

       I watched a fourth time, in HD. My opinion has not changed. I don't care who he is, I'm looking at what I saw in the video. He was pointing directly at someone, lowered his gun, then raised at a lower angle away from the person he was initially aiming at but still in their general direction, then fired a shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be real, if this guy wanted to shoot that person then and there he easily could have. It's not like his gun has one bullet.

       In the case of Charlottesville, the police literally funneled the rally-goers into the mob of antifa, basically single file.  There are plenty of videos of it.  I believe the photo of the black dude spraying a flame thrower at them was at the narrow stairway where they were forced to exit the park.  It was such a clear set up, the cops basically made sure the two sides fought.

       Listen man, violence begets violence.
      </p>

       It's a cycle. This is why there are people like me explaining that this behavior will not end racism, in fact you're giving them steam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people on the right who support equal rights are trying to meet you guys in the middle, because this violence is sickening to them too. If you would actually speak with them instead of condemning them, you might get somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when you throw that line about everyone here upvoting this shit out of racism and downvoting you because of said racism. Do you actually legit believe that people don't agree with you because this entire board is invaded by white supremacists and they've turned the tune against your rock solid beliefs?

       I want to try and remember your comment, it's easy sometimes to get dragged into squabbles, feel satisfaction in point scoring or be so sure of your own side that you can't listen to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we all recognise that there are issues in the world and we want to make changes to them such that we all get a good life and no one is being sold short. I guess the problem is that we all interpret these issues in a different way but we always have the solution whereby we can communicate and understand each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than ever i am appreciating how valuable freedom of speech is, the ability to speak out about how you feel so that others may understand where you are and vice versa. Only then can we find a way to work together with others.

       Really? We know who they are and why? Are they all racist and want only white people to roam the Earth?  We are in 2017.  I'm sorry to tell you that this large group of racist white dudes who want to genocide everyone else doesn't exist. That picture looked like a brutal assault.  Is it related in some way? It doesn't seem like the situation described, so are you refuting the facts laid out by OP, or is this pic unrelated and a sad picture used as a weapon to hide behind claiming racism...

       And you are qualified to make that assessment how exactly?  Seems like an odd comment about the state of people's mind in a thread that has some substantive value.  So, yes, people are correct in questioning people like you, entirely.  Same goes for your parent comment.

       I look at a cloud or a tree or a person and I see a cloud or a tree or a person. I don't know what others see or why others don't see what I see. But when others insist that a cloud is a chemtrail, a tree is a terrorist, or a person is somehow sub-human, then clearly these are a people not interested in the truth.

       And what you said has nothing to do with conspiracy either, nor are you the person that I was talking to.  I really don't care what you HAVE to tell me.  I don't call clouds chemtrails (though my grandfather, an aviation engineer, told me about them around 1980, and he worked on the early Apollo missions), and I certainly don't call trees terrorists or people sub-human.  If anything, reptilians would be an advancement, not a step backwards, so sub-human would be inaccurate at best, IF you believe those types of things.  Whether I do or not believe anything or not doesn't matter, what matters is substantive truth.  And the search for it.  Good luck refuting that. And don't act like all known truths are overtly available to all of the general public either, or else a sub like this wouldn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in summation, go outside and look at some clouds or tree or people.   Don't waste time in a conspiracy sub if you fail to see value in it.

       Well, your attitude is certainly welcome to all here, as is your prose ("mistooken", really?).
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the "correlation" between truth and conspiracy?  You can tell me that after apologizing for helping me "save face" by cursing my feelings on my grandfather, who co-invented the very hydraulic trash trucks that make your very life oh so convenient.

       I do give a fuck about scientists, especially highly educated ones, that KNOW chemtrails are a real thing.  So, yes, I value his opinion far more than yours.

       I know you don't value my opinion. You don't need to tell me you don't value my opinion. If you were worried that you weren't getting the message across that you don't value my opinion, I can assure you that you've made clear the fact that you do not value my opinion. Am I being clear on how clear you are being in regards to the fact that you don't value my opinion?

       Well, you are certainly charmed enough to try and stifle discussion on a message board...innocuously, right?  I'm sure you believe in loads of conspiracies, just not any that anyone talks about, at least none of the plebes on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do your conspiracies end at topics like why Dragon Age was so glitchy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me one actual conspiracy you believe in and the specific evidence that makes you believe it.  I don't need a link or anything.  I just don't think you are honest, or have honest intentions for being on here in the first place.  That's the hallmark I have on here, honesty.

       I disagree.  It is not a conspiracy because it is not a secret.
That's like saying the drug war is a conspiracy.  If that is the depth of your conspiracy knowledge, then you really don't have much to contribute.

       A response like that is the most pathetic attempt at concern trolling ever conceived. Either provide some evidence for the equivalence you've suggested (like the person you're replying to) or stop spreading deceptive bullshit under the guise of pretending to ask questions.

       There are no two sides to white supremacist violence. There are racist cowards inflicting violence on usually unwitting and unsuspecting innocent victims, and there are Nazis murdering people, but there is no fucking equivalence between the consistency and violence of fascist hate crimes, and their victims.

       Who are these people trying to bring back concentration camps?  Antifa? Research the list and you'll find most of them are mischaracterized, lies, or just some random sick people (I.e., one sicko is a sicko, not coordinated effort).  The only organized group of people systematically attacking people is Antifa.  Sorry, but anger isn't going to change facts and making dishonest comments about concentration camps and mass executions is extremely offensive to Jews whose relatives actually survived the real horrors you describe (not the ones made up in imagination land).  These white supremacists are actually embarrassing, because they are not the ones who are the blatant criminals...how can Antifa be so sick that it actually makes the white supremacists look like the good guys?

       Even Spencer, who is supposedly so evil, has never called for minorities to be hurt, never called for violence, and he's never even suggested that qualified minorities be passed over for jobs.  He wants co-existence and he believes his group is better than my group.  I believe he's wrong, but that doesn't make us mortal enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racial bias is real and it can suck big time.  Going hysterical and shouting concentration camps is far worse than any racial bias I've seen in my life, because it shuts off critical thinking and conversation.  It's designed to hurt people with no justification whatsoever.

       No, it doesn't make racist violence ok.  Yes it shows that way more blacks are dying to general crime related violence than anything else.  When the number per month of Blacks killed by Nazis and other Trump supporters in a month reaches the number killed in an average Chicago month come and talk to me.  Then tell me how the Democratic politicians running every major urban city in the country have made a single dent in this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want Americans or non-Americans killed for racism, crime, police mistakes, being sent to ridiculous foreign wars or any other reason.  And I sure as hell don't want a race war in this country started by the god damned media convincing people in these communities that half the country is some sort of covert supporter of the KKK.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where this narrative is leading.  And I'm sure the government will be there to install martial law to protect us from the chaos that they started through the puppet media.  So forgive me for not supporting your hysteria.

       quite a few of those on the list were later debunked such as the 69 year old woman who was punched to the ground. If you watch the whole video you can see that the guy who punched her was 73 years old and blind and she kept harassing him before hand.

        Two men beat a homeless man with a metal bar and urinate on him screaming, “Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,” When asked for a comment about the incident Trump defends them saying, "My supporters are very passionate.

       . So the attack probably occurred after 10 PM on the 18th, but before ass o'clock in the morning, and made the morning papers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Sounds like habitual criminals turning a dumb robbery into a free beating. One Leftist site said they hit him with a "lead pipe." How long has it been since pipes of lead were commonplace? I haunt hardware stores and I have never seen one.

      <blockquote>

       Sounds inspired more by Charlie Sheen than Donald Trump. "WINNING!"

       <p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Police said Scott Leader, 38, told them it was OK to assault the man because he was Hispanic and homeless. “Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,” he allegedly told the police.

      <p>
       I can practically see their hand-written orders on official Trump Tower gilt stationary. So, to be clear:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Trump-inspired" == "bizarre,
        <em>

        rationalization"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By the way, "extensive criminal records" means, "they can't vote," right? So, if Trumpistas are all habitual criminals, who voted for him?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Told about the attack, Trump said: “It would be a shame. … I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.”

       What a funny ellipsis there. Can we find the full quote? Ah: New Hampshire presser, Aug 19, 2015 (same day as the attack),

       The next reporter asks about Heidi Klum. (Your National Media Earning Its Pay, folks.) The entire exchange takes less than a minute. He declares the attack to be a "shame," but he doesn't have any information on it. Once he had confirmed info, he tweeted:

       I'm gonna need some kind of source for that claim. "Trump supporters commit more violence than the average leftist."
       <br/>
       Perhaps you can consider the idea that a violent crime is more likely to be reported on with details about the person's political leanings if they are a Trump supporter, because it makes the people who control the media very happy to be able to push an agenda, and if a leftist commits violence, they'll probably either not be given much airtime or a front page on a paper, or their political leaning will not be "related to the attack" or whatever other excuse you can think of.

       Yeah. I watch a lot of Videographers footage on youtube because it is WAY better than getting your info from the media.

      <p>
       Just raw footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw Duerst The Worsts and he was walking along and caught the whole attack. Bunch of dumbass white supremacist dudes parading down the street, bunch of dumbass BLM dudes following close with bats. They see their chance by the parking garage and bum rush the ass end of the line of racists into the garage and start the fight and it backfires.

       They Deandre dude had a small baseball bat in his hand.

      <p>
       If you want to get raw info scope out Shuttershot45 and Duerst the Worst on youtube. They go to all these events and get raw footage. Shuttershot is the one who got the video of Antifa member Eric Clanton bashing that dudes head in with a bike lock.

        Here is a post I made the other day
       </a>
       with images that show it seems the weapon Mr.Harris had was a metal mag light type long handle flashlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "bum rush" was a an attempt to capture the flag &amp; once the struggle to snatch the flag began Mr Harris then began the more intense violence of swinging weapons with malicious intent to inflict serious damage on the flag man. The flag hold was an older man &amp; Mr Harris clearly hit the older flag man in the head with his flashlight weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is absurd Mr Harris is being shown by the MSM to be a victim, as he started the chain of weapon swings he was on the losing end of. It is criminal IMO that gofundme has not removed the fundraiser, as Mr. Harris is attempting to profit on criminal activity &amp; they are aiding and abetting as they have been informed how Mr. Harris started the violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very disturbing that the puppeted MSM propagandists have been sent these images that show the truth of Mr Harris starting the violence &amp; none are running with the story that does not fit the staged narrative their puppet masters want to propagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a side picker &amp; think the extremists on both sides are often acting ill &amp; dangerous. Addtionally I do think courts should sort out if any charges should apply to those that Hit Mr. Harris as some blows may have happened after he was no longer in possession of the flashlight.

       Well that would be an assumption that what they were saying implies that they actually took the bats, but if they did there were plenty from the left that brought their own weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that aside, what does it matter? Say they did take the bats from some racists, does that justify them following and then attacking these dudes? Were they they same guys they took the bats from? Not likely.

       The same reason any biased person has for seeing what they expect to see: cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, &amp;c. The mainstream media is 85% Democrat. Anyone capable of seeing the incongruity and speaking out against the prevailing bias either is, or fears being, James Damore'd. They have student loans and mortgages like anyone else and don't wish to be blackballed from the major media outlets.

       Pro-tip: FOX News employs Democrats at about the same numbers as the general population. But FOX only seems a lot larger than it really is: FOX News Channel is the biggest cable news channel, but it pulls numbers
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       smaller than the big three broadcast news shows. In millions of viewers:

       There was also a UTR guy being beaten during this same altercation. You can see him in the background of the photo and in the Buzzfeed video. The Buzzfeed reporter(Cabin Boy) says "Someone's getting beaten into the ground.". Two minutes later, 2 old UTR guys are assaulted in front of the police station. That Buzzfeed video is worth a watch it you have the time. It doesn't have much commentary. I found it very informative and unbiased.

       one how is this a "conspiracy" that news organizations jumped on a story about a viral video of white supremacists beating someone up? what just because the new organizations don't have an army of neck beards trolling the net 24/7 looking for footage, there is some type of conspiracy? give me a break.

       No, it doesn't make racist violence ok.  Yes it shows that way more blacks are dying to general crime related violence than anything else.  When the number per month of Blacks killed by Nazis and other Trump supporters in a month reaches the number killed in an average Chicago month come and talk to me.  Then tell me how the Democratic politicians running every major urban city in the country have made a single dent in this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want Americans or non-Americans killed for racism, crime, police mistakes, being sent to ridiculous foreign wars or any other reason.  And I sure as hell don't want a race war in this country started by the god damned media convincing people in these communities that half the country is some sort of covert supporter of the KKK.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where this narrative is leading.  And I'm sure the government will be there to install martial law to protect us from the chaos that they started through the puppet media.  So forgive me for not supporting your hysteria.

       Well, your attitude is certainly welcome to all here, as is your prose ("mistooken", really?).
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the "correlation" between truth and conspiracy?  You can tell me that after apologizing for helping me "save face" by cursing my feelings on my grandfather, who co-invented the very hydraulic trash trucks that make your very life oh so convenient.

       I do give a fuck about scientists, especially highly educated ones, that KNOW chemtrails are a real thing.  So, yes, I value his opinion far more than yours.

       I know you don't value my opinion. You don't need to tell me you don't value my opinion. If you were worried that you weren't getting the message across that you don't value my opinion, I can assure you that you've made clear the fact that you do not value my opinion. Am I being clear on how clear you are being in regards to the fact that you don't value my opinion?

       But in the words of Joker, "That's just my opinion. Don't go spreading it around or anything."
