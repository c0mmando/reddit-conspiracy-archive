        CHILD ABUSE AT THE PRESIDIO
       </strong>
       - Where Michael Aquino worked
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In April, Aquino wrote a four-page letter to the head of a children's advocates group in Southern California warning that "we do not intend to see a replay of what happened in Nazi Germany, when the reluctance of the Jews to challenge those who systematically and falsely accused Judaism of heinous crimes-including the sexual abuse and ritual murder of Christian children- led to violence against them."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        On Aug. 12, 1987, the Adams-Thompsons were shopping at the PX at the Presidio. Suddenly the girl ran to Larry Adams-Thompson and clutched his leg. He looked up and saw a man whom he knew as Lt Col. Michael Aquino.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Yes, that's Mikey," the 3-year-old told Adams-Thompson. After being taken outside, the girl added, "he's a bad man and I'm afraid." As they were leaving the parking lot, the Adams-Thompsons saw Aquino's wife, Lilith. Larry asked the child if she knew the woman.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Yes, that's Shamby," the girl said.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The family went home and called the FBI.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        When interviewed by authorities the next day, the girl identified Gary Hambright from a photo lineup and said she had been driven to Mikey and Shamby's home by Hambright. There, she said, she was abused by Hambright, Mikey and Shamby in a room with black walls. She said that she had been photographed. She said Hambright and Mikey were dressed in women's clothes and Shamby was dressed in man's clothes.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The investigators drove her to Leavenworth Street in San Francisco. The girl was asked to identify any of the houses that she had been to before. While walking past{-redacted-home address same address as The Temple of Set} the girl identified the house as the one where she met "Mikey" and "Shamby." It was the Aquinos' house.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A search warrant was served on the Aquino home on Aug. 14. In attendance were agents from the FBI and the San Francisco Police. Because the abuse allegedly occurred on city property, it was to be a city case.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Among the items seized were video tapes, cassette tapes, notebooks with names and addresses, two photo albums one paper plate and two plastic gloves from the kitchen garbage, four plastic cases of negatives and 29 photos of costumes and masks. With his widow's peak and arching eyebrows, Lt Col. Michael Aquino looks more like a pudgy Dracula than a high ranking Army officer with top security clearance. He is the founder and high priest of a satanic church, the Temple of Set. His wife, Lilith, a gaunt woman with long, dark hair, is a priestess in the temple's

        . The couple refer to the search as a "raid" and have branded the investigation a witch hunt.

       I saw that. This psy-ops veteran was confronted by a poorly spoken man who had a ridiculous tale of ritual abuse, easily defeated by Mr. Aquino.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except the man was a plant designed to make Aquino look good and dispel the rumors surrounding him. Notice at 3:53 in this video Aquino silently mouths the words his opponent is speaking. I'm guessing he wrote the script.

       I know this is a controversial opinion, but I really wish "Pizzagate" wouldn't have coalesced with "pedogate".  It's really muddied some waters in my opinion, as I immediately wondered what this guy had to do with Comet Pizza.

       It was, when the evidence started circulating people started pushing pizza full pressure 24/7 trying to get it to stick. I remember more than one saying that's a bad idea and were ignored.

       I kinda got that.  Which is why I dislike the confusion that has set in regarding Pizzagate and all the other elite pedo claims.  Pizzagate is a thing, like Watergate is a thing.  We don't consider all politically motivated break-ins "Watergate" because that was it's own event.  Just like Pizzagate should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a poor example, but you surely get what I'm saying.  Somewhere along the way people starting conflating elite pedo info and I don't think it's a good thing.

      <p>
       That's my only point here.

       Who the hell would know "pedogate" was a thing among the elite without the recent evidence of some specific case of it? This would still be a thing that most people never heard of let alone consider it's actually true.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no muddied waters here. Pizzagate is the dam holding back the floodwaters of a systemic issue in the higher ranks of society. Break that dam and its over for them all.

       People have known this was a thing since LONG before Pizzagate came around.  The Franklin Coverup did a good job putting this on people's radar - and people sharing that information did a great job making connections while avoiding sensationalism
       <em>
        unlike
       </em>
       Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may argue that Pizzagate is actually hurting the theory that there are elite pedo groups.  Many in the mainstream have come to believe Pizzagate was a political tactic,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a breaking story - so conflating the two can do a lot more harm than good.

       What people? The very small minority of people who even bothered to research conspiracies knew about it. Now the whole world knows what "pizzagate" is.

       Yeah, i've seen you argue that a lot but actually it doesn't. It brought it to light and that's why the term and thus the very idea of pizzagate has been exchanged for "pedogate" because there's nothing to do about pedogate. There is no specific outlet for legal action, there is no identifying of involved people and therefor it is no threat to the pedo establishment whatsoever.

       Perhaps, but in my opinion it's for good reason.  I was completely open to the subject of Pizzagate - code words, spirit cooking and all.  I believe something like that is a real possibility.  But to me, Pizzagate turned out to be nothing more than a Rorschach test.  Even more so considering its origins are directly linked to the campaign and surges of fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll continue to stay open minded on the subject, but everything I've seen thus far has been wildly left up to interpretation.  And I'm just not about hanging people based on interpretations.

       Yeah, this is the best we can do. Admins have been pretty harsh on us for approving posts with PII in the past, but I went through the link and everyone mentioned appeared to meet public figure status. If someone thinks there's real PII, they'll have to show us what that is.

       Maybe. A lot of these PG posts get a ton of reports to begin with, and the admins do take PII seriously, but if I just get a random report saying there's PII in a post but there's nothing obvious and the report isn't specific, I'm not going to remove it.

       No matter what a persons inclination towards the pedophile matter is (truth); Aquino is a fishy motherfucker up to -something- inexplicable to the conventional perspective.  Do not doubt his presence is unaware of even this seemingly innocuous reference to himself.

       This shit all falls apart when the name Paul Bonacci is used. That dude is nuts, he's also the one who claims Hunter S Thompson filmed pedo snuff at Bohemian Grove. Just because you want to believe something doesn't make it true.

       The Hunter Thompson stuff very well may be true. I didn't want to believe it either when I first heard about it but the story has been corroborated by several people and has come up in unrelated stories.

       People have known this was a thing since LONG before Pizzagate came around.  The Franklin Coverup did a good job putting this on people's radar - and people sharing that information did a great job making connections while avoiding sensationalism
       <em>
        unlike
       </em>
       Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may argue that Pizzagate is actually hurting the theory that there are elite pedo groups.  Many in the mainstream have come to believe Pizzagate was a political tactic,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a breaking story - so conflating the two can do a lot more harm than good.
