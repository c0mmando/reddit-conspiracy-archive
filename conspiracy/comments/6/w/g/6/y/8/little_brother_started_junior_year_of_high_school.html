        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He just told me about this yesterday, and it has been a real morale booster for me just thinking about it. I&#39;ve been telling him about that shit for a year, trying to save him from joining the Air Force and being a whore for the military industrial complex. He usually listens, nods along, but at some point his eyes glaze over. When it came from a teacher though, someone he&#39;s been told by society to revere, it made a HUGE difference. I retold him about the passports found at the crash sites, and the mystery of building 7, and this time it really clicked for him. Really amazing to hear some teachers out there red-pilling the next generation. In fact, my first exposure to truther movement was an English teacher showing us JFK on the last day of school one year, and it really got me thinking at the time, although it would be years before the seed would sprout into a new understanding of the world. This is the way to do it, infiltrate the system and spread the truth. Spread this as far as you can in whatever way you think will work. Crimes against humanity will not be forgotten. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can say that i spent many, many hours on 9/11 truth, and that it is overwhelming to try and take in all of the info thats out there. its a bottomless pit of info, and it all basically points to a (((false flag)))</p>

<p>but there is so much info, you can get bogged down for years just looking at the physical evidence, or lack thereof in 2 cases.</p>

<p>so by the time you finally convince yourself that the official story is not true, many years have passed by and those responsible and/or complicit have moved along  </p>

<p>you start to realize that... if it was a (((false flag))) and that 19 muslims and Osama Bin Laden were not responsible, 
then you start to ask... (((who is responsible)))?</p>

<p>who benefits?</p>

<p>the US military invaded Afghanistan in 2001, allegedly because the Taliban had something to do with 9/11, but in fact the reason was because the Taliban was disrupting worldwide opium supply and this was unacceptable to the Rothschild&#39;s </p>

I think it is unethical for a teacher to assert his opinion as truth on any subject, due to the authority of his position(science and math is a bit different of course).

I despise our current education system, it does not promote critical thinking at all. Perhaps this teacher had positive intentions, I still think it&#39;s an abuse of power though.</p>

They want us to believe what we&#39;re told by our &quot;betters&quot;, and believe what we read, that is written by them. We now live in the information age, we have no reason to fill our cup with data we could find out with a quick google search. Instead we should be focusing on critical thought, to question everything and come to the most informed conclusion. We do not need to told what the truth is, we need to have the ability to ascertain that for ourselves. Truth may be one thing to one teacher, and something else entirely to another.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still on the fence regarding how a teacher should not be able to assert an idea; on the one hand i mostly see todays schooling as indoctrination and i&#39;d like that to stop (so i agree with you). </p>

<p>I think that because of how easy it is to lead someone by using either method. </p>

<p>If the teacher did promote critical thinking and used an approach without asserting then maybe that would be good but if the student spends their time outside of school being bombarded by corporate/government-friendly/PC propaganda then i wonder what their chances of being able to think critically are. An open mind would be impossible if they already know the &#39;truth&#39; unless someone is making them aware of other theories.</p>

<p>I reckon if you take your idea and apply it to the level of the media and government as well then that would be groovy.</p>

<p>I agree with you here, I have no good answers. Should the minority opinion have an equal voice? Is the majority opinion, actually the majority, or is it just the opinion that got the most invested in via propaganda? The flow of information via the media dictates the majority opinion currently, whoever has the most $&#39;s has the loudest voice. I think to have any kind of open discourse in our education system, isn&#39;t possible with our current system.
It&#39;s entirely dependent on the ethics and integrity of our sources of information media/news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think all hope is lost yet. If we can get money out of our political process, then I think we can have a true democracy that actually represents us. This is a fight that is happening globally. The DNC lawsuit gave the opportunity to look behind the curtain so to speak. We have a generation raised on the internet, and through that are inherently more open minded than their fathers/grand fathers. They&#39;re not bickering about social issues to distract us. Right or left many believe in equality, in 10-20 years it will not be the hot button topic as it&#39;s used today, and the millennials will be the dominating voting block. You would have to define to me what your version of fascism means. To me it&#39;s the most oppressive form of government you can have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a.  A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the problem is capitalism itself. It has gone unchecked for far too long. The ones with power and money use that money to divide us, and write their own legislation. The scales need rebalanced. I think finding that perfect middle between socialism and capitalism is ideal. But any talk of wealth redistributing invokes red scare, and you get called a commie, even though record wealth redistribution has been ongoing year after year to the top .1%. This is by design, and that talking point is heavily invested into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using facism to mean that centralization of authority though it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a single person. I&#39;d happily get rid of the violant suppression of the opposition and i&#39;m hung up at the moment as to what racism means. Cultural diversity is bugging me as well as i&#39;m struggling to define what that means. </p>

<p>I&#39;m opposed towards selective mistreatment of anyone because of their race so i think that makes me against racism. </p>

<p>I guess I think my point is that capitalism is a disguise of facism but without a single dictator. The economy is as controlled and no true opposition seems to be found. I dislike both but i&#39;d rather lose the disguise. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking nationalism seems sort of fine (preferably without the belligerence). If the governance of each country looked after the interests of it&#39;s own country like that saying about free will - My free will and rights to do something exist up until the point where they impinge on your free will and rights to do something or avoid harm or destruction of your property, then they could maintain their own interests with minimal generation of strife. </p>

<p>Is it idealistic as it seems to rely on all nations accepting that viewpoint? I think you can&#39;t ask someone to do something you wouldn&#39;t yourself.</p>

<p>To add to that i feel like a form of nationalism that puts the people of the nation first rather than the umbrella of a corporation or the head of a party would be a good idea. If the basic needs of the comman man or woman in any country are not met then i feel that that is the first need that need be considered.</p>

<p>If there were no NIST report, then the teacher would be in a tough spot if they had no research and evidence to support their claims.  As it is now, anyone squashing any discussion that contradicts the official government position is actively brainwashing the public.</p>

<p>Anyone using their position of authority to assert a point of view is flat out wrong, regardless of the content. </p>

<p>Lol! what, pray tell, is teaching at all then?!</p>

<p>With the exception of basic literacy, math, and <em>some</em> of the sciences, what else do you think the process of &quot;educating&quot; children is?? </p>

<p>I&#39;m finally old enough to have witnessed/recognized recorded history reflect a completely false reality in my own time - has human nature changed so much that my generation is the first to experience this phenomena? Can all post-propaganda but pre-Vietnam recordings of history be trusted? </p>

<p>Clearly there is room for criticising a teacher who blatantly stays from the curriculum, but for other reasons than this. Is sending your children to be educated by people in &quot;positions of authority&quot; (over them) to &#39;teach&#39; out of a textbook edited with clear agendas and sold to school districts by lobbyists any less &quot;brainwashing&quot; than this in it&#39;s essence?</p>

<p>We were studying the JFK assassination and we had to do a big project on it. This teacher did not plant ideas in our head as to what exactly happened or who did it, he just presented the provable facts, and different reports of what happened. </p>

<p>The project was for us to decide who performed the assassination and how they did it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget that teacher and his teaching style. He was very good at making students question the narrative and keep an open mind. </p>

It&#39;s a teacher&#39;s job to teach students <em>how</em> to think rather than <em>what</em> to think. For example: &quot;Our history books teach us x, but there are people who believe y. Who has a more credible argument? Are there examples of history books being wrong, or people or organizations lying in order to achieve something?  What were the effects of those lies? Based on your research what do you think the truth is?&quot; This is teaching critical thinking and it&#39;s kind of teaching 101. </p>

I&#39;ll just add that it&#39;s way more important than most realize to go to websites/forums/chats/comment sections where young people hang out. Even if for just 10 minutes a day.<br/>
You can inform thirty open-minded young people in the same time it would take to inform one closed-minded older person.<br/>
Letting the government &amp; corporations have a near-monopoly on what young people learn (especially when it&#39;s fairly easy for you to get information to them online) is <em>incredibly</em> foolish/irresponsible.</p>

<p>HUH? What&#39;s with such a comment?</p>

<p>*Judy Clare Clarke (born 1952) is an American criminal defense attorney who has represented several high-profile defendants. She has negotiated plea agreements that spare her clients the death penalty, as was the case for Eric Rudolph, Ted Kaczynski, and Jared Lee Loughner. In the case of Susan Smith, Clarke argued to the jury that ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raised in Asheville, North Carolina, Clarke is a graduate of T.C. Roberson High School, Furman University and University of South Carolina School of Law. Clarke served as executive director of the Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc. (FDSDI) and the Federal Defenders of the Eastern District of Washington and Idaho. From 1996 to 1997, she served as President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Clarke will receive the John Frank Award from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there was a time when i simply did not have the proper vocabulary to explain to other people what i was seeing. </p>

<p>i would try to compare it to movies, like where theres good guys and bad guys, but they are just actors playing a role, but in real life they get along. and the police, and the judge, and the doctor, and the &quot;extras&quot; in every movie.... yes, they are all part of the movie... they are all &quot;in on it&quot; so to speak...  </p>

<p>then one day the word &quot;hoax&quot; became part of the popular lexicon, and was soon attached to all sorts of fake news stories like </p>

<p>. #SandyHoax </p>

<p>. #BostonHoax</p>

<p>. #OrlandoHoax </p>

<p>. #FergusonHoax</p>

<p>. #ChristopherDornerHoax</p>

<p>basically, CNN is so bad that you can take almost any story they cover, add the word &quot;hoax&quot; to it, and there will be a hashtag with someone calling out CNN as fake news</p>

<p>it is commonly thought that PG was the reason that the MSM had to hype the phrase &quot;fake news&quot;, to get out in front of PG, </p>

<p>and perhaps more importantly, to get out in front of the deluge of common people figuring out decades, and centuries of &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;hoaxes&quot;, and having their empire of lies collapse like a house of cards. </p>

<p>even #NASAhoax is a thing </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Also, self realization helps someone to think
they came to the conclusion by their own cognition, which might make them value critical thinking more. They might as their awake teacher &quot;what about the Moon landings&quot; but then might do their own research to verify the teacher&#39;s view.
I mean, a teacher could think 9/11 was an inside job (true) but that the Moon landings were real (false IMO)
so the critical thinking boost would be helpful. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why my wife and I have had many many talks about homeschooling our children. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want this shit in the classroom, even if I may agree with it. Our children don&#39;t go to school to be programmed. They don&#39;t need to be taught that they&#39;re lesser because they are white, and they don&#39;t need to be taught to distrust our government. </p>

<p>I want my children to find their own paths, to find what they believe on their own. I don&#39;t want their teachers planting ideas in their heads. My children, and nearly all children, are smart and inquisitive. They can find their paths. </p>

<p>School is about learning what you need to be a contributing member of society, nothing more and nothing less. Being taught your&#39;e racist because you&#39;re white, or that the government did 9/11, does not help society progress forward. Sure, some may take these teachings and do good -- most won&#39;t. </p>

<p>Most kids will just grow up resentful towards whatever group they were told has wronged them. You see it now with millennial, Antifa, college campuses, etc. This type of shit is what has led to that. </p>

<p>So, again, I do not think this is a good thing even if I agree with what the teacher has said. There&#39;s a time and a place for that shit, a high school classroom is not it. </p>

<p>There were no hijackers..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The planes that struck the WTC Towers were piloted by remote control, using hardware developed by <a href="http://100777.com/node/1836">Rabbi Dov Zakheim</a>, who with Zionists <a href="http://rense.com/general80/key.htm">Jerome Hauer</a> and <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-11-chertoff-side_x.htm">Michael Chertoff</a> engineered the whole project!</p>

<p>There was no plane at <a href="https://s10.postimg.io/m35ynsiyx/Shanksville.jpg">Shanksville</a>, a <a href="https://s11.postimg.io/x39wqq01f/Missile_Pent.gif">cruise missile</a> slammed into the Pentagon, &quot;<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html">Celebrating Jews</a>&quot; were filming as the Twin Towers went down.</p>

<p>The most revolting aspect of the push to blame the Saudis, is their refusal to set the record straight in contempt of the edict in the Koran to &quot;<a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/6az.png">cast truth at falsehood</a>.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudi sponsors and finances terror all over the world.  They fund wahhabi organizations all over  Canada and Europe and world wide that promote Islamic Extremism.  They also commit many bomb attacks in Yemen every single day,  killing children and causing the starvation of millions of Yemenis. And their culture is backwards as hell, highly abusive towards women and minorities. They also execute people for being atheist or gay or going to a protest. They clearly hate American values. Why are you jumping to their defence? Your links are all a bunch of bullshit anyways.  not one reputable source or actual shred of evidence.  If it was true that thousands of jews knew ahead of time why hasnt any one stepped forward? All the evidence points to Saudi agents being the primary culprit. </p>

<p>What about the calls from those to their family members from the planes? What about the &quot;highjackers&quot; and the flight training they had done in Florida?</p>

<p>Also, didn&#39;t OBL claim credit for the attack?  I want to understand, but there are points from both sides of this debate that don&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my teachers showed Lose Change in class when I was in high school. Unfortunately I was still being fed the &quot;terrorist threat&quot; narrative by the news, my family, movies, video games, etc so I kinda shrugged that video off as a crazy teacher and joined the infantry thinking I was serving my country. My red pill experience was a year in Afghanistan...</p>

<p>I wish my sheeple parents didn&#39;t discredit the teacher that was trying to open minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was one of these teachers but I always presented the official story and then presented the &#39;conspiracy&#39; side of things. Presenting multiple sides tends to mess with the student&#39;s head and they end up doing research as it is uncomfortable to be exposed to contradicting evidence at the same time (which is a good thing). It sets the tone for the school year that these kinds of topics can and will be discussed. </p>

<p>9/11 is fun to teach because it happens early on in the school year and can also be a very useful tool in helping kids to think like a historian. My grandma saved the newspaper from 9/11/01 so I used it and other resources to help kids understand the difference between primary and secondary sources. </p>

<p>Building 7 and the found passports make the kids go wtf. </p>

<p>But I am no longer a classroom teacher because I went above and beyond with the whole questioning the officials thing (we contfronted our congressman about 911 in a student hosted town-hall meeting) and I wasn&#39;t allowed to teach government/economics anymore. </p>
