        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know a lot of speculation or maybe even science tries to find out &quot;how the brain creates consciousness&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>But ... isn&#39;t that ass-backwards?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know how it happens, how do you even know THAT it happens?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this just some kind of, I dunno, old as hell superstition about the mind being the seat of the soul or whatever? (but also of course the place that seems to store indoctrination, how coincidental!)</p>

<p>I mean, the brain is useful and all I guess, but I see no reason to automatically assume that it &quot;generates consciousness&quot;. If you ask me, that claim is made out of thin air, hence probably so difficult to prove or substantiate - because it may just be nonsense. How the fuck do some electrical connections create consciousness? By that standard a computer becomes conscious too if you just make it complex enough.</p>

<p>As far as what sounds intuitive to me, I would say that the brain has a lot to do with memory and thought, but not necessarily with consciousness. You may glorify memory and thought all you want, but that doesn&#39;t give it magical properties, like to &quot;spawn consciousness&quot;. </p>

<p>How do people even get away with such claims, given that they seem to be substantiated by ... well, nothing. We treat it as some kind of general consensus or indisputable truth or &quot;common sense&quot;, when there is literally zero evidence for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise some interesting questions beyond the one in the title (e.g. computer consciousness). Your request for scientific reasons is going to generate results of the scientific method which is largely geared toward the circuitry answer you suspect. You also wouldn&#39;t be hard pressed to find people arguing for humans as mechanical chemical robots. Not answering that question, but I might also wonder: what is the difference between being alive and being conscious and where is the seat of life (surely not only the brain). Good luck with the scientists...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct - this is the materialistic interpretation of consciousness popular in western thinking, but there is little to no evidence to support the claim.  In fact, Western science doesn&#39;t seem to know much about consciousness at all, as opposed to Eastern wisdom traditions which feature incredible expositions on the nature of consciousness.  They taught the opposite: that there is no self and consciousness arises as a function of interdependent origination.  I hastily threw together some links below to get you started:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked because of your explanation how science had it ass-backwads. I think consciousness is nothing more than being self-aware which imho perfectly can be described as a form of intelligence. you know, like that test when babies, dogs or monkeys see themselves in a mirror and depending on intelligence are aware that they see themselves. So I don&#39;t think it is that far off to think that consciousness comes with our brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask myself a similar question....is consciousness created by the brain
or received and then utilized differently?
I think astralrocker2001 once replied to me saying
that other people have met in the astral plane.
I don&#39;t know if those people are telling him the truth
but if there&#39;s any contact between two or more peoples&#39; consciousnesses,
(whether my unexplained/supernatural means, quantum physics means, etc.)
then it may suggest consciousness can exist outside the brain
and body, further suggesting that it&#39;s received....or some other mechanism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have evidence and I&#39;m pretty on the fence when it comes to whether
spirituality is legit.
I think I read something about a microcrystalline substance in the pineal gland (&quot;seat of the soul&quot;?).</p>

<p>And well crystal radios.....(I currently don&#39;t actually know how they work, I&#39;m just saying it gives me a bit of hope that spirituality might not be nonsense/just chemicals reacting differently).
I like to live in hope. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been pretty lazy in trying to meditate, though.
Probably why I find it difficult to be spiritual,
spirituality isn&#39;t talking to me at the moment (nothing weird happens to me).
But sometimes syncronicities happen....oh consciousness,
you are a tease! Hahaha
(just trying to lighten things up... :P)</p>

<p>We have no idea of the origin of consciousness so
all cards are on the table for me! :D
I would like to know of a way to experience spirituality
in order to find out if there&#39;s more to it than just neurotransmitters.
But I do wonder....things like photo frames falling after someone&#39;s passed away...
Is it just confirmation bias, random, or could it be a message from
the deceased, letting us know?
It&#39;s so frustrating and often sad that IF the afterlife
exists, those perished souls still can&#39;t communicate with us.
Who knows how it works. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I think other factors include impatience (expecting results and something tangible like full awakening lol),
difficulty in maintaining &quot;no thoughts&quot; or being unsure of what meditation really is (even I&#39;m not completely sure beyond the saying &quot;all suffering comes from thought&quot; thus stop thinking/allow thoughts to pass and move on).</p>

<p>Using your phone timer for 15mins+ significantly helps though.
In response, your mind stops wondering &quot;has it been 15mins yet, I have something I need to do soon&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>Have you had any experiences as a result of meditation?
If so, what, and how often, how long did you have to do it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still a seeker, not fully awakened in any way.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the point of meditation is to have a direct experience of the truth. There are many benefits one gains along the way but ultimately, it&#39;s to become awakened/enlightened. To add to that, meditation is not an achievement of some sort but a realization of what we already are. The Buddha said that we are all enlightened, whether we know it or not. </p>

<p>Using your timer is a great idea for the reason that you articulated. I second that insight.</p>

<p>I have had a few cool experiences here and there but nothing worthy of mention. With that said though, there are numerous accounts of special powers and abilities that people unlock along their meditation journey. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi</a>. Masters have always advised not to focus too much on those things as they are not the ultimate. </p>

<p>As far as how long does it take, it depends on a lot of factors but I would focus on intention and intensity.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask more questions or try r/meditation and r/awakened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It stems from the first law of thermodynamics (<a href="https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookEner1.html">https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookEner1.html</a>) which states that you can&#39;t create energy (and therefore matter) out of nothing.  You can only change it from one form to another.</p>

<p>If you were to place a person in a specific type of room (lead-lined, deep in the earth), you would be able to essentially abate any radiation coming into the room, but you&#39;re still conscious.  So it doesn&#39;t seem to come from without.  And it can&#39;t spontaneously be created from within, from the first law (above).</p>

<p>If you damage your brain, you can damage your consciousness.  You agree that the brain is responsible for memory but then how much of consciousness is memory, if not an incredibly large part?</p>

<p>Mind-brain duality is a very strange thing and we&#39;re still learning a lot about it.  But this subject is very old (it starts hundreds of years ago with Descartes, actually!) and smarter people than you and me have devoted a lot of writing towards it; the least we can do is read it.</p>
