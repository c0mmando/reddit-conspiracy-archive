       No way. Mcgregor was done. He couldn't keep his hands up, he could barely breath, he couldnt defend himself, and he was about to have one of the best boxers in the world tee off on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rig was in that he never had a shot in the first place. Mayweather may have bet his money on the 10th round, but thats the extent.

       McGregor hadn't thrown a punch in almost a full minute. He was wobbling all over the place. He was about 15 seconds from a full KO. The ref did exactly what any boxing ref would do in any other fight.

       He threw a punch at 2:19 (about ~14 in 30 seconds prior) - Mayweather opened up at 2:14 and the fight was called at 1:58.
      </p>
      <p>

       It was determined before the fight that there would be no standing counts. The fighters both agreed to the rules.

       My mistake, if no standing-8 it was simply called too early. He dodged 60% of the shots thrown at him during the ~15 seconds.

       You may have a point about the count. Even if it did go to count McGregor was finished. He would have been finished off right after. I dont see how anyone can make the case that the fight was fixed in favor of mayweather though.

       Yet they still gave him the rounds on the scorecard. And the first opportunity they invoke a final TKO when Mac avoided 60% of strikes thrown at him in -16 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was weighted heavily in Mayweather's favour. If they had given Mac a standing count or let him drop there'd be no argument.

       So your saying if it wasnt for the tko connor still had a shot at winning? And that the ref called it early to ensure a mayweather win? He was gassed at the end, couldn't defend himself, couldnt keep his hands up, and had no meaningful offense.

       The ref in that ring knows boxing and he is closer than anyone. He can hear them breathing, look into their eyes, and knows when a fighter is done. People dont understand the power someone like Mayweather has behind a full punch to a defenseless amateurs dome-piece.

       Pretty much. The only scam was the hype how McGregor has even a remote chance of winning but he was so outclassed it's incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe just maybe if he had more stamina to keep up the tempo from rounds 1-3 all until the end but even then he would've got destroyed.

       And people claiming he should have won more rounds by points, I didn't count but I saw many many illegal moves, hammer hitting floyd from behind in the neck and so on ...

       The other scam is if ufc is going to refund the people who paid a c-note for a faulty product. They dont seem to be handling that snafu well at all.

       Yeah, Mayeeathers professional reaction to that really downplayed the severity of that. He had every right to punk McGregor out after the fight and remained a gentlemen. Disregarding anything else leading up to that, he deserves credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more times I watch this fight the more apparent it is how much Mayweather dominated the fight. Connor came out with everything he had and Floyd didnt even break a sweat.

       The more I think about it I dont know. Im not a boxing fan but people are interrsted in seeing huge upsets. Think of the miracle on ice. A McGregor victory would have been on that scale. Thats why I watched it. The fight went the way a lot of people predicted. The risks and quality of the fighters was well known to everyone.

       Im just rambling a little but I agree with the spirit of your comment whole-heartedly.

       the ufc thing is just incompetence i'd say
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know the specifics since i didn't subscribe, but that's what it seems like. they weren't prepared for the number of users they got and the whole thing crashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       could they handle the thing better? sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       the deciding part comes after though, if they refund the customers, it's all good, bygones, but if not, i wouldn't trust them with a cent of my money anymore.

       Are you fucking serious? Tv doesn't come with ad block for starters. It's a lot harder to use subliminal messaging thorough text, most webpages don't have that type of simultaneous viewer counts, regardless of any supposed subliminal or overt propaganda, how is it the super bowl rises to the top here every year over illumaniti symbols but to question a barbaric brawl peopeare paying to see in any way questionable to the same crowd?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same crowd moaning over how everything anti trump is fake news, and the media run by evil Jews should, in a logical world, be very wary of events like this and other tribialistic propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I watch videos on occasion, and will go see Star Wars and a few other films in theaters, (discount tuesdays and drive ins for the win) but I do not like what tv watching does to me. It's like the old this is your brain on drugs commercials. I'd rather read, or engage in interactive experiences. I do play video games, but not many realistically violent ones. Even stuff like GTA or red dead( Wild West GTA) bothers me a bit nowdays, and I used to love it. No online fps games at all, but I do enjoy flying vehicle battles and tactical stuff.

       He threw a punch at 2:19 (about ~14 in 30 seconds prior) - Mayweather opened up at 2:14 and the fight was called at 1:58.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it was actually 16 seconds of "not punching" where he consciously avoided around 60% of the strikes thrown at him.
