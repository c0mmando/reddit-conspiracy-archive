        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/InfoDisseminator.html">InfoDisseminator</a></p>

<p>Women with higher urinary concentrations of a common type of flame retardant had reduced likelihood of clinical pregnancy and live birth than those with lower concentrations, according to researchers. The study is among the first to examine associations between organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs) -- which are used in polyurethane foam in many products, including upholstered furniture, baby products, and gym mats -- and reproductive outcomes in women. </p>

<p>These flame retardants don&#39;t even work, so why are they in so many household products? Since the mid-1900&#39;s, many flame retardants have come onto the market, and eventually we find out that they are extremely hazardous to human health. They get phased out, a new flame retardant is introduced, we find out it&#39;s hazardous, a new one is introduced, repeat, etc. This is still going on today and will continue for the foreseeable future. These flame retardants have many health effects, including fertility. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manufacturers of flame retardants would repeatedly point to this government study as key proof that these toxic chemicals — embedded in many common household items — prevented residential fires and saved lives.</p>

<p>But the study&#39;s lead author, Vytenis Babrauskas, told the Tribune that industry officials have &quot;grossly distorted&quot; the findings of his research, which was not based on real-world conditions. The small amounts of flame retardants in typical home furnishings, he said, offer little to no fire protection.</p>

<p>&quot;Industry has used this study in ways that are improper and untruthful,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The misuse of Babrauskas&#39; work is but one example of how the chemical industry has manipulated scientific findings to promote the widespread use of flame retardants and downplay the health risks, a Tribune investigation shows. The industry has twisted research results, ignored findings that run counter to its aims and passed off biased, industry-funded reports as rigorous science.</p>

<p>As a result, the chemical industry successfully distorted the basic knowledge about toxic chemicals that are used in consumer products and linked to serious health problems, including cancer, developmental problems, neurological deficits and impaired fertility.</p>

<p>Industry has disseminated misleading research findings so frequently that they essentially have been adopted as fact. They have been cited by consultants, think tanks, regulators and Wikipedia, and have shaped the worldwide debate about the safety of flame retardants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an industry talking point. Increased use of fire alarms has decreased the amount of fires and especially the amount of deaths caused by fire. Huge amounts of education on cigarettes and fires reduced the amount of home fires cause by smoking. Another reason is &quot;fire safe cigarettes.&quot; They are made to self extinguish, reducing the odds of burning furniture when dropped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d guess most of the retardant overuse has little to do with conspiracy but are a combination of (a) ass-covering against lawsuits, (b) the Western attitude that technology is inherently good, and (c) the fact that flames are visible and scary while infertility is subtle, invisible, and less intermediately frightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who works with flame retardants to develop foam padding formulations I can say first hand they definitely work to prevent rapid spread of flames. There are potential hazards of the chemical that deserve more investigation on health impact but once you see the difference in a flame test of a sample with FR and a sample without FR you would agree they have utility.</p>
