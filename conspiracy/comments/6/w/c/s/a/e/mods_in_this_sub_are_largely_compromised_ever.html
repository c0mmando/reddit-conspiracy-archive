       The nwo was only a concern with bush and Obama, trump is different. Somehow. Enough that mods on a conspiracy community take government statements as cold fact, and every counter voice is blasted as a shill. Fuck everyone who doesn't question the official story, at least a little bit.

       You don't have to "resist"but pretending all is super, thanks for asking ,is way more out of place here than not trusting the president.

       Exactly. Militias and more rignt leaning people bought a shit ton of guns while Obama was in office. They didn't trust the government at all. Lulling those people into a false sense of security with a president who was 'on their side' was the easiest way to continue down the path to NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do get why it's hard for them to see. In 2008, I was so excited about Obama, I believed he'd close Guantanimo and tax the rich and work on our broken system. Instead we got drone strikes. And more wars than we know what to do with. They system is bigger than the president. They make you think 'your guy' won so you'll shut up and sit down.

         There will be a NWO, but there is more than one choice about how it will be structured.  Russian style or EU style.

         Obama did issue an EO to close Guantanamo, Congress repeatedly reused to fund the closing even though the military supported it.

       I think you misread me. I know that Obama was obstructed at every turn on every good thing he tried to do. I was trying to make a point about how disappointing it is when you think someone is in office who's actually going to make a difference and then it doesn't happen. Whether it doesn't happen because congress actively works against the president or because the president actually only gives a shit about his own ego, it's hard to go through when your hopes were up so high. If anyone looks at voting histories and is honest with themselves it's pretty clear that both sides aren't the same.

       Russia is seeking to destroy the rights-based international order. He’s right, and it’s something that every freedom-loving American must be on guard against.

       And that includes people within the U.S. Government both the bureaucracy and the elected government and many of our very wealthiest individual citizens who have as you know been supporting  the election of the individual rights stripping elected for decades now.

       r/conspiracy is all about hollow earth and aliens. It was before the election took it over with mostly political conspiracies. We want both, if you don't like it don't read it. Because others say the exact opposite as well.

       Just because you think it's fake, doesn't mean other people don't want to read it. There's actually a decent amount of evidence for Hollow Earth. More so than many theories, and it spams across generations. Not saying I believe it, but I believe it's possible.

       No there isn't. Flat earth is a other Pandora's box conspiracy. It's not even a conspiracy. Who conspired to keep that from us? What purpose does it serve the elite?

       I didn't say it was a big deal, I said people may want to read it. I also did not mention anything about flat Earth, it's obvious psy-op BS.

       I've been into conspiracies for quite a while. NWO/global government plots are something I've been reading about since I was a little kid. After a while, you stop seeing new info (on this sub especially) and just see regurgitated BS. I've read into pretty much every single outlandish theory I can find, just because I enjoy it. Hollow Earth fits with the tauridal field theory in a strange way, and that's why I find it more plausible than some other theories. I would have to see some real evidence before I actually believed it though. I've also seen pictures of other planets that seem to show openings in the poles. But does that mean all the planets are hollow? No, it's just something to chew on.

       It's a conspiracy sub. There are real conspiracies, there are outlandish theories, and there is straight up BS. Thats how the sub has always been. You don't have to believe these theories to be entertained by the thought of them. I mean some of the stuff I've read about lizard people is some top notch sci-fi. Same thing with underground alien bases, and tales of the Annunaki. It may be real, it most likely isn't. But it sure is entertaining.

       Sure there is, but this sub used to host discussion about much of it as well. I mean it's a little bit different than sci-fi, fantasy, because it forces you to step back from your pre-concieved notion about the world for a moment. It's a healthy practice to shake up your perception of reality, as long as you don't get lost in the rabbit hole.

       Why can't mods just delete/ban political posts from both sides?  I came here originally for non political conspiracy: Religious, extraterrestrial, esoteric/spiritual, cryptozoological, etc.  I don't enjoy having to sift through political hit pieces from both sides.

       I could care less,  we all know politicians are guilty of a plethora of crimes.  Should be a rule no political discussion unless topic is X years old, nothing new or current imo.

       Sometimes the politicians commit crimes or are implicated in a conspiracy.   there  is no other mainstream subreddit where the story/link can be posted for reddit's users to see.  The trump subreddit and also the other mainstream subreddits take down anything that goes against their agenda.

       This sub had barely any political things going on before the election. Normal 9/11 and JFK but nothing that it is today. I don't think you would know. We even talked about Bigfoot!

       I didn't say it was a big deal, I said people may want to read it. I also did not mention anything about flat Earth, it's obvious psy-op BS.

       I've been into conspiracies for quite a while. NWO/global government plots are something I've been reading about since I was a little kid. After a while, you stop seeing new info (on this sub especially) and just see regurgitated BS. I've read into pretty much every single outlandish theory I can find, just because I enjoy it. Hollow Earth fits with the tauridal field theory in a strange way, and that's why I find it more plausible than some other theories. I would have to see some real evidence before I actually believed it though. I've also seen pictures of other planets that seem to show openings in the poles. But does that mean all the planets are hollow? No, it's just something to chew on.
