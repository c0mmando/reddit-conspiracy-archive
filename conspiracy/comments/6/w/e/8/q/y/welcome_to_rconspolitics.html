       Nice try flytape but nothing changed. It's been political since Donald Trump the most controversial president in history was elected. He should be a target for conspiracy as well as seen as an outsider friend to non-politicians (lol). He's just a man.

       Like it or not conspiracies usually involve a government somewhere and how is a government fueled? Politics.

       Avoiding politics is literally avoiding the conspiracies about why the nature of the politic and how it may affect you and others.

       I completely disagree. I think the internet is the perfect medium for propaganda, and has completely backfired in that it has actually made most people less informed, and more apt to fall for inherent biases and propaganda.

       The checks and balances in our government were created so that any one branch of our government could not have too much power. So that if
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       branch overstepped their boundary ( bypassing another branch to get their desired way), the other branches may come together and stop such action.

       I've encountered shills and some very real users here lately, and have engaged in some amazing discussions involving Arcana, the Occult, Princess Diana, and politics in the last 2 days alone. I don't believe the sub is lost just yet. Yes, there is an ever increasing amount of shills, but there are still the real ones here. I don't believe it is lost until we see official censorship begin, with comment deletions and ban lists of sites and links endorsed by mods. Do you have any particular examples? Sometimes it's just a bad day, I've had several on here. Stay strong and keep fighting.

       my point isn't that all the posts are political.  My point is that the sub is being astroturfed heavily by those parroting deep state buzzwords and talking points.  When reddit first started r/politics was a fascinating place, where discussions took place.  It is no longer an open and free discussion, as it has been coopted by corporations and the deep state.

       You're right. The change is very noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overnight the alt right started spamming fake stories, old stories, and bullshit talking points about the left. It's very obvious when the same people are getting the same fake stories to the front page at the exact same time.

       the sub has been mainly about politics since i've been visiting, and of course politics have ALWAYS been a scam, so nothing has changed. all the real conspiracies are downvoted, so it's a good idea to only browse new.

       browsing "new" is the only way to enjoy this sub, but that is often where i see the worst offenses of stifling discussion.  Any thread that has the potential to lead to open rational debate, is immediately brigaded, and washed downstream.

       The reason I made this post, Is that I saw three regular conspiracy posters called "nazi sympathizers" for questioning the events in Charlottesville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazi, and Nazi sympathizer are the new deep state buzzword for creating devision.  They present this issue a massive race war, when it's really just a very, very, very small percentage of people on the fringes of both sides.  Add to that the admitted use of FBI undercovers on both sides (participating, and who knows what else), and you have yourself the gameplan of the deep state in every country we have overthrown in the last 10 years.  Their playbook works, and they are now using it on the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy used to be a place to talk about issues, without descending into name calling.  Seeing the term "nazi sympathizer" thrown around this subreddit is terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is not a vague topic.  The loony right has a right to protest about whatever they want.  You give them power by paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many that want to keep the left right paradigm going on here, so honest, good discussions about looking UP don't take place anymore.
