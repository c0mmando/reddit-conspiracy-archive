        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">122</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all,</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed the slight upheaval on the mod team in the late hours of last night. Sadly two of our moderators (flytape and sarah_connor) decided to take it upon themselves to remove all of their co-mods without even so much as opening a discussion. </p>

<p>This occurred in the context of the mod team actively voting to remove Sarah_connor as acting head mod, due to previous incidents of a similar nature. After Sarah_connor removed all of the moderators sans discussion, two moderators (flytape and dronepuppet) were then added back to the team while a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nbn5J4j.png">strange announcement was posted</a>. These actions were done without consulting any of the removed moderators, and were entirely unexpected and unwelcome. </p>

<p>As the moderators had already come to consensus with regards a vote to switch our acting head moderator from <a href="/u/sarah_connor">/u/sarah_connor</a> to <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> (who is, indeed, our lead <em>active</em> moderator), the decision to remove all moderators last evening was seen as retaliation for that vote in the eyes of the site administrators. For clarity, the admins of reddit <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal">explicitly prohibit retaliation against moderators who vote to change their acting head moderator.</a></p>

<p>As such, the site administrators came in and reverted the mod list to exactly as it was before the incident yesterday (minus a few permissions for the mods who had acted without consulting the full team).</p>

<p>Over the weekend the mods will discuss internally as to how to best address the two moderators who remain on the team (sarah_connor and dronepuppet). Flytape has resigned after his attempt to take over the sub from what he felt were hostile forces failed.</p>

<p>The mods, again, want to reiterate our commitment to impartial moderation and the defense of the free exchange of information; however, in situations such as this, it becomes clear that the tactics being deployed on the modern web in the pursuit of information control are growing ever more nuanced and complex.</p>

<p>In that way, we encourage all users to keep an eye on our public mod log as well as meta subreddit threads as they are posted; without your help, there is simply no way we could ever deal with the large influx of outside agitators currently using this subreddit as a battleground.</p>

<p>This entire ordeal exhausted the mod team, and we&#39;re sorry that it happened; hopefully the subreddit will be better off going forward, and we hope discussion here will be civil. </p>

<p>With our regards,</p>

<p>The mod team</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, here&#39;s the time line.</p>

<p>3 weeks ago Sarah_connor removed all permissions from the moderators. This was overturned by the admins instantly Sarah acted without consulting the team.</p>

<p>2 wees ago the mod team opened a vote into removing Sarah_connor and handing top acting mod spot to <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>.</p>

<p>That vote concluded this week at 8-0 in favor of switching the head mod from Sarah_connor to <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> .</p>

<p>Yesterday, to stop the vote from being finalized, flytape and sarah connor removed all of their fellow mods.</p>

<p>The reddit admins found that action (removing all of the mods) to be retaliation for taking the vote to swap Sarah_connor with AP, and as such the changes were reverted.</p>

<p>Flytape resigned on his own after the admins reverted the changes.</p>

<p>Flytape also strangely admitted openly that he and Sarah_connor retaliated against their fellow mods as a result of the vote to hand the top spot to AP;</p>

<p>Flytape said publicly in drama yesterday that;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6FXAuk8.png">Yeah there was a group of mods trying to vote off our top mod so we removed them all to sort out who we could work with or not.</a></p>

<p>He demanded all moderators sign up for slack before permissions were returned. Although some mods had concerns, most signed up. Sarah_connor then never appeared in the slack.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t explain himself  or follow up after that, so that&#39;s why we made the vote to switch the top spot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit has close to half a million subscribed.  I&#39;m inclined to agree with you since neutering this sub was the logical next step needed in controlling the narrative.  Particularly concerning since an admin stepped in to wrest control of the sub from a couple mods who clearly weren&#39;t on board with the direction this website as a whole has been taken, and the admins&#39; actions are dictated via making reddit into a viable money-making business for their investors; not having a free and open platform for truth and their userbase.  (Incidentally, reddit raised another 200 million in funds last month, are valued at 1.8 billion, and their CEO threw out the idea that they are on the road to an eventual IPO.)</p>

<p>That being said, transparency is appreciated and everything AATA stated rings true even if, hypothetically, it was a bunch of shill mods, democratically and by reddit&#39;s owm rules, voting down SC from head mod in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SC was the perfect mod.  He was here before the shills got rolling, so is above suspicion (and Flytape too), and he didn&#39;t spend time censoring the sub.</p>

<p>I trust AAtA somewhat because TMoR hate him.  Still, this shifts the balance strongly towards the pro-censorship, pro-shill, pro-pc mods, and is a very bad move.</p>

<p>For the board go work as it shpuld and progress to where it should go, it needs both stability and trust. Trust among the mod team and trust in the community <em>of</em> the modteam.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the way Reddit&#39;s hierarchy is structured,  anyone who outranks you can undo anything that one below them does. </p>

<p>Are you familiar with the term</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As above so below. As below, so above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;ve come to believe in that in most things ironically, and reddit isn&#39;t any of them.</p>

<p>More answers most likely tomorrow - but know that large majority of us wanted two specific moderators to answer for the actions and it will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Flytape&#39;s bias isn&#39;t a secret, and has since started <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a>, a safe space for &quot;Right ONLY Conspiracy chatter.&quot; lol.  </p>

<p>My sense is that most of the ShareBlue crowd had basically written off this sub some time ago--it&#39;s not a circlejerk like r/politics is. But there was an effort to turn more of the sub&#39;s members to further right causes through tactics of normalization--apologetics for white nationalists, the push to label antifa as a terrorist group, that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>The only attempted &#39;takeover&#39; here was the failed one by Flytape&#39;s crowd, which really only succeeded in turning the sub into a political battleground. We&#39;ll see what happens next. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flytape is a passionate person. Sadly the identity politics of the far left, and now the far fright with white identity have caused many folks to HIGHLY distrust the neocon/neolib agenda. Right now we have a president who has been nearly neutered politically, and is surrounded by the old guard Republicans and Democrats who wish him out. Many in entertainment, media, education, and other parts of  government feel exactly the same way, and do not want their plans of &quot;progress&quot; to be in any way derailed. It has turned into an all out information war. The traditionalists and conservatives have a few powerful friends, but they are divided from one another and surrounded themselves by a sea of terrifyingly powerful people from every area of influence. This progressivist cult has seeped into all sorts of societal structures and it has made their agenda nearly impossible to fracture. </p>

<p>If you cannot see that we live in really, really, really strange and scary political times, then you are naive, or are intentionally blinding yourself to reality. If you cannot see who the dominant powers are, and what their agenda is, then I do not know what to tell you. This place (whether you like it or not) is surprisingly influential among opposition groups, and is targeted by those who favor the so-called &quot;centrists&quot; and neolibs/neocons (the establishment). Right now we ARE witnessing conspiracies within many governments throughout the world. Planned coups and government take-overs, assassinations, and blackmails. Where else are we going to talk about these thigns if not here??? I would really like to know. </p>

<p>Also most conspiracy theories are either loosely or intimately tied to politics. You know this is the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we have a community discussion about what the proper relationship between the mods and the users is? </p>

<p>For instance, a lot of the controversial decisions (contest mode, unique flair) we&#39;re supposedly put in place to protect the users from brigading. I however, do not need protection from brigading and would prefer the threads just be left alone. </p>

<p>Also this notion that r/conspiracy has to be the counter-balance of opinion on Reddit (similar to how Fox News sees themselves as a counter-balance to the &quot;mainstream&quot; media) seems misguided. Just because an idea is being entertained in r/politics shouldn&#39;t mean that we automatically take the opposite opinion, or that we have to act as refuge for groups of partisans that find themselves marginalized rightly or wrongly by the rest of Reddit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you make biased judgements of people based on emotion instead of reason. No offence intended, just something I&#39;ve observed about you over the time I&#39;ve been on this sub.</p>

<p>No. Most other subs don&#39;t appear to be magnets for people who actively dislike the subject being discussed in that sub. If you thought golf was a shit sport and a waste of time (a perfectly valid opinion), but chose to hang out in <a href="/r/golf">/r/golf</a> sharing that opinion on a daily basis, the other users might show you the door, no? I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/golf">/r/golf</a> has that problem, but we as hell do.</p>

<p>Unfortunately <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (in particular) attracts time-wasters and sophomoric self-styled skeptics who want to hone their debating skills and/or pontificate their political opinions and who have no real interest in learning anything or getting to the truth.</p>

<p>oh my gosh, reporters have special access to politicians? I had absolutely not idea! /s</p>

<p>How did you think journalism works?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have no problem with the revolving door relationship between the Trump admin and Breitbart though, right? An example of blatant and literal collusion between a known propaganda outlet and a sitting POTUS.</p>

<p>But no, a political campaign setting up closed door interviews must be evidence of some terrible collusion....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are not many large and diverse places left like this to hold dissenting opinions. There is something almost sacred about areas that allow for open discourse. This place is certainly not perfect, but seriously it is one of the only places left. It seems misguided to me to allow the few places left to be subverted by people parroting and supporting the predominant wings of power in the western world.  The neolib/neocon way of thinking has subsumed nearly every board concerning current events on reddit, and on other platforms. It should terrify people that opposing opinions are being attacked through well paid groups with well laid out strategic plans. We are no longer seeing them take things inch by inch, but now they are coming in the open. If we hold an apathetic attitude these days, then we are surely doomed. The marginalization you mentioned feels more intense than ever before. I fear it will soon border on, and then cross to persecution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed post and the transparency! Awhile back I wrote to the moderators about a series of Holocaust denial posts that were brigaded to the top of this sub and cited rule violation #11. They were sensationalist propaganda full of &quot;facts&quot; that were unverifiable, untrue and misleading. If you want to post facts that show that the official narrative of WWII is not entirely correct and provide facts that show this, go right ahead. But these posts didn&#39;t do that and were easy to debunk by a 5 minute google search. Sarah_connor wrote back a super snide/shitty/snarky comment stating that if I didn&#39;t like reading posts like this (intentionally misleading propaganda) that I should just go somewhere else. I almost threw in the towel right then and there on this sub. But instead I chose to draw attention to it and submitted a post about how the language used by Alt-Right, White Supremacist websites (Daily Stormer, etc) mirrors a lot of the language used in posts and comments here and concluded that Alt-Right Nazis are brigading this sub. My post was predictably downvoted to hell and I received a lot of personal death threats in my private inbox, all things I expected. But what I didn&#39;t expect was the mod axolotl_peyotl to respond to my post and say that not everyone here is an alt-right hack. He even removed some of the Holocaust Denial trash posts from the front of the page, which was the right move because they were garbage, violated rule 3 and 11, and fed into the image of this sub as an alt-right breeding ground. He restored my faith in this sub, sarah_connor just served to divide and push moderate conspiracy theorists like me away. Believing conspiracies is not exclusive to the alt-right and more people here need to understand that. Real conspiracy theorists know that being politically affiliated is pointless and only serves to divide people. </p>

<p>Tldr the mod sarah_connor is likely a t_d or daily stormer shill or at the very least sympathizes with anti-Semitic Holocaust denial bullshit. Axolotl_peyotl rocks and is by far the best, least biased mod we have here! Keep up the good work! And fuck sarah Connor. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen so far, it would seem that a handful of people researching, then pursuing top mod removal over a petty offense seems like a takeover, or inching closer to it.  One fairly inactive mod, and another partisan minded mod is hardly a takeover, since they were already at the top.</p>

<p>But who knows.  We have the leftover faction&#39;s pov here, which is loudly celebrated by the most notorious shills on the board.  And one of the few mods fighting off the brigade is gone, with a couple others apparently on their way out.</p>

<p>So, who&#39;s takeover is it, really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. Yes, you made it clear. I just wanted to make sure readers understand that r/conspiracy welcomes all types of conspiracy discussion, and that we should be civil to one another when engaging in touchy subjects. When someone who &quot;questions&quot; the holocaust narrative on other subreddits, they will be told &quot;Oh, so you are a conspiratard! You need to go to r/conspiracy!&quot; So, those poor souls have nowhere to go to tell their story, so they eventually do end up coming here as they were instructed to do. But, upon arrival they will realize that they are welcomed, and that their opinions will be treated with the same respect as the posts about the pink-polka-dotted shape-shifting alien lizard that fathered Chelsea Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I have a slightly different experience with this sub it seems. Sure those people you are talking about exist, but there are also people who come here to peddle propaganda. There&#39;s a fine line between holocaust revisionism and holocaust denial / nazi propaganda, and that line comes down to evidence and facts that can be verified. Some of the mods here didn&#39;t seem to understand that. Maybe a few years ago this was a place where people could come and share their conspiracies about anything and they weren&#39;t insulted. But that&#39;s not what this sub is like anymore. This is not a safe space. I&#39;ve been called a psychopath, an idiot, crazy, insane, moronic, etc multiple times on this subreddit. And if I even attempt to point out that white supremacists are brigading this sub, I can add death threats to the list also. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I hear you, and I think I know where you are coming from. I&#39;m a Jew, and I get drunk now and then and talk shit about my people. So what happens? I get banned from r/Israel and my son was so pissed he wouldn&#39;t talk to me for about a whole day. My son wants to move us there. But the truth is, I love Jews. I look up to them, and I know what my people are capable of accomplishing. We can be a big help improving the current mess the world faces. But for some reason, Jews don&#39;t want to to do that, and it breaks my heart. I guess I am an old school liberal that is part of a dying breed. These young, new liberals are doing everything all wrong. I can only speak for me. I can&#39;t speak for anyone else; even the Jews who were murdered in the holocaust. I feel sorry for them, and it angers me that they were treated so horribly before being murdered. But I didn&#39;t experience what they went through. I didn&#39;t experience what black people, who have suffered racism for being black, have had to endure. But I feel sorry for them. And, I feel sorry for paranoid white people who are scared shit-less about their future because assholes like Alex Jones (who is a Mossad agent,btw) loves scaring these people to death, and then these paranoid white Gentiles are called &quot;Nazis&quot; when actuality they hate Nazis. </p>

<p>Seriously though, with how many NeoCon and Zionism shills are on this /r/ it would surprise me if there weren&#39;t Nazi shills basically doing the same thing.

<p>Right wing politics have been using conspiracy theories to attack their enemies, and many far right wing groups use the same strategy against Jewish people.

<p>I know he has been accused of being a shill/compromised before, but to me it always seemed like the anti-Flytape crowd was suspiciously organized and I personally never saw any action by Flytape that indicated he was a shill.</p>

<p>One thing we do know from looking at the comment section of any highly upvoted post, this community is absolutely infested with shills and they are working OT to take over the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question, why was anyone trying to change the mods....... And why did two of the mods possibly violate the rules of Reddit to the point that the Admins needed to step in? </p>

<p>There&#39;s an awful lot of &quot;why&quot; here. But seeing as Flytape was pretty open about his political positions, and he&#39;s even started his own right wing political sub I have my suspicions as to the &quot;why&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would be a whole lot different if a mod squad formed to remove Flytape for political reasons. Instead it seems like he was involved in self-initiated moves that left others in the dark and required intervention. Not sure what the relevance and authority of a &quot;top mod&quot; really is for a sub, why all this drama was necessary. Still I see Flytape has a history of de-modding and then returning to the sub so there has always been something salty there. He&#39;s of the opinion that the sub is now another anti-Trump circle jerk, but I&#39;m not sure how he thinks this will be enforced-- nor why he felt the need to create a r/conspiracyright and claim Trump supporters are being actively marginalized here. Reality does not comply with this view to anyone with eyes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stuck with this place because all parties and factions can be seen as suspect and all conspiracies (legit or psyops) can be brought up and discussed. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that Trump supporters are being marginalized here is ridiculous. I hunk it&#39;s just that it&#39;s been an absolute free for all over the past year, and they&#39;ve become so accustomed to having the run of the place that they can&#39;t handle it now that Trump is in office and taking some heat.</p>

<p>The Trump/Russia conspiracy is at least as relevant as most of the politically motivated crap coming out of right wing media, I think far more credible........ And the fact that they use double standards when they look at the evidence shows that they&#39;re only concerned about the politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll sleep like a baby.</p>

<p>But in total honesty, you have no fucking idea the mod drama that happens in this sub: I&#39;m on mobile so this may not be as well written as I would prefer, but let me provide a bit of insight into some history;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit as an active daily user for over ten years. On conspiracy for a very large portion of that time.</p>

<p>Wax has been a defunct mod for my entire tenure, his removal request, to the admins, was ignored many times.</p>

<p>I trusted the judgement of the other mods and made no edicts or reversals of their actions and attempted dialogue through mod mail on various matters. I explicitly created a sticky that said that this was not a political battleground. Other mods bitched and removed it and we moved discussion to modmail, yet the cats could not be herded and no consensus was made.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve drafted policy to which no clear agreement could be arrived at.</p>

<p>Another is that I stated that we need mod votes on certain topics, but I stated publicly I was not in the position to ban users as I wanted the community to be inclusive - so I chose not to participate in bans, but I stated multiple times that users who politely request unbanning be the policy, with a vote from mods, and that it was the job of the banning mod to unban. That process has worked well.</p>

<p>There are some real jerks who mail the mods when they get banned.</p>

<p>Now, to this discourse; I have personal IRL matters that consume the majority of my attention, and I agreed to step down and be lowered on the mod list, I may have fucked up and changed APs perms, but I didn&#39;t mean to, and honestly I don&#39;t recall doing that. I asked him to contact me prior to any action taken - I wasn&#39;t contacted (I asked him to email me at my IRL personal email) </p>

<p>I told him to restructure...</p>

<p>Then SHTF, and a mod that I completely disagree with politically  called me and we had a discussion - and I reinstated him, he was the only person who has actively tried to have conversations with me outside of modmail.</p>

<p>I had created a slack group to move discussion out of the preview of admins and other mods failed to use it effectively - but at the same time my IRL shit took my attention elsewhere (my kids birthday was this last weekend and I have had several deaths in the family plus other shit I need to deal with)</p>

<p>We have 481k users - can&#39;t please them with a mod team that is 0.00004158% of the SUBSCRIBED user base in a topic surface area as wide as this sub is. We aren&#39;t managing memes (no offense to meme /r/ related mods)</p>

<p>So... the admins swooped the fuck in within minutes of my &quot;recess&quot; post - and threatened us.</p>

<p>Now the admins fucking swooped in again and killed my perms.</p>

<p>Yet they defended fuck pedo subs, picsofdeadkids and other abhorrent content - but when the political shit hit the fan, the admins are all over it.</p>

<p>If anyone is to blame to the state of the sub, it&#39;s the fucking admins.</p>

<p>I know that many people wear their political bias on their sleeves here, as I did - and I had literally multiple discussions with flytape on his politics on the phone and made my point clear that we don&#39;t need politics as a seemingly purpose of this /r/</p>

<p>Everyone can bitch all they want - I&#39;ve been here for ten years and have beeen accommodating to other mods more than anyone who is not a mod even knows.</p>

<p>But reddit is changing and fuck both sides of the political spectrum of idiots: I specifically made a post that we are apolitical. </p>

<p>The admins are manipulating the entire situation with them intervening when it suits their narrative and I guarantee not a single admin has the depth of experience with the content, user base, problems and complexity of this sub as myself and some of the other mods.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shitshow, the admins are fucking with your attention and there are mods that really know what they are doing from a community standpoint and we very much don&#39;t agree on our politics.</p>

<p>Finally, this sub has 481,000 subscribed users, and millions more lurkers, trolls, brigaders, etc... </p>

<p>So now I just have mod fatigue and &quot;life-mod-balance&quot; issues....</p>

<p>Not a single mod can say that I stepped in and fucked with them. Because a lot of the mod tenure is short, and the volume of content is high, we can all make opinions on too few data points.</p>

<p>Or, as a conspiracy theorist, the mod team has an admin shill on the roster :-) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are, they&#39;ll silence all discord by sweeping it under the misconception that you or anyone else is merely trying to (create drama|damage the sub|attack the moderators|create a splinter community) </p>

<p>Will there be users smart enough to realize this is going on? Yes. But they&#39;ll all be drowned out by the narrative citing the reasons above. </p>

<p>Even worse, anything conspiratorial discussion that happens in the short term will be drowned out by the drama and this itself will be an excuse to start culling any support of what you&#39;ve been trying to accomplish or say. I could see this clearly years ago, it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s already been an agenda pushing a certain narrative likely coming down from what you said yourself in another post, that it&#39;s the administrators poking too far into the mod team and trying to use the subreddit as a tool for something, but I&#39;m not informed enough to make a guess as to what the ultimate motive is. </p>

<p>The only thing that made me come out of an 8 month hiatus to post here was that the administrators stepped in and made a decision without consulting all of the moderators or the subreddit itself. That&#39;s reddits game now, and it&#39;s finally made its presence known here. </p>

<p>Archive what you say, start discussions on other places about it. Allow people to look at the events/discussion and make their own opinions. The streissand effect can go a long way for you there I guess. As far as continuing to fight here, [post deleted]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The correct answer is that you either don&#39;t become a mod at all, or of you do you leave your politics at the door.</p>

<p>Being a Pizzagate doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically a partisan. However, if you&#39;re a former moderator over at T_D, you openly admit that you&#39;re pro Trump and don&#39;t like Trump/Russia stories, and the first thing you do when you get banned from here is run to T_D to whine about it then chances are you&#39;re not fit to be a moderator.</p>

<p>Real conspiracy theories are not partisan. If you&#39;re hanging off the nuts of a politician, a political party or a political ideology then you&#39;re probably going to look at conspiracy theories along partisan lines. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been obvious to me for a long time that right wing politics, particularly Trump supporters have been using conspiracy theories to attack their political enemies for a long time. The only reason they come here is to spread bullshit conspiracy theories that were designed as Weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, that&#39;s crap. Since when did being a supporter of the President disqualify anyone from a mod position about conspiracy theory? Shall we poll every mod and demand the truth of who they voted for, how they&#39;ve registered, who they currently support? Maybe lie detector tests so we can make certain they have no political leaning? </p>

<p>Not sure why you&#39;re having a hard time understanding what he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s not saying FT&#39;s status as a <em>supporter</em> was a problem. He&#39;s saying FT taking specific <em>action</em> as a mod in favor of his beliefs was a problem. It&#39;s not about his thoughts, it&#39;s about his deeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with his personal beliefs.</p>

<p>It has everything to do with his statements and his actions. I already clearly outlined some of the actions he&#39;s taken that I feel impaired his ability to govern the sub from a neutral position. The fact that he immediately went over to T_D to whine about what happened here speaks volumes as to what his thought process is.</p>

<p>If someone supports Trump, that&#39;s fine...... Many reasonable people do. The issue comes about when moderators take steps to suppress what they feel are threads damaging to Trump, or start promoting and encouraging brigading and right wing partisan threads that they know serve no purpose other than to spread political propaganda. He&#39;s over at his new sub right now calling out for a person that was coming to this sub on almost a daily basis ( peyote coyote ) starting a dozen or more politically motivated threads.......... How is that reasoning impartial?</p>

<p>I removed all mods except for axolotl as I had said that I would step down as my position of &quot;top mod&quot; (number two mod.</p>

<p>Admins are complete assholes and suddenly stepped in, either due to someone on the mod team having a friend as an admin or due to admins finally after ten years realizing that free speech on reddit is something to limit control and profit from as a propaganda device.</p>

<p>I freaking gave all mods free reign to do what they saw fit. I made several attempts to ensure this sub was not political.</p>

<p>As an example, I have disagreed with flytape on many political issues. He and all mods are free to have their own opinions on anything, but this /r/ is not political. I fucking put a sticky up saying so and the other mods removed it. They couldn&#39;t come to any agreements about anything.</p>

<p>Now all of a sudden, after years of neglect, admins are stepping in for some reason? </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6FXAuk8.png">Yeah there was a group of mods trying to vote off our top mod so we removed them all to sort out who we could work with or not.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why admins decided to act, and it was because you violated the rule about relation for holding a vote to transfer the mod spot. You cannot simply wholesale remove moderators without consulting the full team and achieving consensus, that&#39;s what admins have now laid out quite clearly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Effective mod authority is based entirely on <em>seniority</em>. When one person is made a mod even one minute earlier than another, the former has the ability to de-mod the latter. </p>

<p>Moreover, Sarah had agreed to be bound by the vote, and in order to  comply with the decision, the <strong><em>only</em></strong> action that needed to be taken was for Sarah to de-mod himself,  period. (yes, him). </p>

<p>Had Sarah done this, the other mods would have moved up one rank organically. We had agreed to re-mod Sarah, who would have migrated from the top to of the list to the bottom. That was the agreed deal - accepted by all parties, including Sarah.</p>

<p><strong>But that is not what happened</strong>. Instead, <em>Sarah de-modded everyone</em> on the list except for Axolotl_peyotl, <em>whose moderation permissions were removed entirely</em>. </p>

<p>Next, Sarah re-invited Flytape, a move which would have put him in the second active position (AP having been made powerless), and allowed Fly to gain seniority over THREE other mods that had been above him. Then DronePuppet was invited to mod - and accepted, in a move that would have propelled him above FIVE other mods that were previously his seniors.</p>

<p>The evidence provided shows that the intent of those involved was NOT benevolent for the interests of <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> or the mod team. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>

<p>I hope the above explanation and images clear up any misunderstandings that you and others may have had WRT the actions taken by SC, Fly and Drone, and their intentions.</p>

<p>Because the last time he took away all are perms the admins swooped in within <em>minutes</em>.</p>

<p>They made it <em>very</em> clear that they don&#39;t want a sub as large (and controversial) as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to go without moderation for <em>any</em> period of time. </p>

<p>Yes, and he attempted to make it <em>twice</em> and <em>both</em> times was countermanded by the admins each time.</p>

<p>Reddit has very specific rules about retaliating against other mods if you&#39;re a senior mod that has been voted off the island...it basically assures admin intervention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds reasonable enough, but I have a couple hangup/concerns, if you have the moment.  The first time it happened (1/2 a day?) we had what, an extra Bigfoot picture, and maybe 3 more shill accusations than normal?  The place wasn&#39;t &quot;unmoderated&quot; for any length, either time.  There were still mods in place, even if  very understaffed, for a tiny bit of time.  And if we&#39;re supposed to start trusting admins&#39; judgement on that, here, then you(s) have really jumped the shark.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;d like to see this &quot;specific rule&quot; you mentioned.  The only rule I&#39;ve seen that&#39;s loosely related refers to voting off inactive mods.  Any other votes are non binding, and still subject to tenured mod&#39;s whim.  AATA had a peculiar, <em>preexisting</em> interest in this topic, and seems to have orchestrated the whole thing perfectly, to pull this coup.  He ratted to the admins <em>immediately</em>, and had a premeditated outcome in mind.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if AATA was one of the primary instigators of this original mod voting.  Is he the one who was pressing for the vote(s)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a Trump supporter and he was pretty honest and open about it. That&#39;s not what makes a shill. Moderators will have their own leanings and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. Balance is good.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have a well funded group of ShareBlue operatives (and perhaps others) manipulating this forum using tried and true shill tactics every single day. People try to play dumb here and pretend they don&#39;t see them, but this is yet another manipulation tactic. <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> was one of the few people that cut through the bullshit and banned them. I don&#39;t agree with the way he worded some comments, but I think he was working in good faith to protect the community from the poison that has ruined most of Reddit already.</p>

<p><a href="https://paste.ee/p/PoQRk">https://paste.ee/p/PoQRk</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that Reddit, being the left leaning and biased company that having gone so far as to spend money to re-write how Reddit works in order to prevent conservative subreddits from reaching the front page while empowering leftist subs to constantly overwhelm the front page that it would likely not allow it&#39;s leftist users to be lambasted in the way that it allows it&#39;s conservative users to be lambasted. And frankly, I doubt Reddit admins would allow an organization that was the antithesis of Shareblue to operate on its service the way it allows Shareblue unfettered access everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because Trump is incompetent and his team is now run by Pence, and there&#39;s nothing to gain anymore since his base is geriatrics in Mississippi who don&#39;t go on reddit.</p>

<p>Other than T_D fanatics, the only non-lefties left on reddit are people who would and will and have turned against Trump, and this is one of the last subs where a broad audience comes together to discuss these issues.</p>

<p>So, now I&#39;m hardly worried about trump fanatics who post lame trump spam.  It&#39;s the threads that appear where 50 people comment in a row echoing the same - usually mocking of this sub and its community - sentiment.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s true. Notice the first spike in August 2016 immediately following Hillary Clinton&#39;s infamous speech. The alt-right is a fringe group with no actual influence. The buzzword propaganda involved conflating Donald Trump and his supporters with racist alt-right groups. In reality, very few Trump supporters are part of the alt-right simply because the alt-right barely exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the fuck would Trump be expected to attack groups and individuals that have nothing to do with him? Why the fuck would it be good for America if Trump attacked Putin? Do you <em>want</em> WWIII? I don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t you publicly attacked Canada? They could invade us at any moment. You must be part of the Canadian plot to overthrow the US. It&#39;s the only logical explanation.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Inflate boogeyman from practically insignificant threat.</li>
<li>Launch media campaign to associate political opponent with boogeyman.</li>
<li>Gaslight political opponent for failing to denounce imaginary enemy.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>The Deep State is a far bigger threat to America than the alt-right or the alt-left or Putin or Canada. The mainstream media is a Deep State propaganda operation. They are responsible for inflating the alt-right boogeyman. There are only a few thousand white supremacists in a country of 350 million and yet somehow <em>the Nazis are coming</em>. Could be, but the attack comes from within the intelligence community, not from some skinheads holding rallies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop lying.  The term isn&#39;t new as you&#39;ve now admitted.  The association of the alt right and Trump&#39;s campaign was self selected by the alt right who turned out to support in droves and by Trump&#39;s campaign which has strong associations with the Mercers who are major sponsors of alt right content, such as Breitbart which Steve Bannon previously described as the platform of the alt right (even though he is now very dishonestly trying to distance Breitbart&#39;s image from that of the alt right).  </p>

<p>Which is what is going on here.  Breitbart and Bannon were all on board with the alt right theme when it suited them but now it&#39;s less convenient the gaslighting commences.  Oh we were never the alt right, the alt right doesn&#39;t even really exist but is just a buzzword, Hillary!, Trump and the alt right have nothing to do with each other!  All that pro Trump/pro alt right content is totally genuine and organic but there are hardly any of these people creating this mass of content - they barely even exist!  By the way, what about the alt left which is totally not a buzzword we just made up as propaganda all while projecting our own dirty tactics onto everyone else...</p>

<p>Who is it you expect to fall for this nonsense at this point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, do a similar search for alt right, the term that extremists on the right used to lighten the view on them.. but literally, here&#39;s the results for interest in alt left in the same timeframe: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=Alt-left&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;tz=-120">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=Alt-left&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;tz=-120</a></p>

<p>So who made up what? Who got elected by creating a term that didn&#39;t exist? </p>

<p>Literally, look up alt right, you find the Nazis and the KKK trying to soften their look.. but Trump was the one who popularized the idea that the left is as extremist as the right.</p>

<p>And last truth bomb.. the alt right are the equivalent of the terrorists, the (((Muslims))) you hate so much.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of funny, I don&#39;t run into hate speech from Muslims as much as I do from the right.. but then again, this is a war between religions, neither of which I agree with.. but there&#39;s only one side I see daily hate posts made by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, thank you, I needed a good laugh.  </p>

<p>Come on. Obviously Trump popularized &quot;alt-left&quot; in mockery of the fad created by Hillary Clinton to conflate the alt-right with Donald Trump and supporters.  </p>

<p>You laid it all out right there in your post, but then missed the point. Yes, the <em>actual</em> alt-right is a bunch of neo-Nazis and white supremacists. This is exactly why we see the effort to conflate Donald Trump and supporters with the alt-right, even though there are hardly any actual alt-right people in the entire country.  </p>

<p>Shrinking: it ebbs and flows. Your polls, unreliable though they might be, probably show that. I&#39;m curious to see how the whole Nazi line of attack works against his popularity, principally with respect to the three groups who comprise his lines of defense: Congressional representatives, the US military, and (at a very remote and God-I-hope-this-is-irrelevant level) the 2A folks.</p>

<p>As long as these three groups are solidly behind Trump, it really doesn&#39;t matter how unpopular he becomes with the rest. 2018 midterms are going to be extremely interesting, in terms of the first group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have known dronepuppet and flytape for many years, and I don&#39;t think they are the same people (flytape was active during multiple instances where dronepuppet was vacationing without wifi for 1-2 weeks at a time, and drone would send pictures of his trips and such afterwards. I suppose he could have staged that whole thing, but that&#39;s a stretch. They also have widely different syntax which has remained consistently different over 3-4 years.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened with dronepuppet yesterday, nor do any of the other mods as of this point, but we hope to speak with him today and come to a decision by Monday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thankfully, that isn&#39;t my responsibility.</p>

<p>After my pedestal rant yesterday, I went ahead and reported about a dozen articles from the top down that weren&#39;t expressing conspiracy, but simply an anti-trump/pro-trump article you&#39;d find in political stronghold subreddits.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were simply crossposts.</p>

<p>Not that it matters to the drama here, but I also reported to the mods the thread in politics on trumps impeachment that got over 40k upvote score in 6 hour which severely outpaced their Sherrif Joe pardon megathread that had 37k in nearly a day and was stickied.</p>

<p>When I told the mods directly that the thread was botted, their response was &quot;there is no evidence to support that it was botted and we don&#39;t have any methods to detect that it was.&quot;  I found that interesting.</p>

<p>This place needs a mass overhaul on the Mod front. Mods, the people of r/conspiracy have spoken, we don’t want you, Your corrupt anti-left vitriol is tiresome, and ya’ll need to recuse yourselves because frankly, you suck.</p>

<p>I asked that question because I don&#39;t believe that person believes the &quot;muh russia&quot; stuff is garbage. Take his deflective reply how you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can look at my post history to see what it is like for someone trying to bring things to light.  im astounded my postings about the arizona situation was downvoted.  </p>

<p>anything focused on hillary, this obsession, is russia/t_d which are the same, which is really a mafia, which is really the point of this sub to investigate</p>

<p>more importantly i think the issue is that any individual espousing a certain set of ideas is unablet o get upvotes and ends up with everything at zero: anti-israel, pizzagate, anti-t_d</p>

<p>but what i think is really happening, the big picture, is that those of us who have been here for many years and have accounts that are evidence of ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL HUMANS, are being actively countered no matter what they say</p>

<p>sites like reddit, and their viewers, belong to multinational conglomerates(conde nast) and intelligence services(and i will provide my personal testimony that i have encountered undercover agents who are clearly acting on things they learned from my reddit posts</p>

<p>it could also be the case that individuals deemed unwanted, as in, not contributing the USAToday/enquirerer/readers digest/people magazine level of dialogue, are being pushed off the site so it can become a banal method for shoving cruft into the gullet of the proletariat and cogs in the machine who need some cheer while they enforce brutal social norms.  </p>

<p>and then, once you are on this or that list, you get a special filter on your user, more ads, brigades are informed of your posts so they  can immediately downvote them ie hasbara, monsanto, etc etc</p>

<p>and then your posts are at that point just you talking directly to the secret agents who are monitoring you patting themselves on the back about how they are protecting your freedom, when in fact they are about as patriotic as a mafia hitman or corporate spy.  </p>

<p>so i am looking for any humans who want to discuss these things, and i keep only finding people who dont act like real humans, over and over and over</p>

<p>just telling you what ive been seeing over the course of a while, and i dont know how any civil freedoms can be maintained if anyone who wants to encrypt an email is assumed to be making a bomb or looking at illegal porn</p>

<p>what do you think about all this?  am i human?  are you?  </p>

<p>But seriously, I am not even sure how to respond to this.  If the state of online information is controlled to this extent, then there are much bigger things to discuss than mod drama on this sub.</p>

<p>I want to believe there is already an underground where non-shills as you describe are free from shit like this.  I personally haven&#39;t found it, but to be fair, I haven&#39;t been truly looking.  Maybe one day soon I&#39;ll begin a voyage to find it.</p>

<p>What I do know is, reddit is not it.  4chan used to be it, but it&#39;s not it anymore and hasn&#39;t been since it went mainstream (2010ish IIRC).</p>

This sub should always be questioning the fascist political power structure, not openly cheerleading and advocating for it.</p>

<p>I  hope that this place can become much much less political than it has been recently. I miss the old discussions where people here could comment objectively about politics and actually employ critical thinking and civil debate into the political issues that fit what the sub is supposed to be. This sub should not act as a political newswire and dumping ground for for people&#39;s political shitposting. </p>

<p>I am glad to see something actually got done. Now is the time for people to watch closely the actions of this mod team in the coming month. Let&#39;s see if the tone and tenor of this sub can change back to a little more of what it used to be. The next few weeks will tell us a lot. I for one hope the overall health of this place improves    in the coming weeks and am looking forward to seeing if these guys can be successful in making this a conspiracy sub again. </p>

<p>Sadly two of our moderators (flytape and sarah_connor) decided to take it upon themselves to remove all of their co-mods without even so much as opening a discussion.
This occurred in the context of the mod team actively voting to remove Sarah_connor as acting head mod, due to previous incidents of a similar nature</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally found them as I was talking to you, I guess actually doing research to back up my points is a foreign concept to you.</p>

<p>The timeline as stated by OP:<br/>
they were a mod<br/>
demodded (<strong>not for the first time</strong>) by sarah_connor<br/>
re-added today  </p>

<p>the links I posted showed
they were a mod before yesterday<br/>
they were a mod a year ago<br/>
they were a mod in 2015  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think the most parsimonious explanation for this contradictory information in the web archive is? An elite group of hackers injected this information in there to further this narrative, but forgot to cover their tracks and left it contradictory? Or maybe this shit has been going on for awhile, and when a mod gets removed and readded to the team it will show the latest time they were added. Depending on when the snapshot was cached, you&#39;re going to have different dates for how long they&#39;ve been a mod. In which case, the oldest available date is the most relevant if you are genuinely concerned with finding out how long they have been modding here. </p>

<p>This is all real obvious stuff to someone actually interested in uncovering reality, and not just looking for a loophole that might allow they to be perceived as correct and advance their narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was thrown 18 feet off of a hell in a cell in 1998? /s</p>

<p>As to your question; reddit doesn&#39;t allow for entirely user curated content (and it would be dangerous for the sub as well), because people can post illegal content which can cause issues for reddit as a site.</p>

<p>For example; on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> 9/10 mods didn&#39;t know much about reddit, or how the admins apply standing &quot;precedent&quot;, etc. So, when users (inadvertently) pushed for more ability to post anything they wanted, the mods got overwhelmed and the community was banned within 72 hours for &quot;allowing doxxing&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the mods here have a perfect solution to this paradox; but the question you&#39;re asking (how can one moderate in the furtherance of freedom rather than the furtherance of restricting content) is probably the single most important facet of our shared digital age.</p>

<p>There are ways to be a moderator and encourage the free flow of information, just as there are ways to use one&#39;s moderation to advance an ideological or monied end. To that end, I think we come once again to the answer I was talking about elsewhere in this thread; vigilance.</p>

<p>If you see a user posting doxx to conspiracy that is freedom of sorts, but the reason we encourage you to report those instances is that the admins could ban the subreddit entirely if moderators don&#39;t remove them.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m not doing the best job of explaining this nuanced issue, as its early and my coffee is only 1/4 done lol; but yea, happy to chat more as I think you&#39;re onto something with regards your insight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only value this place has, and this goes for the rest of reddit as well, is the belief that it is a free venue of actual human thought; that it is a place where regular, honest and sincere people come together and share their thoughts amongst other like-minded humans.  Once that belief has faded and it becomes obvious that the words we&#39;re reading are just newly disguised versions of talking money, then this place will have absolutely no value to the users or those trying to influence them. </p>

<p>So long as there are people who believe reddit still is what it was created to be, there will be value in it. But once the users realize they&#39;re just reading clever advertising and agenda driven campaigns, this place will immediately die. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been coming here for years. And I&#39;ve seen it go through massive changes, none for the better. I personally believe this place first got the attention of the movers and shakers back when Occupy Wallstreet was first being organized. Back then, there were these posts counting down the days until this mysterious event, users were chiming in talking about how excited they were to finally be standing up. It was so small that it didn&#39;t even exist outside of these words on a screen. But once those words blew up into reality and a movement started growing and being seen by the big media, it wasn&#39;t long before the source was traced and this place and others like it started to change. </p>

<p>Suddenly this place had value for people who weren&#39;t interested in discovering and exploring new ideas. </p>

<p>The change happened so suddenly it almost happened without notice. Posts began coming in that shot down what others were propping up. A new element of naysayers filled with ridicule began to eat away at the discussions. Things became less about hope for change and wonder for the unknown and more about acceptance of facts and the shutting of doors. </p>

<p>It&#39;s foolish of me, even after witnessing this decline in discussion and content and lamenting the loss of truly inspiring users who used to fill this venue with their words of encouragement and orginal thoughts, I still keep coming here because I remember what this place was, and I&#39;ve always been grateful for its existence. To surrender it to (what appears to be) its ultimate fate of consuming itself from the inside is not something that i&#39;m interested in doing. </p>

<p>Perhaps it is the fate of anything of value to be destroyed by those who hope to pocess it. I hope not. But I&#39;ve grown used to seeing changes on here perpetually speeding it towards a seemingly inevitable demise. I commend all those who continue to try and prevent this place from falling. The fact that you&#39;re still here sharing new original ideas despite the state things actually fills me with more hope than when this place was flourishing. It&#39;s certainly not easy. </p>

<p>I know I PERMANENTLY vacated R/politics and many others did after the DNC nomination.  Thats why this is happening now I think. People lost faith in r/politics. You think letting the replace brigade will help this subreddit? I think not</p>

<p>I&#39;ve vacated politics, but that was the goal of shareblue. This is the new form of censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone doesn&#39;t stand up for the free exchange of information the mod spots get filled with those who despise organic curation. So, we mod to ward off those insidious interests.</p>

<p>For example, I joined the mod team 3 years ago after I saw a mod try to ban all discussion about meta reddit conspiracies (such as censorship on other subs).</p>

<p>Turns out he was friendly with a bunch of default mods and was trying to ban discussion of reddit censorship here to protect his friends.</p>

<p>Its a dirty game in the back rooms sometimes, but keeping an eye on people is the only way to ensure the integrity of this platform without Aaron still being here :(.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lots of questions, why was sarah_connor being voted out?  what kind of behaviors?  what was she up to?  why was she voted in?  did she at some point change?  </p>

<p>why did flytape think the other mods, except sarah, were in on some fix?   </p>

<p>how are these erratic people becoming mods?  </p>

<p>why can&#39;t i get anyone on this sub to look into the arizona cps situation where the 5 year old girl was boiled alive by her newly adoptive mother after being stolen from her mother for questionable reasons and given to a creepy af 50 year old man who is in jail for multiple abuses, and where an active duty military intelligence officer is still in jail for taking part in the abuse?  </p>

<p>(that last part isn&#39;t related, but we are seeing actual evidence of the internal workings of the abuse network and my posts about it are being negated in favor of really absurd bullshit) </p>

<p>all told, there are now so many conspiracies evidence on fucking cnn that the people who have the actual capacity to investigate are overwhelmed, and potentially under attack themselves.  </p>

<p>it&#39;s been a wierd summer for me posting, odd phone calls and voicemails, internet interference, vpn interference, strange computer behavior requiring reinstalls, etc etc </p>

<p>this is a human tell you and everyone here that some real shit is up and the same forces want this sub gone.  </p>

<p>so it will someday be the line you hear &#39;oh we dont discuss conspiracies at reddit, just funny pictures haha! take that obvious evidence of systemic corruption in child protective services in multiple states somewhere else.  </p>

<p>The evidence of what is really going on is so beyond the pale historically, it does appear that america is entering it&#39;s final stages which will devolve into a series of brutal military dictatorships and assasination plots, tracking ancient rome, babylon and just about every empire.   </p>

<p>im considering steemit, the chan comments saying this site is entirely a hangout may be right.  im very curious how the mods may respond to this, and i will use such responses to determine how likely you may be real enough to have any positive effect.  </p>

<p>thanks for trying, i do believe some of you are</p>

<p>p.s. will someone tell the people who own reddit that i will FOR SURE stop posting and voting if they dont stop sending me ads.  my free posting and writing has to be enough for their greedy paws, which are now enough to fill several books, for which I would prefer payment to idiotic ads trying to read my fucking mind.  thanks for passing that on.  </p>

This place really isn&#39;t that influential, even on Reddit, let alone outside it. Yet apparently propaganda firms are spending millions to influence the political narrative on a non political based sub that doesn&#39;t even rank in the top 60 for activity or top 100 for user count on the 8th most popular website. </p>

<p>Shills exist sure, but I think it&#39;s far more likely you all just hate each other and screaming shill/ctr/medimatters/orange peel is far easier than actually talking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s read between the lines here a little.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Sarah_connor does crazy things.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, we&#39;ve all known Sarah_conor shouldn&#39;t be a mod here for a long time. Bans were going out like this was T_D. I&#39;m happy this insane behavior has been acknowledged by the moderator team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flytape has resigned after his attempt to take over the sub from what he felt were hostile forces failed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These detractors are paranoid and don&#39;t agree with the other mods (who haven&#39;t been Sarah_connor crazy, at the very least).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mods, again, want to reiterate our commitment to impartial moderation and the defense of the free exchange of information; however, in situations such as this, it becomes clear that the tactics being deployed on the modern web in the pursuit of information control are growing ever more nuanced and complex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence speaks novels. These detractors are exercising &quot;information control&quot; for someone. But based on Sarah_connor&#39;s crazy behavior (and flytape&#39;s paranoia) we know that this means they were diehard pedes. This insane paranoia is a huge part of the Trump fanbase. Go listen to some Mark Levine and hear the insanity that these guys have deluded themselves into believing. They believe that everything taught in schools is bent to a liberal agenda. They believe that the south were the victims of the civil war. It&#39;s amazing to listen to Levine because it shows you how completely controlled these people are, and they don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>These detractors have been agents for Trump through idiocy, ignorance and passion. They spread disinfo not because they want to hurt us but because they want to save us... and they&#39;re too ignorant to know it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that way, we encourage all users to keep an eye on our public mod log as well as meta subreddit threads as they are posted; without your help, there is simply no way we could ever deal with the large influx of outside agitators currently using this subreddit as a battleground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of &quot;outside agitators&quot; I like here because it&#39;s not just T_D that brigades here. We&#39;ve also been brigaded by liberal causes. Because they believe some of the parts of the conspiracy canon, we got along with the T_D folks. We both had a devoted interest in all the Wikileaks stories that the news refused to touch... and we all saw conspiracy grow with agitators from either side because this was the only sub where open conversation was happening about wikileaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This entire ordeal exhausted the mod team, and we&#39;re sorry that it happened; hopefully the subreddit will be better off going forward, and we hope discussion here will be civil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The front page already looks better. Thanks. You&#39;re doing the right thing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you make biased judgements of people based on emotion instead of reason. No offence intended, just something I&#39;ve observed about you over the time I&#39;ve been on this sub.</p>

<p>I know I PERMANENTLY vacated R/politics and many others did after the DNC nomination.  Thats why this is happening now I think. People lost faith in r/politics. You think letting the replace brigade will help this subreddit? I think not</p>

And that more real people have felt like this sub, over the last 1.5 years, became more overtly right wing than in the past, and specifically pro Trump. And now the facade is being removed. Just because a majority opinion is different from yours doesn&#39;t mean that the majority opinion isn&#39;t astroturfed. It&#39;s possible, but you speak as if it&#39;s an evident truth. It&#39;s not. People may just disagree with you. </p>
