Donald Trump is best friends with epstien and everytime he&#39;s brought up its always about Bill Clinton. Use some common sense folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wasn&#39;t pardoned for the fumbling of sex crimes. </p>

<p>He was pardoned because the federal judge would not allow him a trial by jury.</p>

<p>And that is because the judge knew that a jury would not find him guilty of contempt of court because he was treating illegal immigrant criminals harshly.</p>

<p>And treating illegal immigrant criminals harahly is something a good majority of Arizona&#39;s population supports because a lot of them left California over their saturation of Los Angeles and other surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Sheriff Joe has helped prevent his county into LA county and his residents appreciate that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If his residents hate him, the surely the federal judge would have let him have a trial by jury. But, the judge refused. Because he knows a good chance the residents would let him walk.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is the influx of illegal immigrant criminals. And by cracking down on them you also indirectly lower the amount of sex crimes.</p>

<p>But, people like you don&#39;t see that. You see it as him defending child molestors and rapists because he spends his focus on the bud of the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because only illegal immigrants commit crimes. You must be special. The majority of child molesting is done by people close to the child. Maybe we should protect those children too? But nah, let&#39;s just round up brown people. Look i got no problem if someone commits a crime to punish them. Harrassing people because of what they look like is something else. Guess you&#39;ve never been stopped by the police bc of the shade of your skin? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep putting words in my mouth? Did I say only illegal immigrants commit crimes? No. However, they are coming into the country in record numbers and as a result, the crimes increase.
It&#39;s simple math. More people &gt; more crimes. He&#39;s not harassing brown people. He is preventing illegals from walking across the border and arresting those that are connected to crime. The ones who aren&#39;t criminals are deported. And yes, I have been stopped by the police for the color of my skin at gun point. My dad (who is white) has had his tail lights broken by cops because he was out early putting up garage sale signs and they had hoped to stop a burglary in process.</p>
