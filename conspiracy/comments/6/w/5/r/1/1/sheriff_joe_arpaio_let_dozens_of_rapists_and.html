       If you are a Donald supporter and are always screeching about pizzagate, your boy just rewarded a real piece of shit. Thoughts? I don't want to see any partison bs anymore about this subject. We all I think can agree this shit happens along all spectrums of beliefs and ideology so just think about it for a second. Donald Trump is best friends with epstien and everytime he's brought up its always about Bill Clinton. Use some common sense folks.

       I downvoted you.  While I disagree with Trump going this route, I disagree with you coming in here to shit talk him.  Make the thread about the conspiracy behind why he did it, not why he is an awful president.  Because let's be honest, they are all awful.  But the conspiracy behind their movements, that is what we are here for.

       No I'm not talking shit about Trump. I'm talking shit to t_d people in this sub who just ignore anything to do with the GOP. I'm not insinuating Trump has done anything illegal with a child, I'm just saying they can't say bill Clinton was friends with epstien and not include Trumps friendship.

       Btw the 2nd top post is about the minecraft developer just proclaiming pizzagate is real. No information, just a link to a Twitter page that has not information. This sub is fucked my man. At least I provided some information. You want this to be t_d where we post a Twitter post or a picture and just upvote with no discussion then have at it.

       Wasn't saying he was. He never investigated dozens of sex crimes against children after funds were given to him to do so. Either he was protecting them or didn't think it was a priority. Either way this is the type of guy Trump pardons.

       Look dude. I'm over it. I don't give a care he was pardoned or why. I'm pointing out the man let dozens of rapists and child molesters continue without investigating. That is all. It has nothing to do with the doj probe, it's the fact he either looks the other way or thinks it's not important. That's it.

       He wasn't pardoned for the fumbling of sex crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was pardoned because the federal judge would not allow him a trial by jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is because the judge knew that a jury would not find him guilty of contempt of court because he was treating illegal immigrant criminals harshly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And treating illegal immigrant criminals harahly is something a good majority of Arizona's population supports because a lot of them left California over their saturation of Los Angeles and other surrounding areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Joe has helped prevent his county into LA county and his residents appreciate that.

       Actually his residents hate him. He was voted out. Again. I said he committed no crime in regards to sex crimes, I mainly pointed out that he looks the other way......

       If his residents hate him, the surely the federal judge would have let him have a trial by jury. But, the judge refused. Because he knows a good chance the residents would let him walk.

      <p>
       The bigger issue is the influx of illegal immigrant criminals. And by cracking down on them you also indirectly lower the amount of sex crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, people like you don't see that. You see it as him defending child molestors and rapists because he spends his focus on the bud of the issue.

       Because only illegal immigrants commit crimes. You must be special. The majority of child molesting is done by people close to the child. Maybe we should protect those children too? But nah, let's just round up brown people. Look i got no problem if someone commits a crime to punish them. Harrassing people because of what they look like is something else. Guess you've never been stopped by the police bc of the shade of your skin?

       Why do you keep putting words in my mouth? Did I say only illegal immigrants commit crimes? No. However, they are coming into the country in record numbers and as a result, the crimes increase.
It's simple math. More people &gt; more crimes. He's not harassing brown people. He is preventing illegals from walking across the border and arresting those that are connected to crime. The ones who aren't criminals are deported. And yes, I have been stopped by the police for the color of my skin at gun point. My dad (who is white) has had his tail lights broken by cops because he was out early putting up garage sale signs and they had hoped to stop a burglary in process.

       I don't know man. Either way I think stopping people bc of the way they look is wrong, I'm sorry. Because at some point it won't just be brown and black people and it will turn into everyone. It seems like we may be on the same page in general just a process issue.

       Read about this,   his office was contracted out to cover  a municipalilty,  they weren't doing their job, not only sex crimes but many crimes went without investigation or follow up , this is more of dereliction of duty than covering fr sex criminals
      </p>
      <p>
       Not enough evidence to prove it but from a few cases I read I think they may not have been spending much time or effort in crimes where the victims were illegals
