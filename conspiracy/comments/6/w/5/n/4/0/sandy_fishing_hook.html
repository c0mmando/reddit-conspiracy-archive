       Sandy Hook was a staged event carried out by child murdering pedophilia cults that have infiltrated aspects of the government and media and were backed up by the human trafficking Italian Mafia and paramilitary death squads. Sandy Hook was used as type of litmus test to sort out those that reject the official story and speak out. Those who spoke out against Sandy Hook's official story have been put on a list for persecution and execution. The fake story was the bait and the internet is the hook used for catching those that speak out. Anyone that looks into Sandy Hook can see the inconsistencies, flaws, and suspicious details. Realizing that members of the government and media were involved in carrying out a staged mass shooting of 20 children is shocking. Many immediately turn to cognitive dissonance to deal with this realization. Those initiated in secret societies were in on it and there are millions in the United States that are initiated into secret societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that the US government has legalized information programs through the NDAA with the intent for international use through their Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting network makes the media legalized liars that cannot be trusted. The VOA reported on Sandy Hook. The media's immediate response to Sandy Hook was disarmament of citizens. It is logical that a tyrannical government would seek to disarm citizens and go as far as staging mass shootings to do obtain their objective. Since it was the death of 20 children this makes it a sensitive subject. The reality is that the US government has murdered millions of children through trade sanctions, war, and hellfire missiles and they do not even deny this. Those involved with the Sandy Hook story signed national security contracts, were paid mostly through charitable organizations, and are members of secret societies involved in pedophilia and human sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some inconsistencies include Robbie Parker smiling on video less than 24 hours after his daughter was brutally murdered as the media reported, the death certificate released through the Freedom of Information Act that states Adam Lanza died the day before Sandy Hook occurred and in New Hampshire, the strange behavior from the coroner, green screen used by CNN during an interview with one of the victims parents, doctored photos of Adam Lanza, and many other details. The inconsistencies were intentional and the bait. Motives involving Sandy Hook include disarmament for enslavement, pay offs or greed, murdering those that speak out, and most of all for enabling human trafficking and pedophilia. Many came out strongly in defense of the story as if they were there and many of them are paid or more than likely pedophiles part of this larger agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lanza family are a Sicilian nobility and hold many titles through out Sicily to this day. Today Prince Pietro Lanza di Scalea is the head of the Sicilian Lanza family. The Sicilian Mafia are involved in human trafficking. The Hollywood movies that glorify gangsters as if they have some moral code is propaganda. The mafia are the most ruthless and despicable group on the planet. Ryan Lanza moved to New Jersey where the Italian Mafia have major influences over. It appears that Ryan Lanza helped to create the fake identity of Adam Lanza while residing in the town of Sandy Hook. Jeff Lanza is a retired FBI agent from Connecticut and this suggests the Lanza family have infiltrated the FBI. The private investigator Wolfgang Halbig while speaking with a woman on video mention the Italian Mafia threatening them. I have been threatened many times for speaking out against Sandy Hook myself.

       Thanks. I feel most that read this already know the Sandy Hook lies. I wanted to point out the Lanza family, Italian Mafia, and that they intentionally made Sandy Hook appear staged as bait at the end of their hook.

       Good write up. The Sicilian mafia abide by certain honour codes and killing children (or pretending to have children killed) doesn't really fit their "style of doing business".
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the US government and media were definitely in cahoots regarding Sandy Hook, but the missing element in your analysis was the involvement of the secret societies - Rosicrucians and Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post of mine from a couple of years' ago reveals a very direct link I discovered between The Georgia Guidestones, the Capitol and Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Guidestones are literally pointers, showing things to those who are able and willing to look. And if you look even harder you will find an owl connection between the three also.

       Then there was the dirty rumor of Adam lanza father having to testify on the issue of GE not paying taxes, the company he worked for as tax director. I say rumor cause I can no longer find an article, when they used to pop right up on joogle.

       I remember that. Some claimed he was to testify for the LIBOR scandal. Could be GE and him were involved and this was a way of getting out. Could of just been a rumor too.

       Nancy Lanza had no income at the time the marriage was legally dissolved, in September 2009. Her ex-husband, Peter Lanza, earned an annual salary of nearly $445,000 as an executive at General Electric and agreed to pay annual alimony of $240,000. That figure was scheduled to increase steadily for cost of living considerations, and Nancy Lanza was due to receive $289,800 in 2012, court records show.

       I positively remember there being much more information available on his part in the scandal/ge and how he was being used as an almost scape goat by the company. In the year or so after Sandy hook, I remember showing links/stories to friends to show them how weird it was..now you Google him all you see is that it was a rumor...whatever it was it was certainly a sticky situation. Peter lanza was in some shady deals with shadier people, saw a way to save his own ass and get rid of a bitch ex wife(240k for alimony my gawd) and queer son so went for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember Sandy hook happening, and remember doing my own research into it. It stunk from the start, with all the news stories not the same on what guns/how many shooters etc. Witnesses seeing men run into the woods, it was just a shitshow. The only strong point they had was that if it was true, it was too horrible to doubt cause it was
       <em>
        children
       </em>
       . I always look into who any perpetrator's family was, and there was tons on Peter. He WAS going to trial, but it all disappeared after the "tragedy". Just like the trillion$ the Pentagon didn't have to answer for after 9/11. False flag to get what they want, sweep some dirt under the rug, move on. It's bogus, and it's what they do.

       I have researched Sandy Hook for hundreds of hours.  There is 100% no doubt that it was a completely staged psyop (by the Government, DHS, etc), and no children died.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find very significant about your post is that you say that the Establishment drops enough "inconsistencies" so that they
       <em>
        intentionally
       </em>
       want the smartest people in the population to find out that the story was a hoax -- in order to identify them and put them on lists for future persecution/etc.  I also believe that to be true.  Nevertheless, I am not afraid and will continue to speak out.

       Great post here, but I would disagree on the hierarchy - the Jews/Khazars are subservient to the Vatican/Jesuits.  The Babylonian Talmudists that infiltrated the three major religions and created the political doctrine of Zionism are the same descendants of the mystery schools and Saturnalian cults that intermarried with European royalty and created the Black Nobility, the true Elite.  Even the Rothschilds and other banking families are ultimately subservient to these people.  The "Jews" are ultimately being used as the scapegoats for Elites to further inflame sentiment against them in order to further their eventual goal of the destruction of all three Abrahamic religions.

       What if what we saw was all staged on tv with crisis actors and such due to the aftermath of Columbine high school massacre. I remember so many people went after the family's of the 2 gunmen. Perhaps kids and teachers actually died but what the average person saw was all faked. Perhaps the media has to stage the event (pictures, all those kids waking out of the school, the staged ambulances from the videos) in order to keep the actual families that lost loved one safe. Hey but if I'm wrong or if anyone else has heard that theory let me know.

       They do use actors to cover up and imitate real events at times. This does not appear to be the case. This is also criminal when they do this especially when it is used for a political purpose like gun restriction. That is the very definition of terrorism. Using fear for political gain.

       If Robbie Parker is an actor, who never lost a daughter. Someone out there knows him. Someone was his 1st grade teacher, had the locker next to his in high school, etc . Someone would come forwards and call him out, and thus this whole "Operation" out. Or Robbie Parker showed up in his space ship, pulled off Sandy hook, then returned to his home planet afterward.

       The name Robbie Parker could very well be scripted.

       The actor that played Robbie Parker could very well have been living in Israel for the last 10 years.

       Return to his home planet = go back to Israel.

       It is suspicious that one document was dated the day before, but the second document shows that it was amended and the date was changed to 12/14/2012. Have you tried calling the coroner that wrote the document? His phone number is listed there.

       The most common phrase from those that defend Sandy Hook for being real is this; "children died at Sandy Hook" and I absolutely believe these Satanists sacrificed 2-3 children around that time and those were the bodies brought to the nearby hospital. Anyone who says this particular phrase appears to be in on those deaths.

       My high-school friends grew up with him. They called him the "briefcase kid" because he would always walk around school with one. He was socially awkward and had little to no friends.

       "Adam Lanza" (or the person in the photoshopped images) did exist. He was an only child who changed his name to "Ryan Lanza" sometime between leaving High School and College.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perpetrators of the Sandy Hook hoax pretended that Adam and Ryan were two people - brothers, and they pinned Sandy Hook event on the Adam Lanza identity - a ghost at that point. It was a conjuring trick.

       Well, the photos they circulated of "Adam" (pre Sandy Hook) are the same person as those circulated as "Ryan", post Sandy Hook. They weren't ever photographed together, which is telling. Since Ryan seems to have evaporated into thin air, it is quite possible that the person in the images is called something else altogether.

       I didn't say the whole thing isn't sketch. I don't believe Lanza did it at all. He was setup. But nothing you say proves he didn't exist at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Death Certificate the day before his death: He could of been killed the day before, and had his body dumped at the scene. I'd be interested to see that death certificate as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the topic of inconsistencies in regards to Ryan Lanza, it is really strange, but in no way points to Adam not existing. I'm not sure if you remember the coverage during the immediate aftermath, but originally the media was claiming that the shooter WAS Ryan Lanza. They quickly took that back.

       Some say these mass shootings are ritual sacrifices that make the news
       <em>

       I stated in the comments I believe they sacrificed 2-3 children around the time this fake mass shooting occurred and those were the children brought to the nearby hospital. The people who did this are child murderers. I would like a large scale search and investigation along the Connecticut and Long Island coasts just off the shoreline for remains of what I believe to be at least hundreds of victims including children.

       ""Sandy Hook was a staged event carried out by child murdering pedophilia cults""
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago I was debating someone on here about where all the children went of it was staged. I offered the theory that we are dealing with child trafficking victims. I believe it was around the time of the FF news reporter shooting. Which I was also theorizing with someone that much like the mafia grooms young people our government could be too with assassins or political actors. Much like Russia's sleeper agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       An as I was typing all this I started to wonder if the parents themselves are not child victims who have grown an been groomed for certain actions.

       I am have a theory that it could be possible that the parent are victims themselves who have grown up in it. So compliance is easy when it is all you have known since your kidnapping. At the same time it should not be crazy to think that there are families that have children indoctrinated an brainwashed since birth to be loyal actors of the state. Much like Russia's sleeper families or when a gangster grooms their child or  another to be their protege.

      <p>
       Lanza or Lancia. 
It was to descend from the dukes of Bavaria and was also related to the Sveva house, being a Bianca Lanza wife of Emperor Federico, king of Sicily. He owned the principals of Buonfornello, Castelferrato, S.Domenica, Malvagna, Sabuci, Ventimiglia; The duo of Brolo and Vizzini; The marquisate of S. Elia, of Ficarra; The barons of Bonfalà, Burgio Mancino, Carancino or Belvedere, Casalgiordano, Casalnovo, Cassibile, 
Castania, Ferla, Fessima or San Bartolomeo, Frascino, Galati, Giarratana, Longarino, Longi, Mojo, Nadore, Piraino, Riddidini, S. Martino, Valcorrente, Verbumcaudo, Xireni, etc. It was divided into the branches of the dukes of Brolo, and the principals of Trabia, from which were drawn the principles of Lanza, the principles of Mirto, the barons of Marcatobianco, and so on. We can not, as we would like, to say extensively of the various members of this family who are ecclesiastical for civil and military virtues and for the possession of charges and titles, but we are forced to mention only flying to some of them.

       Close, I doubt it has anything to do with pedophilia, sandy hook is where Gun Owners of America is headquartered. Sandy hook was a gun grab scheme plain and simple, modeled after the Australian one. You would have to be a complete regard to not see that this school shooting just happened to occur under shady circumstances with a gun-grabber president and leftist senators in office calling for Australia-style gun confiscation.
