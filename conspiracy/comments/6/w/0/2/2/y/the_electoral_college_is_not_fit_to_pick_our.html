<p>Look you guys got stuffed with 2 of the shittiest candidates, thats all that happened. Either way an asshole was taking the reigns. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be more concerned with actually having a federal government that necessitates the electoral college, than trying to address the flaws in it.</p>

<p>If Government was predominantly local with only a small federal authority to manage certain aspects, you wouldnt even need the electoral college.  </p>

<p>Because i&#39;m sure we can agree that an area the size &amp; population of CA has no concept of what a small town in Kansas needs... and vice versa. </p>

<p>It&#39;s completely irrelevant whether the audit changes anything or not. You can&#39;t change the rules to the game because you don&#39;t like the outcome. It is asinine to think that things would have happened the same way if there were different rules for the election.</p>

<p>He won by the rules that this country has literally always used to pick the president. If those weren&#39;t the rules, Trump almost certainly would have campaigned differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The electoral college is about state smoothing so that states have a say as well.  States should have a say in the government which is about 18%.  Trump won because he abandoned his efforts in California and clearcut states where he knew he would lose anyways.   California takes the biggest hit on this smoothing since it is the most populace state.  Wyoming is the biggest benefactor and that state has the most representation per person in the US.  I think it needs to stay to where states have 2 people to send to vote in their behalf.  The rest is simply population based.  The reason is that smaller populated states have always needed more say due to them being instrumental in the economy but due to more populous states like New York for example, their interests and say in the government would be squashed and their industry would suffer because of it.</p>

<p>Right now, there is a dangerous movement caused by the two party system&#39;s flaws and the understanding that politicians sometimes cannot deliver on their promises and that their promises should be taken as a sense of do they understand what they want.  If I ran, I would create a subreddit to where the people that represent me could post their issues and upvote and really relay where they are on  certain bills and certain issues that are coming up in the legislature.  This way I can provide almost instant feedback as well as understand what the people that I would represent wants and kind of relay with them on some of the information that the lobbyists are telling me on how it would impact my district so that I could vote on issues in a manner that properly represents my district.  My own personal issues don&#39;t matter as much as what the people and corporations issues are.  It would be interesting to say the least.</p>
