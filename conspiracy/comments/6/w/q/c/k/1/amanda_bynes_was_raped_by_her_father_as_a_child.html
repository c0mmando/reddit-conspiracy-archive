<p>She was probably also raped by Nickelodeons great Dan &quot;don&#39;t shed a tear, it&#39;s for your career&quot; Schneider <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1882849">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1882849</a> (my original post on Dan Schneider)</p>

<p>Here is a list of celebrities, politicians, journalists, and other influential people who have spoke about Pizza/pedogate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6wf2i3/with_minecrafts_notch_joining_the_fight_against/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6wf2i3/with_minecrafts_notch_joining_the_fight_against/</a></p>

<p>I also am using my personal YouTube to fight Pizzagate (I posted a FTWD video which has gotten 71,000 views and my other video got 33,000 and many of my videos are being picked up. My YT page has gotten 130,000 views)(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDpysO7IMrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDpysO7IMrY</a>) Figured I would try my hand at making a successful channel and bring the worlds attention to Pizzagate. Nothing sickens me more then what these animals to do to children. The channel is dedicated usually to apocalyptic fiction and gaming(nerdy I know), but with how fast it&#39;s been picking up figured I would use it to fight these monsters. </p>

Any time I post it I usually get some people thanking me for posting the content - since it is very very relevant evidence to support the claims made - but I also always get someone trying to shoot it down as &quot;she&#39;s on drugs&quot; or &quot;she has mental problems&quot; and also get the old &quot;have you got anything from the last 50 years?&quot; response.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I remember a thread not too long ago about an interview in the &#39;80s on a girl who was abused in a satanic pedophile cult (yes, you heard that right) and was rescued. Immediately there were posters vomiting nonsense about the Satanic Panic and &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; and, my favorite, &quot;she was coerced into saying those things!&quot;</p>

<p>Ignoring the nearly identical stories told to trained psychologists and psychiatrists in different parts of the country. These professionals, who had no relationship with one another, were convinced that these kids were telling the truth because, for one, the kind of details they go into can&#39;t be made up by children. The atrocities committed are only capable of being conjured up in the mind of a truly depraved psychopath.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Do you think there&#39;s a possibility that she realized nobody was going to act on what she confessed so she did what she could to protect herself against those who might continue to hurt her? </p>

<p>She&#39;s talking about being abused by close family members. The reason it happens so often with people close to the victim is because they can control the victim&#39;s behavior by being so close to them. If there is corruption involved (which in Hollywood show business is a given), then there is an argument to be made that she rescinded out of self-preservation.</p>

<p>And I agree - neither of us know for sure. With that said, I have just as much right to speculate as you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Louis West head of UCLA psych department long history with MK-Ultra</p>

<p>It used in Jack Ruby evaluation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He performed Jack Ruby&#39;s psychiatric evaluation, and he was in charge of UCLA&#39;s department of psychiatry and the Neuropsychiatric Institute for 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Head of psych department at UCLA history with MK-Ultra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>West did his psychiatry residency at Cornell University, an MKUltra institution and site of the Human Ecology Fund.[4][5] He later became a subcontractor for MKUltra subproject 43, a $20,800 grant by the CIA while he was chairman of the department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma. The proposal submitted by West was titled &quot;Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis and Suggestability” with an accompanying document titled “Studies of Dissociative States&quot;.[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other funding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in grants from the federal government, channeled through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a major funding conduit for CIA programs. Many millions more poured into the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute that West headed, including over $14 million in federal funds in one fiscal year before he stepped down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UCLA tried to remove West from his position:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a lawsuit currently before the Los Angeles Superior Court, it has come to light that the University of California at Los Angeles and UCLA Medical Center have, since the early 1980s, attempted to remove psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West from the roster of the university’s faculty.</p>

<p>One psychiatric colleague who asked to go unnamed described West as “supremely arrogant” and charged that he “misused his positions for his own ends,” at the expense of the university.</p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely curious are these people (and I also refer to the &quot;SJW&quot;-types, not just these 4chan lite -memers) aware how brainwashed they themselves sound by repeating all of these catchphrases and memes like robots?</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to feel like these people are not even real Trump-supporters and are just some government agency using memes like those Wikileaks -documents said about NSA/CIA using memes to socially engineer and manipulate online discussion.</p>

<p>Why the fuck would you quote some year old Trump memes when talking about horrific child abuse? And why would you also do the opposite, talking about horrific abuse but inserting snarky shit about &quot;nazis&quot; or &quot;altright&quot;.</p>

<p>WHO THE FUCK are these people? Why are they so articulate and well researched but act so childishly at the same time? Doesn&#39;t seem natural or organic.</p>

<p>Maybe these cases would  pile up in the &quot;strange events linked to conspiracies that won&#39;t be solved&quot; until we can expose how it works, there modern means of control and manipulation, harassment and murder through modern technology through covert operations that people still can&#39;t, won&#39;t or refuse to believe in.</p>

If you can make them look and act crazy, especially at a young age, you take away any credibility they have to the public. I havent seen anyone here mention Cory Feldman yet. His career went away just as he was becoming an adult. Now he actively speaks out about the rampant corruotion, rape, pedophilia, and other dispicable horrific acts in hollywood, even admitting it happened to him...thats a big step to take. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wouldn&#39;t be correct, as schizophrenia has broad list of symptoms and angles to diagnose (even these days it&#39;s being discussed if the illness diagnose should be reduced as part of psychosis, leaving schizophrenia as an outdated term like women hysteria). You must be talking about psychosis/a psychotic episode, that is part of the symptoms linked to schizophrenia. That&#39;s the problem of providing an &quot;internet diagnosis&quot; from reading a post and news articles.</p>

<p>It could be a psychotic episode based on the knowledge we have about psychiatry disregarding modern means of control and manipulation, but It&#39;s also a reality that psychotic episodes do happen. Some people has serious mental problems that are extremely dysfunctional, but before MKULTRA was recognized and accepted that illegal human experimentation DID HAPPEN and still does, the victims suffered similar stigma. That why it&#39;s part of a conspiracy board, and I&#39;m not even saying this is one of <em>those cases</em>, it&#39;s hard to say but it&#39;s open to discussion. </p>

<p>Implants or not, there&#39;s something we still ignore, something that can&#39;t be explained with 5 minute psychiatric plus psychological internet diagnosis, and that&#39;s the point of posts like this one.</p>

<p>I started to realize this when I saw the compensation for MSM personalities.  It would be like a bakery paying their baker millions a year, but the bakery would soon realize that they can hire someone almost as good for much much less.  So why doesn&#39;t this happen in MSM?  Katie Couric, Steve Harvey ARE NOT that good.</p>

<p>The CIA took over the MSM media a long time ago through operation mockingbird.  So anyone who plays their game is at the very least unethical and probably a sociopath.  So none of this surprises me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robert Downy Jr on Dan Schneider;</p>

<p>&quot;Hes a monster. The WORST predator alive. And if you wonder why nobody will confront or charge him? Hes in charge of multiple HIT SHOWS for Nick which rakes in oceans of money. Tens of millions of dollars multiplied by many years and many shows (not to mention his merchandising royalties). So Viacom-Nick warn him to cool it - then pay for his damn lawyers.</p>

<p>What about the parents? No tweener parent who shoved their kid into the limelight from birth is going to cross him either, and risk career suicide and loss of revenue (and residuals and future career). No matter how bad it ****s up the kids. Especially if theres MULTIPLE kid actors in the family. And the kids agents are complicit too. Just ask the Spears family. A LOT of settlements get paid out of Viacoms accounts.&quot;</p>

<p>Kinda figures.It makes sense to me after watching &quot;An Open Secret&quot; </p>

<p>Not even on a sexual level(like this is) but people are constantly taken advantage of by their &quot;dream job&quot;. Anecdotal evidence here. A bud of mine just scored his &quot;dream job&quot; at a cannabis manufacturing farm. But he is so horribly abused because he &quot;gets to work there&quot; he&#39;s been told if he msses a single day he will be fired. He&#39;s entirely replaceable but working like a slave cuz he&#39;s brainwashed.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t disagree, and there is certainly a significant amount of supporting evidence, I&#39;m wary of witch hunts - <em>especially</em> when it comes to accusations of pedophilia.</p>

<p>That said, this has been a rumor for years and years, so I&#39;m certainly not about to hang my hat on defending the guy.</p>
