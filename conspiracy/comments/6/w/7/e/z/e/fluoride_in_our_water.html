At one point she asked if there was fluoride in the water that he drinks and I didn&#39;t know how to respond. Well yes stupid we are all drinking it whether we like it or not. Weird question to come from the doctor considering the amount of effort it takes to not be subjected to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, ingesting fluoride has little impact.  If you are worried about your teeth, fluoride treatments where you just have it in contact with your teeth for a few minutes are the best option.  I don&#39;t know the research on teeth specifically, but fluorination of the calcium hydroxy apatite is well established (the fluoride ions replace the -OH ones, this process also occurs in fossilization).  Fluorapatites are more stable to acidic conditions.</p>

Anyone who thinks that delivering any medication by dumping it into public water supplies is scientific is scientifically illiterate. On top of that, fluoride is highly toxic and a cumulative poison, like lead, arsenic, and mercury. I have asked many forced-fluoridation fanatics to tell me how much accumulated fluoride in the body they think is safe. So far not a single one of them has been able to answer the question. It is unlikely to just be a coincidence that the US, Australia, and Ireland, which have had high rates of forced-fluoridation for decades, also have high rates of joint problems, and poor health outcomes in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we should but we have had it drilled into our heads that fluoride is some sort of medical boon for so long that it&#39;s difficult to start the conversation when the default is &#39;BUT CAVITIES&#39; so I&#39;ve found a first step in this discussion is about just that and to show that all other things being equal there really isn&#39;t a difference in dental health with or with out fluoride. The issue about health is that flouride could be the cause of so many things that it would be difficult to pinpoint and to even begin a study to find out exactly which things it&#39;s causing. It&#39;s a known endocrine disruptor and we are wallowing in a sea of these disruptors so which one(s) are causing what would be difficult to parse. I think the basic idea that we shouldn&#39;t have any medication added to our water is more than enough reason to keep it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking for a while now that the vaccine blowout is a shiny object to cancel out the fluoride discussion, and here&#39;s why. We were starting to see some great evidence of health issues regarding fluoride, but this sub has gone through a lot of changes and one thing I know for sure, their going to put whatever they want in vaccines, it&#39;s not something that&#39;s going to change; however, if the above mentioned figure is right, this country is 70/30% of fluoridated water sources, which <em>is</em>  something a national conversation could change.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have link on hand, but I remember a study last year which concluded that fluoride bonds with aluminum and accumulates in the brain to cause Alzheimer&#39;s. The r/conspiracy wiki should have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The silicofluorides which are dumped into public water supplies leach lead from pipes and fittings. Fluoride is actually more toxic than lead, and is a cumulative poison and developmental neurotoxicant which accumulates predominantly in bone, the same as lead. Both fluoride and lead interfere with calcium and other divalent cations in the body, but fluoride does so by binding to them whereas lead does so by mimicking them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, ingesting fluoride has little impact.  If you are worried about your teeth, fluoride treatments where you just have it in contact with your teeth for a few minutes are the best option.  I don&#39;t know the research on teeth specifically, but fluorination of the calcium hydroxy apatite is well established (the fluoride ions replace the -OH ones, this process also occurs in fossilization).  Fluorapatites are more stable to acidic conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sodium fluoride is the correct way to say it.  And of course, the whole point is for F- to be available other than it to be with an alkali earth (do you understand anything about chemistry?).  What else would that happen with?
