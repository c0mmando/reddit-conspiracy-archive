       the standing top post right now on r/conspiracy is upvoted by bots... just by mere looking at the statistics.. regardless of the contents (which i will go over down below)
      </p>
      <p>
       only 3 post with &gt; 1k points out of 100 top posts in r/conspiracy right now..
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        3.6k pointing the finger posted ~25 hrs ago (about class warfare more or less)
       </li>
       <li>
        2.8k question time ~39 hrs ago (about WTC7)
       </li>
       <li>
        1.8k arpio ~10 hrs ago
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       the remaining 97 posts about other conspiracy-esque topics such as goolag, sandy hook, the rich using blood transfusion from teenages, cuban sonic attack, assange etc.. range anywhere from 70 to 400 points max (except for the minecraft pizzagate post)
      </p>
      <p>
       in a conspiracy subreddit no less..
      </p>
      <p>
       hm...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       now lets dive into the content of the post
      </p>
      <p>
       the most prized allegation is probably the fact that arpaio is letting pedophile getting away by not pursuing investigation to at least "32 child molestations."
      </p>
      <p>
       that doesn't mean he conspire to make that happen, there can be various reasons from lab backlog to personnel shortage..
      </p>
      <p>
       for instance in georgia since the press coverage in 2015 (til now 2017) there has been thousands of rape kit backlog (
       <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/local/drowning-dna-state-backlog-rape-kits-grows/UZ9ATOyWCcDdxYWJLVIiGI/">
        http://www.myajc.com/news/local/drowning-dna-state-backlog-rape-kits-grows/UZ9ATOyWCcDdxYWJLVIiGI/
       </a>
       ) which then allows the perpetrator getting away..
      </p>
      <p>
       the rest of the point in the post is mostly garbage so i dont even wanna bother..
      </p>
      <p>
       i wasn't even gonna mention obama who pardons thousands, 330 of which on his last day.. they were all FEDERAL drug/meth/arms dealers (those that committed drug offense across state lines) and other actual imprisoned criminals..
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       another point i wanna point out is the comments in that post are selectively upvoted too.. like the one about someone who claims to "voted Trump" but then "screw Trump" for pardoning arpio.. like.. really???
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       there is certainly a narrative being pushed around here.. that is all im saying..

       Just keep sharing information. We need more people to speak out and share
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy information, not stuff that was designed to divide us. We have much more in common than we think. If you source your posts/comments well, and if you get occasionally lucky, you can negate all of the propaganda that many thousands of people have consumed on a topic. It takes a lot of effort for propagandists to bring darkness to a topic, but all it takes is a single candle to light the room.

       I think there are enough people in this sub who each have knowledge of specific topics that the periodic sharing of that knowledge could cause a very positive shift on this website. I think some of them believe they won't make a difference. Others think they have no chance against paid manipulators. A lot of us have noticed the manipulation on this website. It's good to point out, but don't let it affect your motivation. The forum police can't crack down on every thread every day.

       HLSNAMEWASSETHRICH is trying to call EricCarver a shill I think, "3L" and "P2P" just being shorthand for other accounts he thinks EricCarver uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for the whole part EricCarver seems to be pretty respected from "both sides" since he doesn't seem to get overly emotional with his posts, defaulting to "you're a shill" like most users do here.

       Why are you here if you will believe anything that comes out of peoples mouths/posts?

       If I told you Santa is coming to your house later today, will you start baking cookies and decorate a tree? (That is what a dismissive comment looks like, I hope you can tell the difference now)

       I just want to interject that in the time in which you requested "proof", not to mention the time spent arguing, you could have easily searched for the shit on the internet.  Why is it if you demand proof you are in the right of an argument?  This isn't some scientific fucking expedition or research committee.  Click open an extra tab and look.  If there is nothing roast him and say "a simple google search proved nothing.  You are full of horseshit."  And then, this is the important thing, move on.  Otherwise do you own leg work.  Most of the people here do anyway.  Damn.

       And where would I start, genius?
      </p>
      <p>
       The original question only alluded some statements, yet none of those statements were ever clarified. i can't search when I don't know what I am searching for. So that was my first sign of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now my question to you is, how can you even manage the IQ to breath, nonetheless post in a conspiracy sub, where we are supposed to be critical of all information given? Especially when the statement can easily be proven within his original posts?

       I've also noticed that the original OP never replied, yet I have these idiots defending bad logic like its their job.

       Dude, the news about Gorka just came out.  He mentions Fox.  He also mentions a panel.  From that, literally knowing nothing of Fox shows save some names, I would guess it was a segment on The Five over the last two days.  YouTube it and quick scan talking points.  Twat.

       I'm not going to do the OP's job for him. Talking points are not "verbatim" (you don't even seem to know what that word means). I am not going to search thru transcripts when the original OP can't even do it themselves.

       Haha, as an attorney you evaluate all options.  You mean to tell me you think your opposition will tell you their argument or sources?  Who is paying you to say this stupid shit?  Sure there is discovery but who sits on their ass instead of being proactive.  So are you a law student?  Since your mind went there first I'm thinking you are a student or paralegal or some silly shit.  Maybe a practicing attorney in some po dunk law firm but I doubt it.  Gain initiative.  Nothing in this life worth having is giving willingly.  This sub is based off people willing to search themselves when there is nothing.  God damn man.  Seriously, fuck off.

       I disagree, though not because I'm a believer in it.  My own personal opinion is that people here should be encouraged to engage in critical thinking, skepticism, and challenge each other on even small details, but at the same time mocking each other, derision, bickering, and fighting should be heavily discouraged(though not by mod intervention unless it's egregious abuse).

       It's always like that lately.  Top few posts are popularized conspiracies where the opinions can have a wide range and especially a division .
      </p>
      <p>
       Real conspiracies are at the bottom under a pile of negative votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all posts are good, I get that, but the type of posts that are popular follow a pattern normally on this sub. Now the things that get thousands of votes are abnormally brigaded. Don't follow the pattern. To the point I don't even read them now.

       That isn't proof of what that other user was saying. It's not like it's a secret that he posted over there or something. Pretty sure he acknowledge his support for Trump here, on a few occasions. Nothing wrong with supporting Trump and being a mod here.  There are at least two mods here, that I know of, who said they supported Bernie Sanders. Mods can have their own political beliefs and still be a mod,

       On a few occasions? Dude, some people are claiming that he was a mod at T_D.

      <p>
       I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that he's started his own right wing sub and he's been pretty open about his disdain for Trump/Russia threads....... And his own political bias.

       It's pretty damn hard to be a neutral moderator on political topics when you're extremely partisan.

       They are referring to a post that flytape made when T_D closed it's doors for x amount of time (in protest?). Members over there were flocking to this sub as refugees, and all flytape did, was basically say: "We know you are here, you are welcome as everyone else is, but this is not T_D. Respect our rules and enjoy your stay". That was basically it. That's was not encouragement, that was acknowledgment and being proactive as a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape was one of the better mods here, imo. He's a veteran here who knows how reddit works, and was able to keep shill/troll groups at bay, among other things. We shall see what happens here, moving forward.

       SC and Flytape were imo the only two mods who were absolutely above suspicion of being shills.  I'veseen this happenin a few subs now.  Get rid of the old guard, then bring in new mods who fit the narrative.  Bet they move to add mods soon (and I bet I know who they add).

       Yeah, but TMoR aside, Flytape has previously had issues modding this sub, to the point he was removed at one point before being reinstated at a later time. It got bad enough, former moderators have since left in protest of how this sub was starting to be moderated.

       I act like I trust Flytape, and I do not trust many of the other mods.  There are 2 mods I believe are either SB or IS, and a whole bunch of others who are either rule obsessed control freaks, horrifically biased, or straight up pushing a narrative.  I don't agree with Flytape's politics, but there's no way he's a shill, and for that reason I think he should stay right near the top of the list.

       Why does honestly believing in Trump make him above suspicion of being a shill, but not being explicitly pro-Trump makes all the other mods suspicious? Why does the benefit of the doubt evaporate if there's no support for your guy? I honestly don't get it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every person who is critical of the president is being paid by Soros or whoever. And given the existence of Cambridge Analytica and the Kochs in general, not every person who posts in favor of Trump is above suspicion of being paid!
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole shill or not argument can't just be about left/right, pro/anti because the fact is, the conversation is being engineered in some way from all sides. It's frankly ludicrous to treat the very real problem of social engineering via social media as if it's partisan issue. And Flytape's open partisan bias, admirable it may be, makes it impossible for him to address it.

       Flytape has always been far right, and has never once deviated from that.  He was around long before Trump was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills are people who are paid to push a narrative.  I have nothing against people I disagree with posting their views;  I have a huge problem with outside organizations brigading and botting to push their narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape was extremely anti shill, and was in favor of banning them based on human judgment (which I agree with).  Some of the mods have publicly stated that they believe shills have a right to be here too.  Also, several of the mods are darlings over at TMoR, a sub dedicated to making this sub look bad.  If you find out which mods those are, then look through their moderation history you'll see a pretty clear pattern emerging.

       This is a statement you made in another thread, and when asked for
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to support it, you sent me on a wild goose chase down an unknowably deep rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either provide some evidence to support the claim that "there are 8 mods who have made comments / posts openly supporting Hillary" or stop spreading disinfo lies to discredit this subreddit.

       I'm not digging through months of posts to prove something to you.  I tagged every mod during election season when they made statements of political belief;  that's enough for me.  If you don't believe me that is of course your right.  If you actually care, dig yourself.  I'll PM you the mods I have tagged if you like.

       The_donald explicitly forbids the criticism of the current political administration. How could you possibly imagine that culture would be a good fit for this particular sub? Why on Earth was the red carpet rolled out for them? (Again, not because of their politics. Because, right on the box, the_donald is a groupthink incubator and proud of it, while conspiracy is supposed to be the literal opposite)

       I would have said nothing either way, the cultures are completely contradictory. Would have been welcoming to T_D users who came here and followed the rules/culture, and debated and reported those who didn't. Rolling out the red carpet for such an obvious culture mismatch was going to cause nothing but problems.

       I absolutely agree, no one had to say a damn thing. Further, doing so is incredibly inappropriate because of drastic mismatch in subculture. The Donald's specifically forbids the questioning of the current Administration. The blind acceptance of power is antithetical to conspiracy.

       He'd get away with mentioning things that were considered career suicide for any normal person on TV.

       I agree with the point but unfortunately the volatility expressed is exactly what these shills and trolls are trying to bring out in us. It's hard to fight something so obvious when making a claim based on a long chain of behavior that is able to be referenced is considered a bannable offense.

       I agree with you.  This exactly what they are trying to do to us.  Make us divide on purpose.  Unfortunately most fail to see through the charade being presented.  How sad it is what we see going on in society today and expressed on the news feeds being fed to us on purpose. Stay strong.  The good will always overcome.

       So all Donald Trump had to do was sweet talk some classic conspiracies to get a traditionally anti-government conspiracy community to suddenly trust and even defend the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't suddenly trust and defend the government, simply because Donald Trump decided to grandstand with acts like a press conference with people who claim they were raped, you're a shill. Got it.

       Trump has been dishing in so-caled "conspiracy theories" for decades. He hasn't changed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not something he put on for the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't do the Hillary Clinton focus group crap. He doesn't change based on what "strategists" tell him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why the Establishment GOP is still enraged at him. He's still Tweeting. He's still being EXACTLY who he's been for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they're ranting about him not being "Presidential"?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because he didn't suddenly acquire a new personality that handlers and focus groups told him to put on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why Hillary Clinton was so toxic. She came across as robotic, scripted: Fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, for all his warts, is exactly who Trump has always been.

       Trump was more popular than Hillary but the majority of REAL

       Absolutely. And now that he's got the power to release that information and really doesn't give a shit, it's almost like he used you as a political pawn.

       Brilliant strategy,  targeting 4channers and conspiracy nuts,  really it was,  but it's just political smoke blowing.

       Or: It's almost as if he isn't working in a vacuum and has to tread very carefully, lest he get assassinated like Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is signaling every day that it's alright to kill him. They constantly run articles about how Trump (despite not taking a salary) is so expensive that the secret service can't afford to protect him. See? So if a crazed lone gunman got in to shoot him, it would really be Trump's own fault, right?

       So what you are saying is that this subreddit is being manipulated via bots who upvote content and downvote content? That certain posts can reach the top and be seen more widely through bots upvoting. While other posts, who may have legitimate content, can be downvoted enough so most people won't be able see them? Bot manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit as a whole is like this. Instead of deleting posts or banning content or opinions one could use bots to manipulate what a viewer does or doesn't see.

       Yeah it's pretty noticeable when this sub gets brigaded.  It usually happens right after the MSM attempts to fight back.  It wasn't a good look for them when they basically endorsed the actions of Antifa.

       Because people are like herds of sheep. They tend to believe the most upvoted comments because they don't want to feel like "holy shit everybody believes this but me. Must be true then." So like the sheep they are they just follow along. That why paid upvotes pushing propaganda, agendas and narratives is such a big deal, and why this sub is a war zone. I sort by controversial, those are more often than not the organic users, while the guys at the top are paid for to push agendas. One day this sub is pro trump neo-Nazi, the next its an antifa-lovin' crowd. It scares people off and associates us with them. Anyone that supports trump isn't "woke", and vice versa. This sub is anti-establishment and always will be. None of us that we're here pre-election buy that trump is the savior to politics from the outside, and that he's one of us. lol he's a billionaire.

       Oh, don't worry about me. Like I said, I don't even pay attention to upvotes. I always look at the "new" page and I always look at the "top", "hot", and "controversial" pages too. I make sure I don't miss anything that might be of interest to me.

       By using vote manipulation you can easily control the content. Vote manipulate down what you want to suppress, vote manipulate up the propaganda you want to push.

       No, I wouldn't just call everyone a shill. I only do that when it's blatantly obvious, when the user is acting like a third party, neither a Democrat nor a republican (or foreign versions of them), and they don't seem to care about the welfare of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       They react with hostility when I mention shills - the argument between actual users is not whether there are shills here, but how dominated the conversation is.

       Why is it so difficult to fathom that a person could have voted for Trump, but not like Arpaio?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so difficult to accept the fact that a person could have voted for Trump, but now be unhappy with his performance as president? Are Trump voters not allowed to change their minds? Are we required to stay loyal to the emperor god, no matter how shitty a job he's doing? Or are atrump voters allowed to be intaellectually honest and have opinions about trump that differ from those on T_D?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, yeah, it's entirely possible for someone to be anti- illegal immigations and STILL hate Arpaio for his human rights abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyones values fit into a neat little box. That's not a conspiracy.

       Notice how when there's a Hillary/Obama/antifa/Sanders/leftist post, the comments are always bashing OP, attacking this sub, mocking conspiracy theorists or just generally trying to derail the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet when there's a Trump/Russia post, suddenly all the comments are "organically" discussing the conspiracy and any dissenting comments are downvoted to the bottom and mocked.

       Obvious this sub is trying to be taken over by the same subs that have taken over most of reddit post-election.

       I agree that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is being manipulated, this is happening across Reddit. Any subreddit that can sway public opinion is actively being manipulated. What I don't understand, is the example you used as proof, regarding Joe Arpaio. Do you honestly believe that the disdain many Americans have for his man is completely manufactured? Is it difficult to believe that many Americans disagree with rounded up undocumented immigrants and sticking them in a tent city with inhumane/deplorable conditions? The examples you used don't even make sense. Untested rape kits in Georgia have nothing to do with Joe's policies in Maricopa County Arizona. Perhaps if Joe had spent less money on his illegal and inhumane tent cities and more money on catching these awful child molesters there would be more justice but there wasn't. The comment about Obama pardoning drug offenders also doesn't make sense. Pardoning low level drug dealers (non violent crimes) is not the same as pardoning a man who willfully broke the law to continue a racist and inhumane campaign against illegal immigrants who serve as a foundation to the economics of the county because they are the only ones willing to the do the shit low paying jobs Americans refuse to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree that Reddit is manipulated, including this sub. Not every example of outrage against Trump is manufactured. A lot of people just think he is a selfish dick and his own actions can speak louder than any MSM talking head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want real evidence that the MSM manufactures consent and outrage? Look at how MSM covers Saudi Arabia war crimes? Look at how they covered Obama in Libya before Bengazi. Or look at how they record civilian deaths to drone bombs. There are a lot of examples you could use but defending a racist psychopath doesn't seem like your strongest example.

       I act like I trust Flytape, and I do not trust many of the other mods.  There are 2 mods I believe are either SB or IS, and a whole bunch of others who are either rule obsessed control freaks, horrifically biased, or straight up pushing a narrative.  I don't agree with Flytape's politics, but there's no way he's a shill, and for that reason I think he should stay right near the top of the list.

       consider this their second choice community on Reddit. This is no secret. It's their choice where they want to spend their time. They were coming here, no matter what. Nobody had to say a damn thing. They were coming here, because we're not fucking idiots and we know what is going to happen when a subreddit shuts down. It doesn't hurt to remind them of our rules.

       I agree with you.  This exactly what they are trying to do to us.  Make us divide on purpose.  Unfortunately most fail to see through the charade being presented.  How sad it is what we see going on in society today and expressed on the news feeds being fed to us on purpose. Stay strong.  The good will always overcome.

       No, I wouldn't just call everyone a shill. I only do that when it's blatantly obvious, when the user is acting like a third party, neither a Democrat nor a republican (or foreign versions of them), and they don't seem to care about the welfare of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       They react with hostility when I mention shills - the argument between actual users is not whether there are shills here, but how dominated the conversation is.
