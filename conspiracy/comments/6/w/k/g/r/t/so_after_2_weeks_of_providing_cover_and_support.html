You had Reuters referring to them as &quot;peace activists,&quot; and NYT reporter Stollberg hastily &quot;clarifying&quot; a negative observation she made. It was really only the citizen journalists who were showing interest. But in the last 24 hours, that all changed. All the biggies, including deep state propaganda dispensers WaPo and Business Insider, have finally decided to put out pieces on Antifa that are critical. Did someone give them the green light that its finally okay to criticize Antifa? Why now? Why en masse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you care to dig deeper, ask &quot;the man on the street&quot; about their opinion of these issues. i bet they do not care whatsover or have not paid any attn at all. the headlines from &quot;the biggies&quot; are not being read by anyone except a rare few news junkies. no matter where you are, if you ask people walking around your town, they are not walking to a protest or to a philosophical meetup. theyre going to work to think about petty work politics, or to lunch to waste $ on low quality food, or to see their friends who they dont really like, or their family who they hate/love etc. The youngns are playing video games, the middleage are self medicating and the oldies are thinking about mortality. The headlines then are essentially for a tiny fraction of the population; pretty much no-name byline drones conducting a very lazy, cowardly pissing contest. You and me and our anarcho comedian compatriots notice the nonsense, but we largely chalk it up for what it is; &quot;the biggies&quot; trying to maintain relevance. They do not inspire any proactive citizen campaigns to do anything constructive or contributing to a brighter future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response. I disagree with it, as I do think there is something conspiratorial at work here, but I appreciate your perspective nonetheless, and will give it some thought.   </p>

<p>I would like to point out, however, that this line you wrote  &quot;...most of whom are put off by the militancy of the Antifa who were present ...&quot; is factually incorrect.  When Antifa marched into park in Boston in formation, they were cheered and applauded by all present. Videos exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>True, and I think that&#39;s residual from the first phase I mentioned (the post-Charlottesville one). I doubt that <em>all</em> present cheered and applauded. More likely is that some did, and the rest were just quiet rather than booed or hissed.</p>

<p>I think the undercurrent that matters here is that most liberals are non-violent and getting into spats with the far left about this. Check out r/politics threads on antifa and you can see this happening. Anarchist and Communist basically come out of the woodwork to call liberals all-talk pussies. A lot of liberals are looking right now for &quot;verification&quot; that they&#39;re right on this, that  antifa&#39;s heart is in the right place but they need to discard violence. That&#39;s the story they&#39;ve been wanting to hear to resolve this tension they have between support anti-fascism but being queasy about physical violence.</p>

<p>However, on the more conspiratorial side, I&#39;ll submit that it is always in the status quo&#39;s best interest to shame all violence that isn&#39;t perpetrated by the police.</p>

<p>They are not going to label their puppets terrorists but they can make it look like they slightly disapprove, while actually approving, of their actions by dribbling out a little criticism through the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa attacked several reporters and media agencies yesterday. So the media is finally turning on them out of self preservation. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything more complicated then that. </p>

<p>Someone was obviously telling them not to cover Antifa objectively before but now the violence is being directed at the media themselves. </p>

<p>These Antifa members are left leaning but authoritarian in their beliefs. They see the media as part of the establishment, which it is. So of course the media was targeted yesterday and now they&#39;re realizing the narrative they were paid to push is physically harming their own people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>one purpose of antifa is that it allows the liberal/neocon media establishment to rehabilitate it&#39;s image - the so-called rightwing of the establishment will proceed to associate any antiwar or antistate positions as antifa or antifa sympathizers, while it&#39;s left wing will continue to vacillate between apologia for them and hand-wringing over their &quot;tactics&quot;, if you can call it that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi autorackboxcar.  I didn&#39;t comment on other posts about Antifa because I didnt have anything unique to add.  I made this post not about Antifa per se, but about the media&#39;s treatment of them.  Sorry if that wasnt made clear by my title.</p>
