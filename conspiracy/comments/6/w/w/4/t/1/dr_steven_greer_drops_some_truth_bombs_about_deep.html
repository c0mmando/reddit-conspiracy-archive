       i highly recommend watching this documentary. the names he drops are not going to sit well with the people concerned. available on netflix or youtube. and netflix has some big balls airing it. its being discredited by google.... naturally

       Don't know about no deep state stuff, but any extraterrestrial stuff is not correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       People been happening literally forever, if they ever made it much past this point of development, if they ever made it into deep space, if star trek ever happened rl, our skies would have looked like alien new York since before there were humans.  There's no maybe this or maybe that, it's been forever.

       If aliens were real we would see evidence of more crafts and drones, technology and such. It's so wild to think all the nation's of the world are hiding the biggest secret ever when they throw each other under the bus at the slightest geopolitical situation... I don't buy it.

       Venezuela is a funny inclusion in your list, considering what is transpiring there lately. One wonders, why include that Latin America country? Especially in regards the Chilean UAP video released this year by their government.

       That is 1 nations secrets not the worlds.. Aliens only talking to the U.S. Huh? Makes no sense.. There a huge world out there and there is no creditable evidence.. None.

       I agree, but I still think its a good example. Then again your post is assuming we aren't in contact and the governments haven't made arrangements for no fly zone. I think it would be extremely hard to keep secret as well. I agree with you, I just don't believe it is that far fetched as it would seem that they have kept everyone in the dark about this.

       We know the Clinton's imported coke with the CIA, we know 911 was an inside job by the CIA to kick off the new crusades.. We know that the Rothschilds own trillions and that pizzagate is real.. Now with all those juicy secrets flowing like wine, where the fuck are the aliens... Not one photo, not one video, I'm telling you this is why, there arnt any. You can find videos of damn near anything but aliens. We have videos of governors selling appointments for cash, we have videos of Bill Clinton's brother buying Coke. But no aliens..

       Fair point. My only argument to this would be, ships have been photographed. Out of the millions of photos that have been taken of "alien craft" I believe some of them have to show the truth. In regards to photographing alien life, we have no idea what aliens would look like. They could look exactly like us but have 7 livers. Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that. Your point is valid

       You just made an unverified claim, as obvious as it may seem that there may be aliens you cannot make such claims. That's equivocal to saying there is a God I just haven't met said god. Either one is a unverified claim. I'm definitely interested and hope there are aliens O should say this, no one knows either way of there are or if there aren't but logic would suggest there would be, still doesn't mean that there is for certain.  We cannot afford to reduce ourselves to the point of making unverified claims every time we feel like it..

       One can argue you are plenty unverified yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ain't ever gonna meet any aliens because it's been forever.  If star trek ever happened rl, ever, our skies would have had aliens just as soon as it was safe to come into our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been forever, shit didn't somehow magically start from nothing to our big bang, endless, infinite energy and matter already existed.  You can't get something from nothing and the only other answer is matter and energy already existed, must have existed with no beginning and will forever, no end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just cuz that one little slice of common sense- you nor anyone else can snap tour fingers and make something from nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So infinite matter and energy been making infinite people for forever already, it's just that star trek never happens rl, and the only reason is cuz life never gets past this level of tech development.

       You don't have two years left of living like you do.  And gods a real thing.  Take a little time and effort to show ya but gods even right here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alien stuffs just common sense.  Rest of it, be too hard to show you, you didn't read the thread before replying.  Dead giveaway, yer just lookin for someone to 'refute'.  I'll pass.

       O that is cute, look at you go. Reading for a pedestal of dominance via the i am older therefore I am smarter routine... Jesus Christ, the whole conversation we just had was regarding you making unverified claims, now you somehow know me and my age. You know nothing, what you think you know is your own personal interpreted view based off of speculations. I am laughing right now, you have taken this to new heights. Good 👍 job, you are the biggest idiot.
