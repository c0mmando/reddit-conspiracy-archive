    <div class="md"><p>Depends what you mean. </p>

<p>The Illuminatus Trilogy and Foucault&#39;s Pendulum were great reads, but they were actually satirizing the conspiracy theorists. Poking fun at their gullibility.</p>

<p>Them:Adventures with Extremists is a non-fiction book, similarly poking a bit of fun a CTists. A significant part is about sneaking into the Bohemian Grove with Alex Jones. </p>

<p>In terms of actual &quot;I&#39;ve got secret information uncovering stuff&quot; Behold A Pale Horse by Bill Cooper seems to be popular, but I just found it batshit insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Alex exaggerated what he saw there, and Jon Ronson put it into better context, although it was creepy. There&#39;s also video footage, so you can see for yourself. </p>

<p>Behold a Pale Horse is basically an amalgamation of many things. He goes from the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion to Alien ships flying into and out of the ocean. It was quite weird. </p>

<p>&quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; -- David McGowan</p>

<p>&quot;Secret Societies and Mind Control&quot; -- Michael Hoffman</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. They know everything anyway, pretty sure. Just don&#39;t presume they&#39;re so competent, because they&#39;re not, at least not until you get to the very upper echelon and the biggest &quot;events.&quot;</p>

<p>If you really want to stay under the radar, tho, get a bitcoin or other crypto and buy from other sites that permit it. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the deal: FEAR is their greatest ally. If they&#39;ve got you fearful or anxious about their power, they&#39;ve got a leg up. I respect their power, but I don&#39;t fear them--we are all part of the divine, if they choose to kill me, my soul goes into the great collective as a &quot;woke&quot; &quot;good&quot; being, and they don&#39;t like that. It works against them.</p>

<p>The more aware you become while holding on to your innate goodness without succumbing to fear, the greater danger you are to them. Just sayin&#39;. Good luck.</p>

Yes he appears to cast doubt on true believers but what he does is give the background of how a big part of the conspiracy movement got started and gives you the information and history to decide for yourselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you want to analyze an issue in depth, isn&#39;t it important to look at it from different angles, no? They&#39;re skeptical or sardonic, but it&#39;s far beyond simply attempting to make people look nuts. Another one I should have mentioned is The Crying Of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon. </p>

<p>Jim Marrs, who wrote that EO 11110 was an attempt to kill the Federal Reserve, when in fact it gave them more power, is a good example of why some extra skepticism should be applied while devouring some of these theories. </p>

<p>The Executive Order is only about 100 words, but he still managed to mess it up. <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=59049">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=59049</a></p>

<p>But did he talk about what I just said? That was a thought that occurred to me just the other day. An economic disaster so bad that America gets sucked down to point of no recovery. Other countries own us because we owe them our debt. And they basically strip us of our US dollar and replace it with a World Currency...</p>

<p>Is this somewhat on line with what he discusses?</p>

<p>Excellent movie about mindcontrol through media manifesting in higher wokeness that makes hallucinations reality.  Plus it has James Woods.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I heard about Alex Jones doing that. Pretty wild. Thoughts on him doing that?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like a credible read. Something mind blowing that is also likely truth. Behold a Pale Horse; you said it&#39;s insane, but could it be factual? And what&#39;s the subject exactly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t, I want to now. Thank you for sending that. </p>

<p>But did he talk about what I just said? That was a thought that occurred to me just the other day. An economic disaster so bad that America gets sucked down to point of no recovery. Other countries own us because we owe them our debt. And they basically strip us of our US dollar and replace it with a World Currency...</p>

<p>Is this somewhat on line with what he discusses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird that he&#39;s asking for conspiracy books and you&#39;re giving him books that make people who believe in conspiracies look nuts. </p>

<p>Try:</p>

<p>&quot;Rule By Secrecy&quot; -- Jim Marrs</p>

<p>&quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; -- David McGowan</p>

<p>&quot;Secret Societies and Mind Control&quot; -- Michael Hoffman</p>

<p>Movie-wise, &quot;The Parallax View&quot; is pretty good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are two of my favorite conspiracy satires, along with pretty much all of Pynchon. I think I&#39;m more intrigued by the conspiratorial mind than any actual (or fictional) conspiracy, how we all search out patterns while seeking out truth and reality. Pitfalls abound. </p>
