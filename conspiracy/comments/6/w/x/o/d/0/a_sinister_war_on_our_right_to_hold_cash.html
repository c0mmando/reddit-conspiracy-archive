        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>An operation that began as a seemingly obscure academic discussion three years ago is now becoming a full-blown propaganda campaign by some of the most powerful institutions in the industrialized world. This is what rightly should be termed the War on Cash1. Like the War on Terror, the War on Cancer or the War on Drugs, its true agenda is sinister and opaque. If we are foolish enough to swallow the propaganda for complete elimination of cash in favor of pure digital bank money, we can pretty much kiss our remaining autonomy and privacy goodbye. George Orwellâ€™s 1984 will be here on steroids .</p>

<p>What we are discussing is a plot, and it is a plot, by leading central banks, select governments, the International Monetary Fund in collusion with major international banks to force citizensâ€”in other words, us!â€”to give up holding cash or using it to pay for purchases. Instead we would be forced to use digital bank credits. The difference, subtle though it may at first seem, is huge...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cryptocurrencies require an internet connection. If your wallet is in the cloud it can be switched off remotely. When you are connected (to make a payment)  you are 100% trackable. When you buy you are trackable via your creditcard or other means and trackable due to your internet connection. Cryptocurrencies are NOT anonymous, all transactions are stored and trackble. I&#39;ll say if you are on the run it is way too angerous to uae crypto, cash works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. At least one Blockchain is being streamed via free to air satellite as we speak. Internet or no, it works. Outgoing transactions via merchant terminals using whatever, or most obviously sms, ham radio etc. On the other front, in terms of anonymity there are at least three Blockchains I can think of off the top of my head (monero. Zcash. Dash) that offer levels of anonymity varying from complete to pretty good. </p>

<p>The core rule of cryptocurrencies continues to prevail; people want it, so if the maths work, sooner or later someone will profit by launching it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what a right is. You have the ability to use cryptocurrency, but what forces anyone to accept it as legal tender? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t accept that &quot;rights&quot; in the legal / political sense actually exist, mostly in light of the fact they are infringed by the exact entities who supposedly imbue us with them on an extremely regular basis. So therefore to my perception there is simply what we can actually do in practice vs what we cannot. If it is impossible to restrict a given action, the &quot;right to that thing cannot be infringed&quot; , rather than &quot;the right to this thing shall not be infringed&quot; (but actually it will be and is) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but then this whole argument is useless. You may hold that you have the ability to do something, but if the entities governing your ability to do so disagree, you may be right morally, etc. it doesn&#39;t matter though. They have the ability to stop you from using hard or crypto currency and they are since they have the ability to do so. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the right to use them coming from then? </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly my point though. They really don&#39;t. Any more than they have the ability to stop me from using a pocket calculator to factor primes numbers.  They simply can&#39;t stop people from doing it, therefore whether they want to or not is irrelevant. Their powers have limits, and certain things they simply can&#39;t do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realise it&#39;s been banned before my even a hundred years ago in the very country you&#39;re citing the constitution of? </p>

<p>There is only one effective hedge against state power. It must be actually impossible for them to infringe on a given ability in order for it to not happen. Anything short of that benchmark and it&#39;s just a matter of time and incentives. The dog is going to eat that steak if he can reach it, that&#39;s his nature. </p>
