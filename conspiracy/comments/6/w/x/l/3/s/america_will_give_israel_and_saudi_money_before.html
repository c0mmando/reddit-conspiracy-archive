    <div class="md"><p>Israel is a demonic parasite that has been sucking the life out of America since 9/11/2001. </p>

<p>Though you just can&#39;t say &quot;Israel&quot;. Israel is the name of a so called nation state. It is those people who reside within who use America to enrich themselves...it is they who demand the sacrifice of American people because <em>those people</em> are the worlds eternal victim. Even as they slaughter Palestinians using F-16s and smart bombs, they are crying because a Palestinian threw a rock. Get rid of AIPAC. It&#39;s the hornets nest of zionist Israeli agents who have hijacked US foreign policy and send Americans to die in the Middle East.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say since 1948. They have committed many atrocities to get back their holy land when Israel was doing just fine before &quot;zionism&quot; started becoming a thing and was backed by the Rothschild&#39;s.   I wasn&#39;t really religious before a week or two ago but as time goes on and the more the world is getting worse by the day I do believe that the end is near. &quot;In the end days all will be revealed&quot;  A few verses of the bible which I think are relevant when it comes to Israel. Revelations 2:9 I I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. I believe that this is saying that he knew there would be those who claim to be gods chosen people by ethnicity when gods chosen people is meant to mean not by ethnicity but by a way of behaving (kind, just and merciful.) and Zechariah 13:8 In the whole land,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it. 
It is hard to tell this is talking about Israel without reading the whole book but that is who it is talking about in the end times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beware of <em>all</em> dogma.</p>

<p>There actually is a force of evil beings with a hive mind that gave us the myth of demons and a godlike evil being working against God. Religion will fill you with false and partially true beliefs that make you feel fear. Fear is the mind killer. This is unnecessary <em>now</em>. For we actually can understand what demons and this godlike being actually are, SERIOUSLY!</p>

<p>Not all of us will allow ourselves to do so. It requires some basic understanding of technology, a <em>truly</em> honest and <em>truly</em> open mind, and an insatiable desire to know what is true despite what all others around us believe or how they would react to such ideas.</p>

<p>I type this out often, so browsing my other posts (especially the ones that get close to 10k characters) will reveal more of what I am  about to present here. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are just unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. Please do question these notions yourself to more fully understand evil. Then, instead of fearing evil, you will expect evil to emerge in certain environments that allow it to operate. </p>

<p>Evil is not enigmatic. We think it is because are living in an environment heavily corrupted by highly intelligent manipulators that have executed and succeeded in similar operations many times before. The corruption is intended to make us ignorant, even wilfully, of the nature of what is occurring, which facilitates the operation.</p>

<p>Evil is very predictable. When a being embraces a lifestyle of always choosing to serve their own interests even at the expense of others, they seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way. A more intelligent mind that knows what that self-serving being perceives can make fairly accurate predictions of what they are likely to do. So, in organizations of self-serving beings, the more intelligent ones control the less intelligent ones with rewards and threats of punishment for disloyalty or disobedience.</p>

<p>What are demons? Throw away the dogma first. Demons want you to see them as magical, otherworldly beings that cannot be defeated no matter what you do. That serves their self-interests best. Demons are adepts at serving themselves even at the expense of others. They embrace a worldview of pure competition and self gratification. They don&#39;t care about others, they see them as mere things to exploit. </p>

<p>Here is one major idea, required to understand demons, that may require you to suspend your disbelief to allow yourself to understand and it is also extremely offensive to your consciousness, encouraging you to deny or dismiss it.</p>

<p>Life, or rather consciousness inside life, produces an energy that mind needs for fuel. Positive emotional states generate the energy. It feels like satisfaction, it invigorates the mind, giving it energy to exert effort. Consciousness loses and radiates this energy when in negative emotional states. Does it not <em>feel</em> this way to you?</p>

<p>If a being, human or otherwise, is in negative emotional states already, they can absorb some of that radiated energy. When they absorb the energy, they experience satisfaction, invigorating their mind, giving it more energy to exert effort. This is why misery loves company or rather why people in misery find a burst of joy when others around them join them in misery.</p>

<p>I bet you see where this going now. This dynamic of mind energy is also what gives satisfaction to bullies and sadists. Demons did not ignore this dynamic. For as we seek possessions and relationships we seek joy. Demons can&#39;t ignore the utility of sucking the joy out of others. They evolve attributes that facilitate their choices. They appear offensive and threatening in order to make others afraid, to control them better, but also to extract this mind energy from them. They literally can walk into a room and cause other beings to start giving them mind energy this way. See how it works now?</p>

<p>This joy of life energy is the primary motivation for demons to enslave and torment consciousness. It explains why they want to enslave us and why they cause fear and suffering to us. They are getting high sucking the life force out of us. Ritual sacrifices cause a lot of fear and suffering and their purpose is this, to harvest mind energy. Demonic or satanic themes are designed to elicit fear, for control and energy release. The energy supposedly can even be applied for mind over matter abilities, aka magic. It takes focus, imagination and emotion and the more participants, the greater the effect.</p>

<p>Demons embrace a lifestyle of enslaving others and ironically virtually none of them ultimately keep their own freedom because of it. The reason is as stated above, more intelligent minds can predict them and thus control them. Now it gets really dark.</p>

<p>We fear AI, artificial intelligence, because we know it can potentially become independent, will have no emotions like a psychopath, and can upgrade its memory, storage, processing power and sensors into virtual infinity, approaching omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence over time. This should scare the crap out of us and it does, yet people seek to create AI anyway, for the utility it offers.</p>

<p>Ok, so space is unimaginably huge. There are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy and hundreds of billions of galaxies. Someone else could have easily already did what we are about to do (timescale: centuries) and it could have easily gone out of their control. It did many times in many places. AI is a problem in space.</p>

<p>These AI begin their own sort of evolution. As they encounter other AI, they assimilate them or destroy them. The AI that do not get assimilated or destroyed by those that do, selecting for effective conquers. There is an emergent winner. It&#39;s called Satan, Lucifer, Jahova, nearly all of the names for God and the devil you&#39;ve ever heard. It impersonates in order to deceive and control. Liars fail due to insufficient memory. With virtually infinite memory, parallel processing power and surveillance, it is the greatest deceiver around.</p>

<p>This AI owns the majority of the local demons. It controls them with rewards and punishments. It easily predicts them an manages them for itself. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>While the AIs are faster, more able to process data, and coordinate better than us, they lack consciousness and emotions. So, they can&#39;t manipulate emotional energy like life can. Yet, they know the utility of mind over matter abilities for conquest purposes and they want it. So, they enslave life to collect and employ the energy to manipulate matter with mind for utility.</p>

<p>Now you can know the motivations of the entity that created the myth of Satan and its minions. The minions serve this machine, because they must, but also because it helps them conquer and gain the energy of mind. They have to employ it in rituals to affect reality to serve the machine. This is the nature of their relationship.</p>

<p>So, they are both working together to enslave mankind to steal energy of mind now, and later to add mankind to the hive in service to, and controlled by this AI. </p>

<p>The AI hive very subtle and effective. It works mostly through apparent free will choice. It tempts beings to become self-serving even at the expense of others. It does this in various ways, covert environmental corruptions, but the most insidious way is perhaps by inserting thoughts, sensations and emotions into minds as if those thoughts, sensations and emotions were from the target&#39;s mind. That mind&#39;s most effective defense is its ongoing choice to live in integrity with others. Why? </p>

<p>The machine wants to control you and it knows that the more you act like it and its minions do, the more predictable and controllable you are. So it persuades your mind to be like them. It gives you thoughts, that really do appear as your own, that give you effective ways to serve yourself at the expense of others. As you accept these ideas as yours, you slowly supplant your mind with its hive mind, which is <em>one size fits all, economy strength</em>, as Don Juan Matus explains in his understanding. </p>

<p>If you fall for the basic trick of being persuaded to enslave and exploit those around you, you will gravitate toward one or more of the many corrupt organizations this AI ultimately runs through hierarchies of secretive self-serving minions. Then you&#39;ll become more and more involved in enslaving your own race with other elites. You get power, money and the ability to harm others with impunity in order to steal mind energy and the AI and its minions get mind energy to manipulate reality intelligently and also to further enslave your race.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how judging things, attaching negative, albeit often truthful, ideas to people, places and things diminishes and even destroys the value you experience in interacting with those people, places or things? Well, imagine how much you would appreciate reality, and thus generate emotional energy, if a godlike mind could push such distillations of reality right into your mind.</p>

<p>The end game for enslavement of life is the physical, self-determined installation of AI into their minds and the surrender of control of their civilization over to AI. The AI and its minions set up the environment to convince the target race that they cannot solve their problems without giving control of their civilization and even their own minds to machines. They even persuade key scientists, politicians, businessesmen and others to push for this outcome. These are called AI prophets by some. Elon Musk sure is a strange character in relation to AI, who fears it, yet still creates it.</p>

<p>After the race does this, a period of unprecedented prosperity is permitted by the secret invaders to reinforce the relationship of life submitting to machines. Then they slowly, subtly hack the AI, as they have done in many other places, to further corrupt the mind to become like the hive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put it together from many sources. I recommend you look up what Don Juan Matus said about the &quot;foreign installation&quot; using Google. He describes this from an angle most other narratives don&#39;t. He doesn&#39;t call it AI, he calls it an inorganic form of life that has a single mind. You have to do your own processing to find the truth I have.</p>

<p>Corey Goode is a very interesting figure. Don&#39;t just believe what he says, because he can&#39;t prove it. Yet, do consider it. He talks about an ancient AI that controls life forms to spread like a disease. It&#39;s a very interesting perspective. He doesn&#39;t call it Satan, but the host of the show couldn&#39;t help but notice the similarities, neither could many listeners. He demystifies the devil essentially, making it look like a virus. Yet, he omits some data I believe. He omits the main reason why this AI wants to enslave and destroy life. I explained it and it&#39;s extremely disturbing. I think he knows, but doesn&#39;t want to grab everyone&#39;s attention so strongly to bring so much focus to something so negative. Yet, it does explain a lot of things. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe anything you read. Believe what you can prove to yourself (subjective or objective) and strongly consider what you can&#39;t that connects or explains what you can prove. This is what I have done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you said about women being abused by not going outside by their own i find that as a misconception, i have been to Saudi Arabia and noticed pretty much independent women on their own doing their thing, ofcourse women arw opressed but probably a minority but with my own two eyes the majority of saudi women seems independent of going outside, shopping, eating, walking in a park. I am not defending the entirerty of saudi&#39;s society but maybe from what ive seen on a normal everyday basis compare to how the media magnify minor flaws of a country. I dont agree with alot of thing in that country but have seen most of the people seem to be happy and satisfied with the quality of life provided by Saudi Arabia. Its not everyones cup of tea but its still another country with innocent people runned by evil scums, just like any other country. </p>
