        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...It isn&#39;t really a good thing.  It&#39;s easy to shout &quot;SHILL!!&quot; from the mountain top, and you never really know if its a shill or a ignorant normy.  But A trend seems clear.  Confuse, Disorient, Distract, and degrade(the conversation.)<br/>
The primary talking point seems to be: Taking a position like a 9/11 truther, but claiming a commercial airline did in fact hit the pentagon.  Then if anyone argue against, they call you a &quot;No planer.&quot;  Whats important is that years ago another campaign was going on. It was a disinfo campaign designed to infiltrate 9/11 groups and post videos, taking the position that No Planes were at the twin towers, they were holograms(The original No Planer).  Obviously the idea is a confuse outsiders with competing no plane story&#39;s and a series of contradictions in the 9/11 truth community.  What I Believe to be the case is that Planes did actually hit the towers, but not the commercial airliners they are suppose to be.  I also believe its pretty obvious that it was a drone with explosives that hit the pentagon.  It was decorated to look similar to an American Airlines plane, but is drastically smaller.<br/>
My final thought is this:  I don&#39;t know exactly what happened, and many things are in the realm of possibility.  But we know as a fact that the official story is a lie. </p>

<p>3 4 5 6 were turned into confetti by debri from twin towers but stood.  7 was barely touched, fell like a controlled demolition.  Their explanation?  Pretend building 7 never existed.</p>
