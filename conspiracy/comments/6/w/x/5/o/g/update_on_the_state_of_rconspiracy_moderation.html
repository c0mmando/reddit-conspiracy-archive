       Because of our commitment to transparency, it's important for the health of this sub that all moderator activity can be held to the highest standards and utmost scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the very divisive nature of "conspiracy theories" in general has understandably contributed to a dramatically contentious environment here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , from which the moderating team certainly isn't immune.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has seen its fair share of drama over the years, and for those who may have missed the latest installment,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6w5eah/regarding_the_upheaval_on_the_mod_team_last/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">
        here's an overview regarding the "recent upheaval".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The result of this "upheaval" initially led to the removal of dronepuppet and the resignation of flytape, and culminated today in admin intervention to remove sarah_connor.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks ago, S_C made the concerning decision to remove the permissions of the rest of the team, a decision that the admins promptly reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admins have made it clear that any moderator who acts unilaterally and attempts to undermine the subreddit by removing all of their co-mods poses a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unmoderated sub (even for a short period of time) could be subject to doxx or other posts that would then be unable to be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of heeding the advice of the admins, S_C took further drastic action a few days ago by
       <em>
        removing
       </em>
       the rest of the mod team, compelling the admins to act again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because S_C forced the hand of the admins on two occasions, the rest of the mods unanimously decided that demoting S_C from the top (active) position was prudent, thus preventing further issues that would jeopardize the future of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to note that the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod team only voted to
       <em>
        demote
       </em>
       sarah_connor (not demod).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, S_C refused these conditions, and at this point we reached out to the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6w5eah/regarding_the_upheaval_on_the_mod_team_last/dm5mg7k/">
        Although S_C claimed to have been acting
       </a>
       in the best interest of the sub,
       <a href="https://archive.is/t06Cc">
        the timeline of events suggests otherwise
       </a>
       , for not only were my permissions removed and the rest of the team removed as mods, only two were then re-added (dronepuppet and flytape).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the best case scenario, this was a misguided attempt to restructure the mod team (and in the worst, an attempted coup). Regardless of motive, it was the wrong decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veteran mods of several years had their counters unnecessarily reset to 0, and the sub was exposed to precisely the type of vulnerability that the admins warned us against.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, here's a brief rundown of events:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         About a month ago, we noticed that ex-mod dronepuppet (DP) had approved several new and potentially suspicious accounts. When DP was asked for an explanation, his behavior was even more suspicious and our questions went largely unanswered.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Soon after, and ostensibly in the face of increasing tension among the mod team, SC decided to deperm the entire team and the admins had to step in to restore us all, while chastising SC and (politely) warning us to not let that happen anymore.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The mods unanimously voted to demote SC to a lower position on the team, which SC seemed to consider.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DP admitted to using alts and offered some obscure justification, and the rest of the mods began talks to have him removed for suspicious behavior and repeatedly ignoring our questions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A few days ago, SC decided to demod the rest of the team and invited only DP and flytape back. They both accepted and flytape stickied an announcement about "restructuring" the mod team.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Admins then reversed the removals and depermed SC, prompting flytape to resign in protest and our decision to finalize the vote to remove DP.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We repeatedly offered SC a chance to simply be demoted to a lower position on the team, with today as the deadline.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         SC doubled down and we appealed to the admins for his removal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Further details about all of these events can certainly be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       As things settle down, the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod team will be uttering a sigh of relief, as it's clearly in the best interest of the sub to simply move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't hesitate to share any thoughts or suggestions regarding the future of the sub, and that includes all manners of healthy criticism!

       I think you make a very good point here. Regardless of how you feel about the state of this sub at this moment, Reddit, Inc. has complete control over whatever happens on this site. Even if their motives are currently benign, and I don't believe they are, there's nothing to guarantee they will be in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should all be thinking about and working toward alternative models to the centralized discussion forum platform that reddit and other previous sites have been based on. A decentralized platform would be better (e.g. Mastodon, though it does have issues) or better yet fully distributed (I've not yet seen any viable candidate).

       Yeah, I think I made a post here (might have been another sub) about the project Barret Brown was working on, can't remember the name off the top of my head. The project seemed to be more about using webs of trust to pull information in citizen journalism than a discussion forum per se, but a forum or similar could be built off on top of it. It was still in alpha when I made the post.

       So when a business conspires to do harm, it's not a conspiracy? What is it about being a "business" that makes them immune from the crime of conspiracy in your opinion? Why do you think businesses should be allowed to secretly plan to do harm?

       No im saying with their websites they can control the content and do what they please. You cant expect a website to enlighten you or to have your best interest at heart. Create your own perfect website or dont use theirs. Its hard to complain when its not owned by any of us but use it . they dont have to let people speak freely or have to let content they dont want.

       Top mod was compromised, imo, two mods here saw something and were tricked, 4-5 mods are coming up (2-3 being groomed), and you are next on the chopping block. Look under you. You know I always stuck up for you and would choose you or dong to head the ship, but I worry. Considering admin actions.  It's a trap.

       Well that certainly is a matter of opinion...DP was relatively new, flytape has a rather "contentious" reputation on reddit in general, and SC has hardly been active in the sub for the last several years.

       I disagree, flytype immediately went off and made conspiracyright where "we don't have to worry about mopping up liberal tears" really adds credibility to the mods story in my mind when that's flytape first move after removal.

       Doesn't really change the relevant fact that he's a partisan hack who wanted a right wing safe place and that this sub showcases that fact. It's not really about when he made it but rather that him having made it lends credence to the accusations of bias and partisanship that've be levied against him.

       There are two groups at work here:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- the loud people out front and in charge of running the psyop on this subreddit
      </p>
      <p>
       2- the silent and massive number of user accounts that gang vote all scores to align with the purpose of the psyop
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in front continue to gaslight and the second team gangvotes (to disappear) anyone calling it out, while gang-upvoting to carve out comment sections into their own models.

       Why are you repeatedly hammering the "right wing" comment? What are you trying to establish? Those divisive terms and antiquated thought processes are the reason , almost exclusively,  forcing many problems in the world today and I question their motives of anyone who uses them as their primary evidence against others.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they disagree with a political view so be it. If they're wrong so be it. But if you consider being "right wing" as evidence of wrongdoing, you are either severely misguided or intentionally misleading.

       My concern is the post appeared to me to set that position as the reason he wasnt a good mod and I disagree if that's the case. If the TMOR theories are true, if they're complete bullshit it's done. But I'm not in allegiance to a party or platform and don't wait to constantly question whether I'm posting something to "right" or "left" here. It sets off alarms, if that makes sense.

       Who literally cares? You know what I hear when people say things like this? "That person doesn't agree with my beliefs so they're wrong" . I don't care what his beliefs are. Using ones personal beliefs or ideas  to judge them is not just going down a bad road, it's heading off a fucking cliff. There are zero reasons to hold someone's views against them unless those views interfere with their duties. In this case, I never saw it. I never experienced it and I'm not only bisexual but incredibly liberal in many views.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refuse to accept judging someone strictly baded on such a contrived, narrow, media-enforced and small minded categorization as that. I think it's unsettling and a sign of grim futures for many freedoms I used to take for granted.

       The wrongdoing isn't that they had right wing beliefs but that they were moderating this place like T_D with bans for having liberal beliefs and using alt accounts to shitpost and upvote each other just like T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D is a constant campaign rally for a right leaning politician. Conspiracy is a place for discussion of conspiracies and news that we can't discuss elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but I don't see a shred of discussion happening on T_D and this sub has been quickly going to shit over the last few months with the T_D dudes in the mods. Good riddance.

       I wonder sometimes how much longer we have until the world notices. Part of me is hopeful for that day; part of me thinks that it's going to be the apocalypse. There is so much tension, and not many know why it's there, but if they did, whoo boy, that would be a lot of power all converging on TPTB, but then again, no one is starving, so I guess no one will do anything, if history is any indication. lol

       DronePuppet has admitted to creating alt accounts that he used to troll the sub to bait users into breaking rules and then banning them.  No gaslighting required.  I don't think you watched what happened very closely if you still can't figure it out.

       The fact that you as a mod here are continuously using the term "right wing", and "right wing fashion" make me very skeptical of your motives. This sub used to rise above the entire left-right paradigm, and understand that this divide and conquer tactic is detrimental to open and honest discourse.

       Believe me, I'm absolutely no fan of FlyTape. He banned me for calling him out on the whole podcast fiasco.  I've butted heads with him many times. But your seemingly inability to view this sub in an nonpartisan way, really does a disservice to this wonderful sub.

       SC was not right wing, that is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it was is SC and flytape had a long relationship and agreed on the nature of the problem we had here. SC was gone 99% of the time, so when they popped in and saw what a shitshow the sub had become, they probably asked the user they had the most experience with what was going on, which was flytape. And we know where flytape stood on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both know how disconnected SC is. I doubt they even have a coherent political position. Quit trying to fuel this bullshit right left conflict that keeps getting pushed around here. We have plenty of totally organic not suspicious at all users to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most disappointing thing I have read in this whole thread. We should not be taking political positions even if we have them.

       Fair enough. Dude was weird, lots of people were just happy Clinton lost and that was enough to celebrate Trump winning. My main issue is we have a chance to walk away from all the partisan bickering once all the hoopla dies down. We don't need to bring it up any more than it already is. We don't have any explicitly political mods anymore, I see it as a fresh start of sorts.

       's view on this. I'm not ready to condemn or even speak to SC's motives, but I do think he showed poor judgement and failed to respect the democratic process our mod team operates under. Up until today, I would have accepted him merely taking a lower position on the mod team, which was the decision the mod team made and he agree to, but he continually said he would take a lower position and then reneged on that promise.

       Besides the fact that Flytape identified these mods as part of the great liberal meta-conspiracy to take over the subreddit, why do you feel this way? As in what have these mods actually done that you can illustrate.

       It's all very strange. I'm not sure what prompted all this really. From what I've seen, the only sub manipulations and open bias on repeated display were exhibited by Flytape, and potentially dronepuppet by using alts and approving obvious troll posters. If this was their way of trying to maintain non-partisanship here, it sure didn't come off that way.

       I'm curious if there's a plan to place to deal with users who've barely been around reddit but are currently racking up 10, 20 posts per day on this sub. Regardless of context or observable agenda, this is fishy behavior.

       It was us discovering DP's alts that led to this current situation. Even more that he avoided any explanation for a week (while participating elsewhere on reddit) and then once he admitted to using alts, refused to tell us what the purpose of the alts was, how many and which accounts he had been using, and how long he had been doing so. We still haven't gotten an explanation for any of this.

       There is no plan in place at this moment, though we have been discussing it. It's not against any of our rules, and we're reticent to add any rules that would limit the free flow of information on this sub. Do you have any suggestions?

       I suggested a cap on posts a given user can submit per day. Maybe something really generous like 15 to start. But yeah, any limits can be argued to be censorship, even if these aim to thwart the gumming up of /new and karma farming that occurs here every day. It's kind of a conundrum. Doesn't really bother me beyond the way it buries the articles and research of legit users. Quantity over quality and such.

       I think that's an idea worth exploring, and personally I think it could work without hurting users' ability to share important information.

       The realist in me just says any user who feels restricted will just make an alt and bypass the cap anyway.

       I don't think anything we say here will change your opinion, but I'd ask that you give us a chance and see how this plays out. Is there anything in particular you're concerned about?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the admin team "favoring" the current mods, I don't know that's entirely accurate. I expect the admins do want stability, and SC removed the ability of the mod team to moderate twice in as many weeks. The admins did not "pick" the current team; we voted as a team for them to remove SC after we gave him many chances to voluntarily demote himself, and which he agreed to multiple times without following through.

       Nope, not at all, but this is a good teaching moment. What you just did there, where you read what I wrote and then turned it into what you want to read, that's the definition of intentional ignorance/misunderstanding, which up until a few years ago was quite literally the definition of
       <em>
        stupidity
       </em>
       . It sucks that the word is gone, now. It was very useful, but like many other words that were too descriptive, it now rolls along the euphemism treadmill. That's a story for another time, though.

       I'm sorry to say, you're going to have to live with that bias, or rectify it alone. Remember this for the next time we interact. No hard feelings, for real.

       Oh so you have nothing to actually say about the fact that you admittidly accuse people of being shills without real proof other than your precious feelings about them? Instead you'd rather just try to call me stupid. Good to know you aren't interested in even pretending to talk about how you can prove someone's a shill and how shill accusations without proof are worthless comments that hurt the sub.

       The best solution is to drop the stupid no shilling accusation rule. I dont dont who was the moron who came up with that rule, but it was so obvious why it was implemented and who was and still enforce it. That rule was the first step for the hostile takeover.

       Exactly. We have a sharp group of people here. As much as it sucks, we need to be able to battle the shills openly so that casual readers are even aware of the war being waged on this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying we should allow people to go around calling everyone a shill without any elaboration. That would be spamming/trolling, which is obviously counterproductive. That said, there shouldn't be any attempt to restrict those of us who post in good faith. If we are willing to honestly discuss what is concerning about a particular user, then we should be free to do so. The moderators shouldn't stand in the way. The moderators should not be in the business of protecting people's feelings. They should be right there in the comments helping us sort it out.

       At the very least, some education on the subject. If the mods cared, they would be helping the community to understand the phenomenon.

       Did you read my

        sticky post
       </a>
       a few months back? I think I tried to explain some of the phenomenon there. What are your thoughts on that post? We also have Gentleman's Guide to Forum Spies on the sidebar, but most people probably won't see that unless they're specifically looking. I wouldn't be opposed to voting to sticky another piece on the presence of shilling, though.

      <p>
       I assume you mean dropping? I'm not sure how much good that would do. I can only see every thread filled with people accusing each other of being shills, and actual arguments for or against a particular proposition just being lost. That said, I'm not opposed to doing a one or two week trial of suspending rule 10 just to see what the actual effect is.

       Oh, gee. I don't know. The fact that three people were removed from their old mod positions when the policy was always "make a new sub"?

       Everything is deliberately vague. WHICH admins intervened, specifically? WHY EXACTLY would they give a fuck about short-term "stability" of r/conspiracy? The unnamed admins absolutely did "pick a team" by intervening. What precisely gave you the right to force SC into a "voluntary" demotion?

       because they are liberals twats from san fran? i dont know, i cannot begin to understand the psychological dysfunction of what causes someone to become cancer. as for evidence of them being cancer, I do not have the time or the inclination to give a reddit history lesson, perhaps look into the history of
       <a href="/r/subredditcancer">
        /r/subredditcancer
       </a>
       if you need a refresher. admins are cancer. anyone they oppose is chemo. anyone who opposes the chemo is also cancer.

       a) I dont give a fuck. do you want a cookie? i dont care. go buy one.

      <p>
       b) it shows you as a mod for the last year with the sub created 3 years ago. if you left and came back, there was likely cancerous drama surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) spez has edited the database. usernames and post history/account history are meaningless now, and technically always were.

       that's correct, but its not unreasonable to feel that someone being on the benefiting side of a mod coup with the help of reddit admins make someone too far left.

       So you only want mods who are roughly on the same side politically as you.

       But of course, some of the remaining mods have an opposing political outlook, which of course means they're "liberal twats" and shouldn't have any mod power in muh

       people are going to be in one of three categories. people who immediately upvoted my comment (right wingers, and independent moderates who have become anti-left), group 2 is corrupt sketchy left wing antifa loving shitbags who love the admins (these people likely immediately downvoted my comment).

       yea, there is some group 3 of people who are new, unaware, dont understand, have a bunch of questions. it would possibly do them a bunch of good to get answers. to them, sorry. i dont feel like giving answers. im just literally tired and exhausted, too much to have it out with long winded reddit history lessons, and explaining shit they could learn on their own just from paying attention to their surroundings. im definitely not going to go there in a thread where some cancerous person is trying to distract me, discredit me, and be an asshole pretending to not understand the obvious.

       Very similar comment styles. Identical
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus when someone comments on TrumpRusConspiracy's comments, and he interprets it as a rule 10. There is one person more often than not to warn/ban and remove. Within minutes.

       I'd like to see your research here. And please be honest, maybe half of the replies that user gets are people calling him a shill, usually just based on the username.

       Most of this is overall by experience. Engaging into conversations with TrumpRusConspiracy for a few months. You get a certain knowledge of how they comment. I haven't really seen creq interact with the community that much until lately. They could be twins

       I should have taken screens of instances when moderator got involved in a lot of removed comments. I cant seem to get the modlog to go back over a day. But whatever.

       Its not enough proof. Its pretty much a baseless accusation. Im fine with that. Just thought it needed to be said

       The mod log is currently having issues. Not sure if they are intentional issues or just a bug, but I messaged the mods about it and they said they needed to get a hold of some other user who was the one who maintained it I guess.

       I think when the user account we use to populate the mod log was removed it fucked up the connection. We have been very preoccupied and no one has had a chance to wire it back up.

       I like it too. Any time I get some dick accusing me of whatever bias they are pushing, I can point at that. I spend a great deal of time working the queue, and if it isn't obvious what I am about to anyone who might say otherwise, then that is their problem.

       No worries. We're always going to catch hell no matter what we do. Some here are reasonable and others are just making up some bitter attacks based on nothing so far as I can tell. Some just see a chance to troll and spread disinformation because it must be fun for them. That's just how it goes sometimes.

       Yep, I think so as well. I think they confuse me with other users and are always accusing me of shit, but they can never seem to come up with evidence or permalinks to back up their accusations.

       All the new mods are ShareBlue operatives.  The pattern of takeover is unmistakably similar to what happened to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       last year and many of the other big subs like
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/politicaldiscussion">
        /r/politicaldiscussion
       </a>
       , and even
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/sandersforpresident">
        /r/sandersforpresident
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS a coup happening in this sub and the victim is Sarah_Connor and the users of this sub.  The usurpers are the new mods who are ShareBlue operatives.

       don't trust any of them at all, they aren't here to stop doxxers or anything like it says in this post, merely promote their own interests, whatever they are.

       someone who gets to deep into the net conspiracy game starts to get involved in some real games, stay away and don't trust them, look to yourself, your intelligence and your investigative truth to find out what you need to know.

       These are pretty big accusations against a handful of mods who might have just gotten caught up in some mod drama and have opposing views of direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you have further proof to your claims? I do admit the pattern is very similar but I think it's just mod drama. The timing couldn't be worse but this is a reflection of the divide and conquer techniques working on us. We are at a point we are doing it to ourselves now.

       Considering I can still post anything I want here, I find your empty accusations to be suspicious. Do you have a source? Or anything specific? It honestly sounds like you're making stuff up and you have no proof or context at all.

       At the very least, some education on the subject. If the mods cared, they would be helping the community to understand the phenomenon.

       Shilling on Reddit is the most pertinent conspiracy there is. Raise awareness. Get it to the front page.

       Education meaning what?  I'm sure the majority of subscribers here are aware of what shills are and that they're here on reddit.  There have been hundreds of threads posted about them over the years and more get posted all the time.

       I don't have a simple solution, that's why I asked if you had one.  To start with, it isn't possible to identify with certainty who's a shill and who isn't, and because of that it greatly limits what we can do.

       It's important we start planning for a place to fall back to, even temporarily. Somewhere we could get a message out of where to congregate next. Things seem shaky here...but until mods start deleting mass comments and we get ban lists for links and sites there is still some hope.

       Thanks for shouting the sub out.

      <p>
       I just want an area for free discussion of conspiracies without constant attacks
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time I was linked to top minds I was so sad. I didn't understand how there are people who mock and bully like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I mean I do to an extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since reddit is not a bastion of free speech like I once thought I decided to make my own sub with very simple rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) no shilling
      </p>
      <p>
       2) no topminds
      </p>
      <p>
       3) collegial discussion

       That eliminates 90 percent of the problems here.

       often disputes come up regarding subs. the admins response has simply been "make a new sub" if you dont like how one is run.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no reason the old mods shouldnt keep this sub, and the new ones can make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy2">
        /r/conspiracy2
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/conspiracy3">
        /r/conspiracy3
       </a>
       or whatever, and users can pick whichever they prefer, or sub to both, or neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       as someone else so perfectly stated, the admins spezed the modlist. what happened here was complete and total fuckery, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is any lesson to be learned here, its that if you run a sub the admins dont like, dont wipe the modlist all at once. the smart thing to do is replace one person a week, or one person a month until you have a fresh roster. fuck, if I ran a big sub, i would constantly have people on rotation just to prevent anyone being there too long.

       S_C was the top (oldest) mod. anyone under him is "new" mods. these new mods (the current ones) succeeded in a coup/takeover of the sub. the current mods voted to remove the only mod newer than them they didnt like. the OP describes this without any confusion.

       S_C was demoted and then removed, right? after adding new mods and deleting all the old mods.

       S_C was responsible for resetting all the timers, so I guess this discussion is going nowhere.

       It is. All the current moderators have been here at least since Novemberish, if not multiple years (me for 2).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have fresh timers because we were first forced to log into Slack (I think to phish for IPs) two weeks ago to get our permissions back, and then after we were
       <em>
        all removed
       </em>
       by SC and then Flytape and DronePuppet were readded (and accepted invitations) within 30 minuted of the Purge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reset everyone's timer except for SC and wax, and then after unanimous voting by the moderators who remained, voted to remove SC per reddit's site-wide moderator code of conduct (specifically, the moderator retaliation clause).
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape and DronePuppet's timers ended when they resigned voluntarily.

       Can we get a sticky or sidebar link identifying when each moderator was first added to the team? I think this information needs to be more visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously a moderator who was just added in November shouldn't get a vote equivalent to a moderator who has been here for years. What is the point of having ranked permissions if the new guys can just vote the old mods out?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a vote on the matter, I would have suggested starting fresh by removing any mods that have been added for the first time in the last year. Media Matters for America has been wreaking havoc on the internet for nearly two years, and we should be extremely wary of the possibility that we let them vote some shills into the mod team.

       yes, by cancerous admins. this is the issue. they should have left him alone, let new mods leave and make a new sub if they wanted to. the original sub creator should be free to add/remove mods as they deem necessary.

       Yeah on second thought I think I see what you were talking about.  Kind of a weird consideration I haven't thought of before, but if I am, for example, having a 12th birthday party, and my mother gets me a birthday card, I can look at that card and be sure I'm 12. But if I then take the card and throw it in the trash, how would I know how old I am. Am I now 0 years old again?  Am I now a newborn?

       Drone Puppet had no business being on the short list, but SC and Flytape have modded this sub for years.  I will take their opinions over the rest of the sub combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why do the admins only seem to intervene to push old mods out?  Every time AAtA mods a sub this happens.  He was one of the main players in the takeover of wikileaks sub, and oh my god has that sub gone downhill since then.

       Some more detail for those interested:
      </p>
      <p>
       The accounts DronePuppet was making approved submitters were right wing troll accounts. He admitted to banning users who broke rules when replying to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I discovered this after he and Flytape called for me to be removed from the team for banning one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that gives some more perspective on the situation.

      </p>
      <p>
       And really it was more of just a place to make fun of people complaining about mods. It was started as complete satire.

       It previously was apolitical. We recognized that everything was political theater and that a ruling elite ran things behind the scenes. Kinda scary now to think that a contingent of people will now be openly supporting government as a legitimate organization.

       I think I agree with this. I browsed r/conspiracy for years but rarely participated and it was mostly non-political aside from things like JFK. But when the_donald roared onto the scene on reddit r/conspiracy seems to be a subreddit the handlers took a liking to and it got political fast. The, in my opinion, inorganic rise of the alt right on reddit is largely what lead to me beginning to actively comment on reddit because I felt like I had to fight propaganda. You won't convince the commenters you are replying to, but hopefully onlookers see the conversation.

       um just a thought but why would a right winger make right wing trolling account just to ban left wingers responding to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       this imho seems more like a shady anti-fa like tactic where a left winger poses as a right winger just to stir up shit.

       I'm glad you guys have the  public mod log. I saw DronePuppet ignoring reports on MAGABolt and then unbanning him after another mod permabanned and thought right away that it was his alt account. Good to see   other mods calling out shitty behavior like that

       No this guy tecumsehs revenge goes around talking his opinion as fact when it incorrect. Like when he tried to teach me about my own people with incorrect info then tried to say my facts were wrong when I lived in the place he was talking about . So any comment of his needs some sources to back it up . He has already been proven to speak on things he knows not

       No they claimed the alt I banned was a essentially a valued member of the community that was adding quality content to the community. I guess they were just hoping that everyone believed them without looking. Some did. But for those who looked it was essentially "He's enforcing the rules as they should and stopping bad shit, we should kick him out!"?.

       I would say that there is pretty much universal if not unanimous support among the mod team for
       <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">
        /u/axolotl_peyotl

       Thus far is doing an awesome job.  I think some safeguards are critical but I'll have to sleep on it. I just want the general freedom to share and read opinions or theories without wondering who is going to get angry. And now outside assaults from other subs is thrown in the mix, that small goal keeps getting shoved. I don't pretend to speak for anyone else but I think the fact this is resolved is a positive thing.

       Good point. I do have a question regarding combat of perceived "shills" from both sides of the aisle. Can we establish a rule preventing automated or paid activity? Sure it'll be ignored but It would give us a valid outlet to report the issue in the rare cases evidence pops up proving either of those things. Just a thought thanks

       If actual evidence of being paid to post here, including admission, comes up, we will ban with prejudice. You'll have to ask the rest of the mods if this has ever happened, but I seem to recall hearing that it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding automated posters, I'd be willing to explore the possibility of creating a rule to prohibit it. But again, finding actual instances will be rare. I suspect most of the automated behavior is done on voting, and we as mods simply don't have the tools to detect it. Even in instances where we have strong evidence that a post or comment has been artificially upvoted, we can't prove the commenter was actually responsible, and in many cases, I suspect they are not.

       this is a joke.  you guys worked with the admins to remove the longest saving mod.

       This type of BS is what literally destroyed r/politics and turned it into a liberal echo chamber filled with the independent and wapo articles.

      <p>
       This whole situation makes  me hate reddit and all it will do is cause a lot of people to leave the site and drag down the quality as it becomes an echo chamber of thought.

       Considering flytape's schizm with ConspiracyRight and DP's alt right trolling, I'm guessing they wanted to turn this into t_d for reals. Guessing s_c is a lot more right wing than he says or they gaslighted him about some conspiracy to manipulate him into demodding everyone. Ironic.

       Its possible for those on the right to hold legitimate conversations without spiralling down the path of meme magic. You reveal your ignorance when you attempt to bucket anyone who disagrees with you into T_D.

       Besides this, a moderators' political leaning should bear no relevance. It's interesting how "right wing" is portrayed as a bad, yet there's no effort to focus on the alternative.

       One of the mods, DronePuppet, admitted to the other mods that he was using alt accounts that were rightwing troll accounts specifically to annoy and troll users here so that he could people when they responded negatively to it.

       One of them was
       <a href="/u/MAGABolt">
        /u/MAGABolt

       and you can go look at the trolling and total lack of "legitimate conversations" for yourself.

       Nah you misunderstood what I said. They attempted to overthrow and moderation of this sub and now they have r/ConspiracyRight, where they openly ban descent. One of the mods involved had several alt-troll accounts that pushed a certain narrative, another made a "joke" sticky post here welcoming T_D users when T_D temporarily shut down. Do the math...

       You can't honestly look at the front page of the sub right now and claim ShareBlue/CTR have taken over? There's 1 Trump post on there right now and it's about the militarisation of police, which has been a pretty hated idea among the Conspiracy community long before Trump came in. Most of the rest seem like the exact kind of posts CTR would downvote.

       Another interesting move they've started doing (brilliant really) is trying to frame Trump as "the establishment", therefore anything said about him that isn't negative can be met with "You're going to defend the ESTABLISHMENT??!?!"

       But you and I both know still that both sides of the aisle hate trump. So while is part of the govt, he's also an outsider. These career politicians all have dirt  on them. I think that's a lot of what PG is about, these ratty politicians want money and power so they get blackmailed. Trump never went through that initiation and doesn't need the establishment so that are trying to beat him into submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refer to it as the deep state now in these cases because we know the deep state is against trump, or was so long as he didn't go along with their wars. They are warming up to him now a bit I think though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this CtR/ShareBlue is genius though. They are just talking to themselves. We know who the shills are just by the content of their message. Or the dupes who tout the same corporate narratives you find on CNN. They are flooding these posts and downvote brigading yet you and I can still talk and just ignore the riff raff if needed.

       Yea once prominent Republicans started coming out against him, that's when you have to stop and wonder what is really going on behind the scenes.

       And also yes, as a whole they aren't geniuses, but a couple of their tactics lately I've noticed and thought "damn, they're getting better." It's like all we are doing by calling them out on their bullshit is getting better at being able to hide their bullshit.

       We are fighting an uphill battle though, it's hard when you can't even call a shill, a shill, without being banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem if someone calls me a shill because I'm not pushing any corporate narrative. Good luck calling a conspiracy theorist a shill, it's the opposite of what the word means. But yet the admins and mods won't address or change rules to allow us to literally call out the people and bots that are making this sub bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can always just ignore them which is what I do. Not worth arguing online with someone who is paid to be dense and to redirect.

       Yea I guess it's officially a lost cause. You can battle them all you want, and the most you can hope for is to at least stay in the positives (while the person you're arguing has 40+ upvotes).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all an effort to control the narrative for people that don't come here often though. They know that their tactics aren't working on us, but they don't give a shit because we're not the people that they want to manipulate. It's the users that casually come by here to try and learn more about things that they won't learn much about from the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       When those people come here, most of the time they just see the top comments on every post, all circle jerking with each other, and then move on.

       Which one is the neutral one? At one point there were like three or four spinoff subs that looked promising but had very little actual activity. I'm not going to abandon this sub, but maybe I'll add another one to my browsing list.

       The establishment and deepstate paid for users have hit this place hard and will hit any place that grows big enough to house dissenting opinions and where they can't push the crap they push on r politics. R conspiracy was a big one for them but it will be hard for them to stay on topic now.  All conspiracies lead back to the deep state and the establishment which is the path it's trying to lead everyone away from

       Indeed, I suppose I would say if given the chance again I would vote Bernie.

       But yes, on the whole there is a wide diversity of political opinions (there are still mods who lean right on the team, as there are mods who lean left and even some mods who don't have a political opinion with regards the USA in any direction).
      </p>
      <p>
       I did get the sense that the folks who leaned hard right on the mod team felt threatened (which is weird, as no mod ever even brought up removing flytape from the team and, in fact, most of his co-mods very much appreciated the perspective he brought to a wide-range of issues related to the subreddit and otherwise), but that group of mods were also trying to advocate censorship of topics that they didn't like and such for the past few months, as they felt the subreddit shouldn't allow discussion of any conspiracies that the MSM promulgates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I always take any conspiracy orientated theme of MSM's coverage as an indication that there is perhaps more going on than meets the eye (in the sense that the "conspiracy" the MSM is highlighting is probably a distraction from the root issue in some way), but I think it undermines the very hexis of this subreddit when a moderator suggests banning entire topics of discussion on those grounds.

       On the whole, we strive to keep inter-mod discussions privileged as it allows all mods to voice their perspectives without fear of reprisal, etc; however, in this case the line moves somewhat to accommodate context for a major subreddit change I suppose.

       Not too long ago, it used to be US (as in people who came to r/conspiracy) vs THEM (those that supported the MSM). Now it's turned into left wing conspiracy theorists against right wing conspiracy theorists and it's absolutely ridiculous.

       No it wasn't. Your point was to say that this sub is so right that anyone on the left is automatically a "cultrual marxist sjw". If you were actually trying to remain apolitical about it, you would have also said "and anyone that is right of Ron Paul is a dumb Nazi T_D supporter".

       One thing I've noticed in threads is that "a side" is more likely to enter and upvote a thread when they like the news. For example, Trump says something stupid and r/worldnews has a thread on it? Lots of upvotes to anti-Trump comments. A group of black teenagers kidnap and torture a white dude with what appear to be mental issue? Tons of pro-Trump comments. Basically, people show up when their biases are confirmed. Go into the thread about the FBI not releasing Hillary's emails to see this in action.

       I predominantly blame Flytape for the shift, though it seems that S_C and DP were neck deep in it as well. They were trying to make the sub more fair and balanced or some nonsense, and instead just bought
       <em>

       into and reinforced the artificial right/left divide. This predictably divided and conquered the sub.

       They were reacting to the massive changes this sub has seen since the election. The fact that you're blaming this all on them means you're either new here and don't know any better, or you're trying to push an agenda to get other people to think that is what happened.

       I understand what they were doing. That doesn't make it any more intelligent or effective. They saw a fire, decided that the way to fight it would be to build another fire right next to it, we're supposed to trust their intentions when instead of putting it out they damn near burned down the sub?

       T_D is a proud echo chamber in which dissent against the most powerful administration in the world is not permitted. Any long-time user of this sub would know that this culture is diametrically opposed to ours, which celebrates free thought and suspicion of authority. Yet Flytape did everything possible to import them here and create a safe space.

       This is the one sub that should know better than any other the dangers of divide and conquer. But everything they did was the worst possible thing to foster productive discourse, and the best possible thing to ensure that every issue is drowned out by a useless right v left slapfight.

       I don't blame it on them entirely, no. They were actually responding to an issue that was really happening. But they were the adults here, the mods who absolutely should have some grasp of how divide and conquer works. You just cannot fight it by pouring in more of the ideology that you feel is unrepresented. The only thing that can ever produce is more division, a more effective and complete conquering of the ability to have a productive discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I do blame them. Because, out of anyone, they should have known better.

       I'm an egalitarian humanist.  Hard to believe given my history, but I think all humans are essentially clones and all ego is illusion.  I find the polarization of politics annoying and distracting from the truth.  I thought this sub was even attempting to even physically resemble the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ussCHoQttyQ">
        perfectly neutral race from Futurama
       </a>
       , but recently most comment sections start with "oh please, John Oliver debunked this last week..."  and it gets a ton of upvotes.  The smell of Brock and agenda have been lurking in all news-related subs lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose politically I'm a progressive.  I believe in taking care of others more than yourself and that money can't buy you true, lasting happiness.  I think that rich people are trying to replace love and acceptance with money.  But I've been pushed Right from my squishy center by obnoxious, moralizing, virtue-signaling shills on the Left.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a stupid thread recently with a carry-over from /pol/ breaking down the format of John Oliver's show and how the beats in it are designed to prevent critical thinking.  It was very well thought out and presented, but top comment of course is something to the effect of "oh please, must be another Alex Jones bot.  Go back to T_D, cuck"  It was like I was in /politics, where I am mercifully still banned and not tempted to engage with those Morlocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short I can see why Rightwing truthers like Flytape have been pushed away.  I also look forward to his sub taking off.

       While I can't really speak about any of the other mods, DronePuppet was definitely up to some shady shit and needed to go. He was running at least two alt accounts that he was using to troll users and flood "contest mode" threads with off topic top level comments. Remember MAGABolt? That account was almost certainly run by DronePuppet. He approved the account, he ignored all reports on the account, he banned people who responded to the account negatively, and he unbanned the account TWICE after other mods tried to remove it. The same thing happened a month or so before that with another troll account.

       Yeah, DronePuppet was caught creating alts and making them approved submitters secretly so that he could troll and shitpost on them without their triggering automod.  He also admitted to using these alts to bait users into rulebreaking so he could then ban them, a blatant abuse of mod powers.

       A few have appealed and been unbanned yeah.  It's impossible to keep track of them all though so without an appeal they probably are still currently banned.  We usually give second chances though unless the user was an obvious troll.

       Okay, I was just curious. I had messaged a couple of them at the time to see what was going on, which is what got me started down that rabbit hole. Hopefully the mod logs are working again soon, because that is the best way to prevent any suspicious activity like this!

       Ironic that you linked a screenshot of WarmBacon, considering I'm fairly certain that was another one of DronePuppet's alt accounts. We know for a fact that MAGABolt was, and WarmBacon acted the exact same way, used very similar language, and was also used to bait people into breaking the rules. And when they did, they were immediately banned by DronePuppet or Flytape.

       New account with negative karma gets mysteriously added as a "contributor" by DronePuppet which allows that user to bypass Automod. Magabolt then spams Trump memes and harasses other users. Other mods ban that him, for rulebreaking, DronePuppet unbans him, and bans the users complaining about him.

       Holy shit, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened to me, but it was only a warning.  It was that mod that removed my comment when I replied to someone that was obviously baiting people into calling them a shill.

       Yep.  Not saying for sure your specific case was him but he was doing exactly what you're describing.  We only discovered five or so of his alts but there could have been more, he never provided us with a full list or really much detail at all.

       He was. The other mods have confirmed it and apparently DronePuppet didn't even deny it when they confronted him about it. I'm fairly certain he was also WarmBacon, another troll account from a couple months ago. It's pretty ridiculous that a mod was doing something like that, isn't it?

       But you don't get that say. S_C was the oldest mod; they got the say. If you didn't like that, you could create and promote your own subreddit, which is exactly how it was supposed to be.

       we're all speculating here. however, i don't think this plays out without some element of desperation from S_C and DP... they couldn't have thought they could get away with this - it's socially inept from the start.
      </p>

       So what happened that made them do something like this? S_C hasn't been a very active mod for a long time now... what caused them to spaz out?

       but I think it's been pretty clear from many mods writing here that his political leanings were obviously provoking them alongside his actions. To assume that his partisanship was completely out of control and not put that same attention into the converse means they created a power vacuum of sorts. I know that all the mods are not 'bad guys', but when the response to these things is handled like it was, there is a shift in balance that is not organic and that can lead to fuckery. I think that's what people are slightly perturbed about - there's no argument that DP and flytape acted in a way that doesn't allow them to continue as mods in this subreddit, but to think they were not somehow provoked into such a desperate action is also foolhardy in my opinion. What kind of environment is resulting from this shift which came from the reddit admins and not directly from the community? We can't know until we see it play out, but it's got about half the sub worried. That's how divide and conquer works - you're always going to be letting down half the group.

       We could if some people didn't feel so strongly about their "side" that they let it affect their ability to moderate. I don't care what your political beliefs are as long as you ignore them when it comes to being a moderator. Though I do find it incredibly suspicious that anyone would be blindly loyal to any candidate, politician, or president. That seems really out of place in this type of community.

       Man, with how hard the "left" (establishment) are shilling compared to the "right", and the constant barrage of MSM silliness, and how the "left" seemingly took over this sub, Reddit as a whole, and now the internet, I have to say that I am sad to see those three leave. Didn't know Sarah, but fly and drone are usually good guys.

       Did you see my other comment about DronePuppet? He was most certainly not a "good guy". He was using alt accounts as ban bait to troll other users until they would say something that could be construed as an attack and then ban them for Rule 10 violations. He also used one of these alt accounts (MAGABolt) to spam dozens of top level comments in contest mode threads so that the actual discussion was buried under all of his off topic comments. When other mods tried to ban MAGABolt for numerous rule violations, DronePuppet unbanned it every time. He also ignored all reports on the account and set it as an approved user so that it had no posting limit. This was all plainly visible in the mod logs.

       Yes, in a fight, with nothing at stake, honor is what you decide on between each other. Said another way, turnabout is fair play. There is no "think" about it; just go to ShareBlue's website. You want me to give you a handful of shill accts I killed? Or, we could go read any number of articles about advertising on reddit, influence marketing, and MSM bias.
      </p>

       I dunno if it was you that I said this to, but I stand up for what is fair. That doesn't win you popularity contests, but sometimes amazing things happen.

       Yes yes, I know all about your brave shill hunts. I also know that you sent phishing links to a whole bunch of normal Reddit users and creamed your pants when it said they were all using Amazon servers. Nevermind the fact that it was Reddit's spam filter triggering your link. Now I won't argue against the fact that there are shills on Reddit. No one can argue against that. But I don't go around accusing every user who has a different view than me of being a shill. What I do is find concrete evidence and send it to the mods. Like I did when DronePuppet was using alt accounts to harass users, disrupt discussions, push an agenda, and break subreddit rules.

       And the user I reported was very clearly violating the rules and abusing their position as moderator. I KNOW this, I don't just believe it. The other mods agreed, and DronePuppet even admitted it himself. This isn't a fact up for debate. It is 100% proven.

       You accuse the other side of stacking the deck (which is cheating) so you decide to cheat also. I don't care how you justify it. That's the same logic that antifa uses when they fight violence with violence.

       I don't have much info, but I'd be lying if I said that I couldn't see how much more prominent the shilling from MSM/deepstate/left/whatever is, and I've seen what happens to people who fight this stuff (Aaron Swartz), so I'm sort on the root for the underdog team. I don't even have a side in this whole dumb ass game. I just hate unfairness. I wouldn't even care if this were all organic, but it's not.

       You keep pretending you don't have a dog in this fight but you very clearly do. You are trying to justify a mod abusing his power to disrupt any conspiracy discussions that involved the sitting President of the United States. You then followed this mod to his new safe space sub that was created to specifically avoid any conspiracies related to the right wing. I mean, it's right in the sub's name and rules.

       No, I didn't cherrypick anything. Your entire premise is that DronePuppet and Flytape are the underdogs. You are trying to lump them in with those who oppose the deep state, even though they are both ardent supporters of our current President and administration. Or are you still falling for the idea that Trump isn't part of the deep state and is one of the good guys?

       It's honestly not worth arguing with him.  He claims to not be partisan but is anti-left and pro-right in his comments.  If you try to argue with him, if he doesn't have a clever response, he'll find a way to peace out of the conversation.

       Oh, you mean like how can I tell individual shills? Patterns, I guess, and experience. I outed a lot of shills awhile back by tracking their IPs to an Amazon server farm, and I got pretty good at it while I was doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting called a shill is bound to happen if you are a real person and also parrot the accepted narrative. Don't take it personally. Honestly, I don't know how they didn't see this coming. If this keeps going how it is, no one at all will trust. I have even been called a shill once, for telling people to wait until Sunday for GoT and not download it illegally. lol It just happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as how I know who shills and how much and what their goals are? Loooots of diggin. Our enemies, in order, are Eglin AFB, Israeli college kids; ShareBlue; other influence marketers; and lastly, corporate advertisers.

       If they are letting it affect their mod actions then yes! Especially if they are creating alt accounts to distract from any conspiracies that target their "side" like DronePuppet was doing. I'd prefer moderators to run the sub in a way where I can't even tell what their political beliefs are by how neutral they act.

       I support things like environmental protections, expanding human rights to access clean water, government regulation of industries that would profit at the expense of our ability to exist on this planet.
       <br/>
       Call me crazy, but I also believe that industry should not be allowed to lie to the public to start foreign wars, or bribe government officials. Yep I'm a dirty commie.

        corporate personhood

       We were doing pretty well with the "We are the 99%" thing, and had the right people in the crosshairs, but that's been conveniently usurped by a movement that pits us all against each other. Pretty convenient for the guys in the crosshairs, eh?

       I'm not sure how exactly,  but capping capitalism somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works great in theory but gets out of control in late stage and has left us with a handful of corporations controlling everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe setting a % amount maximum that the top chiefs of a corporation can earn (incl. bonuses) in relation to the lowest paid worker.  Then tightening monopoly laws.

       The elite are communists. If you look at how communism went in practice it really makes sense. North Korea is their model society. There is a leader with ultimate power and everyone else is basically slaves to the leader and the inner circle. The people are fully brainwashed, destitute, and starving to death which exactly what they want for us with Agenda 21 and population reduction. The elite are trying to expand the North Korea model on a global scale.

       Precisely. I couldn't agree more. Which is why that mentality shouldn't exist in mods of a "non partisan" sub.

       I would be agreeing with you if you were able to demonstrate that flytape was banning people for their political views.

      <p>
       I'm on the other end of the political spectrum than flytape but I still respected him as a mod. He seemed to be the only one trying to do something about the shill problem that's plaguing this sub.

       To me it seems like you're contradicting yourself - like it's ok to get rid of him simply bc of his political views.

      <p>
       There's an abundance of evidence for that. Namely, that he created that sub, essentially a duplicate of this one, which he himself states he will rule with an iron fist and ban all those who aren't right wing.

       Do you even realize that, at this point, you're not even arguing against me about Flytape. You're arguing against fucking flytapes own words 😂😂

        It also would inevitably lead us down a slippery slope moderating who is and is not a shill (while sometimes easy to spot, one false positive is too many in my view) and thats not something I would be a part of.

       In terms of that TMOR thread, I think amos just misinterpreted what SC was trying to say when he said "he got a 403 error trying to contact the topminds mods".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get a username mention on reddit, and it is from a sub in which you are banned, you can type a reply to the comment. However, when you go to hit the send button reddit will give you a site (403) error. This is reddit's (bad) way of telling you that you can't reply to the username mention because you are banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean this disrespectfully to Sarah (as I think he is on mobile so it makes it hard to type sometimes I imagine), but if you've been following along with some of his comments in modmail and in some threads, he can be quite hard to understand sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that is where the issue came from, as Amos was only worried that SC was colluding with TMOR mods as that is how Amos read the interaction.

       All I've seen is repeated attempts to slander her from not only Amos but a lot of these new mods. All coincidentally added in the last couple months.

       We need a fully sourced thread of all these claims. Like genuinely need man. This subreddit is my favourite and I'll be damned if I'm going to not continue to demand the full facts. We need it.

       It would be really decent of Amos to clarify and retract that accusation, then. It was obvious in the TMoR thread that the 403 error was caused by SC being banned. SC was pinged and went there to defend the sub and couldn't respond because of the ban. The mod in the thread admitted that he had just lifted the bans on the mods. It's really shitty that there is a rumor running around that SC was in collusion with TMoR and it should be corrected.

        I do not retract my demand for explanation

       First, some background: TMoR was literally created (as a spin-off of r/Conspiratard) to mock and attack this sub, and if possible, have it removed from Reddit. When it began, this sub was virtually their ONLY target. Only later did they start attacking T_D and others on a regular basis.

       No one knew of this ongoing enmity better than u/Sarah_Connor - who had been a mod here since 2009.

       I'm aware of what TMoR is and have more than my share of "exchange" with them- to the point of being banned in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also watched that TMoR thread in real time, and your theory that SC was colluding with them simply makes no sense. If there was some covert action and collusion going on, why discuss it in a thread that anyone can read?  And pointing to the 403 error as evidence is faulty- that is exactly what happens when you respond to a user mention in a sub that you are banned from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally was accused last night of being TMoR, which I reported, so you should be able to find it fairly easily. It's a terrible accusation without real proof, and I seriously hope this isn't the beginning of a new tactic to discredit users.

       Perhaps because he was unable to make contact via the "usual channels" (hence the 403 error complaints). He was clearly able to comment in the TMoR

       with no issues, wasn't he?

       If he could not respond because he was banned, how was he able to comment in that thread??? Note that

       did not request that Conspiracy mods be unbanned until after the conversation was well underway.

       The bans had been lifted the day the SC thing went down. I believe all of you were banned and that day all the bans were lifted (except for one of our mods, if I've followed it correctly)- I believe so they could get the scoop and exacerbate the drama. I do not know when all of you were banned in the first place, you can ask their mods I suppose.

       OK - A_Q, I am going to actually give you the benefit of the doubt on this comment...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think TMOR is abhorrent cunts. I have told the entire mod team MANY FUCKING TIMES that I have other shit outside of reddit that is way more important to my IRL than my reddit persona... and while I have a deep passion for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - I literally had minutes on a regular basis to try to absorb what was going on and respond - and it pissed me off to no end that diatrabes were written against me with no freaking context of what was going on with me, my time-balancing etc....
      </p>
      <p>
       So Yes, I got PISSED and thus my expletives - but:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was asked outside of reddit to remove mods (on multiple occasions) and I refused to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agreed, on multiple occassions to step down for Mr.D
      </p>
      <p>
       I agreed to AP taking, and I PMd him telling him to discuss with me over my IRL persona email. He failed to do so. I brought that to modlog.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 100% refute the authority of some ignorant admin "redtaboo" -- as (she) is DOUBTFULLY not one who has had her mind in the space of this /r/ for literally the 35 years that I have - nor been on fucking reddit for 11 years!
      </p>
      <p>
       The calling out TMOR IS characteristic!
      </p>
      <p>
       Pre-your-tenure, I called to ban ALL TMOR mods and participants with a bot... that idea was shot down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck anyone that thinks that I am a trump supporter -- but fuck anyone who thinks that I am an HRC supporter, fuc anyone that thinks that I was anti-semetic -- because Bernie Sanders was our only hope Obi Juan Ken-obi!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This is a fucking problem that is WAY THE FUCK OLDER than a couple of weeks here in this sub...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have written entire articles against the buh cabal, worked in tech for my entire career and written here about that and the spying - the issues of the NSA since the 70s, the cia's bullshit - etc, etc, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I supported the onboarding of every single mod on the fucking list! I was democratic, open and transparent with all of you..
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to herd you guys off reddit into slack - as the admins can read all our shit - that failed. even with threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am convinced that one or several of you are an admin's alt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont walk into the room acting like you can tie a brief period together with some stupid links when there is a LITERAL decade of daily viewing of this sub by me to see the trends and patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       and I was doing this shit since 1984 - my first woke moment was Iran Contra - then I have tracked and watched and learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am completely positive I messed AP perms by accident, OR (and imagine this; a conspiracy!!) it was done by someone else! (Or I was drunk and I dont recall... ) -- But I reached out to AP to gmail me, crickets. People were banning shit left and right and bitching in mod mail and my fucking posts about being NON FUCKING POLITICAL were a clusterfuck of bitching - so I took action.
      </p>
      <p>
       As top active mod it was my perm-right that allowed me to do so... then ppl bitched to the admins after you didnt listen to my AT LEAST FIVE FUCKING REQUESTS TO STOP BEING POLITICAL -- fuck I even made (I believe it was two) posts about this - and other mods swooped in and removed them saying "whoa whoa whoa -- wait we cant just post this" -- yet refusing to having an actual discourse in mod mail resulting in nothing
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever worked on a high functioning, yet technical team - and LEAD one? At the end of the day you have SMEs in their respective disciplines who will not fucking agree on shit, and you make a decision as the leader of that team and execute - but you give everyone the opportunity to tell you "what is wrong with this plan" first -- and if they dont speak up at the design sessions, dry runs, etc -- they they cant bitch after - no matter what... and ESPECIALLY if it was their domain-of-expertise that caused the failure, they are to blame for the failure if they didnt speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       so ---
      </p>
      <p>
       While Yu have some fair statements in your post - this is a far bigger issue than me telling you all to shut-the-fuck-up and restructure as you see fit...
      </p>
      <p>
       ITS THE SAME PATTERN AS BEFORE -- I propose solutions, get ignored so I take action and you all bitch to mommy
      </p>
      <p>
       And the admins are fucked for interveneing -- who the fuck are they? If they "know whats best for the community" -- then WHY ARE WE EVEN MODS????
      </p>
      <p>
       I never agreed with Flytape on his politics- but the guy made a great effort to communicate. and I never removed any mods even when he was really pissed off at some of you -- but I re-added him after a 45-minute call and he made a good case for doing something - and I kept reminding him tokeep his fucking politics out of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at the end of the day, you all belong as exampes of
       <a href="/r/iamverysmart">
        /r/iamverysmart
       </a>
       because you dont even have a decade of context on the complexities of this /r/ and some millennial little SEO-Community-manager who hasnt built shit in silicon valley is going to "evaluate" me...

       Of course it is. Those clowns attack this sub and the mods relentlessly.

       .  Why?

      <p>
       Your history shows FOUR comments in that sub, three were in that thread. Why respond on THIS occasion, and in such a defensive tone?

       That would be pointless. They use alts. They may be pernicious and sinister, but they're not stupid.

       The day you pulled all of our perms your ORDERED us into the Slack room you created - and then you didn't bother to show up. Add to that your admission that your intent was  to evade the admins, and it all sounds pretty creepy. How were we supposed to interpret that?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Action that left the sub totally unmoderated and open to attacks by saboteurs who could pose ANYTHING - Doxxing, child porn pics, ANYTHING... So you left admins with no choice but to intervene, and they could have done one of two things: KILL THE SUB, or override your actions.

       Thankfully, they did the latter.

       Yeah. Right. What does
       <strong>
        <em>
         STOP BEING POLITICAL

       </strong>
       even mean? This is a CONSPIRACY sub, and the vast majority of ALL conspiracies  - past or present - are politically related or have political implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to remove POLITICS from a CONSPIRACY sub? Okay, fine. Then we can no longer discuss American Revolution, the French Revolution, 9-11, JFK, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, the rise of Capitalism/ Bolshevism/ Communism/ Nazism/ Zionism...

       I'd say I definitely lean more right than most of reddit, but mainly just because I believe in the free market, small government and individual liberty. I'm not a Trump supporter by any means, but I also don't hate every little move he makes either or thing he says.

       I've tried hard to give you a chance, but my gut instinct will not let me trust you. I am really trying hard to see beyond my own biases and give you a fair chance, but something is not sitting right. I have seen you shut down speculation on ShareBlue influence with terse, dismissive comments on a number of occasions. You seem pretty sharp, so I'm concerned that you could be controlled opposition.

       I need more information. Can you please respond here with a complete timeline of your moderation history on Reddit?  Not just
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , but all subreddits you have created or otherwise moderated.
      </p>

       In fact, I think all of the moderators should be asked to supply this information in the name of transparency.

       I was unbanned to be allowed to respond as proposed by sabremesh in the above post.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why did I resign?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I resigned because of what I perceived to be an unwillingness of the majority of the mod team to agree on any effective strategy to combat the extreme politicisation of this sub subreddit by people who are otherwise uninterested in Conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people are accusing me of only wanting to silence left-wing politics but everything that I personally suggested to the mod team was designed specifically to effect all political factions equally.  My personal opinion on what to do that would restore Conspiracy to a conspiracy subreddit was to limit the number of current-politics posts any one user would be allowed to submit in a 24 hour period as well as limiting the account age of users who would be allowed to post politics at all (1 year old accounts or older for example).  I'm not 100% sure that these adjustments would have fixed anything at all but I designed the tactic to be tweakable and to effect both sides equally.  Obviously this idea was poo-pooed by other mods (I won't name names, rule10 amiright?)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why did I assist Sarah_connor with removing all the mods?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I did this as my last ditch effort to correct what I perceived as a moderation gridlock where mods were more concerned with high-brow idealisms (free flow of information) than they were with preservation of the Conspiracy sub for Conspiracy Theories.  Again this all goes back to people who outside of Trump, are totally uninterested in actual Conspiracy theories dominating the culture of a sub that is supposed to be about Conspiracy Theories.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why did I start
        <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">
         /r/ConspiracyRight
        </a>
        ?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I started it because my perception of Reddit as a whole has taught me that conservative based anything (including Conspiracy theories) seem to be shouted out of existence on Reddit.  My personal perspective on the problems within the original sub
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       is that the disruptive group, without regard to their opinion on Trump, is primarily left-wing political users.  I do not care about their opinion on Trump as I am well aware that current political personalities are always going to be a source of much controversy, my problem is with how these same users treat other Conspiracies that have nothing to do with Trump but align with left wing hot-button issues such as vaccines, climate change, religion, social policies that involve taxing us more to pay for etc etc.  I found a strong correlation with the sudden arrival of these left wing users and the sudden burial of these topics that were once popular to discuss here.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I was being confronted regularly by mods for banning users that clearly had no interest in having an honest conversation such as TMOR users because they happened to also be anti-trump.  This constant confrontation as well as constant rejection of any attempt by the mod team to lessen the influence of these users who are only interested in Trump's had gone on since shortly after Trump won the election in 2016.  This was not a sudden development in the mod team, nor was it a sudden decision by me to resign.  This was the end result of over half a year of infighting and stonewalling every proposed solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing my resignation, dronepuppet's alt trolling and Sarah_connor's extreme actions all resulted from the same series of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who are celebrating my departure I would like to congratulate you on an empty victory, I was the mod who proposed public mod logs, who managed the wiki, who proposed to steer rule 1 away from "hate speech" (sjw control mechanism).  I did more work here than you deserved of me and if you feel like the work I did was negative then you're probably exactly the kind of person who has no real interest in conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       So fair we'll to you all, I now run an iron-fist style subreddit
       <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">
        /r/ConspiracyRight
       </a>
       where you get to decide if you like it "as-is". And some other thoughtful users are running
       <a href="/r/Conspiracyundone">
        /r/Conspiracyundone
       </a>
       in their own unique way without my personal conservative restrictions if you find that distasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck to all of you!  Seek the truth, and remember that PERSONAL liberty can not be achieved through collectivism!

       FTR I have no intention of attacking you as your aforementioned track record certainly speaks for itself.

       I do think you have the best interest of the sub at heart, but pushing to demod the entire team was counter-productive and rash. Resigning was the right thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I see no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to continue participating with and contributing to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your frustrations regarding the current divisive atmosphere here are justified, but I'm hopeful that the true conspiricists will steer the sub away from this blatantly manufactured division.

       It was an attempt at forced restructuring.  There was no intent to sacrifice the sub.

       The intent was to clarify with each mod as they were invited back that they were here to moderate for Conspiracy theorists in a conspiracy sub.

       You're not good at this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you should explain to the community why you hang out with default mods in
       <a href="/r/dickgirls">
        /r/dickgirls
       </a>
       .  I'm sure it has nothing at all to do with your desire to be included in their power club.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that your fake idealistic persona "the free flow of information" is just something you like to say to appeal to people and you don't actually believe it. You're just looking for your ticket to the in crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can prove you don't actually believe it.  I have years of screen shots, links and examples of you not actually believing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Conspiracy sub, should be primarily for the community to talk about Conspiracy Theories.   If we have to disrupt the free flow of information to make that happen, I'm perfectly okay with that.

       Well, as I was saying above, I think the underlying implication of your view is that information contained in the media can not be a conspiracy, and therefore should be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it not the case that you ban just such topics in your conspiracy spin off you created?

       That is not my view at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       My view is that Conspiracy shouldn't be a place where people just competitively spam MSM articles without even bothering to explain why they feel it's relevant to some Conspiracy or to editorialize the title to make that obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys continue to have no standards in regards to that, the subreddit will continue to look like you have no standards.  That's not a good look man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it's just a coincidence that there is an active assault against alternative media going on by Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and even Reddit while suddenly we have very new accounts that literally spam MSM garbage articles as-is without even editorializing the title to fit /Conspiracy.

       Fyi, they removed their co-mods due to a vote that had been taken to remove the acting head mod. That kind of retaliation is against the reddit tos. -

       We didn't agree to that. Like 3 of you (another including DronePuppt) voted to do it to all of them you just did it to two anti-Trump posts. I followed the "vote" out come then had a follow up post about it, then took them all out because actually no we didn't all agree on that, then you put them back in anyway.

       We had a vote, the overwhelming majority voted in favor of trying out contest mode on ONE specific post.  axolP was the mod who initiated the vote.  You were against it and in retaliation for not getting your way, you went way beyond the experiment that we wanted to do and started applying contest mode to everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You did that intentionally to maximize the frustration of the community with contest mode and celinehagbard had to undo it all.  It's also important to note that you did this during a time when not many mods were online to stop you.

       Straight up the MSM narrative was already being pushed - and straight up there were people telling us shit like "get over Hillary, your guy won" and making fun of genuine threats to democracy with shit like "MUH EMAILS."

       right now as I type this: 12,770 people online.

       Top minds is fucking annoying but get some perspective. There is a shit ton of t_d posters with zero interest in having discourse who only come here to troll and push an agenda. In fact, your co-mod of the new sub DronePuppet is one of them.

They love to forum slide and try to bait people into personal attacks so they can report you for rule 10. Rule 10 was also clearly created to protect shills. It's a fucking travesty.

       What about my response was particularly elitist, would you care to quote it?

      <p>
       The question remains, if you get so riled up on folks calling your transparent backstory and motives into question, why not use one of your more substantiated and credible accounts when trying to make a comment that folks will take seriously (i.e. opening on the status of a community you frequent from a knowledgeable position)?  Perhaps the easiest explanation is that you only started hanging around here in 2016...wonder what the impetus was that brought you here

       Also been here since '07, but the context we were talking about was credibility of a user's comments and accounts in relation to the conspiracy subreddit, wasn't it?  Not sure why I'd care about the first time you discovered Reddit when I was calling into question your the timing of your presence on this specific subreddit. Digg exodus was actually in '10 my friend, r/conspiracy was '08...your dates don't make sense and further make me doubt you having a vested interest in the sub past pushing a certain perspective. It's odd that you're skeptical of my skepticism because, again, we're in a conspiracy subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No Reddit interactions don't make me feel special, they make me rather fatalist and sad for our youth's future. You go ahead and keep pushing your angle though, it probably works on some dumb dumbs around this very sub and we can all tell you guys are having a blast from the smug acknowledgement you all give each other.

       Dude I voted for Obama in 2008 and have always been a liberal libertarian. I am not responding to you the way you want because all you seem to care about is proving that I like Trump. I hate all politicians and JFK was killed by Deep State, Deep State/Bush/Israel did 911, we probably landed on the moon, The DNC rigged their primary, MKULTRA and Pizzagate are real.

       I'm not trying to prove anything, I'm deducing things and drawing conclusions from the evidence you've provided (i.e. your post history on your recently created account where it's strictly pro-Trump, anti-Hillary MAGA bullshit). You're trying to come across as credible, but why not switch to your r/conspiracy account then?  You're asking us to have faith in your words and claim of being a denizen here, coming from this account of yours that doesn't appear to have any real connection to this sub and seems in fact relates to the swarm of right-leaning folks who don't seem that interested in conspiracies for conspiracies' sake? Why do you even have multiple concurrent accounts, in any case?
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with how you've mixed up a bunch of dates, you came out of nowhere to chime in argumentatively when a fellow with similarly fishy credentials got called out, you seem as inarticulate as the average teenager or undereducated gas station worker who wants to MAGA (i.e. "aint", "your"), you're making that classic "While I voted for Obama and am a hardcore Liberal, but the last 8 years have been hell and Trump finally opened my eyes" nonsense that everybody see through. You guys have established this decent pattern over the last year, and it's not that hard to spot. You're just not very believable, my guy.

       What made you vote for Obama?  Were you even old enough to vote in '08?

       I'm 30, I voted for Obama because I was anti-war and supported Ron Paul originally and I wanted to believe he wasn't full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like originally supported Ron Paul and voted Obama in 2008 in 2016 I supported Bernie Sanders and voted for Trump.

       I do not support politicians, parties, or corruption. Should Trump disappoint like Obama did then I will never vote again. Viva la revolution.

       Well there's a nice credible response...you should've led with this one to avoid being lumped in with the unsavory fellows I described in the above post with whom you fraternize. If you are in fact one of those fellows after all, you may be onto a better approach for credibility with this exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your thoughts on the pointless MOAB against Assad, as well as the theory that he was tipped?  What are your thoughts on the Afghan surge?  Do you feel like you knowingly voted for "Fire and Fury" and are you happy with the cadre of Generals who seem to be running the show these days?  You're decently younger than me, but I wonder if you voted for Bush II or would have?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also liked Ron Paul over McCain, but also don't think Obama was particularly damaging (his biggest disappointment was falling well short, but it was expected and unsurprising given the mad he was dealt...certainly don't understand most of the animosity directed at him from his former voters beyond the low hanging fruit racism option). Speaking as a longtime NYC resident who is highly taxed on my finance-y salary, I don't object to his tenure and would probably be a bit left of center fiscally, well left of center socially.  New Yorkers saw this Trump fiasco from a mile away based on the regional tabloids (he was a laughing stock even before his first season of the Apprentice; Western bankers simply do not respect him professionally). It's baffling to me that anyone besides his dumb-dumb core in FL or KY, or the super edgy internet teenager cadre, can possibly continue devoting their personal internet time supporting him on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I don't understand how you can reconcile Trump or deflect so hard against uncovering his Russian issue...particularly in this sub, curiosity should override all but the most edgelord-ey or fervent blind support of him. I think that's why so many of us "shills" have been frustrated with this sub for the last and are happy that it's starting to kick out the bad-faith-participants: sheer curiosity into such an alleged big deal should override partisanship and tribalism, yet here we are today.

       I was not old enough to vote for Bush 2 but I considered myself a liberal then and always supported Democrats my entire life until Obama's 2nd term I voted Libertarian. I hate Bush 2 and all neoconservatives with a passion. Never would have thought I would vote Republican but Trump isn't a Republican, thats why the neoconservatives hate him.

      <p>
       The pointless MOAB on Assad seemed like political theater to me.
      </p>

       I'm not at all thrilled about the Afghan surge but I am willing to give it some time to see how it all plays out before passing heavy judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I voted for the lesser of 2 evils. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were controlled opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia stuff is about as intelligent as the birther nonsense when Obama was elected. It's all political theater to divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I support Trump at all online is because of all over the top opposition to him and Shareblue leading that opposition. I thought you were Shareblue at first but this comment has convinced me your a legitimate user. People online go out of their way to hate on Trump over non-issues to the point that its so obnoxious that I can't help but want to support Trump even more out of spite regardless of my thoughts on things like the Afghan surge.

       The Russia narrative is being pushed nonstop every where else on reddit/the internet... This is the place you go to once you realize that it's a bullshit narrative concocted by the losers of the last election to try and delegitimize Trump's presidency (as if he needed any help with doing that on his own...).

       The fact that you even call r/politics a "great subreddit" shows exactly what has happened to this sub. People like you have come in and ruined it, and are trying to blame it all on right wing users.

       Do you not see it as a conspiracy that the MSM refused to report on theviolent tactics of antifa until only a few days ago when there was ample evidence of their horrific tactics?
      </p>
      <p>
       do younot think it is a conspiracy that since Jan/Feb there was verifiable evidence that the Awan story had teeth and there was something ominous going on and no one reported on it but DC/George Webb and conspiracy even after a congressmen discussed it in public on the house floor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not find it odd how forcefully the media has attacked anyone looking into the very strange issues with the seth rich story?  They went crazier on that story than people who think 9-11 was all a lie.  They claim to be doing so out of compassion for the Rich family but 9-11 had 3,000 Rich families...where was the compassion for them?

       with teh force and vitriol that they did?  It was a more powerful resposne than 9-11 detractors AND the debunking articles didn't even address the biggest claims.  It was reported he was up and talking and likely to survive.  This is rarely addressed.  The DNC's Donna Brazil personally asked investigators why Wheeler was looking into the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do they know this was a robbery?  Nothing was stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a murder in an area of town that had essentialy zero homicides in recent time.  There were reported robberies but again, nothing was taken and none of those robberies resulted in anyone being shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is Seth Rich's laptop?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is just a botched robbery with barely any progress, why involve the FBI at all?  It's just a random shooting from a robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several people have come forward to say he provided 44,000 emails to wikileaks.  No evidence has been provided to the contrary.

       Some context in that case. The admins rely on and expect subreddit moderators to prevent/remove doxx. Subs that repeatedly fail to do this get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual mods who allow a doxx also get banned by the admins. In the last six months, two
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods have been banned by the admins for inadvertently approving a comment/post which contained a link to doxx. Both bans were overturned by the admins on appeal, because it was clear there was no malicious intent, but the lesson is that the admins rely on mods to prevent doxx, and a sub like this one would be regarded by the admins as a high risk without active moderators.

       Yes, the 13 mods who were demodded without warning by SC did contact the admins with a request that they adjudicate on the matter. SC was here for a long time, but his contribution was sketchy to say the least, and if you recall, he disappeared in 2016 for a year because, as he informed the sub "he was being investigated by the FBI". And when the account was reactivated at the end of last year, there was considerable doubt that the account was not being controlled by the original user. His erratic behaviour since then, and his attempts to remove all the active mods should be assessed with that in mind.

       That is literally what the admins told SC when he removed all of our permissions the first time. Whether that was their actual motivation or not is anyone's guess. But because of the PG doxxing we have had around here, and the admins position on that, I tend to take them at face value here.

       Alefantis is a public figure. Talking about him is not doxxing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't really clear on what constitutes actual doxxing, so we err on the side of caution. It sucks because I am definitely for pizzagate exposure. It isn't about Alefantis, it never was. That was just useful as a high profile example.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, I understand the concern. And everything always references back to the same voat materials that we have been specifically warned about. And I don't think we can be expected to follow every rabbit trail on the mega posts to make sure nothing inappropriate is revealed. It sucks. If PG posters want to do us a favor and decrease the chance of removal, don't link to the mega threads. Let what evidence you have stand on its own. There are ways to reference other things that don't include links. We are a creative bunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes this could easily be admin censorship, but it could just as easily be reasonable precaution, I personally think they want us to discuss it here if it is discussed anywhere, because it keeps it contained. But if there are no links to massive archives I will absolutely take the time to go verify and approve a PG post.

       Looks like the new moderators approach is to ban dissent, discussion and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had any balls they would have an open discussion with S_C and flytape OR post the mod chat logs for all to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys (moderators) are truly authentic or honourable you would allow that, or post the logs.

        Yeah there was a group of mods trying to vote off our top mod so we removed them all to sort out who we could work with or not.  And AATA convinced the admins to reverse the changes and remove our permissions so I retired.

       Well it sure looks like a good old fashion coup to me. So Fly tries to defend the sub but the other mods who have worked to gain the majority and are working with the admins of the site put him down. This whole thread seems like a really half-assed attempt to convince us that the mods who just preformed a hostile takeover are on our side.

       Its that ferfrendongle guy who got banned and now hes just evading it and spamming his nonsense.  The mods (at the time)were actively encouraging and even helping him send ip loggers to its users, all of which were people ferfrendongle had argued with in tbe past.

       Because real users should know not to insult people with crazy beliefs?  Anyone who comes here to mock others and not discuss the content is a troll and or a shill and should be banned.  This is conspiracy, a place for crazy ideas that just might be true, not default shit-sub of your choice.

       Real users should know better than to denigrate other users even if they disagree with their beliefs.

       Whats hilarious about this, is now that all the actual conspiracy theorists have moved to r/conspiracyright (which is modded the old moderators that were kicked out of here), this sub will be a clone of r/politics. I can't wait to see it.

       liberal echo chamber? If it were liberal, we'd still be able to self post. No it's a corporate echo chamber, which is very different. Basically you can only post corporate news sources.
       <br/>
       I'd be happy to move away from reddit since the admins are corporate whores now, but I still think the reinstated mod team is legit.

       if they were compromised behind the scenes and taking actions that were counter to free expression in the sub?  Absolutely.  They have significantly less tenure as mods in this sub, so I'd be curious to understand the rationale behind it.

       Soon they will bring out the wrong think mods, deleting threads etc. All the major default subs have been taken over. That's how they made reddit very profitable. Spezza tried to warn us last year when he edited the comments. Site is compromised.

       There is a modmail where DP admitted to using the alt accounts, but he never followed through when asked why he did so. He told us he would compile a "report" about his "expeirment', but never presented it. I can hunt down that modmail now, but its 2-3 weeks back so its going to take a few mins.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I voted against removing dronepuppet from the modteam originally (over the alt account situation), but I did support his removal after the "coup" behaviour and his failure to follow up with an explanation regarding the alt accounts after 2 weeks.

       Fair enough I just think it's beneficial for every bit of information possible to be released. If anything to restore confidence in the mod team. Like the world right now it's quite difficult to see through the bullshit. Cheers.

       Have been lurking /pol/ for maybe one and a half year and actively post on /g/ and /x/ (it's a good place for conspiracies too). The large number of upvotes conspiracy-dismissing-people and shareblue-like shills were getting from past many weeks had made it clear that a shareblue strike on the mod team is very near. I'm moving to 4chan permanently

       ShareBlue came to Reddit admins and made them an offer they can't refuse.  All the new mods are ShareBlue operatives and they have orders to neuter this sub.

       Don't waste your time fighting them.  Leave them to bot-upvote themselves with no audience.  Let them be insignificant.  We have to move conspiracy truth-finding somewhere else.

       it's confusing to me as to how a mod that has been here for 10 years would be causing a pro donald trump takeover.  It's also concerning considering what has happened to r/politics as a sub.   It's an echo chamber in content and commenting.

       You're entire argument centers around his long tenure as mod, that's your entire argument "but he's been here so long" and it's a piss poor one. You act like people can't change or have new ideas. Just because he's been here long doesn't mean he's above becoming a partisan hack or that it's even him behind the account still. That's not even to mention the fact that s_c by all accounts isn't at all active around here and that alone is enough for his removal.

       can I ask you something I've been curious about? Many months ago, in a large pgate thread that had heavily upvoted 'debunkers', you gave me my first rule 10 warning. I asked you about the shills and you said there were no ctr shills here, just people that disagreed. Do you still think that there are no ctr/shareblue shills?

       I've seen this before: a bunch of junior mods get rid of the long time mods with help of the admins.  This is a coup, however you justify it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion on how to resolve this:  reinstate SC as head mod, reinstate Flytape amd DronePuppet, then the rest of the team steps down.  Sarah Connor and Flytape then chose a new mod team.  If they want amy of you back after this, fine, but frankly I trust SC's and FT's opinions over the rest of you combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you banned Flytape so he couldn't tell his side speaks volumes.  And banning the oldest mod for rule 10 is absolute bullshit.  If Flytape thinks there are shills on the mod team them the community needs to hear his evidence.

       Come on man. Dronepuppet created alts like MAGAbolt to politically agenda spam and bait users into breaking rule 10, then ban them. Flytape must have had a problem with those who noticed and called out this behavior. Luckily for you. those two have created r/conspiracyright for all your idyllic needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out Flytape's explanations on r/drama and his newly created, conservative-only subreddit. His side has been told at length. Hint: he thinks liberals took over r/conspiracy (without evidence).

       I'm sure there is. Better yet, I don't want to know. That's not the point of this sub nor should it be relevant. Same with potentially leftist mods. No mod should be as blatantly partisan as those two were, down to acting upon this bias in manipulative ways. That's bullshit, and I wouldn't stand for it if it was an obvious leftist mod either. We should all be working together.

       I feel like the sub has been taken over by liberals.  I don't believe there is a songle right wing mod on the team, and I believe there are several left wing mods.

      <p>
       In any case, I've known Flytape for a number of years now, and I trust him.  Politically, I don't have a lot in common with him, but he's been modding this sub for years, and well.  If he believed that was what was necessary to save this sub from shills on the mod team, then I trust him over all these new mods.

       Trust must = zero suspicions of malfeasance, and still NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT of the actions perpetrated by Flytape and dronepuppet. Their political views are not relevant, nor what they may have done in the past to build trust. They did annoying and sabotagey things, and it looks like they ran to the relatively inactive S_C to plead a BS case and try to unilaterally rearrange the whole mod team (which has over 15 people involved). There's zero circumstance where that's acceptable. And they've had ample opportunities to convince me otherwise, I've read all of Flytape's comments on this. He's not saying much more than "the libruls took it over," without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about the sub has actually changed either way. I mean if it all comes down to "openly conservative mods are hunted minority so they can do whatever they want," that's absurd. And I really think that's the sentiment being expressed by their apologists right.

       What are you even on about?  For the 50th time today:  I trust SC and FT as the senior mods, and I am completely ok with them nuking the entire mod team if they felt it was necessary.  It has been pointed out to me that mr_dong might also have some seniority, so they maybe should have kept him, and there are 3 others I think are generally pretty fair.  As for the rest: good riddance.

       Except Flytape was the only mod who was explicitly using his political beliefs to inform his moderation and encourage beliefs and ideas he agreed with. And of course it didn't balance things out, it was a fucking disaster that all but ruined this sub, because that is what divide and conquer always does.

       To the greatest possible extent, we should be seeking to be apolitical. This sub is about seeking truth. Politics is about already knowing that you're right and figuring out how to show that to someone else. They are incompatible at a basic level. We don't fix any problems here by doubling down on and reinforcing the artificial and illusory right/left divide.

       How did I do that exactly? Them having an open political bias? I sure as hell didn't think they should be unmodded for supporting Trump. Overtly partisan posting out of a mod is rare, but that was never an issue I had with Flytape. Dronepuppet I barely recall.

       If you've been around long enough you can fucking clearly see the take over of 'muh Russia,' and even more recently people bringing up Trump rape allegations without as much as a shred of circumstantial evidence. If the admins assisted a bunch of junior mods in a coup of the sub I don't fucking trust it. This was a Shareblue takeover.

       Just present something based in evidence and not emotion and I'll consider that. There is no takeover of Russia stuff. If a post slips onto the front page every other day, is that a takeover? Makes no sense. The Trump rape thing was Louise Mensch idiocy and I think those users have been sent packing anyway, or are due to be.

       Hmmm. Maybe a bit off topic here, but
       <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/08/29/a-note-on-patribotics-louise-mensch/">
        Mensch has since strongly rebutted the Guardian beatdown

       and denied that she ever used said troll as a source or that there were any sealed indictments re: Trump Models.
      </p>

       Anyway, I digress. What I find more interesting is your claim that "those users have been sent packing, or are due to be". Care to elaborate a bit? (I'm going to make a separate post next if you prefer to input there.)

       <em>
        potential

       anti-Trump trolls-types who may be using these allegations to pull a reverse Pizzagate campaign. They could be genuine users, I have no idea anymore. I checked in on Mensch for awhile but have largely checked out since, she's basically the Cernovich/Prosobiec for liberals at this point, unconfirmed report after unconfirmed report that produce false glee and hope. Luckily there's a real investigation so we will learn some real facts eventually. Best to at least frame suspicions as theories in the interim.

       Will the rules be enforced evenly going forward? When some post in all caps when they get upset AND publicly delete the posts of others for Rule 6 violations it tends to make it look like some aren't subject to the rules.

       What about rule 10?  The phrase

       isn't interpreted the same for all users.  Criticism isn't an attack and the continued refusal to define what an attack is turns rule 10 into a weapon to be used instead of a rule to be followed.

       Criticism is accepted and encouraged, but calling a user you disagree with an idiot, a moron, a retard, a shill, etc. is not a criticism of idea; it's just an ad hominem attack. I usually let these slide if it's in the context of a larger argument, but will remove comments that do nothing other than call another user names.

       We try to look at the context of a comment to see whether the user was baited into responding with an attack, or responding to an attack themselves. And sometimes we get it wrong. If you feel we do get it wrong, feel free to send a message to modmail so other mods can weigh in.

       Really terrible. They're prepping for the upcoming elections, can't have one of the few major free speech subs being (once again) the massive thorn in their side like last year.

       I don't want to share Sarah's email address without permission, but yes he did PM me asking to contact him via email (this was the first time he, or any
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod for that matter, had ever requested this).
      </p>
      <p>
       When I logged in last friday, Sarah's PM to me was 4 hours old, and the entire mod team had already been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the first incident when
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       our perms were removed, Sarah was convinced (by the admins) to restore mine and I immediately restored the perms of the rest of the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the incident on Friday (the so-called Friday called massacre), the damage was done pretty quickly...I immediately replied to Sarah's PM telling him to respond to me via reddit (as I don't use an email address with this account) but he never did.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, the admins interceded and restored the mods, and we immediately set to trying to figure out wtf had just happened.

       Any confusion about this curious kerfluffle is weird to me. A unilateral move to nuke all other mods seems highly suspect at best. The mods who fought back all seem pretty solid to me.

       This is the lens through which it makes perfect sense:
      </p>
      <p>
       The perpetrators of the coup had an obvious agenda of pulling this place far to the right and(way more destructively) turning it into a safe space echo chamber for such beliefs. T_D users got used to their second dumping ground and are pissed that it is going to be less accommodating to them in the future, so they are doing what they have always done here: weakly grasp around for a flimsy conspiracy narrative that they can use to try and get what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how these users have always seen conspiracies, as a means of packaging their ideology and of getting what they want. Not as a way to uncover truth. To them it's a weapon, not a tool.

       This pretty much was how they pulled off the last election---they beat the drum for 9/11, JFK, the global peso ring, so we would think they were "one of us." Now that they're in, it's clear that was all just a marketing tactic.

       politicians and what they're doing are completely irrelevant when feeling the pulse of the general population. Left vs Right is very real. Politicians only exploit the divide of the general public. They couldn't exist in unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm forever opposed to almost all leftist ideals. And I'm also opposed with the majority of right ideals. But it is not the right who, in my eyes, are the biggest or even respectable concern right now. For that, I am labeled "right." And that's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when I'm asked to begin tolerating leftist bullshit, that's when I become immovable.

       The ideals I hold are simple. Any issue that arises  should be handled with as little government influence as is needed and it should always be based around keeping competition going in the economy if it relates to that. Free market ideals. Note that I said as little government as is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For social issues the government should not be influencing them at all. That is for the public to organically decide. The only thing the government should do is make sure that all people have the right to express their views without risk of physically retaliation.

       And you are going to ignore that the over arching data shows that both parties vote against the public interest and align exactly as I said. You listed a tiny tiny fraction of the votes that go through. Many of those votes are all for show for their base also because they know nothing is going to come of those issues.

       Many of these are just virtue signaling on part of the democrats, they vote for it with full knowledge it wont pass the house or be signed by the president, a bunch of votes where the senate votes for it but the Obama admin remained silent when it could've passed the house with their help. They've had moments where they could've pasted a bunch of these but instead have rolled over to Republicans when push comes to shove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bunch of these are just social justice issues, where they do want you to focus all your energy, which divides the country, so that the two big parties can have their bipartisan consensus, such as the MIC or Intelligence community expansion.

       Well you did a poor job of analysis. Read the ones that are incredibly lop-sided.

      <p>
       With regard to the "Campaign Finance Disclosure" Bill, it was written by Chuck Schumer, poster-child of corrupt Democrat Congressmen and granted new exemptions to 527s and 501c Super PACs, creating multiple avenues for laundering money into them. Calling it a campaign finance disclosure reform bill is like calling the Trail of Tears the "Minority Prosperity Land Grant and Diversity March for Freedom Act". Read the fine print.

       In US, what passes for politics really has nothing to do with left-vs-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is healthcare, for example, not a political issue anywhere else other than US? This is where American Exceptionalism really is a millstone around the American neck.
      </p>

       Environment used to be non-political in US – it was Nixon who established EPA. Now it’s been politicised. And so it goes.

       Gotta stop you here. Sweden and the UK both have healthcare as major issues nearly every election. Only issue is that we're moving towards US style healthcare. Both of us have privatized large parts of health services, while still funded by taxes though. So the issues are different, but it's still big issues. We're just sadly sliding in the wrong direction.

       Yes, something similar also goes on in Canada – a creeping retreat from the single payer system towards more commercialisation. Although there are also country-specific issues involved, since most Canadians with money can always go to the US for treatment, if they so desire. So this is not such a big issue politically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in this case, what we’re seeing is the perfidious US influence around the world. The Americans screwed up their own country in healthcare, and now they’re going around the world and spreading their own toxic juice (commercialisation) everywhere else. ;(
      </p>
      <p>
       Profit motive simply doesn’t work in healthcare. There are too many intangibles involved.

       The hippies are the establishment? Or do you mean minority groups? The left is nothing
       <em>

       </em>
       outsiders who keep fighting for a fair shake from the establishment, which has always been conservative. I don't see the threat you do, clearly, and I'm guessing you don't see the threat of our President being compromised by Russian counter-intelligence and acting like it.

       For a long time now the left's goals have been the exact same as the establishment.  Establishment wants more immigration, the left wants it.  Same with amnesty, hate speech laws, Obamacare, name a policy the establishment is pushing and the left wants it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is the core of the establishment.  If you want to defeat the establishment you must defeat the left.

       None of it has been fake news. What are you talking about. For example, we only
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       learned about the secret Trump Tower Moscow that was in the works, during the campaign, while he was denying having anything going on. I mean,
       <em>
        every day
       </em>
       we learn about more contacts and meetings between Trump's campaign and the Russian government, all of which they had been swearing up and down had never happened. They
       <em>
        act
       </em>
       like they're guilty.

Then how come you're absolutely loyal to the highest head of state who has surrounded himself with huge bankers and establishment politicians?

       Then how come almost the entire Republican establishment stands with him? What because John McCain says he gets disturbed by him to save face in a state with a lot of hispanics suddenly means the entire establishment is against him? I don't see any Republicans trying to take him down, if anything theyre protecting them. Paul Ryan, Gowdy, Nunes. I wonder what they're hiding. Or am I not suppose to care or believe it because they're helping Trump. Are you gunna tell me they're anti establishment too?

       I said a timer. Sorry I know how much it upset it makes you that you can't completely silence opposition. Also while you call me a shill I'm still waiting on you to tell me how 40k+ from Koch Industries and other corporations makes Trey Gowdy honest. Once I hear it I'll leave.

       a letter of intent during the campaign. Does he need to read it out loud on camera for it to count? It's clear you use "fake news" as a dismissal of anything you don't want to believe. That's not how fake vs real works.

       For one we have an active top mod who actually has opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For two some of us don't have fucking flytape or dronepuppet breathing down our necks anymore. Their pathetic trolling is easy to deal with but when they have mod powers they act like every other power mad right winger. Now there's only two that are ban hammer heavy and they aren't as powerful anymore. Conservatives are quite literally the biggest snowflakes of all time. It was all projection.

       The only thing that happened was two mods quit and another mod was voted top mod. It's better.

       This subreddit is horribly managed. Here's an idea; once a week you have two stickied threads, one for supporters of said conspiracy theory and one for non believers of said conspiracy theory. For example, this week is the moon landing, you have one thread of people discussing it being a hoax and another thread of people playing devils advocate or sharing their evidence for the moon landing. You do one per week on different conspiracies.   Done.

       S_C et al used the excuse of going on a shill hunt, something forbidden to users for good reason, to attempt to consolidate power. Shill shit-fighting murders productive discourse in its crib. When it is permitted, it gives everyone a one-size-fits all dismissal of every opinion you don't agree with and can only produce eco chambers or divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       S_C acted like a despot and was not following the rules that guide this community. DP was using alt to bait out bans, not communicating with the rest of the team but clearly coordinating with the coup faction. And Flytape was just an unrelenting nonstop disaster to this sub. The rest of the mod team was in unanimous agreement. And you seem to be trying hard to rabble rouse.

       Here's what really happened:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sarah_Connor, who is the most senior active mod and who is not right wing at all, saw that the new crop of mods were ShareBlue operatives assigned to destroy this sub by allowing shills to run havoc.
Sarah did the right thing by de-modding these Trojan horsemen. Sarah had every right to do so. It is written in the rules that senior mods have the power to de-mod junior mods. Sarah did not break any rules.
These ShareBlue mods then run crying to Reddit admins and the coup succeeds. Another subreddit killed from the inside by ShareBlue trojans.

       Good luck pushing this narrative. Things I see that are going to make it difficult:
      </p>
      <p>
       The dramatic improvement to this sub since the failed coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       DP using alts to bait users into bans
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape was a plague of cancers upon this sub. Birdmask webcast. Rolling out the red carpet for T_D when they are a proud eco chamber incubator and r/C is the literal opposite. Doing everything in his power to turn this place into a safe space for T_D and rendering the sub into a divided and conquered hellscape as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       S_C transparently acting like a despot against a community famously resentful of power and its abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah good luck w/that. Also your post constitutes a shill accusation against the whole mod team so you can best be sure that's getting reported.

       Piss off with the self righteous "You're getting reported" nonsense. The dude was giving his/her two cents on what happened. This sub, judging by the comments is split 70/30 on this sideshow from the mods. 70% believing this sub is dead due to recent events. Hell, maybe thats generous and 50/50 may be more accurate. Either way that means half this sub should be reported. The moment this sub became a left/right bitch fest is the moment it died in my humble opinion; your comment reflects that.

       Disagreeing with the situation and saying that the mods you disagree with are shills are two completely different things. I strongly disagree with how S_C, DP, and Flytape conducted themselves and think it did tremendous harm to this community, but I would be in a state of shocked disbelief if I discovered someone paid them to do it. People are fully capable of justifying great harm as righteous action, the shill label is poor intellectual's universal solvent for any idea they disagree with, it is verboten here for good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, after I posted that mod's said that rule 10 is being weakly enforced in this thread only and you've decided that it would be a good lever for you to focus on in order to absolutely ignore the main thrust of the post, so I'm going to edit it out.

       I don't believe I have ignored the point of your post at all, though you've certainly done the same to mine. And are doubly down on the idea of "have problems with how this was handled = the mods are shills"

       Yes we should be asking questions, it's good if you're suspicious and have unresolved questions. You should ask them. But there seems to be a default assumption here that of something is shady, it musta been shills. Where as shilling is the laziest and least falsifiable explanation for a given phenomena. It is where we should go last, after every other explanation has been exhausted. Not the default assumption that you try and work towards.

Also, I'm not gonna argue with you when you are writing novels in your responses to me that don't even touch on the things I am saying.

       Whoopsiedoodle, I did assume that you were the person I'd been talking with since the beginning in this chain. I don't often look at usernames, I'm focused on the content of the reply. That's my bad, apologies.

       However(barring this mistake) I have been directly addressing what you have been saying. What point have you made that you feel I've not addressed? Point it out and I would be happy to.

       Holy shit you're dense. My point initially was that this sub is dead. Reread my first comment if you want to know why. Your reply to that was painting my words falsely. If I did not respond, someone could misinterpret my point because of how you misdirected it. Intentionally or not, you fucking did; you probably had a bias responding to me since you thought I was OP.  Honestly, I dont give two fucks what your response to this is; you can tell me all you want that you champion this idea or that but deep down you have a bias and it is showing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, If I remember correctly, accusations of shills was not against the rules until recently. The whole idea of calling someone out is moot at this point because shilling has evolved to something more than just a paid commenter or a bot. Its the common person shilling the bullshit they are fed and engineered to believe as fact or truth. 4/5 years ago, this sub had maybe 70,000 subs if I remember correctly. Now its over 400,000. Read between the lines in what I am trying to tell you, or more specifically, make your own conclusion.

       You mentioned that the sub was dead, then moved on to a wider argument that since so many people think that, shouldn't they all be banned for shill accusations? I responded to this argument, which is an implicit acknowledgement to the position that you built it from. If you need me to explicitly respond to that, I will.

       You spend the last paragraph conflating shills with useful idiots. Two very different things, does no good at all to paint them with the same brush. I agree they are both important issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       No shill accusation rule has been around for a fairly long time. Regardless, its utility is clear. Without it divide and conquer wins completely, you just get two sides screaming "shill!" at each other. Or an echo chamber.

       OK I'm curious, did you look through my comment history or do you see me post on the sub a lot? Also, is there anything you disagree with what I post in the sub? Just because I think this sub is dead doesnt mean I still can't make comments. Maybe the optimistic side of me believes there are still people here that need to keep it alive.

       I do largely agree with your point on the evolution of shills. The term "useful idiot" is from the cold war, I believe. Describes an unwitting asset you has swallowed propaganda and is happy to repeat it for you. The pejorative connotation has not meant by me, I don't really believe in idiots. Just people who have be mislead.

       That is quite simple, the DEW hypothesis is not supported by the available evidence, if there was then surly she would submit it for peer review, she refuses to do so.

       Another slander tactic.

       You are of course forgetting the fact there are two that I know of, peer reviewed scientific papers that in one directly confirms there was nano thermite and the other confirms this to be true by proving that the rubble pile had energetic materials within it.

       Judy Wood has no such peer review of course.

       Sure they do, the toasted cars is obviously explained by the fact the buildings were packed with nano thermite (if you are talking about the cars blocks away, they were towed there) and the

       The cars were not towed there. That's something that gets said often, though there is absolutely no record of them being towed. There are, however, pictures of the lot being full of cars before and after being toasted.

       You claimed that it was well documented that the cars were towed to that lot after the towers came down. After I demonstrated this to not be the case you completely abandoned this argument to make a different one. That is the classic definition of shifting the goalposts.

       I hugely object to the idea of a conspiracy litmus test. The whole idea here is diversity of opinion, freedom of thought. No one is required to believe anything, nothing is proven. There is no conspiracy bible to be transgressed upon, you must make your case yourself and always be open to rational criticism of it.

       Uhhh no. Step back a bit. What the fuck are you guys doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       No shit Sarah Connor is going to freak out when you guys can just vote to take power like that without consulting the sub or anything. That's shady as fuck. And you use the admins to get your way when we already know the admins of this site aren't to be trusted and clearly work with shills and bot swarms and don't care about the communities within the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many suspicious actors on the mod team now to just leave this issue alone. Even just the fact that a power mod like AssuredlyAThrowaway is so heavily involved with this acting as an admin liaison of sorts and is still on the mod team is absurd. And reading some of the modmail it's hard to trust a few of the others as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to call anyone out as I don't specifically know those involved to be able to claim anything definitively about them but this whole situation is hard to just accept the way it is. I'm just saying it's hard to trust that what happened is all well and good the way this went down. People seem too eager to label this as a coup and that Sarah_Connor was just being selfish and vindictive. He has clear reasons for distrusting what was going on as well as a solid history of being impartial and wanting what is best for the sub. It's hard to trust that everyone involved has the right motives and it would be indistinguishable if they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I will repeat that I have serious distrust for AATA. Power mods should not be a part of a sub like this to begin with, and especially not one who seems to be involved with the admins to the degree that he is. I also remember 10 months ago like 2 days before he became the mod of the wikileaks sub he was trashing the sub in another sub and then suddenly he became a mod of wikileaks (????). That was one of the weirdest things to me, like why would someone scoffing at the sub suddenly be made a mod? And that was during the time that people felt the wikileaks sub was being taken over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt this way for a while but just accepted and ignored it because he seemed to not do anything bad and I had faith that the existing power structure would sound the alarms if that changed and he actually proved to have ulterior motives. Well now that can't really happen (and is apparently being prevented from happening). Maybe he does good work and isn't as shady as he seems but I think it is entirely reasonable to be skeptical and perhaps being so worthy of skepticism is enough that someone shouldn't be a mod of a conspiracy sub. But of course that isn't necessarily what is best, it's just something to consider and discuss.

       This, so much this. I really don't trust this mod team, and I find it suspicious they immediately want to make S_C sound horrible and call it a coup. Can I see any fucking screencaps? I really can't trust some B.S. that is merely words. You guys are acting a little behind-closed-doorsy for me. I hope for the best but I will assume this is compromised.

       That is something that really worries me. They are trying really hard to make it look like he was doing something wrong so that we accept the mod restructuring. If Sarah_Connor really wanted to pull some bullshit in this sub he would have done it a long time ago and not waited until the mod team was bickering and disagreeing on how the sub should be and wanting to get rid of him for having the authority to tell them to cut it out.

       S_C agreed to voluntarily give up the top mod spot months ago. The mod team wasn't bickering about some unrelated issue, they were voting unanimously to hold S_C to something they agreed to do a long time ago, and still said they intended to do but was dragging their feet about oddly. And after that vote S_C tried to purge them.

       I'm talking about before that. There has been a long running issue with the mods not getting along. Some of them have been acting like that for years even. In the past AssuredlyAThrowaway was even removed as a mod and was threatening flytape but somehow they got over that. There is a lot of "politics" behind the scenes with the mods how they interact with each other and jockey for position and for getting what they want.

       Fair point. I don't really know enough about it to be able to comment. I have a definite bias here; strongly against Flytape, who I see as a common cancerous influence on the sub throughout this.

       Not this sub, r/wikileaks. Like 2 days before you became a mod for that sub you were saying things to the effect of what a joke it is and that you don't go there (in a different sub, I forget which). Then you suddenly became a mod of it and I specifically asked you way back then why you would become a mod for a sub if you aren't a fan of it but you never replied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to attack you personally, you seem all right to me honestly and I don't have any concerns with your actual moderation (but of course if you were up to no good you wouldn't do any obvious destructive moderating, you would work behind the scenes which it sort of appears you do). It's just I am skeptical and I think that is natural given the situation. If you are just a dude then no hard feelings.

       No, not wikileaks itself. The wikileaks sub. If I wasn't lazy and if it really mattered I'd go back and find your comment to clear this up. And I mean, my wording is probably a bit unfair since I'm just going off of memory. But the core of it was you were clearly an outsider to the sub and had no interest in it and then immediately following that comment you were made a mod during the time the sub was having strange changes made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feel like you have to defend yourself. It's not worth getting into a discussion about it. I'm just saying that I think there is enough info and peculiar happenings surrounding you to say that it is valid to be suspicious of you as a mod of this sub. I think anyone can agree that this is a matter of fact. However, even if we accept that is true it doesn't mean you aren't a good mod or that it necessarily indicates you should not be a mod or that you have ulterior motives and I am certainly not one to decide that anyway. With that in mind I don't feel it is worth getting into too much detail about, at least not right now or like this.

       They didn't purge the mods though. Flytape left on his own accord. S_C's own plan was to voluntarily give up the top mod spot and stay on the team, and was only removed because they refused to do what they agreed to or communicate. And DP was removed because they were openly using alts and again refusing to communicate with the rest of the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that with these mods gone this sub will become a mirror of politics. By it was Flytape that was fanning the flames of the political shit-fight that's been ruining this sub. We should not be falling for divide and conquer.

       You can choose between diversity of opinion and an echo chamber. More than anything else, this sub has always championed freedom of thought and diversity of opinion. This necessarily entails reading things you won't agree with sometimes. The adult reaction is to rationally argue your points and refute what is demonstrably incorrect. Whining for imagined halcyon days in which you didn't have to confront the Red scourge is worse than useless.

       This isn't and has never been a politically right sub. During the election the right realized that it could try to leverage conspiracies in order to package their ideology set out to try and brand the sub in that image, so I could see how you could come to that mistaken believe.

       Maybe its a good idea for mods to not be so blatantly biased in the first place? I understand they will have their views, but when the are so blatant some people will make accusations of unfairness no matter if the mod does their job fairly or not.  That is to say I don't think being biased will effect their ability to enforce rules, but it will open them up to criticism.

       Balance is an illusion, it buys into and supports the idea that there is a right/left split. Trying to achieve balance by pouring in more of the ideology that you feel is missing only gets more people screaming past each other. It is a sure-fire method to divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way forward is not by seeking balance, which only implicitly supports the artificial dichotomy. Diversity of opinion is important, however what is paramount is that we treat others with respect, stick to the issues, and seek common ground.

       Sure, but this sub reddit has been infiltrated and compromised by the left. Just look at the comments. Disinformation and rejection of even simple ideas everywhere. Then once you put your opinion out there, they argue non-nonsensical off topic issues. It is not a lack of their understand but a more control diversionary tactic. It is like a Divide and Conquer technique. They give no middle ground on sensitive and controversial issues. 
You say that is it an illusion but people are the fallible cog in the machine here, you'll get some that can be fair and look over the other side of the fence but the reality is that it doesn't work that way.

       I am sure that it has, Shareblue is a real thing and the internet is increasingly a balkanized battleground of ideas. (I think the same thing is happening on the right, and that it is a complete waste of effort to try and figure out which side has it worse.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you cannot fight that by ratcheting up the intensity and frequency of the rate at which your side dumps out rhetoric, whichever side that may be. It is the literal equivalent of trying to fight fire with fire, it makes the problem much worse and then the other side escalates in response. By trying to achieve balance you directly make the other side stronger and drastically increase the effectiveness of divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that scans as a shill or brigade accusation feeds this dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only solution that I can see is to treat every user as a real person, only critically engage with the actual arguments they are putting forward, stay civil and call out all logical fallacies you can identify.

       A false dichotomy is a logical fallacy that erroneously reduces a situation down to two alternative. I am saying that the right/left divide is mostly false and stoked to keep us easier to control. That is not a false dichotomy.

       A bunch of closed-minded Michael Shermer disciples who believe just about everything CIA/MSM says at face value then gets their jollies coming here to demand 100% irrefutable court-admissible evidence for every claim/theory mentioned.

       They even still life about not having server space so people posting and responding to comments can't keep the context of their posting from being hi jacked due to Reddits limitation of posting frequency.

       I gotta say you don't make a very good case for you being "the good guys" when the admins are repeatedly stepping in to back you up in a sub that was a huge center of opposition to their favorite Presidential candidate.

       No one pay attention to the Democrats ignoring their own rigged primary to go and protest a candidate that is running in the other party.  Let's all pretend like Democrats calling people racists is anything other than a distraction from the fact they have NO actual policies to speak of.

       Reality is that antifa is considered a domestic terrorist group and Trump's statements about violence on the left was perfectly accurate.

        kinda true, but is always fun that you won't mention why was horrible, because whatever the Clinton's shortcomings, Trump has 100 times worst. Lies? Corruption? Proovably 100 times more.

         Interrupting? You mean by counter-protesting ? Disagreeing? Guess what, is all free speech aswell even if it bothers you. Snowflake.

         Bravo! Talk about bikelocks and not violence in general, or your attempt at painting anti-fascism as the violent ideology would not work so well.

         Accept to have lost in a system heavily skewed to favour the GOP over the popular vote. Sanders was treated unfairly, but at least didn't lose getting more votes. Would you accept a system skewed the other way, to make democratic candidates win despite getting less votes nation-wide? 
Yeah, I didn't think so, but you'll support until It suites you: no principles whatsoever.

       Hate sub? I guess operation overlord was a hate rally then.

      <p>
       How does the piece on antifa contradict anything I said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic right wing circlejerk mentality: every major issue, environment, corruption, public health international crisis... ignored, pretending antifa are the real danger.

       Is this all you have to say? "But antifa are bad too!"?  Disappointed.

       , I'll save you some time.
The Daily-fucking-caller had to admit it, although their bias shows in how they desperately try to change the subject to propriety damage, and debate how the killings were motivated. They can't spin the numbers much tho:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The data from our analysis comes from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a university research center partially funded by the Department of Homeland Security.
Our findings support the ADL statistic. Using their definition of right-wing extremists, we found that 92 percent of ideologically motivated homicide incidents were committed with a right-wing extremist or white supremacist motive.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a somewhat similar analysis of domestic extremism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and found that 73 percent of all domestic extremist incidents that resulted in death were perpetrated by so-called right-wing extremists.

       We'll see what happens to this sub going foward I guess.  If it starts "leaning left" (or all the way), we'll know this was a coup\admin take over from the shareblue\Soros leftists to push their shit fuck agenda. ***NOTE: this doesnt mean, I am pro trump, right, kodos (or a fucking nazi), but fuck these globalist\alt-left cock suckers and their fucked up agenda.

       Its that ferfrendongle guy who got banned and now hes just evading it and spamming his nonsense.  The mods (at the time)were actively encouraging and even helping him send ip loggers to its users, all of which were people ferfrendongle had argued with in tbe past.

       Because real users should know not to insult people with crazy beliefs?  Anyone who comes here to mock others and not discuss the content is a troll and or a shill and should be banned.  This is conspiracy, a place for crazy ideas that just might be true, not default shit-sub of your choice.

       Real users should know better than to denigrate other users even if they disagree with their beliefs.

       No worries. We're always going to catch hell no matter what we do. Some here are reasonable and others are just making up some bitter attacks based on nothing so far as I can tell. Some just see a chance to troll and spread disinformation because it must be fun for them. That's just how it goes sometimes.

       liberal echo chamber? If it were liberal, we'd still be able to self post. No it's a corporate echo chamber, which is very different. Basically you can only post corporate news sources.
       <br/>
       I'd be happy to move away from reddit since the admins are corporate whores now, but I still think the reinstated mod team is legit.
       <br/>
       Do you really think it was right of S_C to delete the entire long standing mod team without warning?

       A few have appealed and been unbanned yeah.  It's impossible to keep track of them all though so without an appeal they probably are still currently banned.  We usually give second chances though unless the user was an obvious troll.

       Nah you misunderstood what I said. They attempted to overthrow and moderation of this sub and now they have r/ConspiracyRight, where they openly ban descent. One of the mods involved had several alt-troll accounts that pushed a certain narrative, another made a "joke" sticky post here welcoming T_D users when T_D temporarily shut down. Do the math...

       I didn't say this sub
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       t_d light. I welcome criticism from and of all sides-- they had an objective in what they were doing, and it seems they were trying to turn it into something that would lean more to one side of the political spectrum.

       So you side with his (evidence-free) conclusion, but don't acknowledge anything about the actions of dronepuppet and Flytape which have

       I'm sure there is. Better yet, I don't want to know. That's not the point of this sub nor should it be relevant. Same with potentially leftist mods. No mod should be as blatantly partisan as those two were, down to acting upon this bias in manipulative ways. That's bullshit, and I wouldn't stand for it if it was an obvious leftist mod either. We should all be working together.

       This is the lens through which it makes perfect sense:
      </p>
      <p>
       The perpetrators of the coup had an obvious agenda of pulling this place far to the right and(way more destructively) turning it into a safe space echo chamber for such beliefs. T_D users got used to their second dumping ground and are pissed that it is going to be less accommodating to them in the future, so they are doing what they have always done here: weakly grasp around for a flimsy conspiracy narrative that they can use to try and get what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how these users have always seen conspiracies, as a means of packaging their ideology and of getting what they want. Not as a way to uncover truth. To them it's a weapon, not a tool.

       Yeah on second thought I think I see what you were talking about.  Kind of a weird consideration I haven't thought of before, but if I am, for example, having a 12th birthday party, and my mother gets me a birthday card, I can look at that card and be sure I'm 12. But if I then take the card and throw it in the trash, how would I know how old I am. Am I now 0 years old again?  Am I now a newborn?

       Those are absolutely not my words. You just quoted the person you initially responded to, not me. Also, I'm not gonna argue with you when you are writing novels in your responses to me that don't even touch on the things I am saying. So I guess you answered your own question and what you think I am doing to you.

       Which was, once again, not communicated to the community in an open fashion.  Making a thread, explicitly saying what is allowed in a stickied post would be helpful, as it is too many people aren't willing to talk because they will lose access to this sub.

       The elite are communists. If you look at how communism went in practice it really makes sense. North Korea is their model society. There is a leader with ultimate power and everyone else is basically slaves to the leader and the inner circle. The people are fully brainwashed, destitute, and starving to death which exactly what they want for us with Agenda 21 and population reduction. The elite are trying to expand the North Korea model on a global scale.

       Steven Jones exposed himself as a disinfo agent back during the Cold Fusion debacle decades ago (watch the doc Heavy Watergate).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But most important of all, AE911Truth do not support her
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's because AE911truth is likely controlled opposition (like Jones) who are distracting us with "thermite" red herrings and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       AE911truth has
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       good explanation for the toasted cars, the minimal seismic record of the 3 collapses, and the sheer loss of
       <em>
        matter
       </em>
       experienced that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to change my perspective if I see valid explanations for these problems (and more), but until then I refuse to accept that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       possibilities for their collapse aren't on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people tell me what
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to talk about and when things are "debunked" and should be left alone,
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       when I start paying attention, and your appeal to authority regarding AE911truth is all I need to hear.

       I voted to have you removed after 6 months of you and username 13 obstructing every effort by any mod to fix the obvious trolls and brigaders ruining the conversation in the sub.  You claim they don't exist but everyone sees it for themselves.

       It was your fault from day 1.  You're just another psychotic liberal freaking out that Bernie didn't win.  You're all pretty much the same, your party cheated Bernie not the Republicans, but now you want to act like the Republicans are literally fascists Hitler's when the reality is thus

       You're the one who started this shit behind the scenes in modmail by singling out Trump supporters as "all morons, not Worthy of participation here" yet it's liberals from /politics who can't have a civil debate about climate change or vaccines without dog piling and abusing Conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of you belong here, all you can do it take over other people's shit and then start turning the screws to make it shitty like most of Reddit already is (Because it's run by liberals like you).

      <p>
       I quit modding because we failed to reset Conspiracy to it's roots.  You won creq, you successfully Fucked over another sub.  Congratulations but you won't pretend like I started this shit.

       Conspiracy will now go down hill like every other shitty sub on Reddit run by liberals.  You're the fucking problem.
