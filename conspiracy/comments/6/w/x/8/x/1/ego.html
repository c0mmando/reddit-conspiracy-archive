<p>IMO, the greatest conspiracy is that there is a you &amp; me. Them &amp; us. These concepts &amp; their many variations (race, sexuality, faith, etc) are simply shackles placed on this vessel that can either easily be broken or easily tightened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading the power of now by eckhart tolle I am becoming more and more shocked daily as I catch my own ego, and others, slipping out. It&#39;s so common.. And wide spread, and a huge source of our problems. Eckhart Tolle calls it the unconscious which is spot on.</p>

<p>Our brain likes to think it&#39;s in charge, but we really are a holy trinity of mind body spirit and when all three are in balance and in harmony you get wonderful things as a collective and as an individual. </p>

<p>Seriously, if you guys haven&#39;t read/heard this book, download audible, and use your free book to listen to the power of now. We will only survive as a species if we get our ego in check.. Without that, we will destroy ourselves </p>

It&#39;s materialism, designed to create self doubt, and catch phrase temporary satisfaction. Ownership illusions.<br/>
What a charlatan. It amazes me how people buy into it.<br/>
Studying various schools of hypnosis, mind control, NLP, and propaganda techniques would be much more valuable. Tolle is hypnosis for those who have no knowledge about hypnosis techniques.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Shitty meditation teachers are assholes and you pay money to an asshole to teach you garbage dogma based on the need for the author to get money.<br/>
Experts do not respect pedestrian blow hards spouting garbage.<br/>
Judge me again, negative manifester. You are manifesting what you deserve right now. If you are about to step into a pit of vipers, and I steer you onto a better path, whyich means all paths not filled with vipers, then, yes, I am being negative towards scumbag Tolle, the scammer. Shall I name 200 new age scaqmmer authors who have written complete garbage, who ended up with suck up fan boys like you, defending them, and calling everyone not on your zombie team a Nazi Racist KKK hater spewing negativity all over your chosen father cult leader?<br/>
Fuck Tolle, the charlatan. Boiled down bullshit to soak the washable minds of the weak and dull.<br/>
Now you get triggered about negativity again, and shove some earbuds in to have Tolle soothe you into sheep counting temporary bliss, again.<br/>
Then the real world hits, and you long for the Tolle zone, where all must be perfect and comforting, or it won&#39;t work. The powers self destruct whenever anyone has a &#39;&#39;negative&#39;&#39; thought, so run to the safe space. Shhh the baby&#39;s sleeping. Wimpopalooza 2017.<br/>
There are many better teachers. That&#39;s why Tolle is popular. People are mostly stupid as fuck.</p>

<p>For the fourth time, have you even read the power of now? I&#39;m beginning to think you haven&#39;t. In fact I&#39;m almost 99% certain you have not read the book and is why you are so judgemental about it.</p>

<p>If you have any other books that would be a great read I&#39;d appreciate it cause it helps work go by much quicker.</p>

How would I know what this moron does if I have no knowledge of his spiritual ownership fetish?<br/>
Yes I am quite familiar with hypnosis scams, religious cults, spiritual materialism, kinesthetic programming and much more than you, religious cult fanboy, stuck in a Tolle rut.<br/>
It amazes me all the time how people get caught up in such pedestrian, childish dribble from the lips of scammers. Millions a year fall for bullshit teachings. All of them act superior to the rest of us, like you, Mr Tolle super fan.<br/>
&#39;&#39;You must not have read anything ever, or you&#39;d be just like me&#39;&#39; is the only retort people like you have,while under deep trance to your leader.<br/>

Beginner meditation shit for people who are wet as fuck behind the ears.<br/>
Coddling studies for the easily dented heads of namby pamby dabblers.<br/>
Then your feelings dive, and you desperately try to &#39;&#39;hold the moment&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;capture the present&#39;&#39; or any number of physical materialist speech, regarding things and words, that you get to keep as personal possesions, in the mine mine mine philosophy of me mine and me. Plus cool connections to positive people, as you manifest what you decide to be connected to or not.<br/>
What a load of crap.<br/>
Read a real book on meditation, philosophy, spirituality or something.<br/>
Yay for you, you passed the beginner newby phase of ignorance and &#39;&#39;easily led.&#39;&#39; Time to move on to adult authors. </p>
