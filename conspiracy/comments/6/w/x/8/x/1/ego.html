       Haven't been here long but I feel as if I can't go on this site without seeing a title or comment labeling another person, segregating not only yourself from this individual but all sentient life. If you consider yourself an entity of "good" &amp; a true conspiracy theorist, you'd see you've erred.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, the greatest conspiracy is that there is a you &amp; me. Them &amp; us. These concepts &amp; their many variations (race, sexuality, faith, etc) are simply shackles placed on this vessel that can either easily be broken or easily tightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you must have hate or even dislike, direct it towards TPTB that have constructed a world of fallacies &amp; perverted truths that allow, if not force, the systematic indoctrination of ideologies that not only degrade the internal but external. Do not play the game.

       After reading the power of now by eckhart tolle I am becoming more and more shocked daily as I catch my own ego, and others, slipping out. It's so common.. And wide spread, and a huge source of our problems. Eckhart Tolle calls it the unconscious which is spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our brain likes to think it's in charge, but we really are a holy trinity of mind body spirit and when all three are in balance and in harmony you get wonderful things as a collective and as an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, if you guys haven't read/heard this book, download audible, and use your free book to listen to the power of now. We will only survive as a species if we get our ego in check.. Without that, we will destroy ourselves

       His obsession with personal ownership has nothing to do with spirituality.
       <br/>
       It's materialism, designed to create self doubt, and catch phrase temporary satisfaction. Ownership illusions.
       <br/>
       What a charlatan. It amazes me how people buy into it.
       <br/>
       Studying various schools of hypnosis, mind control, NLP, and propaganda techniques would be much more valuable. Tolle is hypnosis for those who have no knowledge about hypnosis techniques.

       You seem inflated by ego retention, and judge those who judge, as if you are the true judge. Looks like you wasted your time bothering with that garbage literature.

       I'm not perfect but I'm also not going to tell others how to interpret things and how to act. Plus your comment is just negative in general and not too conducive to an actual discussion on Tolle. I like his work and I enjoyed the book but I don't invest as much into it as you seem to think I have. Anyways, I appreciate the links

       So you read that shit, recommend it, and also try to pose as an authority on people? You aren't even aware enough to see all the ownership propaganda on every single page of his complete garbage ''literature'' cough cough.
       <br/>
       But you are a great judge of people below you, who must not have read the spiked Koolaide correctly, or they'd be smart enough to be a follower fanboy seeking ownership dogma, like you.

       Again, more negativity, baseless judgement, and random toxicity. Why is this angering you so much? Why are you against learning and expanding your consciousness?

       Shitty meditation teachers are assholes and you pay money to an asshole to teach you garbage dogma based on the need for the author to get money.
       <br/>
       Experts do not respect pedestrian blow hards spouting garbage.
       <br/>
       Judge me again, negative manifester. You are manifesting what you deserve right now. If you are about to step into a pit of vipers, and I steer you onto a better path, whyich means all paths not filled with vipers, then, yes, I am being negative towards scumbag Tolle, the scammer. Shall I name 200 new age scaqmmer authors who have written complete garbage, who ended up with suck up fan boys like you, defending them, and calling everyone not on your zombie team a Nazi Racist KKK hater spewing negativity all over your chosen father cult leader?
       <br/>
       Fuck Tolle, the charlatan. Boiled down bullshit to soak the washable minds of the weak and dull.
       <br/>
       Now you get triggered about negativity again, and shove some earbuds in to have Tolle soothe you into sheep counting temporary bliss, again.
       <br/>
       Then the real world hits, and you long for the Tolle zone, where all must be perfect and comforting, or it won't work. The powers self destruct whenever anyone has a ''negative'' thought, so run to the safe space. Shhh the baby's sleeping. Wimpopalooza 2017.
       <br/>
       There are many better teachers. That's why Tolle is popular. People are mostly stupid as fuck.

       Then recommend some alternative texts and books to read because all you've really managed to do is put yourself into a bad mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the fourth time, have you even read the power of now? I'm beginning to think you haven't. In fact I'm almost 99% certain you have not read the book and is why you are so judgemental about it.

       If you have any other books that would be a great read I'd appreciate it cause it helps work go by much quicker.

       You seem very very ignorant.
       <br/>
       How would I know what this moron does if I have no knowledge of his spiritual ownership fetish?
       <br/>
       Yes I am quite familiar with hypnosis scams, religious cults, spiritual materialism, kinesthetic programming and much more than you, religious cult fanboy, stuck in a Tolle rut.
       <br/>
       It amazes me all the time how people get caught up in such pedestrian, childish dribble from the lips of scammers. Millions a year fall for bullshit teachings. All of them act superior to the rest of us, like you, Mr Tolle super fan.
       <br/>
       ''You must not have read anything ever, or you'd be just like me'' is the only retort people like you have,while under deep trance to your leader.
       <br/>
       You use religious cult language. You will kick and scream to deny it.

       Calling me toxic is positive?
       <br/>
       I'm not angry.
       <br/>
       I'm all for learning, that's why Tolle should be trashed mightily.
       <br/>
       I do not own  concsiousness. It is already infinite and does not expand. LOL
       <br/>
       Have you read ''The idiot's guide to following dipshits?''
       <br/>
       You should read all kinds of stupid shit so you can challenge everyone who isn't in your cult.
       <br/>
       Have you read all the scientology coursework? No? Oh, well, I guess you are not allowed to say anything about them, or any other religion, until you have read and studied all of their nonsense garbage.
       <br/>
       Only those who have eaten lots of dog shit are allowed to call it disgusting shit.
       <br/>
       You like spiritual stuff? Thast's nice. Get fucki8ng better at it bro, and stop reading materialist filth.

       Hehe your comments crack me up thanks. Also, thanks for proving to me you can't even bother to research what you judge. You haven't even read the book yet feel you can assume what it's written about.
      </p>

       I know it's all downhill from here so I wish you the best man! Love ya! :)

       You proved nothing except your toddler sensitivity to anyone trashing your shitty heroes.
       <br/>
       I guess I just made up the ownership dogma idea on the fly and have no idea who this asshole Tolle is.
       <br/>
       Now you get to retreat to the ''positive'' safe space, where you fear the ''negative'' because ''your soul'' and ''your ego'' must be protected in the name of special connections. ''You are connected'' LOLOL
       <br/>
       Beginner meditation shit for people who are wet as fuck behind the ears.
       <br/>
       Coddling studies for the easily dented heads of namby pamby dabblers.
       <br/>
       Then your feelings dive, and you desperately try to ''hold the moment'' or ''capture the present'' or any number of physical materialist speech, regarding things and words, that you get to keep as personal possesions, in the mine mine mine philosophy of me mine and me. Plus cool connections to positive people, as you manifest what you decide to be connected to or not.
       <br/>
       What a load of crap.
       <br/>
       Read a real book on meditation, philosophy, spirituality or something.
       <br/>
       Yay for you, you passed the beginner newby phase of ignorance and ''easily led.'' Time to move on to adult authors.

       It's fine, there aren't really any you or mes around. Apparently bots can now mimic organic comments and they probably don't have a sex or religious faith so there's even less dividing us

       I'm not even sure what important truth there is than this. We have a collective unconscious that is always available for introspection, if you need proof.
