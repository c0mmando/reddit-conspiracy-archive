<hr/>

<p>I have everything to lose and nothing to gain personally from sharing this. I am not anti Vax as the media always portrays me out to be.
What I am is deeply concerned as to where we currently find ourselves in society. I am concerned on three fronts:</p>

<ol>
<li>The health of all children (and many adults) is at an all time low. Auto immune disease, cancer, hormone-related diseases including Thyroid, breast, ovarian, testicular cancer, infertility are increasing as is depression even in our young. I am concerned for our children, grand children, our nieces and nephews, their children, and our friends children and grand children.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am concerned for ALL CHILDREN as every child is OUR responsibility AS A WHOLE AS WE ARE COLLECTIVELY CREATING THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN WILL BE LIVING IN. We are collectively creating the level of wellness that our children will ultimately experience in their lives. The burden that responsibility places on our shoulders is great, there is, in fact, no greater responsibility.</p>

<p>AS SUCH, THE CHOICES WE PERSONALLY MAKE OR ALLOW OUR GOV&#39;T OFFICIALS TO MAKE ON OUR BEHALF SHOULD NEVER BE SWAYED BY ANY PERSONAL VESTED INTEREST OR ANY PERSONAL MONETARY GAIN.</p>

<p>PEOPLE IN POWER; OUR GOVT&#39;S, DRS, POLITICIANS, IN FACT, WE AS INDIVIDUALS - EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US, OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR FUTURE TO ACTIVELY QUESTION AND BE OPEN TO QUESTIONING SCIENCE even if there is only the slightest chance that science could possibly be wrong...AND ESPECIALLY IF THE SCIENCE THE DECISIONS ARE BEING BASED ON is supplied by the very companies who stand to profit.
2. When did we lose the right to question? To think for ourselves, to ask?</p>

<p>As as society we are so quick to judge, to ridicule, to knock down anyone who dares to step outside the parameters of what we&#39;ve been told to be true and we do it with such close mindedness, such malice, in many instances with such hatred and why? Have we ever taken the time to actually research ourselves? Have we ever taken the time to sit with parents who have lost a child? who have a child on the spectrum? - whose child was developing and then changed and became autistic without a question in their mind after their child had been given their vaccination? Have we ever sought to look into the cases that relate to the $3.5 Billion payouts to vaccine damaged children?</p>

<p>Have we ever read fully the possible side effects of some, and I repeat, some of the vaccinations. Have we become so closed-minded that we don&#39;t listen to people&#39;s actual stories of loss just because we are not, or have not been personally impacted? Is that who we really are? Is that who we&#39;ve become as a society? Is that who we want our children to model in the future?</p>

<p>We believe without questioning the media propaganda machine that sets out to discredit and diminish anyone or anything who dares to question what has been delivered to us as the &quot;norm&quot;, but whose &quot;norm&quot; is it and when did we actually lose the right to reason? Have you seen Vaxxed? If not, have you asked yourself why? I&#39;m sure you see yourself as a clear, level-headed, smart, compassionate human being who can&#39;t be swayed by a movie one way or another? Perhaps the USA and Australian Govt&#39;s aren&#39;t giving you that much credit? Surely you would be able to reason for yourself and decide whether or not it is a batch of crock?</p>

<ol>
<li>We are shown studies that support the vaccination schedule yet we aren&#39;t as a society shown the other side. Is it time to ask why? We are bullied into submission and don&#39;t have a voice as anyone who questions is simultaneously shut down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is it time to take the time to really look at everything in its entirety not just look at what is being delivered to us? Don&#39;t our children in the very least deserve that from us?
Maybe it&#39;s time for each of us to look deeper at studies like the ones found here:
<a href="Http://www.vaccineresearchlibrary.com">Http://www.vaccineresearchlibrary.com</a></p>

<p>Maybe we should start to think for ourselves, see the unseen (actually ask the question Who is benefiting from what and in who&#39;s interest?</p>

<p>Maybe we should stand in support of people standing in support of us, people like Dr Piesse and so many other wonderful Drs, Natural Therapists, Wellness Practitioners who have been until this happened with Dr Piesse too frightened, felt too alone - too vulnerable to speak up. Sadly when anyone even expresses any concern they are tagged (like I have been) as Anti-Vax. Is it time to ask why this is so? Normally (just as in this case) one person takes the heat, gets ridiculed, vilified and it becomes a witch hunt of discrediting and vilifying when in fact the opposite should be the case.</p>

<p>It takes guts to stand up and to question, to reason, but our kids need us to do that. When a Dr has been practicing medicine for over 40 years, does his clinical experience over that time not count for anything? Can he, a medical professional not share concerns without being labeled a &quot;quack&quot; and if not the question is why not?. Concerns like these words written by Dr Piesse:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;I have been encountering cases of vaccine injury for over 40 years. In June it was a happy, healthy nearly 5-year-old whose parents were required to put her on a catch-up schedule, in order to get her into kindergarten. She won’t be going to kinder. She’s in a wheel-chair, brain-damaged. Her life ruined. Then came a friend’s father who died after a flu vaccine, and last week a 4 year old boy, made autistic by a catch-up schedule.&quot; Should we simply ignore that and discredit this brave Dr for having the intestinal fortitude to actually say something. The answer in my humble opinion, is no.
Why do Drs who fear for kids health under the current system have no alternative but to go underground, speak privately. I guess, that&#39;s the question of the day. Any dissension or going against the norm has them ousted, attacked, lose their license to practice medicine, why? Because they care enough to ask for more evidence in support of what they are doing.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time to be a stand collectively as one in wellness. Most wellness practitioners embrace medical science but the reverse appears to well and truly not be the case in many instances. Maybe it&#39;s time to put our personal fears aside, be what our kids need us to be, come together collectively in support of Dr Piesse and of each and every natural therapist and wellness practitioner wanting nothing more than to work hand in hand with medical science to provide everyone with a total wellness package that supports human health moving forward.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s Dr Piesse&#39;s article written for The Melbourne Age that unfortunately was not published:</p>

<p>&quot;I have been encountering cases of vaccine injury for over 40 years. In June it was a happy, healthy nearly 5-year-old whose parents were required to put her on a catch-up schedule, in order to get her into kindergarten. She won’t be going to kinder. She’s in a wheel-chair, brain-damaged. Her life ruined. Then came a friend’s father who died after a flu vaccine, and last week a 4 year old boy, made autistic by a catch-up schedule.</p>

<p>In 1988, the US National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was created. It has paid out over US$3.5 billion to the vaccine-injured. The NVICP was set up to protect vaccine manufacturers from ruinous costs of litigation by vaccine-damaged people. It was deemed preferable to have ‘unavoidably unsafe’ vaccines than no vaccines. Unfortunately the protection provided to vaccine manufacturers also reduced incentives to develop safer vaccines in USA.</p>

<p>Politicians and doctors assure us that vaccinations are very safe although less than 5% of vaccine reactions are reported. Most are passed off as ‘just a coincidence’.
Vaccines contain health-damaging ingredients, not the least aluminium – a known neurotoxin implicated along with mercury, in brain damage as in autism, developmental delay, ADHD, and learning difficulties. Aluminium is also a powerful promoter of auto-immune diseases. Vaccines can claim to be mercury-free if their mercury content is below a still-toxic threshold. Most influenza vaccines contain mercury – also a neurotoxin. In addition, polysorbate 80 in vaccines increases the permeability of the blood brain barrier and potentiates the risks of these neurotoxins. The known presence of carcinogenic viruses in the MMR vaccine, has been covered-up. Vaccines also contain formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.
Proof of vaccine safety requires rigorously conducted clinical studies comparing vaccinated versus truly unvaccinated children for health outcomes. Are there any such studies that confirm that vaccinated children are not worse-off than those unvaccinated? No. There are none. Hence, child vaccines are unproven for safety – an inconvenient truth for a profession that prides itself on being scientific.</p>

<p>One analysis indicated that national infant mortality rates were proportional to the number of vaccine doses (Miller NZ 2011), contradictory to the claim that ‘vaccination saves lives’.
From mid-2015, parents who wished not to vaccinate their children, started to converge on my practice seeking assistance with gaining exemption from the penalties directed at non-vaccinators by the No Jab No Pay and No Jab No Play Legislation.</p>

<p>Analysis up to the end of 2016 of parent’s reasons for not vaccinating, indicated that 64% of 166 parents knew of vaccine-damaged individuals in their own family. The study of ‘Adversomics’ confirms polymorphic and genomic susceptibility factors common to vaccine–damaged individuals and their families. (Poland GA 2015). 40% of unvaccinated children had pre-existing health problems that parents considered would make them more at risk of harm from vaccines. 60% of unvaccinated children were very healthy, but only 6% of the vaccinated children. There were no cases of autism in 212 unvaccinated children, but 8 autism cases in the 50 vaccinated children (16%), and 36% with ASD, compared to 1.4% in the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>As yet there are no large-scale vaccinated versus truly unvaccinated studies of the sort needed prove that vaccines do or do not cause autism.
So where does the widespread belief that vaccines do not cause autism derive? In a nutshell: from an over-whelming quantity of ‘manufactured science’ of low quality, scientific fraud, and ignoring !1 evidence supporting causality. Few doctors and politicians are aware of the pivotal scientific fraud committed in the US Centers for Disease Control. A study of the MMR vaccine in black American babies showed a 2.5 fold higher level of autism in babies given the MMR vaccine at 12 months of age compared to 3 years. The CDC refused to publish these findings but manipulated the data to disguise the undeniable association found. The fraudulent data was then published (DeStefano F 2004 ) and promoted as the final statement on the question. Thereafter the official line was that vaccination did not cause autism. 5000 vaccine-damaged children had their applications in the Vaccine Court for compensation quashed after this deception. But whistle-blower William Thompson released the true unabridged data which was published briefly until pressure from the CDC forced its retraction (Hooker B 2014)</p>

<p>A recent study of home-school students showed a 6.6 fold increase in neurodevelopmental disorders in the vaccinated group over the unvaccinated. Autism spectrum disorders were 4.7 times more prevalent in the vaccinated children (Mawson AR 2017).</p>

<p>So long as doctors and governments continue to be hood-winked into believing that vaccines do not cause autism, no action will be taken to stop the alarming surge in the autism epidemic. A tragedy that need not happen if we demand good science. and safe vaccines.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Since you did not say why then you lie. Since you only understand cheapshots, then these will be supported by facts that expose and demonstrate that the naive are easily brainwashed.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Jeremy Wakefield is a British former gastroenterologist and medical researcher who was struck off the UK medical register for his fraudulent 1998 research paper, and other proven charges of misconduct, in support of the now-discredited claim that there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the appearance of autism and bowel disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He lost his license due to that fraud.  Since he could not support his 1990 lies, he was asked to leave, and eventually fled to the US.  He intentionally and knowingly promoted fraud - according to every investigation into his fraud.  Fraud also applies to those who ignore well proven facts.  That explains why you post only cheapshots to defend your lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have lied about vaccines and autism.  Some (like Jenny McCarthy) only believe the first thing told.  And then ignore honest facts characterized by reasons why. Brainwashing is when only believes the first thing heard.</p>

<p>You also only believe the first thing said.  That is the point.  Even that vaccine / autism myth is secondary.  Relevant is how easily you can be brainwashed by intentional fraud.  And it was intentional fraud.</p>

<p>Point remains how easily and why you can be brainwashed by Jenny McCarthy and fraud intentionally perpetrated by Wakefield.  You promoting lies is not a laughing matter.  Your nasty attitude justifies this &#39;in your face&#39; reply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relevant are so many who believe Wakefield when he was caught faking data, promoting fraud, lost his license, and eventually fled to the US to avoid legal and other problems.  Why do some only believe the first thing they are told?  Why do so many deny facts even stated bluntly by Wakefield&#39;s peers? Why is subjective myth considered proof?</p>

<p>No relationship exists between autism and vaccines.  A relationship exists between a poorly educated Jenny McCarthy and an outright autism lie invented and promoted by fraud. So many people who are honest and educated accurately exposed Wakefield&#39;s lies. He was even banned from practicing medicine.</p>

<p>So again, why do you believe and promote these obvious lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are lying again.  Co-authors withdrew once his intentionally faked data was exposed.  Your CDC whistle blower is fake news created by another brainwashed Jenny McCarthy type.  Poorly educated and easily manipulated.  But she must be right because she is a blond and has a big chest.</p>

<p>From the NY Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since losing his medical license, Wakefield has depended on his followers for financing and for the emotional scaffolding that allows him to believe himself a truth-teller when the majority of his peers consider him a menace to medicine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is an excellent scammer - a menace.  He lives on manipulating and lying to the most easily brainwashed.  He has no support from educated professionals. None.</p>

<p>His paper had twelve co-authors (not 13).  Ten wrote a paper citing their mistake.  Being brainwashed, you don&#39;t hear facts that contradict what you first believed. You only hear what you were first told.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2004, 10 of the 12 authors issued a statement in the Lancet entitled &quot;Retraction of an interpretation&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient. However, the possibility of such a link was raised and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were being kind.  His data more than insufficient.  Wakefiled intentionally manipulated - faked - the data.  He committed fraud.</p>

<p>Wakefield and you lie.  He did so intentionally.  You do so because you are easily brainwashed.  So brainwashed as to believe 12 other professionals agree with Wakefield.  They don&#39;t.   You forgot to learn they deny his conclusions.  But again, please learn facts before lying here.  Unfortunately, the brainwashed stop learning after a first speculation; as if a soundbyte is a fact.  Co-authors do not believe what you said - you lied again.  Co-authors discovered that Wakefield intentionally faked data; intentionally lied.</p>

<p>Definition of the brainwashed - entrenched - they cannot learn.  Unfortunately too many like you keep junk science alive and well.</p>

<p>False. Co-authors only withdrew because their medical certificate would be revoked if they didn&#39;t. Andrew and one other were the only ones who didn&#39;t fold, had their ability to practice removed, and the one other recently had theirs re-instated.</p>

<p>False</p>

<p>Oh gee, I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t remember every single number from memory. I was one off. </p>

<p>False. I&#39;ve heard all about it. You&#39;ve only researched one side, I&#39;ve researched both, so I&#39;m more informed than you.</p>

<p>Show me the hard evidence the data was faked. You keep saying it was, but there&#39;s no proof.</p>

<p>Brainwashed, Brainwashed, Brainwashed, Brainwashed, Brainwashed</p>

<p>You keep calling me brainwashed, but I feel like you&#39;re projecting. You&#39;re worried because you know there&#39;s a chance you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Wacko extremists routinely do that.  Once a lie is exposed, then reasons to protect that lie are invented.</p>

<p>Wakefield lied.  He was exposed fraudulently inventing data.  You are easily brainwashed.  To avoid admitting how easily you are brainwashed, you now invent this new myth. You did not even know of their Lancet paper until it was posted here.  Another example of how brainwashing works.</p>

<p>Some find it impossible to learn how easily they can be brainwashed.  I understand Jenny McCarty.  She could not even get educated.</p>

<p>Brainwashed - the word exists and applies no matter how many times you try to mock it.</p>

<p>Wakefield lied.  Only the brainwashed would deny that reality.  So you invent myths and lies so at to not learn how little you know and how easily you are manipulated. You did not even know that co-authored wrote a paper defining Wakefield&#39;s fraud.  In Germany, these same people were called Brownshirts.</p>

<p>No way around what is clearly brainwashing.  Junk science is alive and well.</p>

<p>Ahhhh sorry but that&#39;s completely bogus. You can&#39;t know about Wakefield without having heard of the Lancet paper. Utter moron.</p>

<p>You keep repeating the same 5 points, but answer none of my questions. Who is brainwashed really? Your only argument is &#39;you are brainwashed&#39;. You ignore everything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying you will not reply. Then you reply. That is the point.  A child is emotional.  An adult, who uses a completely different part of the brain (pre-frontal cortex), is logical and honest.  You even lied about not replying.</p>

<p>Your junk science is not justified by what an adult uses - logical reasoning.  Junk science is often observerd with adults who still think like children.  Emotion - not honest facts - justify your faith in Wakefield.  All facts (including his co-authors) say he faked data (committed fraud).  He promoted junk science.  But that is logic; not emotion.</p>

<p>You keep saying you will not reply.  And then post again.  Again your emotions keep talking.  The emotional are easily brainwashed.  The emotional automatically believe a first thing told.  Then get angry and confrontational when facts, numbers, and honesty expose that fable.  Angry as in emotional and not logical.</p>

<p>You are not even honest enough to stop replying.  Maybe when insulted by this challenge, then you will use logic to be honest and stop replying.  This challenge to your emotions and your resulting anger might force you to change;  start becoming logical and honest.</p>

<p>Junk science remains alive and well - protected by those who are emotional.</p>

<p>Lies avoid this reality.  No relationship exists between vaccines and autism .... except in the mind of an adult who is still a child.  Who is easily brainwashed.  And who even denies he lied about not replying anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wakefield faked the data by preselecting the children. No medical evidence was actually used, only the parents own anecdotal evidence (my child got sick after being vaccinated).  Some of the children had developmental issues that been flagged by their own doctors before they where vaccinated, information which was left out of his report. </p>

<p>Wakefield was paid £450,000 by legal firm trying make up a case. Wakefield also held patents for single vaccines which would only benefit if MMR was discredited. Far from being an anti-vax hero he is nothing than a money grabbing twat trying to line his own pockets. I have no doubt he didn&#39;t intend to cause direct harm to children, that was just a side effect of him trying to line his own pockets with his own vaccine. I have no doubt that if his medical career had taken a different path he would be the kind of doctor working for tobacco companies and proving 20 a day is actually good for yoy</p>
