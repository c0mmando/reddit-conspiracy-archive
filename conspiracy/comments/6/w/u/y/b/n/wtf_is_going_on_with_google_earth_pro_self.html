        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I woke up this morning and turned on my PC to find a new shortcut icon on my desktop called &quot;google earth pro.&quot;  I didn&#39;t install it and it never even gave me notice that it was being installed.  I have never installed goole earth on that machine, but my browser is Chrome.  At first I thought it was some kind of virus pretending to be a google product, but after a little bit of research I found a bunch of other people complaining of the same thing and saying it really is from google.</p>

<p>I feel like my privacy and computer security has been badly violated.  Self installing with out permission or notice are traits of a virus.  Is this just google being shitheads or does this program double as spyware?  I haven&#39;t yet launched or uninstalled the program.</p>

<p>EDIT:  What other crap has google put on my PC without permission?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look in the add remove programs control panel and it will tell you what day the apps were installed.</p>

<p>Often weird apps are included in installs for other things.  I&#39;ve gotten the option to install chrome and other programs when attempting to install other things.  The checkbox to tell it NOt to install is usually hidden or very small, and defaults on installing the extra junk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Libreboot. There are cpus and hardware that is free from the intel ME chip and AMDs version. These cpus are older and are obviously not as powerful as intels i series but they are free from the flaws of the i series ME chip. I know that theres a website that sells these laptops with libreboot already setup on them I just can&#39;t think of the name. If youre really paranoid you can run your Linux OS on a removeable flashdrive and use specific security minded Linux distros such as Tails or Kali that help you keep your privacy. </p>

<p>Best of luck to you! I left windows as the trash it is once they pushed W10 and mandatory telemetrics on its users and I regret nothing. Linux has growing support for games if that is something you care about as well. Many games on Linux are also free and open source. I hope you find a distro that suits your needs and experience the glory of GNU/Linux.</p>
