    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve been on reddit for 4 or 5 years but lurking even longer.  I have neverbeeb banned until recently and it was r/politics that did it.  That sub is a complete joke.</p>

<p>Personally, I DO hate that this sub has become a political tug of war instead of giving some fun relief to discuss actual conspiracy theories but unfortunately the current state of journalism is so terrible that a lot of what isnt being reported is legitimately conspiracy territory.</p>

<p>Where can we go for good conversation and content?  I have been lurking on 4chan for over a year but I still don&#39;t understand it and voat is full of racist garbage.</p>

<p>No, what you said was, &quot;I removed all mods except for axolotl as I had said that I would step down as my position of &quot;top mod&quot; (number two mod.&quot;  This is unequivocally a lie, you provably did remove AP&#39;s perms and you provably <em>did not</em> step down from your position as &quot;top mod&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Sarah,</p>

<p>What you did is clear: You made two attempts to purge the mod team: The first was on Aug 10th, when you REMOVED all permissions from ALL mods. <a href="http://archive.is/sSVRT">http://archive.is/sSVRT</a> </p>

<p>Do you &quot;remember&quot; doing that?</p>

<p>Also, can you explain this thread on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qHmudet.png">TopMindsofReddit?</a></p>

<p>Excerpts: (emphasis mine)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: u/sarah_connor, you had your chance to do something [about this](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6svm0i/all_mods_are_on_recess_for_an_internal_discussion/">/r/conspiracy/comments/6svm0i/all_mods_are_on_recess_for_an_internal_discussion/</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: You area fucking moron. <strong>Admins intervened</strong> - so go fuck yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: I&#39;m trying to be civil here - see my response below. <strong>How were we supposed to know the admins intervened?</strong></p>

<p>[further down]</p>

<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: Fuck you <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> - <strong>I attemted to reply MANY times</strong> and got &quot;403 error&quot; upon every submission.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: I don&#39;t know what the &quot;403 error&quot; is but <strong>I just asked the mods here</strong> [TopMindsofReddit] <strong>to unban the r/conspiracy mods, so maybe that was the cause?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: I have a life IRL outside of reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: Completely understand that. <strong>I&#39;m just saying you had an opportunity of power.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: When I removed perms, <strong>ADMINS stepped</strong> in and basically threatened to take action if perms wernt put in place.</p>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: No one was aware of this. That&#39;s not a good situation for you to be in.</p>

<p>IDK, Sarah, but it sure LOOKS like your pals at TMOR had sent you on a MISSION to purge the mod team - and that they were PISSED because you FAILED at that mission, and that you had not communicated with them properly. (Fucking&#39; 403 errors!)</p>

<p>Is there any other way that the above conversation can be interpreted?</p>

<p>But you tried AGAIN, last Friday, didn&#39;t you? This time with a little help from Flytape and DronePuppet: <a href="http://archive.is/t06Cc">http://archive.is/t06Cc</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s enough for the moment. You have some explaining to do, u/Sarah_Connor.</p>

<p>The floor is yours.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t &quot;pinging and trolling&quot;, they were shaming and scolding - for failure to complete an assignment. </p>

<p>Also, Sarah_Connor had been modding here since 2009*, do you think they would fall for TMOR&#39;s bait?</p>

<ul>
<li>*<em>I should say the ACCOUNT known as Sarah_Connor has been on the mod list since 2009 - there is a strong possibility that the account was taken over by others)</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Re-read the actual thread. SC&#39;s accuser ruthlessly attacks, and then becomes borderline apologetic after learning that ADMINS stepped in, and that SC could not &quot;reply&quot; due to 403 errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Moranall</strong>: I don&#39;t know what the &quot;403 error&quot; is but <strong>I just asked the mods here</strong> [TopMindsofReddit] <strong>to unban the r/conspiracy mods, so maybe that was the cause?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Nah, this was not just trolling. <strong><em>SC was supposed to report</em></strong> to TMOR, and could not due to &quot;technical difficulties&quot;, hence the confusion.</p>

<p>Look, if you don&#39;t like my interpretation, give it a shot. I asked Sarah repeatedly in the modmail to offer an explanation, and I was ignored.</p>

<p>Give it a whirl?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  I&#39;ve not interacted at all with s_c directly, so it feels a little weird carrying too much water for him.  But I feel that their voices have been somewhat snuffed out since the coup, so I&#39;ll go to bat for em, with the bits of evidence I&#39;ve gathered.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/GgdKE">https://archive.is/GgdKE</a></p>

<p>Based on this post, topminds was whining that our hot page wasn&#39;t filled up with Charlotte crash stories.  The op pinged s_c to make fun of him for &quot;allowing&quot; this to happen.  When s_c foolishly responded, the op began &quot;polite concern trolling&quot; him on how he ran the sub, and allowed all the &quot;trumptards&quot; to take over.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty straightforward.  I can&#39;t know <em>exactly</em> what the 403 errors we&#39;re, but it seems like s_c tried responding to the ping, but couldn&#39;t, because conspiracy mods we&#39;re banned, at first.</p>

<p>The first part of my answer is a straightforward reading of the thread.  (I took a closer look after your invite).  The second part is speculation, but it&#39;s a reasonable guess, based on the context of the post, ping, and following &quot;conversation&quot; (trolling)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean it is disproven. It just means more than one person conspired to do something (and usually tried to hide it, though that is not required either)</p>

<p>Ironically, the reason why this misapprehension is so widespread is itself a conspiracy, and a confirmed on. After the JFK assassination, the CIA was worried about all the thinking that people were doing, and set out to intentionally discredit the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and conflate it with wild and unproven, unprovable nonsense. It was pretty effective. </p>

<p>Do people really, honestly believe a sub is paid/being paid to give two shits about conspiracy subs? Is there <em>any</em> proof of this at all? Nope. Never was, but that has never stopped anyone here from believing, well, anything. </p>

<p>Sarah Connor isn&#39;t banned, he just got caught in a lie and hasn&#39;t been seen since.  Flytape retired on his own volition and was banned for a few rule 10 violations same as anyone else would be.  He hasn&#39;t appealed his ban at all in modmail so I doubt he really cares about being allowed to post here.</p>

All I have are my RES tags, which I trust, but you&#39;re of course under no obligation to.  </p>

<p>The other problem we run into is Rule 4.  I&#39;ve had enough interaction with the mods to know that if I do start naming names and providing evidence I&#39;ll get banned ASAP.</p>

<p>Rule 10 is for personal attacks.  Making arguments based on evidence is allowed.  In fact, you&#39;re closer to rule 10 right now making claims about the mods without any evidence at all than you would be if you&#39;d said the same things while providing links/screenshots/an argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I appreciate you taking the time to respond.  I&#39;d truly like to wrap my head around this enough to understand the opinions on the topic.  </p>

<p>So bear with me, because these may sound like stupid questions - but apparently I&#39;m an old geezer now who doesn&#39;t understand the way Reddit works, which sounds like might be an important thing to grasp in the big world of social media influence - especially in this sub.  </p>

<p>Reddit has sponsors?  I mean, I get they are a company who has to make money.  And naively, I&#39;m not really sure how much of social media makes its money (like Reddit and Twitter).  I assumed Reddit made money by users simply buying gold, though I guess that wouldn&#39;t really pay the bills, let alone make millionaires.  But I don&#39;t see many ads like Facebook - so I haven&#39;t a clue where the money actually comes from.</p>

<p>Which, is why I have a hard time understanding admins having an agenda, I guess.  And when there are thousands of subs, how that agenda gets pushed?</p>

<p>I get we&#39;ve gone wildly off topic, but since we&#39;re here maybe you can help me learn a little more about why we&#39;re damning The Man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh, okay.  So you&#39;re saying people pay to get on here as users and influence other users.  And that admins are completely aware of this (and support it).</p>

<p>THAT claim makes sense (I&#39;m not being sarcastic).  In fact, I think I remember people posting actual evidence of this but I just kinda dismissed it without digging into it.</p>

<p>Fuck, that&#39;s dark.  I think I was happier thinking this was just a big fancy message board where people were connecting with one another.  And &quot;shills&quot; and the like were just outside interests being paid by other companies to push agendas.  I never imagined Reddit was actually in on it.  In fact, I know I was happier thinking that.  Red pills taste bad.</p>
