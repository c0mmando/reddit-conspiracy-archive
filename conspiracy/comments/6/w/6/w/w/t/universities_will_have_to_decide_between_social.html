    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t apologize, u/TrumpRusConspiracy is just more interested in what facts other users may be exposed to than the facts themselves.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you try paying more attention to the facts themselves and how you can form a more objective and well-rounded perspective on the subject of conspiracy? I honestly believe that if you just took the time to step back and consider all points of view and didn&#39;t try to create your own path to what you already think is the truth, you&#39;d be ashamed of your username, as 90% of us here are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know that. But is &quot;flooding&quot; breaking a rule? I&#39;m glad someone recently unbanned him. He got a bunch of awesome posts exposing antifa to the front page. With how obviously unpopular antifa is, and the fact that he didn&#39;t bother to disguise himself with any alts, I don&#39;t think he had any bad intentions. He simply posted anti antifa posts that made it to the front page, because we ALL wish antifa would stop with their bullshit so that we could all come together and have civilized discussion instead. Personally, I upvoted all of those posts and I know I wasn&#39;t the only user to appreciate the level of dedication it took to put that content together and post it.</p>

<p>By the way, what do you think about Mueller subpoenaing the Podesta group for their Uranium deals with Russia? I would think that it would be of some interest to you, given your whole thing is the MSM parroted &quot;Russian collusion&quot; conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right I mentioned that he was only incidentally in politics because he&#39;s interesting for far more legit reasons than his stance on one Canadian piece of legislation. </p>

<p>Also that Canadian law was not about only the world &#39;they&#39;. It&#39;s completely open ended, which is the problem. That&#39;s the problem with most problematic laws. But I&#39;m not going to debate that bill here, it&#39;s not interesting to me particularly and isn&#39;t the point of this thread. It&#39;s just a nice sound bite sjws use to foolishly discredit everything the man says because they can say &quot;HE HATES TRANS PEOPLE&quot; knowing full well that 99% of their fellow ideological travelers will take that slander at face value without looking further at the subtlety of the situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a former NDP (far left Canadian political group) supporter. He&#39;s currently advising the Canadian Progressive Conservative party on their election platform.</p>

<p>Peterson is a centrist as far as I can tell. His beliefs are deeply grounded in enlightenment era thinkers and widely rejects (and mocks) post-modernist philosophy. This is the source of his hatred for identity politics.</p>

<p>He appears to be right wing is because he believes (as far as I can tell) that the West is shifting so fast towards the left that the people who hold right-wing views are becoming disillusioned. His views are that people oriented towards right-wing views are required for a functional society because they are temperamentally (according to their personality as measured by big 5 personality traits) oriented towards working jobs that require limited creativity with a lot of hard work (i.e. Jobs that keep businesses alive).</p>

<p>I&#39;m unsure if the OP&#39;s quote is something Jordan Peterson even said. I can only find an x-post from t_d attributing the quote to him. </p>

<p>Regarding the statement itself; I don&#39;t approve of labels and simplistic realities (black vs white | Good vs Evil) that ignore gray areas. Why can&#39;t we have social justice when and where injustices are occurring while also scaling back the amount of dishonest teachings that are ushering in a youth that is being blinded from the realities of human existence? The dogma is gaining strength, but it isn&#39;t entirely made up of a backbone of lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>Peterson seems to be a full-stop sort of experience for a lot of people who have their minds made up for them by the great echo chamber we call social media.</p>

<p>Now, having firmly supported both what he says, and his right to say it, here&#39;s a few add-ons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Peterson is much more subtle than the catchy quote that started the post. He clearly has a nuanced perspective on &quot;truth&quot; that includes a lot of pragmatism. He believes stuff because of things like gobs of data and strong statistical confirmation, you know, like a scientist in any other field than gender divergence in personality psychology.</li>
<li>He has been adopted as one of the foremost intellectual stars of the alt-right. Saying we wish he wasn&#39;t won&#39;t undo that. I&#39;m not at all sure he ever would have wanted or chosen that. He&#39;s about the only credible academic who will flat-out say men and women are totally different takes on humanity. </li>
<li>His Achilles Heel is not understanding enough postmodern philosophy. The essence of the postmodern is that there is no truth - it&#39;s constructed and with a purpose. If society needs a world full of gender neutered, race-conscious, apologetic, highly-distractable drones in order to enter the next phase of humanity, then that&#39;s how you condition them. Anybody interested, I suggest looking up Antonio Gramski. </li>
</ol>

<p>(btw - I am a postmodernist theorist and I do see whay they are doing this weirdness and where it might be going. Spoiler: ask Elon and Zuck.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus &quot;What is Truth?&quot; (John 18:38) it was a rhetorical question which both of them must have understood. The Roman governor was saying &quot;look, I can let you go free if you say the right things right now, but you have to drop this truth stuff about being the Messiah and King.&quot; This dialog in the New Testament is thoroughly postmodern.</p>

<p>So Nietzsche is completely misunderstood by most people, even philosophers. He wasn&#39;t saying that &quot;God is Dead...and you killed him!&quot; because he wanted us to be happy about it and run straight toward the &quot;Superman&quot; ideal of a strong, ruthless, self-centered individual. It was a warning. If you drop your God, your only real choice is to evolve/devolve back into what Pilate was channeling: Pagan power hierarchy, where the idea of truth is simply a tool to control the unwashed masses. A Game of Thrones world.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make sure we know the difference between Modern and Postmodern. They overlap, even today, but we are rapidly getting into deeper Postmodern territory. The Modern is the full flowering of the Enlightenment ideal of a rational predominance in the areas of science, politics, and economics. During the Enlightenment (1600s and 1700s), only a few forward-thinkers embraced these ideas, while the masses clung to their superstitions and religious practices and viewpoints. During the Modern (1800s) the masses caught up and by and large accepted the predominance of the rational sciences over and above the mystical incantations of the old order priests and theologians.</p>

<p>But, certain voices during the Modern period were already moving past the idea that all problems of human existence can be solved by applying logical and mechanical solutions. People like Nietzsche, as well as writers like Melville and Dostoevsky, tried to open up the problem of the mysterious source both of human angst and goodness, something that was inimical to pure rationality. (See Notes from Underground - the famous passage where the protagonist wonders why 2 plus 2 must always equal 4; and the chapter in Moby Dick that describes the bottom of the ocean - both classic postmodern epiphanies.)</p>

<p>OK, so the Postmodern position questions the drive of humanity toward a fully rationalized existence. This perspective can be deployed either by the political left or by the political right. The thing it seeks to overturn is mankind&#39;s confidence that rationality alone is &quot;The Way&quot; in a nearly religious sense - the best path for humans to follow going forward.</p>

<p>There are so many elements as to why Postmodern can actually win an argument with intelligent Modern rationalists and convince people (me for instance) to defect. The trick is to use rationalism against itself. To make an argument against rationalism using rational insights. For instance, one approach is to ask yourself how and why things change over time. If the things our parents and grandparents took for granted are no longer &quot;true&quot; for us today, doesn&#39;t that imply there is no real truth here in the flesh and blood world? Even science changes. Different schools and fields pop up and fade away all the time in science, even in Math. This idea that nothing stays the same is sometimes called &quot;Historicism&quot; or &quot;Historicity&quot;. It claims that, effectively, our reality is created anew each generation.</p>

<p>Another example of a rational argument against rationality has to do with language. You might have heard the phrase &quot;The Linguistic Turn&quot; in philosophy. People started looking very hard at the way normal language works, and found that everyday spoken and written language has certain characteristics that formal language (as in logic or math) cannot fully represent. So one approach is that when a translator changes a novel from one language to another, everybody agrees that certain things about the experience of reading it in the first language is not the same as reading it in the second language. Why would this be?</p>

<p>You might say, well, computers are now so good at translating they have caught up and can do as good as humans. That&#39;s actually not the case. Modern AI-assisted language translators consist of vast dictionaries of how human speakers choose to translate phrases. They found out that trying to translate using rational symbols and processes just didn&#39;t work as well as &quot;Big Data&quot; full of typical human decisions. That&#39;s what nearly all &quot;Expert Systems&quot; do. They don&#39;t replicate humans, they capture humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thank you. I&#39;m very interested, please give me some examples of rationalism being sort of self defeating? Just because different generations value different things doesn&#39;t mean that universal values/ultimate truths don&#39;t exist, or does it? That&#39;s an interesting take on post modernism that I&#39;ve never heard before. I&#39;ve mainly only heard that post modernism is only about tearing everything else apart while creating nothing, which I still do believe. This new take on it makes me see it in a different light, but still mainly as a cultural Marxist attack on the west </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Examples of Rationality that &quot;errors out&quot; when applied:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bertrand Russell&#39;s problem with self-reference with set theory in his Principia Mathematica (1910&#39;s). Related to requirement of Excluded Middle. One version: Given that a barber shaves all the men in town who don&#39;t shave themselves. Does he shave himself? If he does, it breaks, and if he doesn&#39;t it breaks.</li>
<li>This then sets up a much bigger problem: Godel&#39;s Uncertainty Principle (1920&#39;s): In any internally consistent mathematical system, even as simple as arithmetic, there will be equations which cannot be determined. This result was expanded by Turing and Post (1930&#39;s) into the Halting Problem which applies to all standard computers.</li>
<li>Side by side with doubts about the limited nature of straight up logic, there was a drive to understand textual matter in a rigid framework. As texts such as religious and philosophical books were analyzed closer and closer for meanings, it became apparent that a circularity was necessarily implied: the words in the text were explained by using other words, which themselves might only be understood by reference to the original word in question. Again a form of self-reference, called the Hermeneutic Circle.</li>
<li>Making things in literary analysis even worse, the question was put forward of whether the author of a work could be said to have an intended meaning at all. Both the act of writing a work, and then the many acts of reading the work, seemed to consist of a multitude of overlapping meanings which cannot ever be collected into a single meaning. The radical response to this was the notion of deconstruction (Derrida), which was to take the initial stance that the real meaning of a text is the opposite, or the negation, of it&#39;s superficially apparent meaning. Example: If I start a story with &quot;There was a hill&quot; my meaning may be &quot;there was not a plain&quot;, or &quot;there was not a non-hill&quot;. The fact that I started by saying there was a hill points the mind of the reader to the opposite of the hill. In logic, of course, there is no (A = Not A). But the theory goes farther, by suggesting the true intent of the author is found in the resonance between affirmation and negation of the positions described, and it is never parallel to it, always oblique. So if I told a story about hills, my real purpose might be to talk about sex, which could only be found by a careful deconstruction of my simple story.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there are many more examples like this - I could literally keep it up for pages. I talked earlier about science being associated with the historical context in which it emerges. A few scientific &quot;facts&quot; remain constant over longer periods of time, but many, if not most, change. The postmodernist would claim that the very idea that some &quot;truisms&quot; we take for granted, like what constitutes goodness, or the extension of personhood through time, or the color red, actually exist at all is itself a product of our education and environment, not true in itself. In other words, what we call true is always local in time and space, even when it seems like that time and space is very large - as with astronomy, etc.</p>

<p>In the old systems based on hierarchical power relationships between the nobility and the lower classes, what was considered &quot;true&quot; in any given society generally was passed down from the top by priests, backed up by strong rulers, and had the implicit stamp of divine approval, in case anybody was wondering...</p>

<p>With the emergence of a powerful middle class, that led to industrialization, first the merchant class, then the working class, found in themselves the means of ruling as well or better than the old nobility, and therefore they were now in the position to &quot;decide&quot; what truth would be handed around to everyone. In some cases they chose to keep most of the same truths, for instance when America retains a strong dose of bible belt religion; in other cases, as in the communist revolution, the &quot;people&quot; in charge abandoned all the old truths and substituted new truths. In all cases, the Enlightenment urge to elevate scientific rational valuation was an essential ingredient. But, for the reasons given above, the slow encroachment of anti-rational perspectives has now changed that playing ground. Rational answers do not hold the same weight.</p>

<p>So I mentioned that both political conservatives and political progressives can and do take advantage of a postmodern perspective. In my experience the defining difference between the two is that the left tends to place &quot;humanity&quot; or the &quot;common good&quot; in the driver&#39;s seat when deciding what truth means, while the right tends to pull a sort of &quot;transcendent historical purpose&quot; into the equation, such that the postmodern decision-making on the acceptable &quot;truths&quot; must take into account the long term development of societies and belief-systems, which are often entangled with religious beliefs.</p>

<p>OK, so from this point we get right at the question - why does the left seek to reshape civilization using the postmodern understanding - that all truths are built in to a population by conventions of thought, and can be manipulated? Well, they are trying to look ahead at a future society that will be able to give every person a place. </p>

<p>We can all, left and right, see that the end-point of industrialization and computerization is a world in which all the classic economic problems get solved. Who will benefit from that?</p>

<p>The left wants that near-future stage to benefit absolutely everyone in the world. That would mean necessarily breaking down the divisions between the technocratically gifted populations (like white euro males, but also other demographics), and everyone else (like poor brown-skinned people who recently got running water). So their strategy appears to be operating on many levels. Lots of propaganda aimed at leveling the perceptions about the different types of people to make them feel equal; actually encouraging large scale migration so that each country has a mix of people and cannot be homogeneous;  large scale infusions of first world capital into the third world areas (by carbon exchange for one thing); efforts to unify economic interchange to facilitate eventual blurring and removal of national boundaries. All these actions are being pushed in postmodern ways.</p>

<p>What does the right want to do? Well I think that&#39;s pretty much up in the air. Mostly, I think the right wants to twist postmodernism into a sort of &quot;magic&quot; that retains the ancient roots of our species&#39; unique abilities. A certain amount of inequality is likely built in to that vision.</p>

<p>You were the one equating youtube views with whether one&#39;s argument and views are correct or not. If popularity means that one&#39;s views are correct solely based off popularity then you don&#39;t live in the real world. </p>

<p>If you want to actually argue about what he espouses, we can have that argument.</p>

<p>Popularity doesn&#39;t = His opinions are correct.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simplistic and childless view of the world.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Do youtube views indicate whether or not someone is more well known in the real world by real average everyday people or less well known? I follow people on YouTube that garner more views than Jordan Peterson, which doesn&#39;t correlate to the average person out here in the real world actually <em>knowing</em> who this person is.</p>

<p>Sam Harris is more well known than Peterson. He can selll out more speaking venues than Peterson precisely because of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show me anyone else that has ever had that much attention when addressing the Canadian Senate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a rabid political junkie and news hound. I&#39;d never heard of Peterson speaking to the Canadian government until you brought it up. What did he say? Why did most people have never heard about it? Why is it important that someone like Peterson—who most people have never heard of—speaks to the Canadian government? Not to talk smack about the Canadians but they have no leverage geopolitically or on the world stage. Most countries don&#39;t give a damn what Canada thinks. Canada isn&#39;t Germany, let alone a superpower on the world stage. People are invited all the time to speak before the Senate, btw. A quick search online can show you that.</p>

<p>Which is your subjective opinion, not fact. There&#39;s a difference. And yes, he is clueless about many things political, including socialism and capitalism—that isn&#39;t a subjective opinion if you are aware of his arguments about socialism and if you are also aware of what socialism is and isn&#39;t, beyond the cursory reactionary view most young conservatives have about socialism when they are just actually parroting what they&#39;ve <em>heard</em> instead what they&#39;ve personally <em>studied</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a childlike view of things. It&#39;s not a legitimate argument based in logic and reason. Politics is and has never been the man&#39;s strong suit—he&#39;s an academic who likes to rant about parallels between history and lore and modern times and humanity. Sam Harris shot holes all through these arguments on his Harris&#39;s podcast, btw.</p>

<p>There are many well known people who have the ear of the people who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about half the time—history is full of them. Donald Trump is a prime example. George W. Bush. People still voted and believed in both, even though they were caught in boldfaced lie after lie and misled people and didn&#39;t show a clear understanding of critical subjects in the field of politics. Again, popularity doesn&#39;t = knowledge. Popularity doesn&#39;t = your opinion is right.</p>
