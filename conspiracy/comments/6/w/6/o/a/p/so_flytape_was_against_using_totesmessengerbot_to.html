       The Alt-right is a term coined by Richard Spencer, in an effort to rebraned neo-nazism into softer language to increase it mainstream appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The group was made as part of the Kremlin plans to increase racial tension in the US, as part of the plan outline in the Foundation of Geopolitics.  Spencer's wife is Nina Kouprianova, who is translating the Foundation of Geopolitics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breibart is used a platform to promopt alt-right beliefs.

       Spencer is almost definitely an agent provocateur and comes from an extremely liberal family and background.  In fact he was even quoted saying before that he doesn't think socialism's all that bad.  He's a fake and a fraud designed to demonize the right.

       Alt-right wasn't a term to label far right supporters. It's different from say labeling far left as altleft. White supremacists, not necessary nazi supporters, coined the term to unite themselves. So in the technical meaning Altright does indeed refer to white supremacists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile altleft was externally labeled so it dosen't have the same conotation.

       No they did not.  The media needed a label for a growing group of people fed up with certain loosely associated issues.  They needed an ambiguous term with which to create a boogeyman in order to attack everyone who doesn't fall into center-left category.

       Look up Richard Spencer, a white supremacist. He started using the term in interviews and messages back in 2010 specifically for white supremacist groups. Afterwords it spread throughout. It was indeed self labeling and not by the media looking for a label.

       Spencer used the term "Alternative Right".  Not "Alt-right".  Alt-right was coined by the media as a pejorative.  You've specifically said "White supremacists" which is also incorrect.

       Alt-right is a short form of Alternative Right. What did you think it meant? Also, why is White Supremacists incorrect. Take notice that many White Supremacists label themselves altright on thier own websites/places of discussion.

       Out of curiosity, I get that you are crediting the media for creation of the term altright. What I'm curious about is your opinion of alt right. You said its a term to group loosely based right ideologies. Do you consider it an attempt by the media to group non white supremacists republicans along with white supremacists to inflect neagtive values through the transitive property? What is your take on Briebart which takes upon itself the label of alt right news. Do you think right leaning ideologies should denounce being called alt right or is it more a badge of honor now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I'm interested in reading your complete analysis/opinion of alt right and it's impact on the groups labeled stuff much more then which definition is more correct between us since definitions can change.

       You keep saying this, but what anti-trump posts did he put in contest? I'm a pretty big advocate for contest, and I followed the trial period pretty closely and I'm not remembering this.

       I think you are talking about a post that was clearly brigaded, put in contest by a mod other than fly, was analyzed by a user trying to show that it was brigaded by t_d using incomplete and biased data, then shown to have been completely brigaded by r/politics when he went back and used all the data he had at hand in an unbiased fashion. Is that what you are remembering. Or maybe you missed his final edit.

       There was a point, like the span of a week, where several post negative of Trump were put in contest mode. It was pretty recently and a lot of people noted it and mocked it at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The excuse given was that those posts were being brigaded, but it's pretty clear that the mods behind it didn't like the narrative.

       My understanding is that it was blocked to avoid this sub using the link to defend itself in the subs that X-posted. It is a measure to prevent our users from brigading other subs while they are effectively defending against a brigade.

       Flytape has always seemed like a disinfo agent to me. Remember that weird shit with the "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       podcast" where he wore a stupid bird mask or whatever the hell it was? He was surrounded by drama the entire time he was modding here, almost like he was not on our side. He was there to make us look bad, and it worked like a charm. The fact that he didn't want us to know when we were being brigaded is no surprise at all. It makes perfect sense if you realize he had ulterior motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say let us have more information, not less. That bot was very helpful, and it would let you know when you shouldn't take the vote tallies at face value. We already shouldn't take them at face value, but it's especially true when a thread has been brigaded. When you see that a thread is being brigaded, check the comments that are at the bottom of the thread and the ones that have been hidden from view due to downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the messenger needs is a line aboubt not participating in the threads mentioned. That's it. If someone decides to participate anyway,. then that's on them. Ulterior motives people. Don't believe the fake excuse that the people here want to keep you from being banned.

       Really? Even when he, as a Mod, made and stickied a post welcoming all members of t_d here after their subreddit was temporarily sanctioned? Causing a mass exodus and flooding of this sub with "refugees", all right-leaning and some extremist in their views?
       <em>
        This is not a political sub.
       </em>
       This is a
       <em>
        conspiracy sub.

       I feel like people are really conflating the two to the point that there is no longer any difference. While there are plenty of extremists when it comes to conspiracy, those extremists are not political in nature.

       Why couldn't we use the "golden rule" disclaimer, like TMoR does? The bot posts the link as NP, so it should be out of the sub's hands if people are idiots and decide to participate in defending themselves in being talked about in other subs that are brigading the parent thread.

       This was in modmail regarding the constant TMOR brigading. They didn't just say "oh so solly, we look at that for you GI" like they usually do. They actually acknowledged it and said something that made me think they were going to do something about it. I won't hold my breath, but we have discussed it many times before, and the language was different.

       This. I think it goes back to the days (before Top Minds) when
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       was the arch-nemesis of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , regularly brigading here. When our users responded in kind, they got banned and the admins got really shirty with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , even though we weren't the main culprits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to defend
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and its users, we have no choice to but to disable
       <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/siren-call">
        the siren call
       </a>
       that is totesmessengerbot, because users would inevitably follow its links and start posting retaliatory comments/downvoting in the brigade sub. To be clear, this is exactly what the anti-conspiracy subs want to happen, because they can then complain to the admins and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       gets censured by the admins.

       If you did that just now we didn't get it. You can also just use the sned a private message feature, and put

       He answered me when I asked.  His reasoning was that when it was used our users would backtrack the links and get banned for brigading.  I'm not sure I agree, but I can see the logic.

       TotesMessenger should be allowed here. He's the reason it wasn't and he's gone. It's a perfectly fine bot. His irrational dislike of it because it didn't allow him to completely control the narrative shouldn't be allowed to continue. It's time to let TotesMessenger do it's thing while removing another stain left by Flytape and Sarah_connor.

       Can you actually prove that they brigade? Even if totes is activated, all it means is they're linking posts from this sub, which is well within Reddit's rules.

       I find them here all the time, here's one I reported a while back. That sticky doesn't stop people, with reddit enhancement suite you can switch accounts in 2 seconds and no one knows. A huge portion of the sub is just linking to threads here on r/Conspiracy, you got to be really blind if you think they aren't bridaging.

       Chance discussed why they were banned recently. Just scroll down a bit when you click their name, it's  like their fifth most recent comment. They were banned for allegedly doxxing.

       Honestly what will happen is people will link to a post here, the bot will post a link to that post and some people here will follow that link and brigade it.   That will get a lot of people banned and if the numbers are high enough could get this sub banned.

       He was busted for suspending the mods permissions while the mods were in the process of removing Sarah_Conner from the head seat. The admins came in, and flytape resigned. He proceeded to make a post warning the sub about the mods he doesn't trust and was banned. There is a sticky post that explains it further. You can also check out flys sub r/conspiracyright for more of his side of the story.

       Totesmessengerbot alerted me to the fact that a conversation I had participated in in r/documentaries had been hoovered up by a bot and posted in r/holocomments. A sub that consisted at the time of less than 10 members and three rules: No Posts, No Comments, No up/downvotes. It was just a place for the bot to dump it's load. Shortly afterwards, I was banned from AskHistorians.

       He answered me when I asked.  His reasoning was that when it was used our users would backtrack the links and get banned for brigading.  I'm not sure I agree, but I can see the logic.

       He was the only openly pro Trump mod left.  There are 8 openly pro Hillary mods I can think of.

       I think you are correct. Brigading violates Reddit TOS, and Totes tends to encourage that behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't like being brigaded, and we should practice what we preach.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not encourage brigading.

       Out of curiosity, I get that you are crediting the media for creation of the term altright. What I'm curious about is your opinion of alt right. You said its a term to group loosely based right ideologies. Do you consider it an attempt by the media to group non white supremacists republicans along with white supremacists to inflect neagtive values through the transitive property? What is your take on Briebart which takes upon itself the label of alt right news. Do you think right leaning ideologies should denounce being called alt right or is it more a badge of honor now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I'm interested in reading your complete analysis/opinion of alt right and it's impact on the groups labeled stuff much more then which definition is more correct between us since definitions can change.
