    <div class="md"><p>Accusations are not convictions. He was convicted of contempt of court, and that was what he was pardoned for.</p>

<p>Here is the other side.</p>

<p><strong>The Case for Pardon</strong></p>

<p>President Trump today issued a pardon to the man he calls “Sheriff Joe” — Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio was convicted of failing to follow a court order to end the practice of detaining people based on the suspicion that they lack legal status and turning them over to the border patrol.</p>

<p>The White House provided this explanation of the pardon:</p>

<p>Arpaio’s life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. After serving in the Army, Arpaio became a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, NV and later served as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), formerly the Bureau of Narcotics. After 25 years of admirable service, Arpaio went on to lead the DEA’s branch in Arizona.</p>

<p>In 1992, the problems facing his community pulled Arpaio out of retirement to return to law enforcement. He ran and won a campaign to become Sheriff of Maricopa County. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.</p>

<p>I think there should be a strong presumption against granting pardons. I would prefer that the judicial system, flawed though it is, have the final word on the fate of those who are, or who may be, before it.</p>

<p>But if presidential pardons are going to be granted, and every modern president has granted them, it seems to me that Arpaio is a good candidate, basically for the reasons set forth by the White House. Sheriffs shouldn’t defy court orders. But in a real sense, Arpaio’s crime consists of being overzealous in combating illegal immigration.</p>

<p>It arose in the context of lack of zealousness on the part of the federal government. According to this account, the judge found Arpaio couldn’t detain those who lack legal status because that’s the federal government’s job. But the feds hadn’t been doing that job.</p>

<p>Arpaio was accused by the Obama Justice Department and other left-wingers of targeting Hispanics. Indeed, the legal case that led to his conviction arose from claims of racial profiling. But in Maricopa County, the illegal immigrant population is overwhelmingly Hispanic. Had the County been plagued by mass illegal immigration by Koreans, chances are Sheriff Joe would have targeted Asians. And he would have been right to do so. Sheriffs shouldn’t be expected to check their common sense at the door.</p>

<p>To be sure, the pardon of Arpaio is, at least in part, a political act by a president who campaigned on a tough-as-nails immigration policy and who received Arpaio’s backing. But there’s a pretty good argument that the prosecution of Arpaio was also political.</p>

<p>It was the highly politicized, left-wing Obama Justice Department that chose to prosecute Arpaio in connection with the hot button political issue of enforcing immigration laws. The judge whose order Arpaio defied apparently was satisfied with civil contempt. Team Obama went criminal on the octogenarian sheriff. And it did so, according to Arpaio’s lawyers, just two weeks before he stood for reelection.</p>

<p>The pardon thus can be said to represent a political end to a political case.</p>

<p>Some may defend the pardon by comparing it to egregious pardons of the past, like President Clinton’s pardon of wealthy fugitive Marc Rich and President Obama’s pardon of a Puerto Rican terrorist. Arguing form these outliers strikes me as misguided. Their pardons were so flagrantly unjust that the same argument could be used to defend a great many indefensible pardons.</p>

<p>No such argument is required to defend Trump’s pardon of Arpaio. It was a reasonable exercise of the pardon power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the story from an individual that lives in/near Charlottesville and went to the rally as a spectator, this is their account of the event(s);</p>

<p>What I saw yesterday in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>I am not a writer but will do the best I can. I arrived about 10:30ish. Was actually surprised that I was able to find a parking space relatively close to Lee Park. In fact I thought that perhaps the turnout wouldn&#39;t be as big as I was anticipating because I didn&#39;t see much at first and I was only 5 blocks from ground zero but I was wrong. By the time I had walked one block toward the park the police presence was strong. Many in riot type gear. They had most streets and walkways blocked off funneling everyone into two or three entrances to ground zero. As I got closer to the park you could feel the tension. The Antifa presence was strong as was BLM. Didn&#39;t see many &#39;alt-righters&#39; till I got to the park. (One note here - I think some people were there just to watch. It also wasn&#39;t always clear who was who.)</p>

<p>E Market St was the only way the police were allowing entrance to the park. The park is not huge. I&#39;m guessing, but maybe 1.5 acres or so. It also is on a mound/hill so you have take steps up from Market St to get to it. There are two sets of steps up to the park from Market St. I was coming from the south. The northern entrance was for those protesting the removal of the statue and had been cordoned off as best they could. The southern entrance was for everyone else although most people in the park were statue removal protesters (alt-right). As I got to the park the crowds were already pretty thick. The northern entrance had some priest/religious figure locking arms with antifa and blocking the entrance. The rhetoric and name calling was heavy from both sides. </p>

<p>By the time I got to the park it was maybe 10:45 with the event slated to start @ noon. It looked to me there were about 300-400 alt-righters up top at the park and maybe 1000 -1500 others on the street being a mixture of the left and right but mostly left. By noon I would say the total number of people on all sides had swelled to 4-5,000. I position myself at the southern entrance on top of a retaining wall alongside 3 or 4 reporters/photographers. There were plenty of BLM signs, African Flags &amp; various left supporting banners/flags. Of course many signs spouting about hatred and Nazi&#39;s too. The right had many Confederate Flags, various state flags &amp; US flags, A Few Don&#39;t Tread On Me and a couple I didn&#39;t recognize. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some pictures that show a few Nazi Flags/armbands but I didn&#39;t see them. Not saying there weren&#39;t there but again I didn&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>About 11:10 or so a group of about 50-75 statue supporters were making their way down Market street toward the park from the South. As they approached the southern entrance to the park is when the first violence started. Bottles of water, balloons of paint and bags of urine were thrown at them from the crowd. When that happen the shoving started, fist were flying and people hitting each other with sticks. Of course the right stood up for themselves. Now I&#39;m not saying some on the right wouldn&#39;t be violent anyway BUT I can say for a fact they didn&#39;t start it. Also the police did nothing to quell the violence. Once it started it went on for at least 30-40 minutes or more with crap flying every which way. Also within this 30 + minutes a second group of about the same size also made there way down the street and this just exacerbated the chaos.</p>

<p>In looking at the pictures I took I see there aren&#39;t really any during this timeframe. I also wish I had taken more overall but all I know is if you weren&#39;t looking up and paying attention you were liable to be hit. Crap was being thrown in all directions but in a general direction without care to where it landed. I myself stopped 6 bottles coming in my direction, one from hitting the photographer next to me in the head.</p>

<p>As we approached noon the violence and shouting was prevalent. At this point the police started making the announcement on a bullhorn that the alt-right was having what had been declared an illegal gathering and that they must disperse or be arrested. They did nothing to contain nor restrain the left only the right. The right, who had legally obtain a permit to be there. They complied which I not sure if I was in charge I would have done, but that is another story. After this, while things continued to be chaotic people became more spread out and violence started to dissipate. As a side note I didn&#39;t see the vehicle thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been in the middle of something like this. I found it fascinating &amp; unnerving at the same time. In a split second things can escalate.</p>

<p>You can say what you want about those that were present on the right. They were there to speak to the removal of that statue and history. The MSM and politicians are railing on about the hatred and violence from the &#39;white supremacist&#39; yesterday? But the left was full of vitriol &amp; had no problem with violence even though you&#39;d never know it from the press. I am not saying those on the right were all boy scouts but they had a right to be there and to have their right protected to assemble. Had the left not been there I am relatively certain no violence would have happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was 2 days <strong>after</strong> the Nazi killed an American and injured 19 more in an ISIS style attack. For 2 days before that Trump blamed &#39;both sides&#39; for Charlottesville violence. There is no moral equivalence between the Nazi counter protestors and the Nazis and KKK. Oh and lets not forget, he also said some of those Nazis were &quot;good people&quot;. Trump showed his true colors, and the message was received loud and clear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump comments were good... He said he loves us all. Also refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him. No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good.  <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/white-supremacists-cheer-trumps-response-to-charlottesville-violence-3d0d50196c52/">God bless him.

    <div class="md"><p>Again you missed the point. There aren’t multiple morally equivalent sides here. There’s one side, the white supremacist,  that has long oppressed all other groups of people. Their protests aim to ensure that oppression continues, even if it means using violence. The people counterprotesting, on the other hand, are trying to end that oppression.</p>

<p>So while it’s true that both sides participated in the brawls seen throughout the protests, one side, in a country that supposedly values equality, has the much stronger case by actively working against the hate, bigotry, and violence that the white supremacist side is actively trying to perpetuate.</p>

But immediately following the murder of a girl following a terrorist attack is not the time to even give the appears of a false equivalence.

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone else feel like besides the whole class/ race war the media and other entities are telling us, that this is just a huge social experiment. Like we as a nation are being studied for our reactions. It&#39;s like when my wife and I argue to try to prove a point instead of just calming working things out. Beside seeing the videos all over YouTube with the so called antifa  group calling anyone even people of color Nazis for not agreeing with them, this term hasn&#39;t been brought up in the media at all until 2 weeks ago. Honestly I can tell this is the new narrative that&#39;s being pushed, co worker as well notice this too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, violence should be condemned, on all sides. But immediately following the murder of a girl following a terrorist attack is not the time to even give the appears of a false equivalence. How thick do you have to be to not get that all he had to do was condemn the Nazis. Not only did he create a false equivalence sending the message of approval to the Nazid, the also said some of the Nazis were good people. Complete moral failing. </p>
