        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cell phone formatting plz forgive.   I believe that human sacrifice is an inevitable/essential element of orchestrating human swarms and that this sacrificial rite has been institutionalized via medicine (and via the intelligent distribution of industrialized humanity&#39;s waste streams).  It is essential because any civilization which intends to survive must progress beyond the innate balance of famine, and so the human swarm has for millenia been installed with an innate tendency to self destruct.   Ritualistic vivisection atop a ziggurat and chemotherapy are close relatives...   </p>

<p>Im being extremely succinct here but in order to understand simply analyze what medicine was and the historical reality of its effects.   Go back and look at the doses of arsenic and antimony that were prescribed for hundreds of years and compare them to what is now considered a lethal dose.  Compare blood loss during venesection to what we now call traumatic hemorage. Go ahead.   Now consider why the institutions that indoctrinated doctors made lethal weapons of healers and excommunicated any sane enough to question...     At the end of the day the historical reality is that medicine has killed,  maimed,  and rendered infertile millions upon millions globally since time immemorial.  The most murderous of treatments were defended then as vaccination is today and so one must consider that perhaps some essential function lies within a constant effort to devitalize the injured..  And that always the guardians of civilization have bamboozled the masses into considering murder a virtue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reasons for this are primarily due to</p>

<p>A)  The regulation and sanitation of urban environments.  It cannot be emphasized enough how much healthier cities became as they gradually stopped wantonly pumping tons of toxic waste into the water and air supply..  systems emerged to purge cities of their unsavory refuse.  Sewers and smokestacks...  Be glad we have them. </p>

<p>B)  Refrigeration.  Logistically this development meant urban dwellers had food to consume that actually qualified as nutrition. </p>

<p>C)  Medicine toned itself down a bit.   During the last 200 years slicing open the veins and arteries of sick people fell out of vogue.    Additionally the officially recommended doses of various poisons were scaled back dramatically so as to have sub lethal effects.</p>

<p>On the whole governments internationally de.concentrated poison levels dramatically in areas where tens of thousands were concentrated.  This meant less dramatic episodes where large numbers suffered acute poisoning... Shifting towards an even larger scale chronic low level toxicity.   Poisons which once went concentrated into the air and water were often brilliantly repurposed into consumer goods or at least filtered enough to prevent catestrophic health effects.   </p>

<p>The exponential increase of the population started way before that. What you describe only started to become a thing post WW2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly it did not &quot;become a thing&quot; post ww2.  Subtract one hundred years and youre warmer. </p>

<p>Cases of paralysis fell IMHO due to a significant drop in the general urban usage of nerve agents/insecticides.  Additionally injectables became much more sanitary (they were associated with paralysis)</p>

<p>Smallpox declined primarily because the 150 year practice of deliberately spreading it from person to person fell out of vogue.   Also the usage of fumigants and heavy metals associated with papular skin eruptions declined significantly ... And the general improvements in sanitation meant livers,  kidneys,  and filtration organs were rarely overwhelmed to the degree whivh was formerly common. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously pollution was not solved by the 1970s... However that does not negate the actions of government to reduce noxious industrial emissions prior to that point.   The alkali acts for example were efforts initiated one hundred years before the 1970s to reduce hydrochloric acid emissions.  In fact there were a great many measures taken prior to the 20th century which reduced pollution.   Fun facts. </p>

<p>From a 40s edition of the Ohio State Medical Journal &quot;Probably the first clear description of muscular paralysis as a symptom of serum sickness was recorded in 1911 by Vincent and Richetl who treated a 30 year old man for paralysis&quot; ... And paralysis is a well established consequence of poisoning via organochlorines such as the ones routinely sprayed and painted on cities  following WW2... Before bans were initiated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it sounds to me like you were both insanely dumb and insanely lucky. This is not how it usually goes. A neighbour once let an infection of his thumb grow for so long that they nearly had to take the hand off; luckily it was still possible to drain it and fight it with heavy antibiotics. It&#39;s not something you usually expect to just go away. As witnessed by the high death rate that infections used to have back in the days before disinfection and antibiotics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it served as a constant means of increasing the death rate and decreasing the birth rate.   I believe that it was utterly vital for such a system to exist...  Without medicine to promote the ingestion of poisons and draining blood fertility and lifespan would have been utterly insane.   </p>

<p>If a society today actively promoted heavy bloodletting and ingestion of mineral poisons we would say without hesitation that this dramatically lowers population growth.   This system was in place for many centuries spanning many civilizations...   It was the official and popular system of treatment and effected countless millions.   If they had disbanded medicine entirely and prescribed water for every affliction what the hell would they have done to counter the explosive population growth?  I know the concensus is that they were naive and their system had some net positive if only through the placebo effect... However i believe the truth is that the system had no health benefit or individuals... But rather is an ancient fundamental aspect of governing millions of people..  It takes many forms however it absolutely must exist and the governed must accept it if society is to function. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of this information can be found in any medical history book.  So where do I lose you?</p>

<p>1)Prescribing venesection and dangerous doses of heavy metals was at least as common as prescribing antibiotics today.  </p>

<p>2)Heavy metal poisoning and severe hemorage wreck havoc on every system in the biological organism.  </p>

<p>3)A population characterized by the frequent use of these treatments will have shorter lifespans and reduced fertility.. Resulting in a significant overall reduction in the rate of population growth. </p>

<p>4)  The use of these treatments was promoted heavily by governments internationally. </p>

<p>This information is all very basic and I&#39;m not really sure what source you need.   Any book on pre 20th century medicine ... And any book on toxicology.   &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; is an excellent starting point for an appreciation of the harm pre scientific medicine caused. </p>

<p>As for my ultimate conclusion that medicine was in fact designed by the elite to regulate population?  No respectable textbook will ever even humor such a consideration.  Nonetheless the reality of medicines impact on society historically is that it did indeed lower population growth.   With good intentions,  by the popular reasoning.  </p>

<p>Dude. The concept of &#39;heavy metal&#39; didn&#39;t exist. No one knew how anything works. We&#39;re talking about a time when people thought they could create gold out of completely different materials.</p>

Men have been recording the effects of mineral poisons since the dawn of civilization - they observed diseases common to miners and chemists...   Utilized them in assasinations and warfare... Experimented and studied on living creatures...   Your cartoonish characterization of mankind as oblivious monkeys is entirely inaccurate.   </p>

<p>Governments promoted iatrochemical medicine by establishing the universities which educated the medical profession..  As well as generated propaganda through churches and other media which gave prestige to these treatments. </p>

<p>It can be jokingly noted that by popularizing mercury, lead,  and etc as medicine they effectively did transform base metals into gold ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reasons for this are primarily due to</p>

<p>A)  The regulation and sanitation of urban environments.  It cannot be emphasized enough how much healthier cities became as they gradually stopped wantonly pumping tons of toxic waste into the water and air supply..  systems emerged to purge cities of their unsavory refuse.  Sewers and smokestacks...  Be glad we have them. </p>

<p>B)  Refrigeration.  Logistically this development meant urban dwellers had food to consume that actually qualified as nutrition. </p>

<p>C)  Medicine toned itself down a bit.   During the last 200 years slicing open the veins and arteries of sick people fell out of vogue.    Additionally the officially recommended doses of various poisons were scaled back dramatically so as to have sub lethal effects.</p>

<p>On the whole governments internationally de.concentrated poison levels dramatically in areas where tens of thousands were concentrated.  This meant less dramatic episodes where large numbers suffered acute poisoning... Shifting towards an even larger scale chronic low level toxicity.   Poisons which once went concentrated into the air and water were often brilliantly repurposed into consumer goods or at least filtered enough to prevent catestrophic health effects.   </p>
