       -The alt-left domestic terrorist groups are going to become ultra violent soon and attempt the implementation of a communist regime by means of violent revolution with the full blessing of the MSM in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I can prove my words, read on for 5 more minutes until the end and you'll see this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The alt-left domestic terrorist far-left groups are LYING to everyone by telling the general public they only attack Nazis, but in reality, they label anyone who disagrees with their violent far-left Marxist ideology as a Nazi and then incite violence against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       -See here the Mayor of Berkeley calling a female trans-sexual female patriot who disavows the KKK and the Nazis being labeled a White Supremacists because she organizes an anti-Marxist protest:
       <a href="https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/25/berkeley-mayor-labels-march-against-marxism-a-white-nationalist-rally/">
        https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/25/berkeley-mayor-labels-march-against-marxism-a-white-nationalist-rally/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       -See here 5 examples of 5 times Antifa attacked someone who wasn't a Nazi:

        https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/22/5-times-antifa-attacked-someone-who-wasnt-a-nazi/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       -All these groups are communist. They LIE all the time by telling the general public they are just anti-Nazi, anti-KKK, but that is just part of their false narrative to justify and normalize violence against anyone who they label as a Nazi or KKK member, and they label anyone who disagrees with them on anything as a Nazi or KKK and then incite violence against all opposition based on that label they put on all their opposition.
      </p>

       -Antifa plans on how to attack people by meeting at public meeting on a college campus, then accuse non-Antifa people who show up to listen and document of stalking them and attacking women and minorities:

       This is all hard evidence that a communist revolution is taking place in the USA, and the media has chosen its side. CNN doesn't give a crap if the alt-left are violent monsters who undermine the government. They've picked their side, and they will remain on the side of Antifa and the other alt-left domestic terrorist far-left groups until the war is over.... however that turns out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not underestimate them. They have the support of government officials (Mayor of Berkeley for example), communist institutions (like ADL),communist judges, communist teachers and school officials, and off course, the (((MSM))). This makes for a very asymmetric warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because they look, act like and are losers, does not mean they can't be dangerous, because in fact, they are dangerous. The clown in pic related here, is clearly committed, so, can you imagine if some ISIS operative (which they have connections with) hands him a chemical agent and their Antifa leaders order him to go put it in a air ventilation or conditioning system of a building were only Trump supporters or other of "Nazis/White Supremacists/KKK members" (aka, anyone who isn't a Marxists) are working or living, do you doubt he will do it? And everyone to the right of Marx is a "Nazis/White Supremacists/KKK member" for this people. They are losers, dangerous losers which are getting trained and have connection to ISIS, Venezuela's Nicholas Maduro communist regime and Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers.

       They are going to start a civil war. Mark my words, they will try it.

       Revolutionary overthrow of the existing order.  A lot more can be done through elections than the powers that be want you to believe, but fundamental changes will need large masses of people independently organized to make systemic changes.  The security agencies have been clamping down hard on any organization that could potentially do that for a long time though.

       Yeah, no thanks.  Your solution to the problem is the one thing guaranteed to leave everyone else in a far worse place.  See Bolshevik Russia, Soviet Russia, Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia, and Castro's Cuba.

       See so many kids in my generation who Go to college and get 50k -100k in debt and waste 4-8 years partying while getting an unmarketable degree and then complain that they can't get a good job and are now enslaved to the man working at some soulless job making 40k a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only 25k in debt for my extremely marketable CS degree from a public university and own a house the mortgage of I pay for by renting out spare bedrooms WHILE LVING IN IT. I'm on track to not only have a paid off house for me to live in, but multiple properties generating income and I wouldn't be able to do it without the evil banks giving me a mortgage.

       People make bad decisions and blame the system when they should be treating the system as a game that you CAN WIN. Is the system unfair and skewed for the wealthy ? Absolutely and it should be changed, but don't blame the system for your failure.

       Could not agree any more.  There are certain aspects of modern life we can't avoid, bankers, war cabal, authoritarianism, etc.... but most choices we make only effect us.  Glad to see you're doing well for yourself.

       Exactly. There are no jobs available that give anyone a reason to get off welfare. Because wages have stagnated since the 1970s.

       Yea and the reason those people aren't making more is because of their choices not because their is no opportunity. There are massive shortages in many high paying fields, not just high aptitude fields like software either.
