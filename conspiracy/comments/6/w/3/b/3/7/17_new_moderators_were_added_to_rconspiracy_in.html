<p>Those aren&#39;t new moderators, man. Those are all the mods that got their powers back after the attempted hostile takeover last night.&quot;</p>

<p>Anybody else here notice the time when this sub had a sudden shift from SUPER pro-trump to anti trump?</p>

<p>I mean it was about as dramatic a shift as possible. It all started when 3 mods stickied a post about Trump being a Rothschild. It all went down hill since</p>

<p>No surprise. Its what leftists do. They cant stand the thought of Trump being supported so they weaseled their way in and took over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best comment in this discussion thus far. This is exactly what is being requested by a wave of new users who utilize labels and name-calling in lieu of open, sourced discussion. </p>

<p>We are dealing with people who want this topic (conspiracy) to be non political, &quot;fun&quot; , light. They want easy stories with simple 144 character resolutions. The reality, the darkness that exists in front of our faces,  it&#39;s either too much for people to wrap their minds around or the discussion of it, the analysis of it is against the interest of those powerful enough to generate this kind of upheaval.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy has always been about politics in some form or fashion, but it&#39;s only recently that it&#39;s turned into the political shit show that it is.  I had no problem with it before, now it&#39;s just every little thing is turned into red vs blue and immediately upvoted/downvoted based on party affiliation rather than the actual merits of the discussion.  You used to be able to make a remark about the President or other political figures without being descended upon by droves of apologists who are more than willing to excuse anything and everything they can to deify their beloved party. (at least in regards to conspiracy theory)  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about squelching open discussion, because this type of two-party spiteful politics is <strong>anything but</strong> an open discussion.  I&#39;m just tired of seeing literally everything become a political debate with clearly defined allegiances.  It seems we here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have forgotten that <strong>all sides</strong> of our political spectrum are corrupt and are all designed to herd us into nice little corners where we can be validated by our peers regardless of the content of our speech.  Want some upvotes?  Just shit all over whatever Trump did today and watch as his opponents rush to your side, even if your argument is fundamentally flawed from the start.  </p>

<p>You can go on and on about safe spaces or whatever bullshit buzzwords you currently use in your political space, but it&#39;s you who wants to limit the discussion down to the same one side vs the other bullshit we&#39;re being groomed to accept.  So forgive me if I want to go back to talking about &#39;fun, light&#39; topics again, I&#39;m just tired of seeing the same &#39;Trump sucks/Trump rules&#39; talking points recycled over and over.</p>

<p>So, by all means, continue to ignore the greater conspiracy here in lieu of whatever self-validating political nonsense you want to spew instead.  God forbid I ask that this sub go back to its roots instead of becoming like every other sub on Reddit.  Much better for us to have the same two arguments again and again.</p>

<p>This is the part where I accuse you of being a shill from T_D or a Hillary apologist, because that&#39;s <strong>all</strong> we&#39;re allowed to talk about, apparently, without being accused of wanting a &#39;safe space.&#39;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Couple of reasons for this which are perfectly valid:</p>

<p>1) The huge power struggle among elites going on right now and related spin off conspiracies like Pizzagate. What conspiracy forum wouldn&#39;t be immersed in these topics? Why would anyone post about bullshit like Bigfoot and little green men when Pizzagate is breaking?</p>

<p>2) The emergence of armies of paid shills which the mods here and of course admins refuse to address and instead prevent users from fighting back against (rule 10)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To reiterate:  I have no issue with politics being a part of conspiracy, I&#39;m mostly complaining that the mainstream two-party divisive side of politics has compromised what was once a more united stance against government corruption.  The moment things start becoming about who voted for who and what party affiliation you have, you are guaranteed to have a majority of people taking sides based on that rather than having an honest and open discussion.  There&#39;s undoubtedly a lot of corruption in our government, though I would argue that this is an entirely bipartisan effort.  I just see the current political temperature as a result of a broader conspiracy (one intended to divide us into more manageable groups while diverting our attention from real injustices) rather than an organic response from the population.  It just seems too manufactured to me, and I think it&#39;s been building up to this point for a while with Trump and his controversial behavior being the culmination of that.  The fact that these national outcries are more and more turning to indefensible concepts (racism, sexism, homophobia) is an indication of this.</p>

<p>I think Pizzagate is a perfect example of a smokescreen designed to drive a wedge between parties while also planting a seed of ridicule and contempt for conspiracy theory overall.  I&#39;m not disputing that there&#39;s a ring of elites who think of us normal folks as an inferior slave class and have no moral hangups about using us and our children as sex slaves or any other form of entertainment they like.  The pizzagate theory might have got a few things right, but most of us will never know because of all of the misinformation that has been associated with it.  Also, I think the way Pizzagate became entirely about one candidate/party is a major red flag and really the only reason Pizzagate ever made it out of conspiracy forums.  Whatever the truth is, Pizzagate isn&#39;t it, and is engineered specifically to lead us away from the truth.  There&#39;s a greater conspiracy to all of this, but it&#39;s pretty clear to me that the idea of &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; has been compromised.  All of this political bickering is evidence of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is the only conspiracy to have produced such a panicked reaction from TPTB - not even 9/11 truthers saw such a censorship effort.</p>

<p>To me, pizzagate, due to the abundance of evidence is a litmus test for other conspiracy theorists I engage with. If you have actually looked at all the evidence produced by pizzagate and conclude there&#39;s not much to it, then either you aren&#39;t truly into conspiracy theory (which is fine - most perfectly good people are MSM indulgers) or you&#39;re paid opposition.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t see how someone could be convinced of Sandy Hook / 9/11 / JFK conspiracies and then <em>not</em> be convinced of Pizzagate, when there is so much more evidence for Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said Pizzagate was completely wrong, just that it&#39;s been compromised by the media and is being used as a catalyst for lots of conspiracy-theory fearmongering and disinformation.  As I said in my earlier comment, there is <em>certainly</em> a gang of elite criminals who are above the law and regularly participate in activities any normal person would find disgusting.  People who are powerful enough to ensure that something like Pizzagate never gets coverage from any reputable news source.  The fact that the media is reporting on and openly mocking Pizzagate tells me that it is either entirely fabricated from the start, (unlikely) has some truth to it but the details are being obscured by misinformation, (more likely) or the pizza place in question has been completely scrubbed clean and there will be nothing to find and no connections to be made once (if) there actually is an investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intent of conspiracy discussion isn&#39;t supposed to be &quot;fun&quot; . Much of it is painfully opposite. And there are no conspiracies worthy of debate not rooted in politics. I&#39;ve said this one thousand times. Political awareness and neutrality are imperative to decoding the world around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree.  The point I&#39;m trying to make is that the government is corrupt regardless of what party is in power or who is President.  When we turn this sub into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, we limit our topics down to the same two-sided debate you have everywhere else on the internet.  It&#39;s pretty clear that we are being divided more and more every day, and it&#39;s increasingly more and more about race and religion.  If anything, this type of political environment limits our political awareness, because politics has become less and less about a debate and more about vilifying the other viewpoints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It went pro trump <em>way</em> before then, in the late stages of the election after Trump had gotten the primary.  Obvious spamming of partisan crap that got less and less based on evidence, and then less and less effort.  We now have a bit of an issue of incredibly low-effort spam on talking points, much of which is debunked by the actual sources.  I think a lot of anti-trump posting was a natural reaction by people who normally wouldn&#39;t have commented that way (because they didn&#39;t previously have the posts to need to disagree with or refute).</p>

<p>&quot;Dealing with creq and username_13 since Trump won the election has been exhausting. Every time some /politics shill would start shitting on people and get banned they would start crying foul play while <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> devolved into something where /politics users turn every comments section into a graveyard and circlejerk each other about Trump and Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People keep repeating that here (I wonder why), but it&#39;s really not true at this point. The vast majority of mainstream media sources are openly hostile towards President Trump. The programming on CNN, for example, is nearly 24/7 anti-Trump propaganda. Likewise, all of the major subreddits are nearly wall-to-wall anti-Trump propaganda.  </p>

<p>Whether you agree with his direction or not, it is very clear that President Trump is going against the grain of the mainstream. ShareBlue has made it part of their strategy to repeat the meme that Trump is <strong>The Evil Mainstream Establishment</strong> as much as possible in this forum. They obviously determined that this was the best wedge with which to divide conspiracy-minded people. I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you are a useful idiot parroting their propaganda.  </p>

<p>Even if you think I&#39;m way off, remember that we are all still speculating until new information emerges. When practically every subreddit other than <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is vehemently anti-Trump, why is it so bad to have even one moderator to balance things out here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  No no no.  Fox has more news viewers than anyone, they are literally the mainstream and they are VERY pro trump.  And yes the rest pick on him, but it&#39;s because if all his blunders and gaffs.  He seems to forget we live in the information age, not the 50s any more.  People can easily fact check him bow, but he doesn&#39;t seem to know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on. It&#39;s a shame your comment is so far down this thread. It&#39;s really a strange thing that happened to this sub. This narrative you&#39;re pointing out should be so obvious to anyone who takes even a minute to think about it. Conspiracy theorists supported Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc etc. You may disagree that several or all of these politicians are anti-establishment, but they have all marketed themselves as anti-establishment, therefore conspiracy theorists tend to support them. It&#39;s no different with Trump, and the fact that the media, the entire Democratic party, and the Intelligence community all hate Trump means that conspiracy theorists will tend to support him. I&#39;m sure 90 percent of the people in this sub pushing this narrative don&#39;t actually believe it. They are not actually surprised that some conspiracy theorists support Trump. It&#39;s just a convenient argument that works. When there is a Democrat in office in a few years, they will be arguing that &quot;anti-establishment&quot; people are nutjobs. </p>

<p>Another tactic they use is calling you a Trump supporter if you call out their bullshit. I really wish we had more outspoken independent people in here. Then they wouldn&#39;t be able to argue that you are probably a Trump supporter because you don&#39;t buy into their narrative. They&#39;ve gotten people scared of speaking out because you&#39;ll be drowning in downvotes. Don&#39;t worry about the votes, just speak your mind. </p>

<p>a group of mods got together and decided they  wanted to dethrone the head moderator.  When this failed, flytape responded by banning the mods that attempted it.

<p>Just an observation but I would say people on the far right side of the political spectrum don&#39;t fit in well with the conspiracy community. They are far too into the authoritarian mindset. They general support the police, the military, and the status quo.</p>

<p>Make no mistake they are part of a conspiracy community but the sole reason for that community is to smear their political rivals. </p>

<p>Having that toxic mindset represented in the moderator staff brought in center and left leaning skeptics to push back against those politically motivated smears. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When was it ever &quot;safe&quot;?    It&#39;s always been the wild west even if it was a shit load less partisan than it is since some of the tin foil hats took on AJ and Trump as their saviors.</p>

<p>We are getting closer to the point of critical mass,   the tipping point where the majority of Americans want real change,  in other words,  we have to get through this disinfo cointelpro stage of identity politics and unify against central control by the oligarchs.   How could Trump not be a fucking oligarch.    The main thing is that r/conspiracy had too many people putting faith in Trump.    And then the establishment hates Trump.    But at this point the deep state has Trump and antifa where they want them.   The deep state is winning round two here,  and we all need to grow up,  and we will eventually,  but there will be casualties.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>stop prasing your president blindly and stop thinking that everyone against him is a communist. If you blindly trust the president and the mods then this is not the sub for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were you directing this at me personally? If so then you are very mistaken about who I am and what I believe. Check my post history. I in no way blindly support anything, especially the president or the mods. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter by any means, but am frequently labeled as one because I don&#39;t shit on him hard enough for some people, or call out the shitty attempts of people trying to post non-issues or hit pieces from Salon.com or whatever. </p>

<p>And I have discussions with many of the mods here before, been here for 3 years. Based on all of my interactions with u/FlyTape, he seemed like any other r/conspiracy user that is fed up with what has happened here since the election, and was trying to do something about it.</p>

<p>Even if he was a T_D mod (which I was unaware of, is there proof of that?), he still wasn&#39;t a blowhard Trump supporter that thinks everything the president says is fantastic and he can do no wrong. </p>

<p>That being said, if there&#39;s proof that he was a mod there, then it&#39;s probably best he was removed as a mod here. Just as long as any mod here that also is a mod at r/news, r/politics, or any of the countless anti-Trump subs that keep popping up everyday go with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of assumed that you where from T_D just based of you defending the mod, who is from T_D. He is still posting stuff there as far as I saw. Sorry if I lumped you in with a group you are not apart of, I am just getting really annoyed with many of them who are assholes, and resort to name calling if you don&#39;t blindly follow trump. I don&#39;t know if he is still a mod there but I believe that at some point he was a mod, and I am unsure how to check on my cell.</p>
