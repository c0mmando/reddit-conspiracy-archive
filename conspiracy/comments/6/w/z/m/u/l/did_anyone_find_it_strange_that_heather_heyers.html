She should have called out the nazi that ran her over and focused on the hateful nazis that are magically everyone.  Usually the media hammers on the killer, what music he liked, what movies and games he watched, BUT this time was different.  No news on the 2 cops, helicopter crashed, no media on the killer himself, and more of a focus on lumping these &#39;hate groups&#39; with the murder and just saying, &quot;OH you think this way or agree with this, now you&#39;re a murderous nazi supporter now&quot;.  VERY bizarre and suspicious. </p>

Disgusting that MTV shoved this grieving mother in front of the camera and really disgusting that the mother was more concerned about making her daughter&#39;s death a political point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch the VMAs because MTV is complete shit.  The music is shit, the programming is shit and the movies they give these stupid awards to are also shit.  I suppose it was entertaining when they were a sort of pop culture spoof version of the Oscars or whatever, but presently they take themselves way too seriously.  This might have been a jump the shark moment for the VMAs.</p>

<p>I hope it was because they are just idiotic and need to go away.</p>

<p>And to answer that, I&#39;m not really sure. The system wants us divided and fighting in the streets, giving the real problems a pass...problem is, neo-fascists are tools of the totalitarian/corporate state urge that thrives on divisiveness and identity politics (neo-nazis are the far right&#39;s identity politics taken to the extreme), and while I don&#39;t believe Trump tried to do this, they have become emboldened by his rhetoric and all the policy overlap, gushing support for aggressive and militarized police, as well as the deterioration of reality and facts he has weaponized from the start. I think everyone has their definition of what &quot;the system&quot; is and what facets need to be confronted. </p>

<p>But someone as experienced as you is certainly all the wiser to the fact that the chance of the very small number of neo nazis in America rallying in your town is very slim, right? So as the line of logic would go, it&#39;s fair to assume that &quot;the system&quot; is largely responsible for the psy-op right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What ordinary mother would get up in front of millions of viewers and grandstand about her daughter&#39;s death FIFTEEN DAYS after it happened? </p>

<p>The memorial was 4 days after Heather&#39;s death. That&#39;s pretty efficient organising. Her mother was grandstanding at this event too. Who uses a memorial to promote slogans  (&quot;&quot;If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention&quot;)? </p>

<p>The funeral was (I&#39;m guessing) the day before- 3 days after the death! Would the coroner be done with the body in this timeframe? Does Charlottesville (30,000 people) even have its own coroner, or would the coroner have to make a trip from a larger city?</p>

<p>I have to wonder if anyone even died! In the context of recent public opinion-shaping events, we are entitled to question everything. Sandy Hook, the Bataclan, Pulse nightclub, San Bernardino- all are surrounded by unanswered questions. In light of Charlottesville being exposed as a thoroughly contrived event, with KKK and Antifa arriving on the same bus, and the car used in the attack not matching the description of the &quot;driver&#39;s&quot; car, any part of the official story may be considered a lie and a fabrication.</p>

<p>Disregarding the lying, deceiving MSM and this unrealistic woman claiming to be a grieving mother there&#39;s no evidence anybody died because of that Charlottesvile car incident.
