        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of the establishment &quot;Music&quot; is so ugly, boring and stuck to a few tunes and all of them just look the same, and they are all about sex, satan and other degeneracy stuff. They look like they have no soul and no personality, yet they are somehow in the top charts.</p>

<p>This is all the while when i listen to some of the less mainstream songs/music (And even video game/arcade music) and they are among the most beautiful music that i had ever heard. They are so creative and actually ARE music. The contrast is so astounding. Unfortunately, not every person knows about these indie/video-game music because they are NOT top chart.</p>

<p>Now i really cannot stand mainstream music for more than 1 minute. Seriously.</p>

<p>What is causing this contrast? Is it a proof that people are sellingtheir soul and talent for fame? Or is it by design? discuss.</p>

Punk rock was the first genre of music i got into on my own in my youth.  I&#39;ve always looked up to Bad Religion of pioneers of the genre.  Imagine my fucking shock last year when i came across this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/SATFD">https://archive.is/SATFD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/RtQ0F">https://archive.is/RtQ0F</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A fucking band that has presented itself as an Anti-Establishment/anti-government for decades - then you find out one of the members goes to art shows with James Alefantis &amp; Tony Podesta.  Why was Brian Bakker of bad religion there?  Because his wife started TransformerDC with Alefantis.  I&#39;m convinced almost every aspect of our society is fake at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ended up redpilling myself on this after Fat Mike/Bad Religion/etc started publicly supporting dems last year.  I saw bad religion &amp; against me play last year &amp; purchased a shirt with trump &amp; hillary&#39;s face on it that had a checkbox that said &quot;none of the above&quot;... Then a few weeks later Bad Religion members are talking about missing the Obama presidency &amp; supporting Hillary.  Felt robbed knowing one of my favorite bands socializes with powerful lobbyists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re finding the negative message in OPs post that you are looking for. He didn&#39;t post which genres or artists he considers bad or good and not everything falls under personal preference. </p>

<p>Reason i quit my last job was due to a few reasons but the music; that i really couldn&#39;t stand. Similar sort of music that you find in all retail stores really. It gives off a constant pervasive atmosphere of &quot;pay no attention, believe what you are told, everything is good, say yes to everything&quot;.</p>

<p>If it was personal preference in such a consumer environment then why do i never find classical, heavy metal or blues in retail stores. It&#39;s almost like these genres of music leave you either feeling critically minded or not materialistically inclined. Not the state of mind where you&#39;re compelled to give in to that excellent, wonderful 3 for 2 offer of coloured sugar in a bag.</p>

<p>Other thing i noticed was that all of this music stuck in your head so easily. I listen to music in almost all my spare time, mostly classical with some metal and trance/house and none of it sticks in my head unless i try to remember it and i have to try.
The other stuff from work got stuck in your head like a fly on a sundew.</p>

<p>I prefer a select few genres whilst respecting all that have occured naturally but there seems to be music spat out of an industry with little emotion and plenty of agenda, i find it horrible to listen to.</p>

<p>&quot;The term culture industry (German: Kulturindustrie) was coined by the critical theorists Theodor Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter &quot;The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception&quot;, of the book Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944), wherein they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—films, radio programmes, magazines, etc.—that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity.[1] Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the mass communications media, renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their economic circumstances.[1] The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer especially perceived mass-produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts.&quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve learned is, people don&#39;t (really) listen to the &quot;music&quot;. When a fucking stupid pop song is on the radio that I&#39;m forced to listen to, I&#39;ll make a remark and it&#39;s always the same answer: &quot;Huh, I didn&#39;t hear/listen to it&quot;. So why is it even running? I dunno. You could make them listen to white noise. It doesn&#39;t matter. Or maybe the get dopamine filled when after 8 hours &quot;their&quot; song is played that they like.</p>

<p>I really wanted to dig deeper why people do this and don&#39;t just turn it off but I got no answer when asked. Tbh, at this point, I think there&#39;s none. They listen to it, because it&#39;s pop and others are listening to it. The quality doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>Most of the people have no fucking clue about music. What exists, what they like and this in an age where the internet is in your pocket and you could have access to nearly every song out there.
Mind boggling, really...maybe the general public has no personal taste, just a curated one.</p>

<p>There are three things I am convinced are at play here and have some what seen this demonstrated in the professional world years ago, and im sure its on another level now...</p>

<p>1) Frequencies - There are many frequencies that a person cannot hear through the human ear. Just because you cannot hear these frequencies, does not mean they do not have an effect on your brain as well as your body. There are many frequencies that are pleasant to the human body and can cause feelings of pleasure. People get addicted to this feeling, quite easily, like an addiction to drugs. </p>

<p>2) Laziness/Business - People simply do not have the time to sit anymore and appreciate a piece of music for what it is or simply dont want to because there are so many things that surround us that take our focus away from actually sitting and listening.   People want a background noise and beat, thats really it, or something they can remember easily to sing along with or dance to.</p>

<p>3) Interference - Artists are rarely allowed to produce or write their own music now a days, usually its a team of people who will simply do this for the artist. Even respectable bands over the years will always decline in originality or even good song writing abilities, and you often wonder, why cant this artist just re create the magic of their first album? Why? Cause that first album was written most likely when they didnt have a record deal and didnt have anyone in the studio saying, this part doesnt work, you should do this instead, or change these lyrics, i think this hook i have here would work instead of yours.....and if you argue this that song aint gonne be on the album but rather a b side. </p>

<p>Its really unfortunate what has become of the state of music in recent years, and i hope people take their heads outta the sand one day, but doesnt seem like its gonna happen.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference in which i was able to speak to a technological guru, lets just say hes pretty big and well known, i asked him about how he felt AI was gonna enter the music industry and was taken aback by the question, presumably because the conference had nothing to do with entertainment, but he looked me straight in the eye and said thats a really good question, cause its already there......</p>

<p>There is so much great music out there free for the asking. What we lack now are Tastemakers and Guideposts. We need a new John Peel or Rodney Bingenheimer. Hell, even a new fucking Martha Quinn would be welcome at this point!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music has many styles often very niche, so a small audience (possible customers). When a band from a certain niche has bigger success it is because it is washed down so that more people than the niche-fans can enjoy it and buy it. From that standpoint (making the most money with music) you have to create something the most people can like/accept, basically maximum washed down, not unique/special, the rest will be achieved through marketing.</p>
