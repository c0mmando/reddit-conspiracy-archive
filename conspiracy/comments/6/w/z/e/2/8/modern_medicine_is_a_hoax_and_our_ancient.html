        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Language is not just a form of communication, it is also a tool of mind control.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Medicine</strong></p>

<p>Of all topics for discussion, the medical industry is the most taboo. After all, nobody wants to hear the gruesome details of vaccination, chemotherapy or ultrasound.</p>

<p>So perhaps a new approach is needed, maybe we can understand the medical industry, without having to learn of the individual problems with each procedure.</p>

<p>The following are a series of words and phrases that are used by and for medical professionals: when analysed and decoded, they reveal the hidden reality of &#39;modern medicine&#39;. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Doctor</strong></p>

<p>Verb: <em>To manipulate or forge.</em></p>

<p>If doctors are the &#39;good guys&#39; then why do they call themselves by a verb associated with liars? The reason is simple, doctors are not honest.</p>

<p><strong>Patient</strong></p>

<p><em>Please be patient.</em></p>

<p>When you go for a meeting and the other person is running late, they might call you and say &#39;please be patient&#39;.</p>

<p>This is because they are harming you (by not being on time) and want you to be compliant.</p>

<p>So if the medical professional is supposedly trying to help the person who is sick, why do we call them a &#39;patient&#39;. You already know the answer.</p>

<p><strong>If you would like to read more, please visit the full article on my <a href="http://deepconspiracies.blogspot.co.uk">blog</a>. I break down the meaning behind phrases like &#39;Pharmaceutical industry&#39;, &#39;Operating Theatre&#39; and &#39;Hippocratic Oath&#39;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Not only vaccination, but ALL non-emergency medical care is harmful...</p>

<p>There are other examples of terminology revealing the truth, can you find them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a very good troll, but I&#39;ll bite. It&#39;s not a matter of whether or not it&#39;s &quot;left to chance&quot;, the issue is that language is somethung that has developed along with our species over the past several hundred thousand years. There are designed languages, but natural languages do indeed evolve according to principles of natural selection and &#39;speciation&#39;, and we know this because we can observe it. We can see how it&#39;s happened in the past, and how it&#39;s continuing to happen now. Also, Mandarin is the most used language, not English. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing &#39;evolves&#39;. There is a reason why teachers are forced to promote this idea in school, they want to distract us from how the world really works.</p>

<p>All of our major institutions involve top-down control. Children obey their parents, patients obey doctors, and we obey the government.</p>

<p>Evolution is a religion, it&#39;s purpose is to promote the (false) idea that our world is random.</p>

<p>The same ruling elite who gave us TV and the internet, also invented the printing press. They have had control of our language since day one. </p>

<p>This is why english is filled with numerous inconsistencies (Google is pronounced as &#39;Goo-gel&#39; instead of &#39;Goo-gle&#39;) it is designed to confuse us.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that our history is thousands of years, it is probably only a few hundred years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That argument doesn&#39;t make sense, as the inconsistencies in English spelling are specific to English. Most world languages with phonetic writing are spelled exactly how they&#39;re pronounced. Also, &quot;google&quot; is a bad example - most English words ending in a consonant plus &quot;le&quot; have no vowel on the end. This isn&#39;t confusing at all, and actually spelling it &quot;el&quot; would be no more accurate since there&quot;s no vowel between the /g/ and the /l/. The word is pronounced /gugl/. As for your argument about nothing evolving, how can that be true when we can witness linguistic evolution occur right now. Take a look at the caught/cot merger, for instance.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s just a coincidence that Yaws and Malaria have been eliminated from many places after we introduced antibiotics? It&#39;s just a coincidence that my last strep infection went away after being on antibiotics for a few days? How about my last ear infection? You are a straight up lunatic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ought to do a ride-along with a paramedic rig.  Hell, I&#39;d invite you along on mine if you promised to keep your mouth shut.  Watch us use some of those &quot;toxic demon drugs&quot; to save some lives.  </p>

<p>One of the most dramatic drugs you can watch work is Narcan, which blocks those fake opioid receptors that you don&#39;t believe in.  Patient starts out, by any meaningful measure, dying from an opiate overdose: guy is nonresponsive, won&#39;t breathe on his own.  Pop in .02 to .04 mg of Narcan, watch patient wake up, definitely breathing spontaneously because he&#39;s able to bitch at you for ruining his high.  Magic.  (Extra points if he starts projection vomiting because you effectively forced him into withdrawals.)  Emergency care is most often for emergent <em>medical</em> problems; we don&#39;t see as much trauma/injury as TV wants you to think. </p>

<p>God forbid you ever need us, but if you do, I or someone like me may save your life.  And we will do anything within our power, knowledge, and ability to do so.  You wouldn&#39;t believe the lengths we&#39;ll go to, the horrible things risks we&#39;ll take to our own bodies and emotions, to make sure that you can get back on the Talking-Shit-About-Medicine Train.  The least you can do is show the field a little respect, and realize that it&#39;s okay that you don&#39;t understand medicine, because we do.</p>

<p>This was an investigation into the fraudulent attempt by the WHO/CDC to claim that the DNA fragments in the HPV vaccine had been safety tested.</p>

<p>The following is the headline conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion these emails clearly demonstrate that this group of WHO officials and government employees... knew before the... Tokyo public hearing that one of their own experts showed scientific evidence that HPV vaccination does increase cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), particularly at the injection site compared to other vaccines. <strong>Yet, they chose to suppress this information at the public hearing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is an interesting read, it includes:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A scientist using a paper on protein fragments to mislead policy makers on the DNA content of vaccines (page 2) </p></li>
<li><p>Papers being written by unknown ghost writers (page 4)</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the &#39;WHO experts&#39; were essentially just online bloggers (page 6)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>DNA has never been proven to exist by the way, but that is beside the point. This is an official case of acknowledge misconduct by researchers.</p>

<p>Other examples of deception are ideas like &#39;smoking is healthy&#39;, &#39;alcohol is good for you&#39; etc.</p>

<li><p>Wrong.  What makes you assume bacteria?  Or saliva?  Have you ever looked under a microscope?  It&#39;s super easy to view individual animal cells using light microscopes.</p></li>

So, you believe scientists/researchers are liars and that the WHO backs up your claim.  Let me ask - did they investigate every scientist and researcher on earth?  The investigation only focuses on a few individuals who were caught lying, right?  The only logical conclusion you can draw from it is &quot;the individuals who were caught lying are definitely liars, other researchers might lie but there is no way to know without more information.&quot;  There simply isn&#39;t justification for the way you&#39;re casually dismissing centuries of work from researchers around the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Doctors DO NOT recommend that about alcohol.  You are getting your information from a bad source because that is totally untrue.

The cigarette thing is true but that&#39;s because modern medicine is hardly comparable to 1950s medicine, we didn&#39;t know shit back then compared to now.</p></li>
