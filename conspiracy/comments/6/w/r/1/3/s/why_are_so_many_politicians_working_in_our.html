       Obviously we lack term limits, encourage corruption...
But what's the motivation?  Most if not all of these people have secured their lifestyles.  Their political careers guarantee the things that most Americans are desperate for: $$, pensions, healthcare, etc.
       <br/>
       what's the motivation to keep people with a brain tumors, or who can not remember the current presidents name on board? Couldn't a younger generation of corruption be bred?  Wouldn't that be more effective -to mislead the public with people who are more on the pulse with society? 
Why do Americans accept this when age discrimination is so rampant in the rest of our society ?

       Actually compared to any other politician, he's been remarkably consistent and has been very good with keeping his campaign promises to the best of his ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not so sure what he's 'full of shit' on, I'd argue that he's
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       honest for people nowadays who are used to being lied to. Rather, he drops hard truths on them and suffers the consequences and blowback of being too direct.

       oh jees I mean I liked his free wheeling style too, as it seemed different than the canned responses of most politicians.
       <br/>
       But on every issue, he's completely reversed himself. Do you really think he's sincere about the Wall? About starting a trade war with China? Even if he convinced himself at the time, he's just an old rich dude. He doesn't care about working people. He cares about himself.
       <br/>
       You think he's going to unite the country and drain the swamp? Why is he deliberately antagonizing the liberal majority? Withdraw from the middle east? He's signed off on the Pentagon's plan of endless war. He's a buffoon and a con.

       So no, you don't have any real reason to say he's full of shit.  You're just posing questions too numerous for me to reasonably answer in hopes that I'll agree with you....
      </p>
      <p>
       He's delivered so far. You're trying to discredit him on the future, which hasn't happened yet. There's so much hyperbole in your response that I honestly can't take it seriously. If you want to zero in on a single issue and have that discussion, that might be more productive than hyperbolic questions and assumptions about the future.

       I assume you think Trump's policy reversal on Afghanistan is perfectly acceptable.
       <br/>
       "During the presidential campaign, some became convinced that Trump would not be an interventionist president. His tweets about Afghanistan were one of the reasons. In January of 2013, he tweeted, “Let’s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.” Now, we see a president who carries on the interventionist tradition of US Empire."

        like

       what's going on in Afghanistan, but obviously his military leaders have given him information that he wasn't privy to during the campaign. Such is the exclusivity of the commander in chief.

       You just listed a bunch of stuff, you didn't explain anything. Trump never supported socialist healthcare, he's stonewalled by congress on the wall and threatened to shut down the govt over it, he's been in office for a few months so I don't see how he's out-vacationing Obama, and I'm not sure what you mean by 'Afghanistan, Syria'. Details.

       Trump campaigned on NOT vacationing like Obama. He is on track to outspend Obama on vacations 3x, and 4x the time. This is only in his first year BTW.

       He also didn't know then what he knows now. Obama did the same thing. You hope that you can pull out, but you can't control events of the future.

      <p>
       The vacationing thing I can't really speak to, because all presidents work while on 'vacation'. It's not really a job you can walk away from. You may be displeased from where he conducts his business, but that just is what it is.

       If you paid attention to him, you'd understand that the tax payers obviously pay for the wall and the deficit from which Mexico profits from the U.S. is closed by other policy. It's essentially a displacement program.

       BTW, every time Trump takes the White House to his property, he pockets all that cash. He is making a fortune from the office. This is perhaps the biggest red flag that he doesn't give a shit about you. If he cared about taxpayer money, he wouldn't be forcing the government to spend upwards of 100k a day for his vacations. 100k a day that goes directly into his pocket.

       2016 we had a trade deficit with Mexico of $65 billion. If imports are taxed at 20%, as per Trump's plan, that's an additional $13 billion which is well under what it would cost to build the wall. ;)

        t costs roughly $200,000 an hour to fly Air Force One, the modified Boeing 747 that the president typically travels on. There's also the cost of flying the presidential limousine or SUV to Trump's destination ahead of time so he can be whisked away when he lands.
       </p>
       <p>
        With heightened security requirements now that Trump is president, Bedminster has estimated that it could spend $12,000 per day on his visits, and up to $300,000 over the course of the summer.

       Yes I am prepared to pay more and cut back because if we want a stronger national economy, things will get slightly more expensive before they get better. Yes I do believe trade will remain consistent because our economies currently rely upon one another. Trumps attempt is certainly underhanded, but it will definitely work for the time span he needs it to.

       My response is to call you a wackadoo for thinking he's personally profiting from security expenses. If that were the case, he wouldn't be the president. Your source is admittedly basing this on estimations. Your source also doesn't support the argument that you're making. You just blew the bottom out of your own argument.

       First of all he's divested himself from these companies in any capacity in which he profits. So there's the first part where you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part was that you initially said
       <em>
        "Trump pockets 100k a day"
       </em>
       which is entirely factually inaccurate.
      </p>

       Third, and this is a reiteration, the source you used, if
       <em>
        you

       read it, admits that all of these numbers are estimations and speculation.
      </p>

       You're a textbook opposition troll. Your whole purpose was to show up here, try to spin me as pro-establishment and take the conversation away from what the topic was about.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why your facts are bullshit, that's why you're lurking this sub, you're not trying to achieve a victory, you're just trying to waste my time and keep an actual discussion about this from happening. And the sad part is you're not even that good at it.

       I'm actually baffled at how resilient you are after being proven wrong multiple times. Which is why it's obvious now that your purpose isn't to win an argument, it's to waste time.

       You have yet to prove me wrong. In fact all we've done is talk past each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe "the law" prevents Trump from profiting from his businessess. I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think Trump has no choice but to increase participating in the ME, I vehemently disagree.

       You have called me a shill for not agreeing with you, I have done no such thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe in the future you should prevent yourself from throwing out accusations to kill arguments. I do find it funny that you accused me of derailing your discussion when I pointed out promises he has not kept, and you deflected. You did the same thing.
      </p>

       Notice how I still haven't called you a shill? People can disagree about things and not be paid. Crazy, huh?

       That's not antithetical to what he said at all. He's remained consistent. It's not the government's job to cover people's insurance and he's always carried that belief.

       I agree, every time I watch these senile, divisive war mongers with a lifetime worth of baggage being carried around into our affairs it makes me sick. We need some new people in congress that aren't completely subservient to corporations, AIPAC, Shadow Government, etc. Out with the old, in with the new.

       Along those same lines, you have to remember the Boomers aren't just a large portion of the population. They're also more likely to actually go out and vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       So of course the Boomers are going to continue to support the same people they always have, on both sides of the aisle.

       The person with the most dirt receives the corporate support, since they are easiest to control, and more predictable than a younger, less 'experienced' candidate.

       Based on surveys, there is a positive correlation between age and identifying as "Strong" democrats/republicans. Strong identifiers are more likely to vote in all elections, while those who don't identify as strong are tied to limited political activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also data that points to winning candidates also being "Strong" to their party resulting in higher age of election.
      </p>

       Data:

       Meanwhile the discrepancy between Republican and Democrat range is an anomaly in the Republican data. Before 1994, Republicans had the older congressman by almost 5 years. This age discrepancy lead to many new young candidates displacing the older congressmen and dropping the average age significantly. Meanwhile Democrat congressman age was more consistent and had average turnover so it did not change much. As a consequence Republican congressmen age has been increasing since the Bush era, and is only 1 year apart from Democrat age. It's predicted Republicans will overtake in age before repeating the cycle again.

       Part of the Dems' problem is that Obama himself showed very little interest in growing the party. Rather than working to find and groom new, young candidates he wanted to maintain a certain image as a non-partisan, non-divisive figure. When the face of the party sees himself as a singular figure rather than a party member you end up with a party that's worse off than before once he leaves center stage.

       Median age of congress has increased over the last 40 years, but guess what?  So has the median age of the population.  The highest levels of management in almost any organization are usually older because it takes time to work your way up to that level.  Most federal politicians start out in local politics and then run federally, and many Senators were representatives first.  All that takes time, so they are usually in at least their thirties or forties by the time they make it to DC.

       if you can find any example of politicians that got into politics only later in life ("at the end of human life span") then there might be something to this. Otherwise, my guess is that it takes many years (some may say a lifetime..) to rise through the powers of political life. People hate giving young people any type of power.

       This is also why you will see many more old TV presenters in the US than in Europe. Like look at 60 minutes, almost all old presenters, you'd never see this in most European countries.

       He's delivered so far. You're trying to discredit him on the future, which hasn't happened yet. There's so much hyperbole in your response that I honestly can't take it seriously. If you want to zero in on a single issue and have that discussion, that might be more productive than hyperbolic questions and assumptions about the future.

      <p>
       If you paid attention to him, you'd understand that the tax payers obviously pay for the wall and the deficit from which Mexico profits from the U.S. is closed by other policy. It's essentially a displacement program.
