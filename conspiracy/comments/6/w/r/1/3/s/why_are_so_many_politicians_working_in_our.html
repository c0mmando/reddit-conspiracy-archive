<p>Obviously we lack term limits, encourage corruption...
But what&#39;s the motivation?  Most if not all of these people have secured their lifestyles.  Their political careers guarantee the things that most Americans are desperate for: $$, pensions, healthcare, etc.<br/>
what&#39;s the motivation to keep people with a brain tumors, or who can not remember the current presidents name on board? Couldn&#39;t a younger generation of corruption be bred?  Wouldn&#39;t that be more effective -to mislead the public with people who are more on the pulse with society? 
Why do Americans accept this when age discrimination is so rampant in the rest of our society ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure what he&#39;s &#39;full of shit&#39; on, I&#39;d argue that he&#39;s <em>too</em> honest for people nowadays who are used to being lied to. Rather, he drops hard truths on them and suffers the consequences and blowback of being too direct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh jees I mean I liked his free wheeling style too, as it seemed different than the canned responses of most politicians.<br/>
But on every issue, he&#39;s completely reversed himself. Do you really think he&#39;s sincere about the Wall? About starting a trade war with China? Even if he convinced himself at the time, he&#39;s just an old rich dude. He doesn&#39;t care about working people. He cares about himself.<br/>
You think he&#39;s going to unite the country and drain the swamp? Why is he deliberately antagonizing the liberal majority? Withdraw from the middle east? He&#39;s signed off on the Pentagon&#39;s plan of endless war. He&#39;s a buffoon and a con.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you think Trump&#39;s policy reversal on Afghanistan is perfectly acceptable.<br/>
&quot;During the presidential campaign, some became convinced that Trump would not be an interventionist president. His tweets about Afghanistan were one of the reasons. In January of 2013, he tweeted, “Let’s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.” Now, we see a president who carries on the interventionist tradition of US Empire.&quot;<br/>

<p>Trump campaigned on getting out of Syria and Afghanistan. He was increased participation in both.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned on NOT vacationing like Obama. He is on track to outspend Obama on vacations 3x, and 4x the time. This is only in his first year BTW.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned on the wall, that Mexico will pay for it. He is now throwing a tantrum to get the American taxpayers to pay for it.</p>

<p>I followed Trump very closely and don&#39;t recall this. It isn&#39;t inline with his policy plan. Where&#39;s this quote from? Source?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He also didn&#39;t know then what he knows now. Obama did the same thing. You hope that you can pull out, but you can&#39;t control events of the future. </p>

<p>The vacationing thing I can&#39;t really speak to, because all presidents work while on &#39;vacation&#39;. It&#39;s not really a job you can walk away from. You may be displeased from where he conducts his business, but that just is what it is. </p>

<p>If you paid attention to him, you&#39;d understand that the tax payers obviously pay for the wall and the deficit from which Mexico profits from the U.S. is closed by other policy. It&#39;s essentially a displacement program. </p>

<p>None of this shows that Trump is &#39;full of shit&#39;.</p>

<p>BTW, every time Trump takes the White House to his property, he pockets all that cash. He is making a fortune from the office. This is perhaps the biggest red flag that he doesn&#39;t give a shit about you. If he cared about taxpayer money, he wouldn&#39;t be forcing the government to spend upwards of 100k a day for his vacations. 100k a day that goes directly into his pocket.</p>

<p>2016 we had a trade deficit with Mexico of $65 billion. If imports are taxed at 20%, as per Trump&#39;s plan, that&#39;s an additional $13 billion which is well under what it would cost to build the wall. ;) </p>

<p>t costs roughly $200,000 an hour to fly Air Force One, the modified Boeing 747 that the president typically travels on. There&#39;s also the cost of flying the presidential limousine or SUV to Trump&#39;s destination ahead of time so he can be whisked away when he lands.</p>

<p>With heightened security requirements now that Trump is president, Bedminster has estimated that it could spend $12,000 per day on his visits, and up to $300,000 over the course of the summer.</p>

<p>Yes I am prepared to pay more and cut back because if we want a stronger national economy, things will get slightly more expensive before they get better. Yes I do believe trade will remain consistent because our economies currently rely upon one another. Trumps attempt is certainly underhanded, but it will definitely work for the time span he needs it to.</p>

<p>Remember what I said. He pockets this money. He did not divest himself from his properties and his businessess. He pockets much more than 100k when he takes these trips. Which now, are every weekend.</p>

<p>He will pass Obama&#39;s 4yr total by 2 years at this pace. Your response?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused here. He owns these companies. He directly profits from the government paying him to secure the property.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on surveys, there is a positive correlation between age and identifying as &quot;Strong&quot; democrats/republicans. Strong identifiers are more likely to vote in all elections, while those who don&#39;t identify as strong are tied to limited political activity.</p>

<p>There is also data that points to winning candidates also being &quot;Strong&quot; to their party resulting in higher age of election.</p>

<p>Data: <a href="http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data">http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the discrepancy between Republican and Democrat range is an anomaly in the Republican data. Before 1994, Republicans had the older congressman by almost 5 years. This age discrepancy lead to many new young candidates displacing the older congressmen and dropping the average age significantly. Meanwhile Democrat congressman age was more consistent and had average turnover so it did not change much. As a consequence Republican congressmen age has been increasing since the Bush era, and is only 1 year apart from Democrat age. It&#39;s predicted Republicans will overtake in age before repeating the cycle again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Median age of congress has increased over the last 40 years, but guess what?  So has the median age of the population.  The highest levels of management in almost any organization are usually older because it takes time to work your way up to that level.  Most federal politicians start out in local politics and then run federally, and many Senators were representatives first.  All that takes time, so they are usually in at least their thirties or forties by the time they make it to DC. </p>

<p>That&#39;s okay though, I don&#39;t think he will last the year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and ole Maxine can keep praying but you need grounds upon which you can impeach a president. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His words during the campaign: &quot;You will keep your healthcare, we will make it better. Everyone will have healthcare&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I followed Trump very closely and don&#39;t recall this. It isn&#39;t inline with his policy plan. Where&#39;s this quote from? Source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump campaigned on getting out of Syria and Afghanistan. He has increased participation in both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also didn&#39;t know then what he knows now. Obama did the same thing. You hope that you can pull out, but you can&#39;t control events of the future. </p>

<p>The vacationing thing I can&#39;t really speak to, because all presidents work while on &#39;vacation&#39;. It&#39;s not really a job you can walk away from. You may be displeased from where he conducts his business, but that just is what it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump campaigned on the wall, that Mexico will pay for it. He is now throwing a tantrum to get the American taxpayers to pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you paid attention to him, you&#39;d understand that the tax payers obviously pay for the wall and the deficit from which Mexico profits from the U.S. is closed by other policy. It&#39;s essentially a displacement program. </p>

<p>None of this shows that Trump is &#39;full of shit&#39;.</p>
