       The Deep State, did they create AntiFa to enact the police state? These rallies(protests) are getting worse. Now Trump is doing this "Trump to reverse ban on local police using military equipment"

       The Police State is just one or two dead protesters away(and the left already have their martyr) from all out conflict with the government. Is this what they wanted?

       Peta, Code Pink, ELF, OWS (first to make you think something would be done, then to tar the movement itself). BLM, SJW, Political Correctness, Identity Politics, all manipulative names and fake groups to use for political attacks and there are more, can you think of some I missed?

       What do you make of Alex Jones? I have a pretty good source that says he is totally Mossad. Why would he do that to paranoid Gentiles? We have people that are scared shit-less about their future, and Jones feeds on that shit.

       Opposing Israel's horrendous treatment of the Palestinians is not anti-Semitic. If anything it's equating colonial fascism with all of Judaism that's anti-Semitic.

       Yes but will take much longer than you might think (if it happens). There will be a public trained to despise the growing hordes of unemployed as machines take over their jobs. They will not object when AI police force is sent in to put down violent protests. They will not object when the basic income high security camps are erected. They will not object to a world government, the pissing match of which is taking place right now to determine the pecking order and economic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what you want to hear? I don't believe it, but it's theoretically possible.

       Just look at the methods used to overthrow all the counties in the last 20 years.  Create a phony civil war. Don't worry about really selling it to the people of that country. The main audience it is sold to is the rest of the world. This allows them to justify foreign interference in a country. And would you look at that.

       I have always thought of them as controlled opposition. They are a prop used in order to give people to the left of the centrists-democrats a bad reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question. I do agree that they are financed by wealthy special interests. But I do not think that they exist to enact some sort of police state. Imo they exist in order to paint anyone left of the neo-liberal "Third Way" Democrats as radicals.

       The players in Antifa were bought and paid for before the election... they were supposed to go out on election night and simulate angry Trump voters... but by some miracle he won... and they still went out and smashed stuff so it made no sense for a couple weeks... then rebranded Disrupt J20 or whatever to fuck up inauguration... and kinda failed at that... so then they rebranded them as Antifa and send em out to whip up trouble fighting "fascists".

       Lol... they have not been quiet. You could watch them at EVERY demonstration being 'Anti' and violent in europe.

      <p>
       I am sure it feels more sensational to think the big bad deep state paid those people to distract from recent events. But if you just do a LITTLE bit of research you will see that those left wing radicals are neither a recent group nor have they been inactive over the last decades.

      <p>
       If you are looking for a conspiracy you might find a better one in why they are suddenly on the media everywhere... maybe the media are trying to distract. But those radical antifa nutjobs sure as hell have been there all the time.

       Well damn right those fucking liberals weren't burning the cities so they had to create a group to act up,  and it is identical to the group of anarchists  the same dirty ops group used  to shut down protests for the G20 meetings.  Imagine that.

       Cops don't need excuses to shut down protests, especially when wealth is on the line. Stop blaming the victims and oppose the police. Even if antifa is some sort of four dimensional deep state chess piece (hint: it's not) it'd be more effective to just diffuse the police state's propaganda. If the masses of people weren't primed to fear socialists and protestors an antifa false flag wouldn't have any impact.

       My point, every day, about the violence at these protests and demonstrations is that the violence is a deliberate and planned and paid for operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes there is an agenda and the agenda is to generate public support to pass laws outlawing public protests and demonstrations.

       Yes, violence at protests and demonstrations is deliberate and planned.  By the cops.  There is an agenda to outlaw protest and demonstration.  Its the pro police agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa is a red herring here, not just because the narrative of them being constantly violant is caused by media manipulation, but because that same sort of false, protestor blaming narrative happens every time there's a protest movement in the streets against the establishment.  Same things been done to BLM, to Occupy, to everyone before, because when police instigate violence against the left the media blames the left.

       The CIA will fund and arm extremists on both sides. They don't care who. Nutcases who normally don't get anywhere cause to 98% of the population they are insignificant, irrelevant, and repulsive, with the objective being for them cause chaos. Chaos which will allow the majority of people to accept curtailing of their freedoms and the centralization of power to stop the chaos, the chaos giving cover to remove and marginalize people who legitimately oppose such actions, and maybe a junta to stop the chaos the extremists have caused.

       I like the way you re-name the Civil War. It's a better name and really puts it back into perspective. We've forgotten the real reason the war was started and have had 'slavery' supplanted as the reason and shoved in our faces. This is also the reason that TPTB want confederate statues and icons removed.

       Thanks, it is the name the south called it. It is the way the they felt at the time, the aggressors(North) were taxing and regulating them into poverty. It did have some to do with slavery, but mostly not. Mostly it was about states, to have the right, to make their own laws, hence "states rights" became the term of the time. I believe that term will resurface if Sessions continues his war on pot. I also surmise that was the deep state plan along, why else would a deep south senator attach himself to a long shot northern candidate from the get go?

       They run ads in the local paper for protesters for the left.  Paying people to protest and not for their beliefs is hypocrisy.  Some are real protesters, but not all.  To shout No More Hate and attack violently anyone they suspect supports Trump, is a crime.  It's assault.

       imo, they(Deep state) want strife, anything to enact a crackdown on the public. The 1st and 2nd amendment is a illusion of safety, it will be the 1st to go.. All in the name of public safety.

       I've been saying this for a while. Govt creates a problem so they can enact the solution that they want to have in place anyway. Want to get rid of guns? Fake a school shooting. Want militarized police to be able to do whatever they want? Create a fake group that is violent as fuck to create strife.

       He meant that the world would stay at war, there in major $$ in war. There is zero $$ in peace if you make bombs, tanks, plane ect.. However, America is weary of war over seas, so they need to bring it home so to say..

       They didn't create it, but they definitely fund it and support it through the media.  How many times did we hear "punch a nazi" over the last year, until finally the chance to do so just happened to materialize in Charlottesville?

       Charlottesville, imo, was a attempt at irony by the Deep state. Why not start the 2nd civil war, remove our rights, and oppress the right, in one of the places that our "rights" were created..

       There are many that believe the "Deep state" was responsible for Lincoln's assassination. Ergo the Deep state has been around for over 160+ years. It is well know a shadow type government runs the US, not they elected talking heads..
