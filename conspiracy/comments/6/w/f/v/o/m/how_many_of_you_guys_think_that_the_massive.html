       Seems like the American public has totally forgotten how much we hate the establishment and are pretty focused on hating each other at this point.  Once hated and vile politicians are becoming acceptable because they repudiate racism.  Just seems like a complete red herring at an all too convenient time.

       Agreed. Even if you go back to the 90s, Usenet groups were horrible for it. I remember trying to download (pictures) on a 42kb modem and it turning out to be some skinhead BS propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you hit the wrong group and it was full of hate speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early 90s there was a rash of Klan marches. Turned out to be a couple of guys wearing sheets. In one town, there was 1 man wearing the sheets marching down the street by himself surrounded by journalists and people making fun of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, let's not forget the rash of white supremacists they found on army bases, they used the office computers and printers to create hate speech newsletters and emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there were still lots of real attacks though. Horrible racist attacks. One man dragged behind a pickup truck, it was all over the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the incidents of hate/racial attacks are still less than just regular old crime.

       I have seen it.  I mean just go check the comment section of any youtube video.  Shit really started to get bad during the campaign when there were just bots spamming political shit on all sides.  Now you see the same exact technique being used but the bots are spamming either white racism or anti white racism.  Giant Swastikas...  so forth.  Sure some if it is probably edgy kids, and that has always been a factor.  But there has been an extremely big boost in racism, particularly spam style stuff.

       Part edgy kids, part SJW fatigue. Actual racism was so far gone, they start making up "microagressions" and other nonsense. People just shrug and give up: "guess I'm racist for simply existing".

       TPTB are using ALL of us - regardless of race, religion, gender, etc.  We are ALL nothing but objects to them - useful only to the extent we help them reach their goals - in this case, by division.

       I hate to break it to you but the racism thing has been going on for a long time, both as actual murderous hatred and a method of control.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In spite of such preconceptions about blackness, in spite of special subordination of blacks in the Americas in the seventeenth century, there is evidence that where whites and blacks found themselves with common problems, common work, common enemy in their master, they behaved toward one another as equals. As one scholar of slavery, Kenneth Stampp, has put it, Negro and white servants of the seventeenth century were "remarkably unconcerned about the visible physical differences."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that "in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any "white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free."

       I totally notice this too. I work a a very large hospital in the operating room and the Doctors and other RNs have been talking about this too. It's funny the other day 3 of our residents brought up the topics talking about the book 1984.

       ALT media -  is supposedly the "alternative" the the big media, for those enlightened few that realize that big media is just endless propaganda. supposedly the alternative media will give you the truth, but often they are just controlled-opposition/limited hangout (like Alex Jones of InfoWars/ StratFor)
      </p>
      <p>
       as a matter of fact, it seems to me that the popular use of the phrase "alt right" was in reference to "right leaning" ALT news sources such as InfoWars,
      </p>
      <p>
       and "alt left" was the media for the lefty/liberals who left MSM
      </p>
      <p>
       then one day "alt right" became synonymous with "nazi", "white supremacy"
      </p>
      <p>
       and "alt left" became synonymous with "antifa" and "black bloc"?
      </p>

       SM social media - places like reddit, where real people talk to AI robots.

      <p>

       I believe it was first coined by "liberal" pundits like Joy Anne Reid to attempt to paint Sanders supporters as racist, misogynists to help Clinton win the primary. It's another gift to people like Hannity, just like the term "fake news".

       You need to go further back in the election. Look up the white supremacist Richard Spencer and his interviews and messages from 2010 up. He started using the term to unite white supremacists from various outlets. These outlets picked up the Alt-Right banner as a rebranding marketing principle. After 2010 you can see many white supremacy groups identify themselves on message boards as Alt-right. This also ties in with groups outside the US, particularly European white supremacists identifying as Alt-Right. The origins are years before the election.

       Hahah all good I was being an ass because I see a lot of vague generalized statements about the "truth" without any real backing. I find it curious why someone makes a sensationalized post about the eyes of society being opened when they're not willing to elaborate on how they got to their truth or what it even is.

       BTW, just telling someone the truth is out there doesn't do much good.  It's too vague to guide someone to the truth.  You're gonna need to be a bit more specific if you want people to find 'the truth', or what you believe to be the truth.

       That would actually make an interesting poster.  We can then print those out and stick them on posts around the city so when people see them they can tilt their heads and go, "Huh....That's a strange poster on a strange post."

        Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

        And while the John Birch Society changed most of the leading players in their conspiracy theory to what they call the “insiders” rather than Jews, many others still see the Jew as the monster controlling world events. For these anti-Semites the Jew is often referred to as the “International Banker.” All of these groups together, both Identity and non-Identity white supremacist, hold a dangerous sociopolitical view. Their mutual solution to this supposed “Jewish control” is a race war. This war is considered by many Identity teachers to be the last great battle, Armageddon. According to these teachers, at the head of this conspiracy that leads to the final battle is ZOG: Zionist Occupation Government. Zionist Occupation Government simply means to Identity adherents that the Jewish conspiracy has taken over the government of the United States. Since they also believe that Jewish leaders are using other races to destroy the white race, the final battle pits the white race against virtually all others. And, because they constantly feed on conspiracy theories that involve those whose beliefs or politics oppose their own, Identity’s political and religious opposites are also considered their enemies. Furthermore, they do not have to love their enemies because they consider most of them subhuman.

       A threat, what does that mean exactly? Do I feel personally threatened? Of course not. Do I think it's dangerous on the streets because of these people? no I don't.  Do I think these people are dangerous? Yes- timothy mcveigh, eric rudolph, dylan roof, wayne michael page were dangerous and these were just the handful that carried out their acts.  Do I think that these people want to change laws and limit people's rights? yes, given the opportunity they definitely would and we are currently in a time when these people feel emboldened in a way they haven't in quite a while. Much of this is coming from movements in the EU, Australia, South Africa and now these folks can communicate more freely than ever before which is why I think it's something to quell and keep at bay sooner rather than later.

       The media pushing for and casting the illusion of a race problem is obvious. Just look at the methods used to overthrow all the counties in the last 20 years. Create a phony civil war. Don't worry about really selling it to the people of that country. The main audience it is sold to is the rest of the world. This allows them to justify foreign interference in a country. And would you look at that.

       Media is for sure a cog in the machine.  But I think the social proof of going on the internet and seeing constant racist shit being posted all over, from people you might assume are actual people, is much more a way of affirming it to the public than the not so trusted main stream media.

       Not sure why you're lumping all Southern whites into the same camp, but I'll roll with it. Why would Southern whites be infuriated about statues of Confederate leaders being taken down? Do they still agree with the Confederacy? What value do the statues serve?

       The racism has always been there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its the rise in social media and cell phones that allowed incidents that were once very localized to become nationalized in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the Rodney King situation in LA. I've seen tons of interviews with black people from the area saying that being roughed up by the police was a pretty normal thing at the time. What was different was someone grabbed it on camera. Things blew up after the decision was made that the cops did nothing wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now instead of once in a blue moon case of someone being caught being "racist" on camera, its now a common occurrence. This doesnt mean its any more or less common, but we are much more aware. Its real easy for the human mind to go with emotional arguments and say that the person that was hurt or killed was done so without justification 9 times out of 10. Follow that up with 9 times out of 10 its determined that the police or whatever party acted appropriately following an internal investigation it can lead to a massive distrust in the system as a whole.

       Combine this with a 24 news cycle that throws any "news" in your face at high velocity at all times can make any average person think a handful of events actually is an epidemic.

       TL;DR: Some people are racist, some people are trying to take advantage of the situation to advance their agenda.

       Some may call it indoctrination but I call it being awoken... my first class ever taken at college, called Making US Modern, which covered the years 1865-1900, the Professor told us all quite plainly that racism was created by the elite Southern Plantation Class to divide poor white and poor blacks from uniting against them...it is something I will never forget.

       That's what I think whenever I see someone online who goes out of their way to make it clear to everyone how anti-semitic they are, even when it has nothing to do with anything. I'm sure that people are paid to come into communities like this and make a racist scene just to paint the community in a negative light.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I haven't noticed anything conspicuous like that lately. Seeing how the corporate media started pushing racial tensions recently, I half-expected to see a bunch of self-identified "neo-nazis" popping up telling us how we have to use violence against Black Lives Matter or something. I've seen nothing like that though, thankfully. Most of the people seeming to be intentionally stoking the flames of racial tension seem to be more of a "They're all Nazis! Everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi! We have to assault all the Nazis EVERYWHERE!" type.

       they pump up these race-related stories, because they know it will further divide the people. they have to keep putting new stories out there in perpetuity to reinforce existing racism in older people and to introduce racism to young, impressionable people. they know that some people will make racist comments to their friends and families, and this will create controversy, and keep the people divided.

       Don't drag Jill Stein into this shit.  She went to a Russian summit where political leaders from around the world met to discuss the middle east so she could discuss her ideas for peace.  Obviously no democrats and republicans would attend such an event because this exact smear would be used against them.

       Has it ever occurred to you that Russia wants her message to get out there because it's good for the entire world including Russia?  She has an extreme view on military in that we should only use it to defend our country and not police the world.  I'm pretty sure there are a lot of countries that would not mind seeing America become more open to ideas from people like Jill Stein.

       Yeah it makes sense to me.  There's another post where a poster is citing all these attacks on minorities by racists and some of them are things like:
      </p>
      <p>
       'A bunch of guys in a black car stop and get out, one punches the victim in the face then yells 'Trump in 2016!' and they speed off.'
      </p>
      <p>
       And many of them just look really a lot like something I'd picture as false flag ops.  How many times have we seen verified false flag vandalism of Synagogues, and who can forget the fake black woman sending herself racist hate mail then reporting it to the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is a very effective tool for getting the most mileage from things that actually happen and things that are staged.  Too bad most people just eat that shit up without ever stopping and saying 'who is trying to get me mad here and what's in it for them?'

       Not on the internet but in real life for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 80's my parents took my sister and I to Gettysburg for a family vacation (I was 8) and I got a Confederate Flag as a souvenir (not a 5' x 3', more like 18" x 12"). I hung that flag up in my room and it stayed there until the early 90's when I hung it up in my basement after my dad finished it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I met my best friend in 1992, and we would hang out in the basement all the time, sometimes up to 5 days a week for years with that same flag hanging on the wall. Then when we both went off to college in 1998 I took it with me and hung it up in my dorm room, then my apartment, and my buddy would come over a few times a year, and that exact flag was always there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when I bought my house I hung it up in my garage, right next to a jolly roger and a American Flag. And my friend saw that flag every single time he came over, at least 300 times in the last 15 years. He never said a word about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then two months ago he came over and just layed into me about having it displayed and how disappointed he was with me for having one. A flag that I have owned since 1988 and that he has been around on almost a weekly basis since 1992. Then suddenly 2 months ago he decided that it was offensive and that he "Lost a lot of respect for me" because I owned it.
      </p>

       It's some Manchurian Candidate shit.

       He probably learned more about the history of the Confederacy than he had known in the past. Claiming that your friend is brainwashed (your Manchurian Candidate comment) because he thinks the flag stands for something abhorrent (which is reasonable enough, judging from history) is kind of ridiculous.

       The Manchurian Candidate reference is because he could see the symbol his entire life and not care, then one day he sees it and it sets him off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the
       <em>
        flag
       </em>
       has changed meanings over time and today more progressive people are changing their perception of it along/concurrently with the social perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that people always held those feelings but since there was no social standard they just didn't care to share their feelings. But now that it's universal, it's OK to speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the left feels that they are pushed into a corner and when We had a Black Liberal President it wasn't a big deal to see a flag at Pep-Boys or at a Sporting Event, but since Trump won they are now lashing out against all people and symbols that represent the right.

       For the record, I am not a Republican.

       I grew up in Oklahoma in the 70s and 80s.  I saw so much goddamn racism all my life, within my immediate family.    Not to the level of Nazis close to me, but plenty of skinheads and just outright hatred.    There is plenty of it out there.

       People like you are just actually paying attention to the racism and other crap. I have not seen any general increase, or massive influx, or any change in the amount of it. It's all been around for a while, white supremacy grew during the Obama years, Nazis closely related grew marginally along side. Militia groups also grew over the years with a good number having white supremacy tendencies.

       Stop thinking it's bots or something, nothing has changed, you just weren't looking. Maybe you seen (((these))) around here? Chances are high that the poster using them are a Neo Nazi to some degree.

       There is no  large recent influx, the rise of the alt-right faction that harbors most of these people has been having a steady growth, and feel emboldened after Trump won so they've been more outspoken and brash.
      </p>

       But a major increase it is not, they just used to keep to their group, the only real change is them going more public with their shit.

       I've seen an increase too.  I've always reported/flagged racist comments on Youtube (it doesn't always mean they'll be removed, but I assume that if enough of us flag them, something will come of it).  Just a few years ago, it was relatively rare to see what we sometimes see posted hundreds of times per video today.  I definitely think we're being manipulated.  Add to that companies like Cambridge Analytica openly taking credit for manipulating the masses, and it seems hard to deny.

       I think people have been convinced that racial differences don't exist and that all peoples are interchangeable. This is false. On average, two races have vastly different capabilities. Racial tensions will always exist due to innate, biological in group preference. While its true that these tensions can be mitigated with education, forcing peoples of different races to live together will always lead to problems.

       Yes, this is key to me--what is SEEN as racist.  People are getting fed up with people sucking at life and justifying it by calling someone else racist with no evidence.   The media is jumping all over any demonstration that supports trump as racist and they are mischaracterizing anything remotely related as racist. For instance, telling someone that black-on-black crime, black single parent family statistics, black high abortion rates, and black test scores/grades need to improve is now very racist, even if you are black.  Just let us suck at life and blame racism, don't challenge us to be better people.  Maybe calling someone racist with zero evidence should be a hate crime. You can seriously end someone's career easily with a false accusation of it.

       I think a lot of people are actually huge racists and blaming shills or TPTB is just a cop-out by people who aren't psychologically ready to confront their own biases.

       I don't think there is an influx of online racism. Rather, there has been a lot of online racism for a long time and people are just talking about it now. It took a while but I think the whole anti-bullying campaign has done a lot to bring this stuff to the forefront.

       So, first off the OP never claimed racism didn't exist. Second off, I'm so fucking sick of this narrative. You're only helping the divide with this bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying "racism isn't as big of a problem as the media is telling you" is a lot fucking different from saying "there are no racist people in the world". Racism sells. It's in the benefit of a great many people to make the problem appear a lot fucking bigger than it really is. There's a reason Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton are rich as fuck. That shit
       <em>
        sells
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop with this straight-from-the-DNC talking point. It's fucking trite. It's completely possible, logical, and reasonable to believe racism isn't nearly as big of a problem as we're being told while also recognizing it still exists.

       Oh the big DNC boogie man, and you have the nerve to bring up talking points.

       "Ya'll" make it impossible to talk about racism because just like the loldnc? You too look at the very same MSM as the litmus of racism
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying racism isn't that bad because "the KKK [isnt] still out lynching people shift oneoneone" is just as asinine. Racism isn't just calling blacks niggers and fire hoses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell racism isn't just experienced by blacks (which is what you're insinuating by bringing up Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and the kkk cuz you're lolnotraysis). There are a plethora of ethnic groups that experience the very same blatant and subtle racism all over America.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then they come here and get told that it's not that bad or it's some loldnc ploy by people who automagically assume racism only means black and white and then, again magically, play themselves the victim.

        How many of you guys think that the massive influx of racism we are seeing around the internet is actually just bots or payed trolls spreading propaganda to stoke racial tensions for political reasons?

Once hated and vile politicians are becoming acceptable because they repudiate racism. Just seems like a complete red herring at an all too convenient time.

       Sure. But what would

       put the number at? 30k? 50k? 100k? 500k? 1 million? All those numbers are TINY compared to the population of the United States (322 million). If we use 1 million as the estimate, that's about 0.30%.. less than one third of one percent of America.

       We can also get a look at their reach by looking at their presence online. We'll obviously look at The Daily Stormer, but we can also check Stormfront.

       If we compare this to "small-time" liberal strongholds, which frequently push the idea of "white privilege" (and all that other shit), that whites/men are evil, etc, it's not very favorable for the white supremacists. Mother Jones, for instance, is

       estimate the white supremacists in America to be? These supposed "Nazis" (according to the media) had only ~40 people show up in Boston last weekend. Conservative estimates put the counter protestors at 30k.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF we believe the people in Boston were "Nazis" (they absolutely were not), what does that say about their reach?

       I never claimed anything you said I did. I never said racism wasn't real, or that people don't experience it. You're just purposefully arguing strawmen because, idk, you think it wins you some morality points? You think it makes it you look smart?

        How many of you guys think that the massive influx of racism we are seeing around the internet is actually just bots or payed trolls spreading propaganda to stoke racial tensions for political reasons?

        Seems like the American public has totally forgotten how much we hate the establishment and are pretty focused on hating each other at this point. Once hated and vile politicians are becoming acceptable because they repudiate racism. Just seems like a complete red herring at an all too convenient time.

       <em>
        That
       </em>
       would be an accurate representation of my views, yes. I do not think racism is nearly as prevalent as the media is telling us it is. What we saw in Charolettesville is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the norm. Up until the media gave them a platform, and started telling them their president was one of them, we didn't hear a word from the White Supremacists. They were irrelevant. They still are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're like a single ant in an entire colony. When you look at the colony, that ant is pretty insignificant, even if it's the queen. It's just one ant among the thousands. However, if you put a microscope on the ant suddenly that ant seems much bigger and more relevant than it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And (again, I hate this fucking attitude makes me have to say this), just so we're clear, I am
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       saying racism doesn't exist. I am not saying it's a good thing. I'm not saying it's not terrible. I'm simply stating that the problem is not nearly as wide spread as we are lead to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even provided you a
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       for that -- money. There's a reason "White man shoots black man" is national news for days, but the reverse isn't.. or even "Black man shoots black man". Racism sells. It's in their best interest to stoke those flames.

       I'd say people are actually more racist, not less, than they show online. It's naive to think someone would need to pay people to act racist; they've been doing it for free for centuries.

       So your argument is that, since the Civil Rights movement, America is actually
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       racist? That they show that racism
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       online, when people can identify them, rather than in a place where you're anonymous? Are you arguing that the internet magically makes anonymous people appear less racist than they are in non-anonymous real life?

       I think people are generally more racist than they express online (or offline).  A very small sliver of people make overtly racist comments online; a much, much larger group has racist thoughts that they keep to themselves.

       If you break down all US racism, you'll find that
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        30% comes from the left trying to "fix" racism (i.e. giving preferential treatment to
        <em>
         specific
        </em>
        minority groups)
       </li>
       <li>
        30% is the left calling the right racism over policy disagreements because it's easier than listening.
       </li>
       <li>
        30% is black people being unquestionably racist against whites.
       </li>
       <li>
        8% is funny internet trolling, and this gets almost all the publicity.
       </li>
       <li>
        1% is casual white racism, like a neighbor who would be extra skeptical of his daughters black boyfriend, but would also ultimately give him a chance.
       </li>
       <li>
        1% is actual white against black racism, mostly from those who have had one or two bad experiences from living in the ghetto.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Democrats have successfully branded the republican party the party of racists, and since they're in power it's the best tactic to delegitimize. But there's a really bad snowball effect here, in that democrats now feel 100% justified in almost anything they do, because they're fighting against nazi's, therefore all's fair. I'm not sure if this was intentional (deep state divide, russia destabilize, whatever), or an unintended side effect of a party tactic.

       It happens a lot. There's a lot of focus on Russia's use of bots, but the reality is that bots are so incredibly accessible even to an individual. Soundcloud rappers are using bots for fake plays and followers, am I supposed to believe that corporations, thinktanks and politicians aren't? They're all doing it, we are in an era of misinformation, we are clouded by different "truths" being injected into the internet. The result won't be what anyone wants, we will become an extremely confused society.

       I've been on the tubes for while and there was
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       a huge amount of racism in the smaller corners, reddit used to have klan rallies on the weekend in many subs. The change now is that it's currently socially kind of ok to be racist out in public and in above ground internet space so it's much more visible and the media is finding it easier to report on. I don't think there is more racism I just think it's more easily seen.

       The Jews want a racewar. 4chan and even this place and many other "conspiracy" type forums made a dramatic switch from real conspiracy theories to full blown identity politics whining. Both sides are pushing the overton window further left/right to polarize the masses and create as much chaos and civil unrest as possible. Of coarse, TPTB will swoop in when the time is right and bring forth their "solution" to the problem (cashless society, more orwellian measures, police state, NWO)

       No, it's caused by the boomers.  Not even a conspiracy.  You see:

       Boomers are hanging on to high paying jobs, while their skill sets are completely outdated.  The two main skills they have any claim to are nepotism with other boomers (protecting the boomer moneytrain) and senilit-er seniority.  The latter is meant to imply they may have actually seen things that could be helpful.

       All of this would be fine if they then would turn around and mentor the next generation that graduated from college just like them.  This would create a sense of respect for them amidst the lower class.  However there are multiple problems with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A)  The next generation has infinitely more skills due to the information age.  They are also much more moral and better leaders due to role models in media. 
B) The Boomer ego is monumental, having an enormous sense of entitlement after graduating from subsidized college into an extremely high paying real wage job.   Meanwhile Millenials experience the exact opposite
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore Boomers refuse to hire the most competent candidates, fearing that they will easily outshine them or even put their extreme lack of competence on display.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead they hire only through consulting firms, preferring candidates from developing countries, average candidates, disabled candidates, and the occasional mousy subservient candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes white males mad because their extreme education capabilities (admittedly achieved through generations of legacy with epigenetic memory) are ignored and they are rejected.  Meanwhile minorities are mad because they have no chance of advancement - at OLDER white males.

       Agreed. Even if you go back to the 90s, Usenet groups were horrible for it. I remember trying to download (pictures) on a 42kb modem and it turning out to be some skinhead BS propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you hit the wrong group and it was full of hate speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early 90s there was a rash of Klan marches. Turned out to be a couple of guys wearing sheets. In one town, there was 1 man wearing the sheets marching down the street by himself surrounded by journalists and people making fun of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, let's not forget the rash of white supremacists they found on army bases, they used the office computers and printers to create hate speech newsletters and emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there were still lots of real attacks though. Horrible racist attacks. One man dragged behind a pickup truck, it was all over the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the incidents of hate/racial attacks are still less than just regular old crime.

       I have seen it.  I mean just go check the comment section of any youtube video.  Shit really started to get bad during the campaign when there were just bots spamming political shit on all sides.  Now you see the same exact technique being used but the bots are spamming either white racism or anti white racism.  Giant Swastikas...  so forth.  Sure some if it is probably edgy kids, and that has always been a factor.  But there has been an extremely big boost in racism, particularly spam style stuff.

       Ideas like Jill Stein's support of Russia's take over of Ukraine land?

       The Jill Stein whose VP,  Ajamu Baraka, repeats the Russian propaganda that shooting down of MH17 was a false flag?
