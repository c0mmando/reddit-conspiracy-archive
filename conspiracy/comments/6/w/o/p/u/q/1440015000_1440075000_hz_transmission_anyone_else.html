       Seems to have a human-oid pulse, around 72 bpm, like someone's transmitting an EKG or something. Also contains vocals, if treated as FM transmission and noise filtered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems highly unusual - anyone else picking this signal up?

       I have the exact answer if you're willing to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you using a standard cheap dongle? Not a special one or anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, what you're seeing isn't real. I've encountered these before, what you're seeing is USB signal noise
       <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise">
        https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note what it says
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "High Speed USB 2.0 clock noise. Shows up at multiples of 480 MHz."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So 480mhz, 960mhz,
       <strong>
        1440mhz
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing is just isn't happening in reality, I can find the same error at 720mhz, 660mhz, 600mhz 540mhz, 480mhz, etc varying from weak to strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours ins't exact on 1440 because of frequency drift, and doing higher frequencies(anything past 900mhz) will cuase it to heat up fast and cause more drift and more error from this not being designed for that range. Hell, I don't believe you can actually use that frequency at all with a cheap generic rtl.
      </p>
      <p>
       go take a look and listen to 480mhz and see the similarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you're getting into radio stuff, I highly suggest listening to business radio things since that's always fun, find your local ham repeater frequencies. But google a bit.

       So youre making excuses for using Google drive by saying that "its not classified"??? That's like saying you don't care about privacy cause you got nothing to hide. What difference does it make what content it is??? Your are using the enemies service. On a conspiracy reddit. Don't you see how hypocritical that is. And wow so many downvotes. Pathetic. You people probably use Facebook too? Or do you all who downvote don't think fb and Google is the enemy??? You're all hypocrites or part of the problem. Pick one.

       First of all, it's hard to be hypocritical when I never declared google "The enemy "in the first place… You're connecting a lot of dots that aren't there, and making a metric shit-load of assumptions… A lot of people on here are open-minded, casual lurkers, contributing on the occasion that something actually peaks their interest, or when they can be of service to the subject at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like a little time away from your sub might be a good thing for you… I don't mean that to come across the way snarky anonymous Internet commentary usually goes, nor do I mean it to have the usual judge mental tone you should expect from a stranger online… I myself went pretty deep and hard on this sub for a long time, and while I do think that critical thinking and investigation is important, and there's a lot of "fighting the good fight " happening here, it's also very possible to have too much of a good thing, to the degree that it actually starts affecting you negatively. I myself lost plenty of sleep getting worked up about the shit on the sub, and it definitely affected the way I was interacting with the people around me, and certainly strangers online.

       I don't agree with the largess of their practices as a corporation, certainly their "algorithms" raise a lot of questions, if not out right provable accusations… There's certainly a staggering amount of evidence that they also handle privacy terribly. As a consumer, I do use some of their services casually, and cautiously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they're either the "enemy" or the "shining leaders in technological progress" either. I mainly just wanted to be realistic in my solicitation of efforts to get something from someone on the Internet.

       The medium of file sharing is less important than the content in this instance.

       I see your frustration with Google, as do many others, but they're still ubiquitous for most internet users. Additionally, Google drive doesn't require a sign-in to download a video. In this instance, this is 'much ado about nothing'.

       There's no reason for downvotes. Disagreement and discussion can bring  understanding and progress. What would you recommend as a good replacement for Google's stuff? I'm actually in process of hunting for a new browser to replace chrome, because they removed 'backspace to go back'. I'm probably going to get a new email as well, but the phone platform is a concern for me. I don't have the money or desire to support Apple, and there's not much else out there afaik.

       I don't keep track of who replies to my comments and reddit doesn't give you much when you click on the notifications. And no I'm not a bot. Do i seem like a bot to you? And what about my point don't you get or disagree with?

       im sorry but i dont know what is condescending about it. and like i said, if you use services like google drive, facebook and stuff like this - while being on a sub constantly saying that these are the enemies (just look at the hot pages) - then you are either being part of the problem, or a hypocrite.

       I was only talking down to those using Facebook and Google while still participating in a sub where it's clear they are the enemies and I dislike that blatant hypocrisy, so feel free to downvote I feel those who agree with me wouldn't downvote because it wouldn't be referring to them.

       THIS is my big conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       1999 the UN reported a microwave signal coming from space, it was focused on Alaska, reports came from Morgues there reporting the dead were being cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       A week later the news had a blurb about a new US anti-tornado Satelite that warmed the air to disapate Tornados, "The only problem is it can cause Flying things like Birds, Aircraft and Missiles to explode" the news report went on to this this was the system they were testing when the UN made its enquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be totally wrong here, but I think the US is testing their "anti-tornado" Microwave Satelite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and good luck finding ANYTHING about it anywhere, I know I and others who were with me when we saw the news report have tried, for YEARS.

       That sounds a lot like it, but the news described a working system, which is what was first reported as a strange happening which was noticed by the UN who made the enquiry and the news reveal.

       Ya no problem I love to look for stuff speaciallywhen it comes to conspiracy. I also noticed that the SFSU paper I linked isn't even it. You say it happened in the 90s that paper was written in 2000 or 2001. Just goes to show the government is years ahead of the public sector

       I more impressed they found a way for microwaves to only cook dead people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like enough it was noticeable. But not living people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and it doesn't interfere with anything? Watts of power 500 feet to make birds explode.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Lets say 4000 watts to heat a mass of .1 gallons of water to 212 degrees from 100 in 30 seconds. About bird size and temperature I would assume. And longer and the bird probably dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool. So lets say this bird is at 500 feet. Where most of the birds tend to be. And lets say the satellite is in a 2000km orbit. So, transmit power would need to be only 16000000000000000 watts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 16 quadrillion watts to make a bird boil in 30 seconds. Would it blow up? Maybe. Antenna gain? Sure that is a thing. But what is powering this? Lets say it takes...say 1 billion times less power with antenna gain. How are we powering a 16 MW transmitter in space. Average power. Not peak.

       The 21cm L-band is typically used for radio astronomy.  Any observations would need a satellite dish.  Interesting this is being picked up on HAM.  Maybe interference from a

       If memory serves microwave tech works on pulse theory so microwaves is a fair assumption.

       . Has anyone tuned in to the frequencies?

       Cue: someone rehashing the old PR, with nothing to add to answer my questions, that have nothing to do with writing or talking about the frequencies, but rather listening in on them, and nothing else.

       Quick, someone else pretend I have no ability to understand the obvious talking and writing I have no interest in, and did not ask about.

       People tune in with digital TV antennas all the time...  many watch OTA digital broadcast on their TVs.  Many millions of others use LTE cellular data and are similarly "tuned in" to the 700MHz spectrum.  What is it that you want to "listen" to?

       Would this be within a frequency that a ShortWave radio would be able to pick up. Either way I have found some weird shit playing around with the SW radio that I got from a old relative including some weird cryptic transmitters at times or faint voices that are to fuzzy to make out, l live in Alberta.

       Not even close. Also it isn't real, it's USB noise from his device.
      </p>
      <p>
       The voices and stuff you are hearing is just far off shortwave stations, likely in another language as shortwave isn't used in North America but mildly popular in other countries. It's possible you're hearing faint Russian radio or even Japanese radio.

       I have the exact answer if anyone is willing to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you using a standard cheap dongle? Not a special one or anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, what you're seeing isn't real. I've encountered these before, what you're seeing is USB signal noise
       <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise">
        https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note what it says
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "High Speed USB 2.0 clock noise. Shows up at multiples of 480 MHz."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So 480mhz, 960mhz,
       <strong>
        1440mhz
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing is just isn't happening in reality, I can find the same error at 720mhz, 660mhz, 600mhz 540mhz, 480mhz, etc varying from weak to strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours ins't exact on 1440 because of frequency drift, and doing higher frequencies(anything past 900mhz) will cuase it to heat up fast and cause more drift and more error from this not being designed for that range. Hell, I don't believe you can actually use that frequency at all with a cheap generic rtl.
      </p>
      <p>
       go take a look and listen to 480mhz and see the similarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you're getting into radio stuff, I highly suggest listening to business radio things since that's always fun, find your local ham repeater frequencies. But google a bit.

       THIS is my big conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       1999 the UN reported a microwave signal coming from space, it was focused on Alaska, reports came from Morgues there reporting the dead were being cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       A week later the news had a blurb about a new US anti-tornado Satelite that warmed the air to disapate Tornados, "The only problem is it can cause Flying things like Birds, Aircraft and Missiles to explode" the news report went on to this this was the system they were testing when the UN made its enquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be totally wrong here, but I think the US is testing their "anti-tornado" Microwave Satelite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and good luck finding ANYTHING about it anywhere, I know I and others who were with me when we saw the news report have tried, for YEARS.

       The 21cm L-band is typically used for radio astronomy.  Any observations would need a satellite dish.  Interesting this is being picked up on HAM.  Maybe interference from a

       I have the exact answer if you're willing to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you using a standard cheap dongle? Not a special one or anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, what you're seeing isn't real. I've encountered these before, what you're seeing is USB signal noise
       <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise">
        https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_USB_Noise
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note what it says
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "High Speed USB 2.0 clock noise. Shows up at multiples of 480 MHz."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So 480mhz, 960mhz,
       <strong>
        1440mhz
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing is just isn't happening in reality, I can find the same error at 720mhz, 660mhz, 600mhz 540mhz, 480mhz, etc varying from weak to strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours ins't exact on 1440 because of frequency drift, and doing higher frequencies(anything past 900mhz) will cuase it to heat up fast and cause more drift and more error from this not being designed for that range. Hell, I don't believe you can actually use that frequency at all with a cheap generic rtl.
      </p>
      <p>
       go take a look and listen to 480mhz and see the similarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you're getting into radio stuff, I highly suggest listening to business radio things since that's always fun, find your local ham repeater frequencies. But google a bit.

       I heard that too. I was wondering if anyone has tuned in with a TV to see and hear the truth. The ''news'' is rarely accurate about anything.

       It's about the principle. You can't complain about something then go ahead and use the very same it's hypocritical and i dislike it, feel free to downvote me

       it doesnt matter dont you realise that? using the service of the enemy meanwhile complaining about the enemy is completely ludicrous. you cant have a sub devoted to red pilling the people about google and facebook then at the same turn USE their service?? DONT YOU SEE THAT?

       Fair enough. You gotta have the nukes, but you also gotta have the counter-nuke-nukes, and then the counter-counter-nuke-nuke-nukes too... That's brilliant!
