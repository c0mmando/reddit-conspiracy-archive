Then you have the fact that no one even asks him about Yemen since that might make Obama look bad. Some fucking &quot;resistance&quot;.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re supposed to not care because the people before him did it? It&#39;s ridiculous that this is the argument so often thrown around these days. I wasn&#39;t happy previous presidents did these things and I&#39;m sure as shit not happy the current president is doing these things. How does that make me a dumb ass?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is missing the point. Even assuming the worst about Trump, he&#39;s no worse than the last few presidents. So where was the wall-to-wall media outrage machine? Why is <em>now</em> the time to resist and not during the mass cover-up of financial crimes following the housing bond market fiasco? There is clearly an ulterior motive for opposing President Trump. I think his administration is quietly going to war with some very powerful criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who was more recently introduced to much of the bullshit Obama was doing (mainly because of complacency and lack of interest at the time), I didn&#39;t even know that things I don&#39;t agree with were happening. So, as I began to educate myself during the elections I became much more aware and started to speak out.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people over the years who had bought into &quot;my guy is better, and he&#39;s in power so I don&#39;t have to worry&quot; that now realize what fools we were. Does that somehow make us speaking out against the new president wrong or a dumb ass? <em>I</em> don&#39;t think so. I regret that I wasn&#39;t more informed in the past, but now that I am, I&#39;m not going to be quiet when other try to defend things I still don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck about the &quot;media outrage machine&quot; because I know it&#39;s all bs now... but again, just because the media is stupid doesn&#39;t make the things Trump is doing any less against my personal expectations as a voting citizen of this nation.</p>

<p>Yes I am, if it is indeed ISIS.  What is your source btw, are you meaning the Syrian rebels?</p>

<p>Also, this statement &quot;you are blaming ISIS for taking help from the CIA&quot;</p>

<p>and what you first stated, which is this &quot;Are you seriously blaming ISIS for the CIA&quot;, are not the same thing - in the second statement, you added the words &quot;taking help from&quot;.  Next time, try using the same words in your sentences, as a few words added/removed make a big difference.</p>

<p>I do blame both, the CIA and ISIS - one for giving, one for taking.</p>

<p>the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was never designed to regulate the Internet and jurisdiction over the Internet belongs to the FTC not the FCC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about supporting the reinstatement of civil asset forfeiture?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under appropriate circumstances this is completely acceptable. The issue was that police were seizing assets before trial. Eliminate that and nobody would have any problems.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll take local police having that weaponry over UN/private contractors.</p>

<p>Ever heard of border taxes? You can&#39;t be that simple minded as to think Mexico would be cutting us a check. Geopolitics are not that simple.</p>

<p>What is done in the name of Christ or any other prophet is not the same as what they themselves would do. However they are recorded, remember this: they were people who, by speaking to others, gained a huge following because people heard a truth in what they spoke.</p>

<p>If you let all that is done in their name dissuade you from any positive teachings they could give you then that is a choice only you can make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then stop trying to delegitimize the democratic process by perpetuating false allegations through anonymous leaks. Stop trying to make people believe his presidency is illegitimate because of MUH RUSSIA. Russia didn&#39;t hack the voting machines and didn&#39;t change any votes. Period. Get over it.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the DNC rigged the election (of course, you shitlords don&#39;t give a fuck about that). We are also seeing more reports coming out of more democratic votes happening in counties than there are registered voters (illegal immigrants are voting). So fuck you, your voter fraud, your refusal to accept more than one party in charge, your attempt to overthrow a democratically elected leader, and your attempt to keep one party in power indefinitely through voter fraud.</p>

<p>If you want to criticize Trump do it for real reasons, not fake reasons (MUH RUSSIA) or reasons everyone is aware of(HE KNOWS A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE). Criticize his war mongering, his cuts to government assistance, something real. Stop smashing people in the face because they voted for the president you don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great job pointing out the flaw in the analogy. Point being, it&#39;s not that people are defending him. It&#39;s that some of us don&#39;t want to spend all day talking about who he pardons while the middle east is getting ripped to shreds. It coincides with the left/right paradigm mindset that achieves nothing in the long run. </p>

<p>Any 3rd grader knows had he not been elected Assad would be dead by now. It seems clear to me to focus on the many facets of THAT ongoing agenda before listening to people like you who still can&#39;t deduce his future agenda with even a smidgen of foresight just meaningless quips. People like you still can&#39;t tell me why he&#39;s not fully engaged in Syria. That&#39;s clearly where the easy money is at. You can&#39;t change your narrative when it&#39;s convenient. He&#39;s catering to the military industrial complex yet bad mouthing the deep state...Please, oh please elaborate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only agree to what the other users are saying. I have found not one single teaching of Christ that would bring harm if it were followed. </p>

<p>What is done in the name of Christ or any other prophet is not the same as what they themselves would do. However they are recorded, remember this: they were people who, by speaking to others, gained a huge following because people heard a truth in what they spoke.</p>

<p>If you let all that is done in their name dissuade you from any positive teachings they could give you then that is a choice only you can make.</p>
