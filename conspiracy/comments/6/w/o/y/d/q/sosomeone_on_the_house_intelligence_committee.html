        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the article:</p>

<p>&quot;The Trump Organization on Monday turned over emails to the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and whether anyone in Mr. Trump’s campaign was involved. Some of the emails were obtained by The Times&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The emails obtained by The Times do not include any responses from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Sater’s messages&quot;.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that whoever supplied Haberman with the emails did not supply any responses from Cohen. It&#39;s a very convenient way to supply only one side of the story.</p>

<p>I also find it very interesting, that once again, Haberman somehow got access to documents presented to the House Intelligence Committee the very same day they were turned over, apparently.</p>

<p>Of course, many of us remember just how prominently Haberman figured into the Wikileaks emails regarding journalists who would do literally anything for Hillary Clinton during the election.</p>

<p>My question though, boils down to this - In the future, when we finally see what the House Intelligence Committee has found, will we be shown the response emails from Cohen?</p>

<p>Or will this side of the story never be available to the public?</p>

<p>How am I ever going to know what actually happened if I&#39;m only presented part of the story?</p>

<p>Which reminds me...did Rob Goldstone ever testify regarding his part in setting up the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume that his email replies are not as innocent as you assume. Think about it. If they proved him innocent why didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t he just release them now? Why did he lie months ago about having no knowledge of Russia trying to set up meetings. All these people have lied, got caught lying, made up a new lie, leaked documents prove them to be liars again and then and only then do we get the truth. If you believe the first story that comes out of anyone&#39;s mouth associated with Trump you&#39;re a fool. Are you a Trump supporter? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where does it say Cohen released the emails to the press?</p>

<p>As far as Sater officially representing Russia/Kremlin/Putin, I see no evidence of this as of yet. We only have Sater&#39;s claim that he can do this.</p>

<p>Supposedly Sater is also connected to the CIA and FBI? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe anything anyone says. I wait for actual proof/evidence to make my decisions.</p>

<p>I support some of Trumps policies..I definitely do not support some of Trumps policies. </p>

<p>Are you a Trump hater?</p>

<p>And lastly, I notice that many times on this sub, when I ask a certain user (who obviously doesn&#39;t support Trump or any of his policies) a specific question..somebody else inserts themselves into the conversation.</p>

<p>Which typically results in the specific question not being answered.</p>

<p>Because...noone has answered the question as of yet. So I will ask again. How did they obtain the emails that were presented to the House Intelligence Committee?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh my guess is a congressman leaked em. Is that all you wanted? Heh. For real tho man, Trump doesn&#39;t know anything about any policy he says he wants. If you can find me a video of him explaining any policy in detail I&#39;d love to see it. Been asking for months now and not one Trump supporter could provide me one.

<p>Don&#39;t try to make this about Trumps policies. The post was never about his policies.</p>

<p>It was about the fucking fact that once again, it appears that people in charge of what is supposed to be an impartial investigation have leaked information to the press. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This investigation was fucked by Devin Nunes. The wh found out they were unmasked and then tried to torpedo the house investigation by having Nunes pretend he got it elsewhere. You know the rest of the story. </p>

<p>So yeh, I could care less if they leak some emails. Chaffitz leaked the memo comey sent him on hillarys emails. Sucks when it turns around on. Btw if they have nothing to hide why do they keep lying about everything Russia? Serious question. Why do we have to find out about everything through leaks? They are dishonest my man. Come to grips with it. I&#39;m not asking you to look towards the Dems bc they are garbage people too but Trump isn&#39;t your hero. </p>

So yeh....you got me, I enjoy fair elections, sorry. Now please don&#39;t respond without a video of Trump explaining something, anything in detail or go back to t_d and pretend he&#39;s a God emporer.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a comment I made. Gonna beat you to it, Show you how rational people can be. </p>

<p>&quot;Obama convinced the people to get behind Obamacare, no matter how you feel about it. Did town halls, major speechs, called the hill to get support. Trump is a completely devoid of knowledge. Hillary fucked up in the debate, all she had to do was be like &quot;can you please explain that?&quot; about any point he made. &quot;&quot; </p>

<p>You see how I&#39;m not praising Obama for Obamacare, I&#39;m pointing out he went out and sold it. Trump didn&#39;t do anything but bluster and threaten. And the point about Hillary is how she was weak bc she didn&#39;t call him out for being a Moron. Did you see any praise in there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being dishonest. Not praising is not the same as criticism..None of your comments show any type of criticism for the Dems that would lead me to believe you think they&#39;re garbage.</p>

<p>Tons of Dems hate Hillary. She cost the democratic party everything. Still is. Until the Dems completely separate themselves from her they are doomed.</p>

<p>They will still be doomed regardless. Because all they have are identity politics.</p>

<p>They have no leader, they have no vision, no answers.</p>

<p>What they will manage to do..along with all the corrupt GOP gravy pigs, is make sure this country doesn&#39;t see any solutions to its problems for the next 3 and a half years.</p>

<p>Oh..and maybe make sure they get us in a fucking war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where you fail. You are playing right into the dog and pony show where you actually hope nothing gets fixed..to prove a point. Fuckin pathetic. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll keep jerking your chain when your party is in the White House..and you&#39;ll buy into all their campaign promises again.</p>

<p>Trump had four policies I liked. Fix immigration problem, get out of the war zones, create more manufacturing jobs and focus on the countries infrastructure.</p>

<p>Pretty simple. But TPTB aren&#39;t going to allow any of those to happen.</p>

<p>They will get us in another war though. Because that&#39;s where all the money ended up going again. Thanks to the fuckin Russia hysteria the Dems fucking caused along with all the warhawk neocons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do I need a video to show that those four policies were doable?</p>

<p>You know the reason they&#39;re not going to be accomplished just as I do. Lack of cooperation and constant undermining of the administration.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t immigration going to be fixed. Oh, that&#39;s right..because certain state leaders are actually breaking federal law to stop it from being fixed. What about those videos?</p>

<p>Jobs? Not going to be as many as there could have been..now that sanctions have become more important than trade. Got tons of videos on all that.</p>

<p>War zones? Tons of fucking videos from the presstitutes about why we won&#39;t be leaving any and instead create more.</p>

<p>Infrastructure? Could have..not now..because people like you bought the Russian hysteria. You&#39;re brainwashed and you don&#39;t even know it. You helped push the narrative that is going to help make this country suffer more.</p>

<p>Because all of the money is going to go to fighting the Russians now.</p>

<p>I see no reason why his first response to all this wouldn&#39;t have been &quot;but they didn&#39;t publish my side of the story!&quot; if indeed he felt that way. </p>

<p>Aside from his team turning over the emails themselves, a House member slipping case info to the press during the investigation is an area of concern. It does reek of &quot;give us a story&quot; before all the facts are really known.  </p>
