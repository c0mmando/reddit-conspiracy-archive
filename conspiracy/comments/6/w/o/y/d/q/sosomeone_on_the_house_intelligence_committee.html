      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Trump Organization on Monday turned over emails to the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and whether anyone in Mr. Trump’s campaign was involved. Some of the emails were obtained by The Times".
      </p>
      <p>
       "The emails obtained by The Times do not include any responses from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Sater’s messages".
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it very interesting that whoever supplied Haberman with the emails did not supply any responses from Cohen. It's a very convenient way to supply only one side of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it very interesting, that once again, Haberman somehow got access to documents presented to the House Intelligence Committee the very same day they were turned over, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, many of us remember just how prominently Haberman figured into the Wikileaks emails regarding journalists who would do literally anything for Hillary Clinton during the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question though, boils down to this - In the future, when we finally see what the House Intelligence Committee has found, will we be shown the response emails from Cohen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or will this side of the story never be available to the public?
      </p>
      <p>
       How am I ever going to know what actually happened if I'm only presented part of the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which reminds me...did Rob Goldstone ever testify regarding his part in setting up the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer?

       If Cohen was the one who gave them to the press...why didn't he supply his responses? Makes absolutely no sense.

       Especially if his responses back up the statement he made today regarding them.

       I would assume that his email replies are not as innocent as you assume. Think about it. If they proved him innocent why didn't/doesn't he just release them now? Why did he lie months ago about having no knowledge of Russia trying to set up meetings. All these people have lied, got caught lying, made up a new lie, leaked documents prove them to be liars again and then and only then do we get the truth. If you believe the first story that comes out of anyone's mouth associated with Trump you're a fool. Are you a Trump supporter?

       Where does it say Cohen released the emails to the press?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Sater officially representing Russia/Kremlin/Putin, I see no evidence of this as of yet. We only have Sater's claim that he can do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly Sater is also connected to the CIA and FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe anything anyone says. I wait for actual proof/evidence to make my decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support some of Trumps policies..I definitely do not support some of Trumps policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a Trump hater?
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, I notice that many times on this sub, when I ask a certain user (who obviously doesn't support Trump or any of his policies) a specific question..somebody else inserts themselves into the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which typically results in the specific question not being answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because...noone has answered the question as of yet. So I will ask again. How did they obtain the emails that were presented to the House Intelligence Committee?

       Uh my guess is a congressman leaked em. Is that all you wanted? Heh. For real tho man, Trump doesn't know anything about any policy he says he wants. If you can find me a video of him explaining any policy in detail I'd love to see it. Been asking for months now and not one Trump supporter could provide me one. Until you do ill continue to be bewildered how you couldve voted for someone who doesn't know anything .

       I didn't ask for your guess. I also didn't ask you to insert yourself into a conversation where I was asking someone else a very specific question regarding their very specific claim.

       And I notice..they still haven't answered the question.

       It was about the fucking fact that once again, it appears that people in charge of what is supposed to be an impartial investigation have leaked information to the press.

       So yeh, I could care less if they leak some emails. Chaffitz leaked the memo comey sent him on hillarys emails. Sucks when it turns around on. Btw if they have nothing to hide why do they keep lying about everything Russia? Serious question. Why do we have to find out about everything through leaks? They are dishonest my man. Come to grips with it. I'm not asking you to look towards the Dems bc they are garbage people too but Trump isn't your hero.

       Yeh I'm pointing out the fact that Texas, the state, gerrymandered their state so they could keep and maintain power. Does that prove I love the Dems as a whole? No. I like certain people allot, Al Franken is one of them. I also liked Ron Paul. I just happen to dislike the GOP more. You'll never find a comment where I praise the Dnc. So yeh....you got me, I enjoy fair elections, sorry. Now please don't respond without a video of Trump explaining something, anything in detail or go back to t_d and pretend he's a God emporer. It's embarrassing you havn't found one yet.

       This is a comment I made. Gonna beat you to it, Show you how rational people can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Obama convinced the people to get behind Obamacare, no matter how you feel about it. Did town halls, major speechs, called the hill to get support. Trump is a completely devoid of knowledge. Hillary fucked up in the debate, all she had to do was be like "can you please explain that?" about any point he made. ""
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how I'm not praising Obama for Obamacare, I'm pointing out he went out and sold it. Trump didn't do anything but bluster and threaten. And the point about Hillary is how she was weak bc she didn't call him out for being a Moron. Did you see any praise in there?

       You're being dishonest. Not praising is not the same as criticism..None of your comments show any type of criticism for the Dems that would lead me to believe you think they're garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tons of Dems hate Hillary. She cost the democratic party everything. Still is. Until the Dems completely separate themselves from her they are doomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will still be doomed regardless. Because all they have are identity politics.

       They have no leader, they have no vision, no answers.

       What they will manage to do..along with all the corrupt GOP gravy pigs, is make sure this country doesn't see any solutions to its problems for the next 3 and a half years.

       Well they arnt in power. What's to say? Oh I don't like them not voting or obstructing, it happens, it's a tit for tat. The GOP obstructed for 8 years and now whine about the Dems, it's pathetic. That's why I want the GOP to fall, the hypocrisy, it's gross. Either way I'm over it bro, you can't produce a video of Trump so I don't respect you anymore, you voted for a man that doesn't know anything. If you ever find one I'll be here.

       This is where you fail. You are playing right into the dog and pony show where you actually hope nothing gets fixed..to prove a point. Fuckin pathetic.

       They'll keep jerking your chain when your party is in the White House..and you'll buy into all their campaign promises again.

       Trump had four policies I liked. Fix immigration problem, get out of the war zones, create more manufacturing jobs and focus on the countries infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty simple. But TPTB aren't going to allow any of those to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will get us in another war though. Because that's where all the money ended up going again. Thanks to the fuckin Russia hysteria the Dems fucking caused along with all the warhawk neocons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could give a shit about you respecting me. You haven't even earned mine..much less lost it.

       Post a video. If you can't, admit you were duped by an ignoramus. For real. Fuck all the Bullshit, this should be a gimme. Don't give me some excuse that I'm a troll or whatever, if you can not find 1 video maybe you should think about that for a second. We're done here

       Why do I need a video to show that those four policies were doable?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the reason they're not going to be accomplished just as I do. Lack of cooperation and constant undermining of the administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't immigration going to be fixed. Oh, that's right..because certain state leaders are actually breaking federal law to stop it from being fixed. What about those videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jobs? Not going to be as many as there could have been..now that sanctions have become more important than trade. Got tons of videos on all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       War zones? Tons of fucking videos from the presstitutes about why we won't be leaving any and instead create more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infrastructure? Could have..not now..because people like you bought the Russian hysteria. You're brainwashed and you don't even know it. You helped push the narrative that is going to help make this country suffer more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all of the money is going to go to fighting the Russians now.

       I assume Cohen chose to omit his responses either from the emails submitted or from their publication-- or the NYT wasn't able to attain permission to include his words, same difference really. I could see a lawyer not wanting to have certain things on public record at this stage in the investigation, they are his "private property," something along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if it was an issue he would definitely bring up this fact, but he hasn't, nor has anyone involved in the case.

       I'm not certain that he did, and am assuming his go-ahead would be required in order to publish his responses. I do think it's relevant that he's had opportunity to bring up the omission since, but has not, instead simply describing Sater's words as salesmanship and that the deal was not feasible in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no reason why his first response to all this wouldn't have been "but they didn't publish my side of the story!" if indeed he felt that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from his team turning over the emails themselves, a House member slipping case info to the press during the investigation is an area of concern. It does reek of "give us a story" before all the facts are really known.

       You're assuming either the WaPo or the NYT's would wait for permission from Cohen to release his emails?
      </p>
      <p>
       After they've already released very specific details of the Presidents private phone calls with other heads of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't be serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing has been entirely about "give us a story before all the facts are known". And many times it's been absolute speculation with no confirmed source or proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       When has it ever not appeared as though most of the media could give a shit about waiting for the investigations to conclude?
