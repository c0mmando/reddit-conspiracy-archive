       capitalism is directly tied to the state,  it is a political system as are the rest of of usual -isms. hence we have "crony" capitalists, and "we" have "licensing and franchises etc" all with the goal and result of state granted monopolies, duopolies and oligarchies
      </p>
      <p>
       what exists without the state is called "the free market"

       what the u.s. has is a thinly veiled and increasing form of communism, all 10 planks in effect for many decades

       capitalism is definitely tied to the state, you can't do shit (business) without permission and giving the state a cut.

       of course that is capitalism, what else would you call it? the free market?

       capitalize - to take advantage of (take advantage of who, what, when where, how, why)
      </p>

       a requirement of critical thinking and intellectual discourse is an agreed upon definition of the words and terms used

       Is a tigers jaw stronger than a gazelles'? Capitalism does not need a State, it just is. Hierarchy in the animal kingdom, maybe? But, we are not animals, we are humans. I've tricked far smarter people than myself. They had everything going for them, I was the under dog. I won. You cannot really see this in the world/animal kingdom, unless you are a gazelle running from a cheetah. You have ~20-30 seconds to out-trick them, before they over heat, and surrender. Damn gazelle capitalized!!!!!

       You are talking about the parasitic nature of the state. The power of the state exists within all economic models, capitalism is no different. Free market voluntary transactions do not require the state. If I offer goods and services, for any method of payment then that is a voluntary transaction between two consenting parties. "Capitalism" can and will always exist without the state. People have always made mutually beneficial transactions since the dawn of existence. That's what capitalism is to me. Personally, capitalism has become a tainted word and basically a made up term by Marx. I prefer to use voluntary free market.

       Most people think Communism is an ideology dedicated to championing workers and the poor.  This was an incredibly successful ruse which manipulated millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Behind this artifice,  "Communism" is devoted to concentrating all wealth and power in the hands of the global central banking cartel (the Rothschilds and their allies) by disguising it as State power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central banking cartel is the ultimate monopoly. It has an almost global monopoly over government credit. Its object is to translate this into a monopoly over everything - political, cultural, economic and spiritual.   One world government = Rothschild monopoly = Communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ideology that further concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the "State" is Communism in another guise. These ideologies -- socialism, liberalism, fascism, neo-conservatism, zionism and feminism -- are fronts for "Communism," and are organized and funded by the central banking cartel.   Current events are all designed by the central bankers to increase government power.

       Capitalism just means "self determination".
      </p>
      <p>
       The term has been so bastardized by marxist educators that i've non-ironically heard "State Capitalism" as the reason for communist countries failing.

       In capitalism, you only need to work hard enough to get what you want. If that is a simple life for your family, then farming is acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is a new Iphone every year, the latest kicks™, mountaindew and doritos, then you are placing the value of your work in the hands of someone else.

       Quit the job and go work for yourself. Or have communism, where letting up on work gets you a trip to the gulag.

       The problem I see with people who hate capitalism is that numero uno, they still prosper in capitalism.  I also see it as an ingrained jealously; perhaps someone you loved left for someone who was more personally responsible financially, rather than blaming all their problems on "the rich".  It has to go back to a personal slight, or just straight up jealousy.

       Any Rand has some of the best quotes. I still outed her often, especially from my favorite book of hers, The Fountainhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very mention of Ayn Rand often makes certain liberals cringe.

       If you think what they are like 5 mins, it's not hard to lead to this conclusion. People just don't spend even 5 mins to ponder upon what they believe in.
