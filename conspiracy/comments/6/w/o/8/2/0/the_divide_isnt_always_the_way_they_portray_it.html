        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m in Houston right now experiencing the flood.  I work in the medical field, and I&#39;ve been at work since Friday except for a few hours today when I could finally make it home.  I&#39;m back at work now for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed personally and from watching the stories on TV, is that during this crisis no one cares about the issues that the media says divides us.  It hasn&#39;t mattered what someone&#39;s race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc... is, we&#39;ve all pulled together to help each other.</p>

<p>During non-crisis times I just don&#39;t see the divide on the whole.  Even more so though, we&#39;ve come together during this crisis.  Eventually, this nation will reach a national crisis brought about by the criminal banks, crooked politicians, corporate interests and deep state conspiracies.  I hope the nation will band together at that time as well...put aside the small differences...and realize what&#39;s important.  If so, we can show the same resolve us in Houston have shown to make sure the nation is set back on track and the criminal actors responsible for our nation&#39;s problems will be made to pay for their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often wondered, what if all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by an outer -- a power from outer space, from another planet. Wouldn&#39;t we all of a sudden find that we didn&#39;t have any differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens of the world, and wouldn&#39;t we come together to fight that particular threat?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God Bless you and stay safe. I would love to hope people would stick together in a crisis as you described...but something makes me think that when there is a natural disaster there is no real blame... If a crisis came about because political figures or bankers, people maybe would take sides? but we would all lose. maybe I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;ve never ever experienced or seen any kind of national serious crisis in my short time here </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The divide works differently than what they want. There&#39;s definitely a divide, but I think it&#39;s more of a good vs bad divide. </p>

<p>The owner of a megachurch and mega mansion denying refugeto his flock while continually asking for donations to pray. </p>

<p>&quot;Cajun navy&quot; rescue boats being shot at by looters. The same rescuers fearful to leave their boats because they could be stolen.</p>

<p>Fucking looting during a disaster brings out the best in humanity.</p>
