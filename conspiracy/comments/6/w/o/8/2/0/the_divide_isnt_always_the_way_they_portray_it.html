       I'm in Houston right now experiencing the flood.  I work in the medical field, and I've been at work since Friday except for a few hours today when I could finally make it home.  I'm back at work now for the foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I've noticed personally and from watching the stories on TV, is that during this crisis no one cares about the issues that the media says divides us.  It hasn't mattered what someone's race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc... is, we've all pulled together to help each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       During non-crisis times I just don't see the divide on the whole.  Even more so though, we've come together during this crisis.  Eventually, this nation will reach a national crisis brought about by the criminal banks, crooked politicians, corporate interests and deep state conspiracies.  I hope the nation will band together at that time as well...put aside the small differences...and realize what's important.  If so, we can show the same resolve us in Houston have shown to make sure the nation is set back on track and the criminal actors responsible for our nation's problems will be made to pay for their actions.

       It's because the media exeggerates events and the guys who you see in the media are brainwashed/co-opted and are possibly even staged to perform such events.

       Maybe we found the problem? People have too much idle time. The human animal is miserable in captivity. All these poor people trying to fill all this empty time and space, amusing themselves with nonsense issues because at least when they hate they are feeling something.

       Maybe the problem is the relentless drive by the media to keep us divided and when there is a disaster,
      </p>
      <p>
       the media talks about it
      </p>
      <p>
       and the people actually in the disaster aren't receiving constant reminders to disagree and find fault and blame and accuse?

       Nice work helping people in need, rock on. A lot of what you see on tv and "released" on YT is sensationalized up the wazoo. Spencer and antipasta are paid to show up. Just actors that represent almost nobody who's real.

       I've often wondered, what if all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by an outer -- a power from outer space, from another planet. Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens of the world, and wouldn't we come together to fight that particular threat?

       I don't see the divide either.  I live in a neighborhood with incredible diversity:  Pakistanis, Croatians, Ukrainians, El Salvadorans, Asians and Iranians live within 50 yards of me.  I see no racial tensions.  I believe it's fabricated.

       God Bless you and stay safe. I would love to hope people would stick together in a crisis as you described...but something makes me think that when there is a natural disaster there is no real blame... If a crisis came about because political figures or bankers, people maybe would take sides? but we would all lose. maybe I'm not sure, I've never ever experienced or seen any kind of national serious crisis in my short time here

       The divide works differently than what they want. There's definitely a divide, but I think it's more of a good vs bad divide.
