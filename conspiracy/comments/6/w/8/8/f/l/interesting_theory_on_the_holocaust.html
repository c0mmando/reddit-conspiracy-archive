        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I watched a YouTube video about a book called 1666 which explains the origins and history of the Illuminati. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vWMxHBuuP6U">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vWMxHBuuP6U</a></p>

<p>There is a lot of info on Zionism, old fake messiahs from the past 500 years who gave rise to many evils, info on Khazaria, the rothschilds and much more. </p>

<p>Skipping to the Armenian Holocaust and Israeli Holocaust, this is what I gathered. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>A dark version of religion which is often linked to the Talmud began its rise from the 1600s through fake messiahs; one of them being Sebastian Frank. Frank, the second of the false messiahs asked Adam Weishaupt to create the Illuminati. </p></li>
<li><p>Eventually this evil grew and can be associated with modern Day Zionists or Satanists. </p></li>
<li><p>The Rothschild family members are obviously very high ranking members to this dark faction. He wanted to create a land that he could call his own so he dreamt up Israel. He wanted to put it in Jerusalem which was very shitty place to live at the time (i.e. Without roads, hard to find a decent meal, etc..). The reason they chose Jerusulem is because it is dead center in the world which they wished to enslave from a central capital. They originally posted churches on the highest points of Jerusalem to attract Jews. </p></li>
<li><p>These dark talmudists always tried to convert ordinary Jews into Talmudists. They really wanted a Jewish population of Talmudists in the new Israel but that is hard to do because many are unwilling to tolerate evil. They were able to squeeze out a few from the death camps. They spared the lives of those they could convert and imported them into Jerusalem. </p></li>
<li><p>Another problem was getting all the Jews to move to Jerusalem since jeruselum was not as good as places like Germany where they lived well. </p></li>
<li><p>The Zionists decided to make the lives of Jews so horrific in places like Germany that they would flee like refugees to Israel falling right into the trap of the Zionists. </p></li>
<li><p>They had to conduct a dry run in the Holocaust so they went over to the Turkish Masonic lodges and infiltrated them like they do around the world in other Masonic lodges. Once they took over, they ran a dry run by holocausting the Armenians and taking over Turkey. This group of Zionists cleverly called themselves the &quot;Young Turks&quot; thereby tricking everyone into thinking Turks holocausted the Armenians. </p></li>
<li><p>Eventually they used not only Hitler, but also Stalin to make Jewish life hellish and dangerous until many were willing to go to Jerusalem. I believe the author mentioned 70,000 Jews migrated from Germany alone. </p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, a less far fetched theory would be that Jews, successfully took over the institutions of countries that gave them the liberty to engage in their finances, economy, fashion, and everything else through helping one another ( helping Jews ) and benefiting themselves at your expense. </p>

<p>And once they built the social capital, by exploiting and abusing the social freedoms and liberties that are provided by degenerates such as Washington, and the entire aristocracy of America, Britian, Germany, Italy and almost every other country, are now working towards their own religious initiatives for the past 60-100 years at once again, your expense.</p>

<p>So, what did you expect?</p>
