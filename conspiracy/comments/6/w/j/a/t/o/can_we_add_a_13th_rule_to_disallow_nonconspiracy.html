<p>To clean up the sub, just add a 13th rule:</p>

<p>&quot;Posts must be related to a conspiracy or will be removed without warning&quot;</p>

<p>Then we just need the mods to get their act together and remove all the political junk with reference to the rule. </p>

<p>We can agree that the &#39;mod&#39; system is broken, however, it is what it is and if we want to continue to use reddit then we have to accept that system. SO. In the end it always comes down to relying on the mods judgement. </p>

<p>By having a Rule 13, we give the mods the framework to delete posts (and ban users if necessary). As it is, they don&#39;t have that framework (rule) so they don&#39;t follow it (of course) and the result is that the sub is full of shit and people going elsewhere..</p>

<p>Although you could probably make an argument that his new ConspiracyRight sub could be partly responsible for this recent flood of political crap. His sub is more T_D light than conspiracy ever was. The rules even go so far as stating that users should repeatedly call out anyone who is not a &quot;right wing patriot&quot; until he notices and bans them. Several of the articles that have been posted here were also posted there. It&#39;s not much of a stretch to imagine that users who post there also cross post here to push their agenda to a larger audience. </p>
