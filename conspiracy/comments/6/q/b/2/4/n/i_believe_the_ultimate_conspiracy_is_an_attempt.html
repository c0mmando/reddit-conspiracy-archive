    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I like this one! You are absolutely right, imo.</p>

<p>What gives me hope is the next step of the conspiracy which is that we are far more powerful than we know. And that we can tap into that power any time because we are source, and if we learned to hone our inner reality into something beautiful, it immediately changes the external reality. That&#39;s how we win.</p>

<p>Yes, and the exciting thing about taking responsibility is realizing we have the keys in our own pocket. That&#39;s also the scary thing, too, because we can&#39;t crouch our inaction or helplessness on being chained up anymore--the excuse no longer holds water.

<p>Faraday cages do not shield ELF and millimeter waves (5G). Best to wear brain shielding. See the Shielding: Brain wiki and Shielding: Clay wiki in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt the spiritual. What I doubt is people spreading bs that gives the average person hope. Real hope comes from within. A will to exceed, not what another claims we are capable of or not. Get off your ass behind the computer, pick up the closest weapon to you and take action against the elite! That&#39;s how you gain freedom, by exorcising free will not giving a speech online. Take your family, red pill then and put the elite in their place.</p>

Mine is knowledge and understanding, the spiritual is just a natural element that would be foolish to ignore. Also just as foolish to find a false sense of hope out of. It should be used as a tool to gauge your perspective on what your relationship is to world around you, and  guide you on w.e role you have to play in it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I definitely feel you man, that isn&#39;t the way you can fight this. The whole system those elites have put in place is to stop exactly that: the peasants revolting. Even that use of violence feeds into them. And short of getting almost all of them in one go, you won&#39;t be able to do much. The best way to fight it is a combination of what you said and what the other guy said, get your family, try to participate in capitalism the least you can, and just be nice to each other :). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re on to something.</p>

<p>I subscribe to <a href="/r/Astralprojection">/r/Astralprojection</a> and there was a post about Astral projecting go area 51.</p>

<p>They were blocked somehow, and they don&#39;t know if that was due to them being blocked by their own conceptions or if something was actually in that realm blocking them.</p>

<p>Interesting to say the least!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah have always been interested in these projections, I don&#39;t doubt them at all, I haven&#39;t been able achieve said results for a couple diff reasons. Though have gathered that the astral world is in pretty bad shape. Very interesting, well it&#39;s hardly even a conspiracy, the military has shown quite an interest in metaphysic, perhaps they have a better understanding than we think </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they do block off certain aspects of that &quot;realm&quot;.</p>

<p>But perhaps for another reason ? </p>

<p>Have you ever imagined/conceptualized consciousness or the &quot;spiritual&quot; aspects of our world as a form of technology ?</p>

<p>When we look at all these mystery Babylon magical and secret societies, at those connections between vibrations/frequency/harmonics &amp; consciousness, at sacred geometry &amp; consciousness, at the power of intention &amp; intuition, at astral projection/remote viewing and so on...</p>

<p>I become more and more convinced, that it is all a form of technology, which the elites tap into and that they dont want us to realize/actualize/utilize.</p>

<p>Some sort of... &quot;memetic technology&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah y&#39;all believe that, are aware of the ancient roots of groups like Freemasons, but still believe the philosophers of the old days were revolutionaries instead of controlled actors like Bill Nye and Neil Degrass Tyson today. You know they&#39;re at war with the common man; fluoride, negative frequencies, chemtrails, vaccines, media programming presented as entertainment, an intentionally bad education system, etc. You know the moon landings were fake (considering which sub this is), you know the governments lie, and from that you should infer that there&#39;s something they&#39;ve been doing to us since before you were born. </p>

<p>But you still think it&#39;s the world that goes around the sun? Think about the deep differences between that, and who you could have been if you were raised knowing you were at the center of the universe? That the sun, moon, and stars rotate around you, daily, and synced? That intelligent design was logical? </p>

<p>TPTB want you to think reality is an accident, that nothing matters, nothing spiritual exists, that your ancestors are monkeys all while their people know the truth. Lots of people know the truth but they like the status quo. </p>

<p>Look at an animation of Spaceship Earth, then at one of the flat Earth model. Go outside and see which one you&#39;re in. What amateur experiments could you do to help you decide, with today&#39;s technology? There ya go, that&#39;s why there are at least 3 flat Earth YouTube channels with &gt;100,000 subscribers (Eric Dubay, Rob Skiba, RichieFromBoston, and ODD Reality is closing-in). </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to research flat Earth, then I&#39;d recommend researching the globe Earth--what causes day and night, the seasons, eclipses, moon phases, crepuscular and anti-crepuscular rays, the origin of species, the relative positions of the moon and stars in timelapse footage. I know you learned all that in school, I did too, but when you&#39;re old enough to ask real questions it comes apart fast. </p>

<p>The biggest attack on our conscious is the WAR ON DRUGS. Which is why we need to end it as soon as possible and legalize all drugs, especially psychedelics. </p>

<p>The easiest and most dramatic way to tap into the collective unconscious is through DMT. I&#39;ve been lucky to smoke DMT a couple hundred times, and I&#39;m passionate about it as the tool for humanity to advance and find our origins and the nature of interconnected consciousness. Anyone interested- here are a ton of stories and some art that I&#39;ve said. I know it&#39;s long, but worth perusing:</p>

Actually, I have a feeling that the calcification is necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is strong eye abilities? Why would the calcification be necessary for it? I&#39;m not saying it destroys it all together. It undoubtedly has an effect, which I find suspiscious considering all the other detrimental aspects of the substance. Please watch this documentary. This made me more upset than probably any other documentary Iv ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqstwfKGzPI">https://youtu.be/GqstwfKGzPI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong – I&#39;ve been trying to avoid fluoride since the mid-90s; however, in recent years I have been applying myself to the development of various spiritual/psychic abilities – e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>clairvoyance</li>
<li>remote viewing</li>
<li>ability to see ghosts and other denizens of what I think could be the &#39;bardpo&#39;</li>
<li>telekinesis</li>
<li>ability to see auras and bioenergetic fields.</li>
<li>shamanic travelling / astral projection</li>
</ul>

<p>I still take in fluoride, but as little as possible. Perhaps my progress is being hampered, but it&#39;s definitely &#39;good enough&#39; and it&#39;s getting better and better the more I meditate and conduct my other exercises I&#39;ve developed to help develop these abilities.</p>

<p>So, I guess what I wonder is that so many people talk about fluoride fucking up your pineal, but most of these people haven&#39;t gotten to the point where they&#39;re actually able to evaluate the functioning of their pineal – i.e., they can&#39;t see all the crazy psychic shit that I can now see (after 5+ years of working on it daily).</p>

<p>So, while avoiding fluoride might be useful, it&#39;s far more useful to avoid stress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a heavily targeted individual I know the one thing they hate most is when I meditate, induced feelings of pain when I meditate, try to influence energy with my mind and between sleep/wake state so it&#39;s almost impossible to astral travel. My whole targeting started when I started to meditate, they did try to use me to spread alien disinfo with fake experiences and hoped my curiosity would end once I found out most of my experiences were bullshit but I didn&#39;t, I know how powerful our minds can be. It&#39;s a spiritual war in a sense that it&#39;s up to every individual to overcome these fake constructs of reality they&#39;ve created around us and become more aware and vigilant towards their wrongdoings. After all, can&#39;t have spirits floating around in the astral realm all willy nilly, could cause some serious problems for them y&#39;know. Only people that really get to experience remote viewing, astral travel or all these cool innate powers are heavily monitored and controlled. The amount of involvement between the CIA and Farsight Institute should say enough. It&#39;s a tool to reel them in then bombard people with fake technologically induced experiences of aliens, demons, deceased family even fake remote viewing experiences. They can induce faint images and sounds while awake that would seem like your own thoughts and they can induce 3D like dreams that seem totally real. I can&#39;t for the life of me find a more compelling reason to why they&#39;d go to such lengths (even considering all the fake religions) either than it&#39;s to keep us in the dark about our true nature, that everything is connected and we&#39;re able to tap in to this collective mind at will. Sadly we&#39;ve given up our will for the most part with all the distractions they&#39;ve created and this is the world we get that&#39;s been built through us, only question is will we wake up in time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very simple. At first there was the word......they use words. They spell things. Many are not aware of the context they learn a word. So they get confused when the rulers use the formal definition. That is the difference between the rulers and the ruled. The power of the word. </p>

<p>An example: the media using the word teenager instead of adult in the Michael Brown situation. </p>

<p>Another example: using the word they&#39;re instead of their when transcribing Trump&#39;s speech. </p>

<p>It really is as simple as strategically using a word and understanding basic human psychology/social behavior. This is how it is done. </p>

<p>If someone is psychologically engineering society to keep kids viewed as teenagers longer, I don&#39;t see the harm. I don&#39;t want to live in a world where our 18 year olds are viewed the same as our 30 year olds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think they are responsible and I am no advocate of never ending adolescence. In fact, I&#39;m cognizant of the repercussions of encouraging it. I also don&#39;t think it is deceptive to use the word teenager when referencing any 18 year old who has been shot dead. </p>

<p>I know plenty of adults who shouldn&#39;t be able to vote due to their ignorance and inability to recognize the role they must play in order for a civilized republic to be successful.   I know plenty of adults who are irresponsible as they could possibly be.  </p>

<p>Still see no malfeasance with calling an 18 year old a teenager. That is what they are. </p>

Wes talks about this (and much more) throughout his papers. It&#39;s a very interesting read. Only for open minds though.
Many times the web site is taken down. I wonder why...
anyway, if you interested just go to wespenre.com/
