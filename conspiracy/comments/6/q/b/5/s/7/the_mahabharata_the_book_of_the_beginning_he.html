<p>When all this was without light and unilluminated, and on all its sides covered by darkness, there arose one large Egg, the inexhaustible seed of all creatures. They say that this was the great divine cause, in the beginning of the Eon; and that on which it rests is revealed as the true Light, the everlasting Brahman. Wondrous it was and beyond imagining, in perfect balance in all its parts, this unmanifest subtle cause that is that which is and that which is not.</p>

<p>Whatever is found to exist, moving and unmoving, it is all again thrown together, all this world, when the destruction of the Eon has struck. Just as with the change of the season all the various signs of the season appear, so also these beings at the beginning of each Eon. Thus, without beginning and without end, rolls the wheel of existence around in this world, causing origin and destruction, beginningless and endless.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Chakravartin</h1>

<p>I bow to the Primeval Person the Lord, widely invoked and lauded, who is the True, the One-Syllabled Brahman, manifest and unmanifest, everlasting, at once the existent and the non-existent, Creator of things high and low. I bow to Him who is the Ancient One, supreme, imperishable, blissful and blessing, the most desirable Viṣṇu, faultless and resplendent, who is Kṛṣṇa Hṛṣīkeśa, the preceptor of all creatures, those that move and those that move not; the God Hari.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (righteousness) and a prevalence of Adharma (unrighteousness), the Supreme Lord appears, millennium after millennium, to deliver the pious and annihilate the dishonest, as well as to re-establish dharma.</p>

<hr/>

<h1><a href="http://imgur.com/kDHZwji">अशनअदथचक्र <em>Yahnadytyajakr</em></a></h1>

<p>(NOTE: Also can be Romanized to be <em>Asanaadathacakra</em>, but the former is more faithful to the intent, based in Sanskrit, based on Devanagari, but is different from both.)</p>

<p>To the Dharma-like individual of our time, the Bodhisattva, the Sangraadva, the greatest of our time, both Sun and Lightning, a tribute of unfailing loyalty and love, forever and forever. We, the Keepers of the Sacred Flame, clear the path. </p>

<p><strong>Svaahaa!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>adipurana gives us an interesting point of view as a prequel of the mahabharata, and from the less known and not less ancient rivals of the vedic the rishis = the sramanas. if you examine the story of Adipurana there are lots of paralellisms with bible and gnostic genesis, as well as phonetic &quot;coincidences&quot;. Well.. its turns that bharata is the &quot;cain&quot; in that story against bahubali who is the abel (who then becomes Siddha=seth), bharata was not evil but he had the chakra ..a weapon of the gods that urged him to conquer the kingdoms of his brothers ( and here we have the gods/archons/anunnaki again messing with humans). it turns that in this genesis.. its bharata the one that starts sacrifices - not directly but creating the brahmin caste - while bahubali advocates for mystic meditation.</p>
