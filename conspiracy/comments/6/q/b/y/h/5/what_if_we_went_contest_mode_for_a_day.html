       Way back then, I made a comment about the time I had to use my gun to protect a girl that had been stabbed in a carjacking. I didn't think it was a big deal comment, I just made the comment, went to bed, and woke up to thousands of up and down votes, and probably three hundred conments, most calling me a liar. I was so freaked out that I abandoned the account.

       In Reddit account settings you can choose to have a little cross next to comments' scores if that comment has been "downvoted and upvoted by a large number of people".
      </p>
      <p>
       This cross thing is a poor alternative to the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       number of up &amp; downvotes that used to be displayed. (Btw

       if you want to understand why they really stopped showing them).

       Reddit never showed up and downvotes on comment/post, but it was in the API so things like RES could show it, but they removed it because people focused too much on those numbers and it interfered with vote fuzzing.

       You don't care so much that you made an entire thread about changing the way the subreddit displays vote counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how that makes no sense? You obviously care. So back to my original question: What label do you give yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because by your own words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The honest users don't care about votes.
       </p>

       And I'll state it again, you very obviously care. You would not have made this thread otherwise.
      </p>

       So please tell us what label we should give you.

       I was asking you what the opposite of an "honest user" was.

       You said "honest user's don't care about votes." You made a thread where you put on full display how you care about votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you yourself are openly stating you're not whatever an "honest user" is, so what is the opposite of that? What are the other users who aren't honest?

       I like this idea.  This could be used in other ways too.....like a big trampoline.  See how many people we can get on here to jump and see what kind of an effect we can have.

       Like being able to test the shill effect for people who don't see it.  If there is no response, it would be abnormal compared to other certain topics.  If there is a kickback, it can be easily identified.

       I would vote in favor of, temporarily and experimentally, setting all politician centric political posts to contest mode just to see how it effects things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am weary of overly general wording such as "all political posts" because once implemented there could be an argument made that just about everything ever posted in Conspiracy is politically relevant somehow.  You then get into shit fights about "why isn't this pizza gate post in contest mode, it's obviously just trying to make the DNC look bad" or "why isn't this post about opium fields in Afghanistan on contest mode, it's obviously just anti-trump propaganda".
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the kind of details and technicalities the mods must consider, and probably a lot more of them, when trying out a new policy.  We don't like any of our rules to affect one subject unevenly than all the other subjects.  I think that tends to slide towards censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       However contest mode for politician centric posts such as "Trump did this!" "DWS did that!" might thin the crop to a manageable level and make such an experiment worthwhile.

       Who do you think would oppose this change? I can't see any reason it would effect discourse in any way but positive.

       The vote brigading and manipulation is happening on the threads themselves, not the comment chains. The vast, vast majority of it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting threads into contest mode does nothing to solve that problem and only serves to censor community discussion.

       Not to mention I actually agree with Flytape. Almost everything conspiracy related is directly related to politics, if not roundaboutly so. The only way that such a rule could be implemented would be to have it as a forced default for every single thread.

       That's just plain false. We have a huge problem with brigades that only come here to shit on the sub, the discussions and it's users and their comments are
       <em>
        somehow
       </em>
       voted to the top in the majority of the cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that wants that trend to continue is not here for the discussion and instead has questionable intentions.

       I can't speak for other people but I accept that they are free to have opinions different than mine.  What seems obvious to you or me might not work out the way we imagine it will, that's why experimental exercises are useful.

       Honestly, it's really only the
       <em>
        top
       </em>
       post in the sub that ever gets targeted in a big way...my thought was that we automatically have #1 threads go to contests mode.

       No, I've seen it on several political submissions. It is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       only the top submission, it is
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       submission that gain traction and votes.

       Fair enough...I do anticipate a lot of calls of censorship if we start enabling contest mode at our own discretion. There would need to be guidelines.

       Axolotl, they will cry about it even if there are guidelines.

       It may be time to start asking whether the future of the sub is more important than the whining of shills. Are you enjoying this? People are moving on, no longer commenting as much, and the content is starting to mirror politics, or brigaded to hell. How long do the mods plan to "ride it out" while the users have to engage with those that are only here to harass real users? Can you walk me through the current plan for dealing with the problem?
