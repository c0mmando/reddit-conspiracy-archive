<p>This cross thing is a poor alternative to the <em>actual</em> number of up &amp; downvotes that used to be displayed.

    <div class="md"><p>I like this idea.  This could be used in other ways too.....like a big trampoline.  See how many people we can get on here to jump and see what kind of an effect we can have.</p>

<p>Like being able to test the shill effect for people who don&#39;t see it.  If there is no response, it would be abnormal compared to other certain topics.  If there is a kickback, it can be easily identified.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>Thank you for doubling down on showing how much you care about votes though. </p>

<p>The honest users don&#39;t care about votes.</p>

<p>Crazy how you need to keep bringing up votes when &quot;honest users&quot; aren&#39;t supposed to care about them.</p>

<p>regardless of how I&#39;m downvoted.</p>

<p>^ Like right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would vote in favor of, temporarily and experimentally, setting all politician centric political posts to contest mode just to see how it effects things.</p>

<p>I am weary of overly general wording such as &quot;all political posts&quot; because once implemented there could be an argument made that just about everything ever posted in Conspiracy is politically relevant somehow.  You then get into shit fights about &quot;why isn&#39;t this pizza gate post in contest mode, it&#39;s obviously just trying to make the DNC look bad&quot; or &quot;why isn&#39;t this post about opium fields in Afghanistan on contest mode, it&#39;s obviously just anti-trump propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>These are the kind of details and technicalities the mods must consider, and probably a lot more of them, when trying out a new policy.  We don&#39;t like any of our rules to affect one subject unevenly than all the other subjects.  I think that tends to slide towards censorship.</p>

<p>However contest mode for politician centric posts such as &quot;Trump did this!&quot; &quot;DWS did that!&quot; might thin the crop to a manageable level and make such an experiment worthwhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vote brigading we see is happening <em>right now</em> and censures comments daily. Contested mode solves much of this, that is not very difficulty to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vote brigading and manipulation is happening on the threads themselves, not the comment chains. The vast, vast majority of it anyway. </p>

<p>Putting threads into contest mode does nothing to solve that problem and only serves to censor community discussion. </p>

<p>Not to mention I actually agree with Flytape. Almost everything conspiracy related is directly related to politics, if not roundaboutly so. The only way that such a rule could be implemented would be to have it as a forced default for every single thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just plain false. We have a huge problem with brigades that only come here to shit on the sub, the discussions and it&#39;s users and their comments are <em>somehow</em> voted to the top in the majority of the cases.</p>

<p>It may be time to start asking whether the future of the sub is more important than the whining of shills. Are you enjoying this? People are moving on, no longer commenting as much, and the content is starting to mirror politics, or brigaded to hell. How long do the mods plan to &quot;ride it out&quot; while the users have to engage with those that are only here to harass real users? Can you walk me through the current plan for dealing with the problem? </p>
