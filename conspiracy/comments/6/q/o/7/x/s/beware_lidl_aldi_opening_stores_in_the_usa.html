       Irish here and don't actually agree that they price others out so much as offer lower cost alternatives. There's still a value judgement to be made and beyond basic grocery a lot of their stuff is shit. I wouldn't touch the meat, the veg is weak, and a lot of the imitation product is so inferior it's laughable. Proof of this being that our most expensive supermarket chain is still our most popular. We have cost of living and taxation issues that, without these budget chains, it would be impossible to afford decent food for many many people.

       2nd that.

       Also...
The local Dublin grocer was long put out of business by spar/centra/tesco express.

       If Lidl or Aldi can fuck them in the ass for that, fair play to them.

       Exactly! My hometown has had a lidl and a Tesco for years. The problems only really happened when they built a new super-Tesco that bypassed the entire town. Now folks just go there. Even in our barely-post-austerity state convenience appears to be king.

       I live in a fairly rough part of dublin. Known to be a low income, high unemployment area with high rise flats (you can probably guess where from that description).

       We have 2 eurospars and a tesco express. We have no stand alone fruit&amp;veg or newsagent.

       Sounds like walmart grocery. Just awful, I'm so glad walmart gives me so many reasons to spend my money elsewhere. Their produce actually looks beautiful. But the tomatoes, grapes, bananas, and squash all taste like each other.

       Walmart are going to be their main competition I imagine, and I don't see why people would have a problem with that. Would have said so sooner, but didn't want to draw false equivalence as i'm not sure of Walmart's fresh food offerings.

       That's a valid concern. From what I know; they pay well above minimum wage and all levels of management from trainee and up are well paid. They do work staff extremely hard though, so it's not for the faint of heart. It's so different from the supermarket norm that you would need to be relatively fit and healthy just to pack shelves on schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see their real competition segment as imitative product  for people who don't care for the difference - the "it's all made in the same factory" crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a race to the bottom for pricing on the side of food producers which I abhor (as a country with dependence on agri sectors), but that is a whole quagmire that extends far beyond the individual companies and into the heart of European policy. Our boy Phil Hogan is over there making a mess of things right now! A great lad! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Approach with all the valid skepticism you can though, because the structure of labor rates, taxation, etc. might not fit the German model as well as it does here. This could lead to them being much more underhanded. Just because Ireland has broadly benefited from their presence doesn't make it a bed of roses.

       I don't see anything wrong with cheap produce that is locally obtained. Makes the other supermarkets need to step up and lower their prices. In Britain ALDI is number 5 and just about to take over Morrisons at number 4. I don't see anything wrong with cheap competition.

       Supermarkets are known to cause farm prices to suffer &amp; government assistance becomes needed to prop up farms,these chains are a result of fascism &amp; I'm afraid England was wrecked long ago by their actions,you will find out when the boats stop just how bad these cancer companies are for a cunt-tree.

       Most of the Aldis I've seen are in places that otherwise would not have a decent grocery. There's something to be said for small locally owned business but when those aren't around in the first place something like Aldi can be a real benefit

       The reason the locals can't setup a store like lidl is the rents imposed can only be payed by corporations that are cancer.

       There's a lot of neighborhoods near me that have become a ghost town for most stores but they have an Aldi at least. It helps prevent people from having to jump on public transit to another neighborhood to shop.

       Not saying they don't supply a service that is needed but that the service is just another stepping stone to local peoples losing power over industry that should be in the hands of those who live in an area.

       I live in the north eastern US- been shopping at 3 different Aldi stores  for well over a decade. The workers are mostly young adult local Americans, except for the one store that's in an area with a large Hispanic community (and that store sells a much better variety of spices.) They don't seem to have affected other businesses in their areas.
