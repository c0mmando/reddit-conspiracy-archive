    <div class="md"><p>Irish here and don&#39;t actually agree that they price others out so much as offer lower cost alternatives. There&#39;s still a value judgement to be made and beyond basic grocery a lot of their stuff is shit. I wouldn&#39;t touch the meat, the veg is weak, and a lot of the imitation product is so inferior it&#39;s laughable. Proof of this being that our most expensive supermarket chain is still our most popular. We have cost of living and taxation issues that, without these budget chains, it would be impossible to afford decent food for many many people.</p>

The local Dublin grocer was long put out of business by spar/centra/tesco express. </p>

<p>If Lidl or Aldi can fuck them in the ass for that, fair play to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! My hometown has had a lidl and a Tesco for years. The problems only really happened when they built a new super-Tesco that bypassed the entire town. Now folks just go there. Even in our barely-post-austerity state convenience appears to be king.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a valid concern. From what I know; they pay well above minimum wage and all levels of management from trainee and up are well paid. They do work staff extremely hard though, so it&#39;s not for the faint of heart. It&#39;s so different from the supermarket norm that you would need to be relatively fit and healthy just to pack shelves on schedule.</p>

<p>I see their real competition segment as imitative product  for people who don&#39;t care for the difference - the &quot;it&#39;s all made in the same factory&quot; crowd.</p>

<p>There is a race to the bottom for pricing on the side of food producers which I abhor (as a country with dependence on agri sectors), but that is a whole quagmire that extends far beyond the individual companies and into the heart of European policy. Our boy Phil Hogan is over there making a mess of things right now! A great lad! /s</p>

<p>Approach with all the valid skepticism you can though, because the structure of labor rates, taxation, etc. might not fit the German model as well as it does here. This could lead to them being much more underhanded. Just because Ireland has broadly benefited from their presence doesn&#39;t make it a bed of roses.</p>
