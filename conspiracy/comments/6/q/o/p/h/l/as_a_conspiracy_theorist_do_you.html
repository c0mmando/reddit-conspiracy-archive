       feel that you question "deeper" things about life in general?

       I sometimes wonder if the two are related. So just curious if the people here who claim they are conspiracy theorists if you also feel like, compared to the average person, you question things about life that others don't.

       I guess the universe in general, questioning why were are here on this earth, if there are "others" out there lol. things like that... or even marveling at how crazy it is that we are on this planet, spinning, with all these other animals, questioning consciousness and existence in general.

       But yes, I find that the most existential thinkers amongst my friends are also the ones that will sit down and debate elite pedophilia, 9/11, JFK or collective consciousness (or whatever)

       I think the two go hand in hand. I've always sought answers for the "meaning of life" and that required research. That's when the anomalies started becoming apparent to me. Then the suspicion, until I was finally completely convinced of the fix.

       Trying to see beyond the facade of everyday facts becomes a habit.
       <br/>
       so, yes, i find myself a lot wondering and pondering about normal stuff, without deeper or hidden meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       does that make me "deeper"? not sure, probably not.

       does that make me notice details, that other people miss sometimes? yes.

       Part of me almost misses the days when people would tell you bullshit and get away with "I saw it on 60 Minutes" or "I read it in Reader's Digest". I mean, you had to really be dedicated to march down to the library and battle the Dewey Decimal system for a solid day to debunk a single bit of bull, lol.

       It's not just conspiracy theorists that look at their society and world with a critical eye. There has always been opposition to elite gangsters and mobsters like Trump since the dawn of civilisation. The joke is these elitist mobsters think they can eradicate such opposition but the opposition will never die. Once you are in it and enlightened to the mechanisms of the ruling mobsters you can never get out it's the human spirit. As of late M13 and 18 street has been in the spotlight for their monstrosities yet they do not hold a candle to these elite mobsters that rule and govern our countries. So conspiracy theorists are just one prong of the opposition, and relatively new compared the the actual history of open rebellion and opposition to these elite mobsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Trump is coming off as nothing but a piece of trash gangster, his speech fostering police brutality is nothing short of it...reflects with his new reality tv show - The Trumps running the White House.

       When a person questions "deeper" things about life in general, they also need to be able to tell when a theory or idea holds together logically and when it doesn't hold together.

       Einstein thought deeply and his theories were proven correct.

       People who believe that "chemtrails" are a gov't plot will never be proven correct.

       Sometimes an event like the JFK assassination produces many inconsistent conspiracy theories. They can't all be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years ago some believed a person had developed a system that would allow you to get 100 mpg of gas and the oil companies suppressed that device. Sadly, no conspiracy theorist ever said, "What man has made, man can make again." If they had they would have become very, very rich.

       I think being a conspiracy theorist is usually found in people that are more sure of themselves. It is very difficult to be on the outskirts of society believing many things the masses don't. Continuing to value this sort of sparsely circulated information requires a certain degree of belief in ones self and ones ability to understand and make sense of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would say yes, I would imagine many conspiracy theorists do think about deeper topics more often than the general population. Most people are terrified to question their own beliefs and/or don't have enough self-confidence to stand up for their beliefs.

       Isn't that a trap though? Are they sure of themselves because 'they have the answers'?

       They may develop a false sense of security that every avenue they explore is legit and worthy of question. And since most conspiracy theories stay theories, they are never proven wrong. So deeper they go. They'll miss the banker working with the politician to find the secret ingredient in Smarties.

       That is just one extreme. In the way that the extreme on the other side is believing everything on the news or out of the mouth of the government.

       True, the source must be considered. Is the politician coming up for re-election or looking to cash in later in the private sector and does the conspiracy theorist have a book or something coming out.

       I personally wonder what the motive is behind everything we're shown. Everything has a purpose, which lately seems to be only to outrage or scare, or to remove any secure footing you felt you had about our place in the world. Threats exist everywhere, we're all targets of someone, and there's not much we can do about it except put our faith in the suits on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you think about it: what's the reason we're being shown what we're being shown? Why show me war and bombings and 'the rise of terrorism', why tell me about the refugee crisis, why show us all this stuff about Trump and jumping from crisis to crisis while, statistically, we live in a safer world than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I question. Sometimes vocally, but most of the time I just turn off and disconnect from what's being force fed to all of us but I'm wondering about the big agenda behind it all and why these people in suits on screens feel this is necessary to know.

       A conspiracy theorist is simply a person who tries to ask the right questions. The ablity to entertain an idea comes from an educated mind! When you combine the two you get what is known a free thinker. As as an educated freethinker or conspiracy theorist, we know everything we ever learned to be true was once a conspiracy and that new things happen everyday.
