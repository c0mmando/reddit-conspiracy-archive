    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just conspiracy theorists that look at their society and world with a critical eye. There has always been opposition to elite gangsters and mobsters like Trump since the dawn of civilisation. The joke is these elitist mobsters think they can eradicate such opposition but the opposition will never die. Once you are in it and enlightened to the mechanisms of the ruling mobsters you can never get out it&#39;s the human spirit. As of late M13 and 18 street has been in the spotlight for their monstrosities yet they do not hold a candle to these elite mobsters that rule and govern our countries. So conspiracy theorists are just one prong of the opposition, and relatively new compared the the actual history of open rebellion and opposition to these elite mobsters. </p>

<p>Also, Trump is coming off as nothing but a piece of trash gangster, his speech fostering police brutality is nothing short of it...reflects with his new reality tv show - The Trumps running the White House. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When a person questions &quot;deeper&quot; things about life in general, they also need to be able to tell when a theory or idea holds together logically and when it doesn&#39;t hold together.</p>

<p>Einstein thought deeply and his theories were proven correct.</p>

<p>People who believe that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are a gov&#39;t plot will never be proven correct.</p>

<p>Sometimes an event like the JFK assassination produces many inconsistent conspiracy theories. They can&#39;t all be right. </p>

<p>Years ago some believed a person had developed a system that would allow you to get 100 mpg of gas and the oil companies suppressed that device. Sadly, no conspiracy theorist ever said, &quot;What man has made, man can make again.&quot; If they had they would have become very, very rich.</p>

<p>As I say about Alex Jones, &quot;When has he ever been proven right?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think being a conspiracy theorist is usually found in people that are more sure of themselves. It is very difficult to be on the outskirts of society believing many things the masses don&#39;t. Continuing to value this sort of sparsely circulated information requires a certain degree of belief in ones self and ones ability to understand and make sense of the world.</p>

<p>So I would say yes, I would imagine many conspiracy theorists do think about deeper topics more often than the general population. Most people are terrified to question their own beliefs and/or don&#39;t have enough self-confidence to stand up for their beliefs.</p>

<p>They may develop a false sense of security that every avenue they explore is legit and worthy of question. And since most conspiracy theories stay theories, they are never proven wrong. So deeper they go. They&#39;ll miss the banker working with the politician to find the secret ingredient in Smarties.</p>

As soon as I did, I saw every crack as plain as day. It blows me away it&#39;s so difficult to make these so called politically inclined and intellectuals who think the world functions like a high school book says, see this shit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally wonder what the motive is behind everything we&#39;re shown. Everything has a purpose, which lately seems to be only to outrage or scare, or to remove any secure footing you felt you had about our place in the world. Threats exist everywhere, we&#39;re all targets of someone, and there&#39;s not much we can do about it except put our faith in the suits on TV.</p>

<p>So, you think about it: what&#39;s the reason we&#39;re being shown what we&#39;re being shown? Why show me war and bombings and &#39;the rise of terrorism&#39;, why tell me about the refugee crisis, why show us all this stuff about Trump and jumping from crisis to crisis while, statistically, we live in a safer world than ever before.</p>

<p>So yeah, I question. Sometimes vocally, but most of the time I just turn off and disconnect from what&#39;s being force fed to all of us but I&#39;m wondering about the big agenda behind it all and why these people in suits on screens feel this is necessary to know.</p>

<p>Keep us in our cages, even if they are well furnished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy theorist is simply a person who tries to ask the right questions. The ablity to entertain an idea comes from an educated mind! When you combine the two you get what is known a free thinker. As as an educated freethinker or conspiracy theorist, we know everything we ever learned to be true was once a conspiracy and that new things happen everyday.</p>
