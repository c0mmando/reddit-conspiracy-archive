According to an update provided by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis, Henry Boyd, their current assessment is as follows: “excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale, the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war D–30 inventory in combat operations.”

       Not sure where you got the Assange+Russia idea from, but I can tell you that you're being played. :-/ 
Why wouldn't Russia want to repeal the Magnitsky Act?
Trump Jr's emails are dependent on a false premise to begin with. Truth is that if he met with Israeli, Canadian, or someone in Bumfuck Egypt, and the media repeatedly told you to hate those people, you would be saying that Trump Jr colluded with Israel, Canada, Bumfuckeans, etc. And honestly, if Trump Jr falling for a lie about getting damning info about Clinton, which turned out to be a way for him to find out what's really behind the Magnitsky Act, is "collusion" with Russia, then what in the hell do people label the ACTUAL collusion disclosed in Clinton, DNC, and Podesta emails?

       Considering that I've seen people on this subreddit claim that Obama is CIA just because he worked for a firm that had a couple of journalists that also worked for CIA at that time, it's pretty strange that working for a Russian state news network doesn't raise red flags here.

       Almost everything raises a red flag with someone here.  The RT connection does raise a huge red flag with a lot of posters here, and there are others who consider Assange untouchable and will have some reasoning to support him in regards to the show.

       So if Sean Connery has a TV Show on an American TV network he is "compromised" and some sort of agent of the Americans? OK, now I get it.

       Yes, if Sean Connery has a TV Show on NPR or C-SPAN then he has ties to the government that runs those networks.

       It eludes me how democrats seem to be more upset about how the information from leaks was obtained then the fact that leaks proved collusion with in the DNC against their constituents to push a candidate that was not the people's choice. How is an american political party going against our people not more of a problem of a foreign government's interference? We should expect it from a foreign state that is their job, we shouldn't deal with half our government turning against the people. Hell even trump wanted sanders to win and he would have had his ass handed to him by sanders in the debates!

       You people are delusional. There is no ambiguity here, it is fact that The Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign colluded with several parties during the election period. She colluded with the DNC, the Obama administration, several main stream media organizations just to name a few of them.

    (1) Coordinating with the Clinton political campaign.

    (2) Colluding with the press to spin it positively.

    (3) Doing so BEFORE they released it to AN EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Clinton campaign was always a step ahead of the committee investigating them. Shameful.

Nick states "Just spoke to State" He goes on to reveal that State colluded with him about which emails are being revealed to committee and that the State plans to plant a story with AP.

Shows intent to withhold emails from the subpoena.

       <pre><code>This report that Clinton’s campaign was in direct communication with the Obama Department of Justice on the email investigation shows a level of collusion which calls into question the entire investigation into her private server.

On June 29, head of the DOJ, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton on a private plane for 30 minutes.  The meeting occurred hours before the House Select Committee on Benghazi released its final report to the public. Sneaking around during an investigation with the husband of the one being investigated is highly unethical and downright shady.

On October 28, Attorney General Lynch declined to comply with Congress regarding the secret Iran ransom payments. The top law enforcement official, The United Sates Attorney General, "declines to cooperate" with an investigation by Congress. Let that sink in.

        Rigging the primaries against Bernie Sanders (DNC favored Hillary)

“Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess. Specifically, DWS [DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz] had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign to do things because they’d either ignored or forgotten to something critical.”

“[Bernie is] someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.”

“He isn't going to be president.”

“[F]or KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”  

“If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct. They’ll probably complain regardless, actually."

       <pre><code>These emails were written by several leaders in the DNC. They are not supposed to take sides yet they clearly did months before any votes were cast. After the DNC leaks, their leader Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was fired, but immediately joined the Hillary Clinton campaign… think about that for a second. Remember… Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was placed at the top of the DNC once someone else stepped down, none other than Tim Kaine.  In a later leak, we learn that Tim Kaine was promised VP a year in advance, so the pieces were put in place to get Hillary nominated.

They even tried to attack his belief system. Hillary’s campaign has been helped and manufactured since the very beginning.

There were statistical anomalies in the primaries.  In states with only electronic voting machines, Hillary grossly out-performed exit polls, but when their were paper ballots/paper trail, exit polls matched the results.

Bernie Sanders activist and process server Shawn Lucas served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman-Schultz at DNC’s headquarters in a fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters. He was found dead a few weeks later on his bathroom floor.

"Bernie and his people have been bitching about super delegates and the huge percentage that have come out for Hillary… We want [Bernie supporters] to go home happy and enthusiastic in working their asses off for Hillary. Why not throw Bernie a bone . . . his people will think they've "won" something from the Party Establishment. And it functionally doesn't make any difference anyway. They win. We don't lose. Everyone is happy."

“I am doing the opposite, repeatedly writing friendly and positive pieces about Bernie as an HRC supporter, and when the time is right I will have money in the bank with him and his people as a liberal to urge them to come out in force to vote for HRC.”

"Frankly I thought it was dumb for McCaskill and Gutierrez to be attacking Bernie. We are going to need his voters to turn out in November for HRC, he won’t be nominated.”

"Through internal discussions, we concluded that it was in our interest to: 1) limit the number of debates (and the number in each state); 2) start the debates as late as possible; 3) keep debates out of the busy window between February 1 and February 27, 2016 (Iowa to South Carolina); 4) create a schedule that would allow the later debates to be cancelled if the race is for practical purposes over.”

       <p>
        ​
       </p>
       <pre><code>The person who wrote the superdelegate rules advises the Clinton Campaign how to create an illusion that Bernie people won something so they would work hard for Hillary after she is nominated. More shocking is the fact that they admit that the superdelegates are undemocratic. This guy flat out admitted that he rigged the system, and is proud of it.

There was also a man who was acting as a mole for Bernie and writing positive/negative things about him then using that reputation to sway Bernie supporters to Hillary.

Lastly, we see how to rig the debate schedule to be more favorable to her. One on one debates would have been better for Bernie Sanders, so they wanted to avoid that at all costs. They also wanted to limit the number of debates, and start them late to minimize the impact of the debates.

Hillary is also on audio insulting Bernie supporters by calling them "basement dwellers".

       Do you really think people aren't aware of all the shit revealed in the wikileaks releases? Is that really y'all's strategy? Banking that people won't do the research themselves? The DNC  and MSM were proven to be awash in corruption and rigged the primaries for their anointed candidate.

       Obtaining info from a foreign gov is most definitely not illegal as it does not hold a monetary value, which is what the law I know you're going to reference is talking about. Also there wasn't even information given to him. You're blind if you think there wasn't something illegal in those 33,000 emails deleted. Lots of the emails released show she was running pay for play schemes as sec of state and embezzling money from her foundation.

       Interpretation of things of value? In all the cases he referenced, no one was charged for obtaining information "as a thing of value". He is referencing cases in which people impersonated FBI agents to repossess things of value, such as a car and actual money. Not once was the law you're referring to mentioned. Not. Once. Every case he linked to was entirely irrelevant.

       No, it's not. Definitions vary from law to law. I do actually know how this stuff works. If Don Jr. Committed a crime as you say, and all the evidence is there, he would be arrested and charged. Any "lawyer" who says this is illegal is just trying to get publicity.

       The statute in question is 52 USC 30121, 36 USC 510 — the law governing foreign contributions to US campaigns. There are two key passages that apply here. This is the first:
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value, or expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation, in connection with any Federal, State, or local election

       Yeah and if you actually read the WHOLE law, they are clearly referencing funds or gifts. Opposition research has never once been illegal unless info was stolen such as watergate. I'm sure some lawyer could try to argue that thing of value includes information, but they would lose. Definitions most certainly very law to law, it even says so in the laws language what the definition of "contribution" is. So then you agree with me that opposition research is a common thing. You do realize that if oppo research from foreign gov was illegal Hillary would be in jail right? Along with pretty much every other politician?

       I know all that, I explained that REQUESTING a meeting PUBLICLY is not collusion, Don Jr could have publicly requested a meeting with Russian embassy officials inquiring about Clinton and it won't be collusion - that's research but when the foreign power offers you material and you take that meeting - then it becomes an in-kind donation.

       Lied about what? Meeting Russian gov officials? He didn't lie because that lawyer was not a government official. I don't understand your argument anymore. So you're saying that the law is against secrecy? Where in the law does it say the meeting has to be secret to be illegal? You're being such a hypocrite. First you say opposition research from a foreign gov is illegal, now it's only if it wasn't immediately revealed I guess? Mind showing me where in the law it says it's only illegal if it was a secret?

       Don Jr didn't go to the meeting for research, he went there to get 'dirt' on Clinton from a foreign power who wanted to ASSIST Trump's campaign. If Don Jr, went to the Russian embassy and requested info on Clinton, then that would be different, that's not what he did

       So you haven't actually read the law then. I already linked to you the FULL TEXT of the law, not some shitty blog. No where does it say the meetings had to be secret. Collecting dirt on an opponent is the definition of opposition research.

      <p>
       No, she didn't work for the government. Has some connections, but does not represent the gov. Furthermore "crown prosecutor" of Russia is not a real position. The lawyer even stated she lied to get a meeting with trump, as did everyone else who was there.

       You state that he broke the law because he acquired opposition research, a thing of value in your mind, from the Russian gov. That's not even true, but let's pretend that it is. With that logic, getting dirt on your opponent from Ukraine would fall under the same category. You can't deny that. Nowhere in the law does it say the meetings have to be secret to be illegal lol. If you are in favor of arresting don over this, you should also be in favor of arresting Hillary, otherwise you are a hypocrite. You have no argument

      <blockquote>

        Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under Shulyar, said she instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” recalled Telizhenko, who is now a political consultant in Kiev. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa,” he said, adding “Oksana was keeping it all quiet,” but “the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa.

       Researching isn't against the law, ACCEPTING unsolicited research from foreign government is because that's an in kind donation. If Trump went to that meeting without that email chain happening, then there won't be any illegal activity - the moment the meeting was setup where Russian government and their efforts were mentioned, that's when it became illegal.

       WTF MAN. It's information. A DNC worker was given damaging info on trump. The ONLY difference between the two is that the DNC actually got info and Don did not. Your precious law blog doesn't even mention what I'm talking about so your link is irrelevant. If offering help is all it takes to be illegal then THIS IS THE SAME THING. The DNC knew they were getting help from the Ukrainian gov as well and they accepted it. Then they lied about it. I don't know why you don't understand this. You are such a hypocrite it's actually kind of funny and this is amusing me.

       Nonsense, the DNC worker went through the legal channels, did everything publicly to get information about Manfort who had Ukrainian connections. That's complete opposite of what Jr did, he went into a meeting knowing nothing other than the fact that Russian government wanted to help him, that's where it becomes illegal.

This is like a kid saying that he was watching porn for research, you can't accept a solicitation by a prostitute and then when caught, say it was research. Anybody can claim anything to be research, when a foreign govt offers material, it borders into treason because they can blackmail you for quid pro quo.

       Do you? And in-kind donation involves trading something valuable in exchange for a good or service. What exactly was the "Russian lawyer" asking for in return? Oh nothing. That's right. Not to mention that "in-kind donation" never occurred. What about Hillary running pay for play schemes for donors to her foundation? Oh right you don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opposition research means collecting dirt on your opponent from ANYONE. That's what don did. That's what the DNC did. You are such a hypocrite I don't know why you're even trying. This must be embarrassing for you.

       You have ignored EVERY one of my points and continue to revert to your talking points and the same irrelevant blog lol.

       The law says nothing about in-kind donations. All you have to do is quote where in the law it says that opposition research is illegal only if it's in secret. I have quoted the law several times but you just refer to irrelevant blogs.
      </p>

       It's so easy. You could win right now. All you have to do is quote the law. That's it. Just give me a quote and I'll concede. Do it.

       It's illegal when it comes to FOREIGNERS. The secret part proves the collusion, the collusion to hide the illegal act of soliciting things of value from a foreign country

       This is so factually incorrect that I'm a bit shocked you'd even say it.

       First of all, opposition research clearly holds tremendous value, particularly if it was obtained from foreign intelligence sources.

       Second of all, accepting info IS collusion regardless of the value of anything obtained.

       If you actually read the law, it is referring to things that can be used to bribe an official, such as direct donations or gifts like a car. Show me where in the law it refers to information falling under that category. Have you even read the law? No info was even accepted. Everyone has confirmed that the lawyer lied to get a meeting with don.

No amount of your "experts" will convince me otherwise until I see don in handcuffs. But that's never gonna happen because no laws were broken lol. Call me when he's arrested, which would have happened already.

       I am here for an honest discussion, you just refuse to acknowledge any of my points and keep linking to "experts" without thinking for yourself. You want so desperately for there to be collusion but there isn't. I don't know why you would want that to be true so bad anyways. Try stepping away and looking at things objectively without having other people tell you how to think.

       At least we can agree on one thing though right? If this is illegal as you claim, then Hillary and McCain should be in prison as well right?

       I do think for myself, which is why when real legal experts point to the law that explicitly states that this is illegal I think it's credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean look at your posts, you're trying to deny that there was even any collusion when the email and the fact that they met proves beyond any doubt that there was in fact collusion. If you want to continue to deny that it's fine, but your denial doesn't change any of the facts of this case or the applicable laws.

       The email plainly states that the Russian government supported Trump, and promised compromising information to use against the Clinton's....... Trumps key campaign members then attended that meeting...... Junior confirmed both the email and the meeting...... And you want to try and say there was no collusion?

       So you are more upset contents of the hacked emails than Russia's attack on our democracy. So you're fine with Putin picking our president because you feel the DNC cheated you? I think what the DNC did to Bernie was terrible, but politics suck. But a foreign power interference with the heart of our democracy is an an act of war. It's wrong when we do it, and it's wrong of the Russians to do it to us.

       I'm glad the DNC emails were leaked. At least now I know the democrats are corrupt and how this joke of a democracy functions. It sucks, but it's better than the blissful ignorance of being a pawn for a government that is corrupted to the very core. Still zero accountability.

       I never said I was a democrat just saying they got dicked. And if my party did that to me I would never vote for that party again. And no I don't think they attacked our democracy because the democracy doesn't exist if either side or independents aren't doing what their voters are telling them to do i.e. putting hillary over bernie when the movement was clearly on his side.

       First of all, he didn't say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, "17 agencies" was never a lie either. There are four primary agencies that all agree Russia was involved, and the spokesman that represents all 17 said that he believes Russia was behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the actual hack is a pretty small piece of the total picture. Seriously, you have an actual email inviting Trump Jr to meet with Russian government officials to obtain information to use against Hillsry and you're claiming that there's no evidence?

       Did the Coast Guard look at it? No? Okay we are already at 16, ruling:3 Pinocchios. Speaking for them doesn't mean they agree, like the NSA said there is evidence Russia hacked but it's not limited to Russia and no one knows who WL's source is so they signed off saying it's possible but definitive. Kinda down to 3 if you actually count the ODNI which is actually just a bureaucracy not an intelligence agency similar to the way the Pentagon isn't actually the Army.

       Perhaps they did. Which is why the record has since been corrected. They didn't do so publicly because as Comey said in his own testimony, they couldn't reach out to the media to correct them on regarding the ongoing investigation going so far as to actually support Trumps claims that the leaks were real but the news regarding them were not.

       What that lacks in context is that Russia helped put the Steele Dossier together. So it actually sounds like the NSA is right that Russia hopefully for chaos. I'll concede that maybe later they picked their horse but this didn't necessarily start as a "help Trump operation".

       Yea I get that, but the "collusion" is meaningless when America is doing far worst around the Globe. With that kind or reasoning every country we've "meddled" with should have sanctions on America. It's stupid to put sanctions on Russia when America fucks over the Middle East and Africa with Coupes and regime changes.

If you want the facts about Trump,  Hillary,  Obama,  McCain,  anyone,   I suggest you dig in to the actual matters of record that show what is really going on,  issue by issue, rather than join in with a chorus of sheep,  one side or the other.

       So far,  it looks like the evidence is saying that the Trump campaign did not follow up on that meeting with any interest or continuing conversation.    Do you know something I haven't heard?    Or are you more interested in making stuff up?

       I don't disagree that Hillary got outed,  including her emails,  etc.  and it didn't help her campaign any.    But it was a shitty campaign wasn't it?   Weren't all the progressives alienated.   She may have had Wall Street and the media behind her,  but what the hell did she really stand for?   More of Obama with an extra dose of war mongering,  right?    No fly zone over Syria and funding ISIS,   right?

       That dog don't hunt. I agree that we don't know what happened in the meeting but that's partly because the Trump people have left out a lot of relevant information. We don't know if there were more meetings, we don't know what information changed hands.

       You are making stuff up if you think there is any evidence so far that Trump or his campaign broke the law in regards to colluding with the Russians.    That is fake news invented by the Democratic opposition to Trump as a political strategy.    If it turns out to be true,  then we will need to get some real information besides the fact that Trump used the Russian mafia or Russian business associates to advance his companies and get loans.

       We know the Clinton Foundation was a scam.    We know Trump is a shady guy.   The problem is the Democrats are willing to make up garbage about Russia being the enemy of the US.    Now that is really nefarious when Russia never did anything to the US except stand up for its interests in the Ukraine and Syria etc.  while the US was waging illegal operations in those places for reasons that are not in my interest or your interest.   Why are you supporting a rogue foreign policy and a rogue state that wants war with Russia?

       "I think a disruption of the international order is something that Russia, in a shortsighted way, thinks works to their benefit," Mattis responded during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. "I think it does not, but I can't speak for them. I think what you're seeing here, though, is the continued prevalence of threats, not just to our own country, not just the Western Europe democracies, but they're trying to break any kind of multilateral alliance, I think, that is a stabilizing influence in the world."

       Russia isn't exceptionally bad,  there is no good reason for the US to decide now to make Russia the enemy except for politics.    Their stand in the Ukraine and Syria makes sense.    The US on the other hand,  why does it find it necessary to meddle in the Ukraine and sponsor and illegal coup there?   Why does the US find it necessary to remove Qaddafi,  Saddam,  and Assad from power but leave Saudi to its mischief?    And why are you acting as a puppet for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yemen is just one more place that the US had decided to meddle where Russia has been involved for more than a century.    Do you really think the US and Saudi involvement there is going to end well?   Do you really think the US involvement in Afghanistan,  Iraq,  or Libya is going to end well?    Even Pakistan is going to end up thumbing its nose at the US.     None of this is worth blowing the world up over or worth the US going broke,  which its military adventures are quickly doing.

       Duh,  the deep state was as happy with Obama as it was with Bush.   Would have wanted Hillary.   Not happy with Trump.   So what's your point?    Haven't you noticed the deep state always has to turn the American people against some bs "enemy" that is has created?   Meanwhile the deep state is doing everything it acuses the new enemy of doing.   Can you count them?   Vietnam,  Iraq,  Libya,  Syria,  Russia,  it will never end unless American's wake up or the US runs out of printing press money.   It ended for Rome,  Spain,  Britain, etc.   Kinda dumb that we keep falling for it.

       Sweet, the deep state boogeyman. Love me some poorly defined amorphous terminology.

       It's clear the deep state is working with the MSM under the orders of the powers that be to advance the new world order.

       Well, they have one leader and he's in pretty firm control. If he wants to push a story on the Russians news all he has to do is say so. The same goes for killing a story. Whatever Vladimir wants done happens. Whatever happens that Vladimir doesn't want to happen doesn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political opponents and anyone who Vladimir doesn't like usually do not do well in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       No sane person in Russia would have anything at all to do with the American election or either of its candidates without the knowledge and approval of Vladimir Putin. US relations are too complicated for him to allow anyone other than himself to act at such a high level.

       Yeah seriously. Russia is doing more to fight ISIS than we are. Trump recently stopped the covert CIA program that was arming and training "moderate" anti-Assad rebels, aka anyone who wanted to overthrow Assad, including ISIS and al queda.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then instead of thanking trump for moving toward peace in Syria our media all say how this is a move that putin wanted and that trump is being controlled by the kremlin.

       Sorry wrong. DNC can give more exposure giving HRC a "better" image and make people think she is the popular candidate when in reality she really wasn't. The end out come should've been Bernie and anyone but trump had HRC and MSM didn't think he was going to be a easy victory.

       Except she was the more popular candidate and at the time and had a better image (at least amongst Democrats).  Bernie at the time was an unheard of candidate and the 7s or so of Democrats who had heard of him considered him a wet blanket.  He also alienated the hell out of the Democratic base with his socialism talk (I'm not scared of buzzwords but c'mon, the largest democratic voting block grew up doing "hide under your desk from the socialist nuclear bombs" drills.)   He also made policy promises that would be undeliverable considering the makeup of the legislature, further alienating the base which is way more moderate anyway than the younger Bernie fan base.  He lost that primary handily on his own, and the shitty actions of the DNC were a drop in the bucket and hardly constitute a "rigged election."

       You're defending Clinton and accusing Sanders of alienating the base? What fucking world are you from? Tens of thousands of people weekly packing stadiums despite virtual media blackout and he was the unpopular one? Jesus fucking christ, when did you start following the primary? July 2016? What the fuck. You are what's wrong with the world. You're just making shit up. You're projecting a false reality but I think you know you're lying.

       Perhaps I should clarify what I mean by Democratic base.  I'm talking about the older people (middle aged and retirees) who are politically moderate and tend to vote democrat.  This is the largest and most consistent group of Democratic voters.  They are also the group that tends to be active in other ways, such as supporting unions and volunteering.  Sanders had unmistakable and dominating traction with younger voters and very strong grassroots support among independents.   Had all those people voted, the primary might have ended differently as they were pretty close in numbers to the base, who voted as they always do, nearly to a man.  As for the Primary, I volunteered with the Sanders campaign about once a week starting in January 2016.  After he withdrew, I quit a much better paying job and took one organizing for the Clinton campaign even though I didn't like her much, but because I thought it was necessary to everything in my power to try to stop Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that process, I interfaced with thousands of democrats in person as I organized them to do things like register voters and canvass.  I did this about 8 hours a day, every evening I spent 4+ hours on the phone, speaking with thousands more Democrats, 200 calls a day minimum.  I did this 7 days a week from July until the election day and was responsible for about 50 regular volunteers, many of which took 4 or more shifts per week doing the same things I was.  (I don't regret any of this by the way, obviously I wish the election turned out differently but I sleep soundly knowing I did everything I could and think that if anything Trump is worse than I thought).
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned a lot of surprising things in this process, and one of the biggest is that most older Democrats in general fucking hate Bernie Sanders.  For the reasons I mentioned already and because his campaign staff did some pretty outrageous things in my state (although I don't think Sanders and his higher ups realized how far they'd gone).
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Clinton cheated therefore Trump happened" narrative is very popular online but the truth is much more complicated than that.  I honestly think that while the actions of the DNC may have turned off enough Bernie Busters to swing the general, it actually did next to nothing to affect the primary.

       I can't source the vitriol, I will say that another thing I noticed is that most people are stunningly under or misinformed, about candidates, their positions, and about the workings of our government, including people who are very politically active in terms of volunteering and such.  On the subject of sourcing vitriol however I will say that there was an incredible amount of it, so much so that I doubt the DNC or any one source was squarely to blame.  I do think it is in much better hands now that Perez and Ellison are in charge.

       What? Not what I recall. I remember HRC nearly able to fill up anything and even HRC "merged" some of Bernies ideas to her plan later on after they cheated at the DNC. The only place she did good was the polls MSM propped up. As soon as Bernie lost everyone was gone especially after these emails dropped. HRC was propped up by bought favors, a small corrupt base and and a actual loyal Americans who don't see the shroud of political theater.

       The DNC is a private organization. This is what people forget about both of the national committees. I voted for Bernie in the primary, and as much as I fucking hate HRC, and what the DNC and DWS did during that time, unfortunately did didn't do anything illegal. It was morally wrong, to me at least, and not in line with their mission statement. But they don't actually represent the Democratic base and they aren't beholden to do that by anyone except the people who give them money (us) and themselves. This is just more big business people with they eyes on dollar signs involved in our political system and taking the bills over what the people actually want.

       Sure but they shouldnt act like they have a fair process and they should tell their fellow supporters that they really dont have a choice but whoever leads the DNC gets to pick. Also with that being said if the DNC is a private organization, that has the right to pick what they want and not what their supporting base wants, why was Obama willing to retaliate for this?

       Why was he willing to retaliate? Probably because a foreign government with hostile intentions was the source. Private company or not, they are tied to an important process in our government. In a sane world something like this would maybe make people think "Hey, maybe we shouldn't have an organization like this so ingrained into such a vital process" but the right people are already getting their money out of it so I doubt it changes. I would expect the same thing to happen if China decided to try and infiltrate a regional power distribution company with ill intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone with a critical mind is going to disagree with you that it's rigged, but when they are writing their own rules they will never face any consequences for "cheating". The DNC will never see another dime from me in my life for what happened and I would love for more grassroots style campaigns and fundraising to become the norm. If PAC's and business aren't funding the people in office then maybe they will start to give a shit about the voting base that is.

       Ya I guess I was trying to head towards "See another private business, that wouldnt let the US government properly analyze its servers, yet we deserve to go to war or at least retaliate on behalf of a private organization that gets to pick who they want to win?" BUT youre very right about sane people but then again thats why we have the Federal Reserve yet there is nothing Federal about it besides it working with government. Also China has tried and is infiltrated in the US. Like how China hacked the FDIC but was covered up by the US government?

       pretty much 'no' on all counts, OP.

      <p>
       Russians wanted someone in power that would not interfere with their agenda overseas (syria pipeline, ukraine, etc), would be friendly towards them in business, and had a similar world view (nationalist, racist, protectionist), someone that would aid in the US aligning with a much more right wing ideology and pro-oil stance as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrat thing was orchestrated from outside but carried out mostly from inside the US using right aligned people who wanted to expose and bring them down all the while aiding in the rightwing winning the election.

       The way I see it, the "alt right" are the independents who want to vote Republican. If they cheat Trump to get him out, they're not going anywhere any more than cheating Bernie Sanders made independent lefties disappear. We'll all still exist if the next election is Bush vs Clinton, I think we independents just need to come together on some issues so that we can more easily take power. Independents make up about half the country now, we have enough people that we should be able to take the majority.

       There is really only one thing to get straight and that's simply the "truth"...
      </p>
      <p>
       which is that the Dems and various opponents of Trump are in the untenable and uncomfortable position of trying to maintain that if the public hadn't learned via a series of well publicised leaks that the Dems had actually rigged all the primaries for Clinton over Sanders and had conspired and colluded with all of the mainstream media to ignore all the detrimental, inexcusable, and even criminal things Clinton had done while in office and presented her, as well as supplying countless rigged and jiggered polls that presented and supported her as the only possible and desirable winner in the eyes of the vast majority of Americans, then she would, logically, and according to them should have actually won that election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So exposing all the lies and criminal collusion and corruption that actually was all intended to throw the election in their and Clinton's favor is now being interpreted as interfering with that same election by whoever was responsible for supplying that leaked information which they believe influenced enough voters to prevent that whole nefarious plan from working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information that Clinton and the Dems had no possible way to deny was true, because it all really was perfectly and undeniably true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now "how" we encounter the truth about anyone or anything is far less important than the fact that we have encountered and been forced to confront and know it, and it's irresponsible, unethical, and immoral to try and turn back the clock or simply pretend that we don't actually know it or anything about it for no other reason than "how" that happened to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this, you know this, and so does everyone else. Any who oppose it do so only for disreputable and purely selfish reasons of their own and they are clearly prepared to pursue it in spite of knowing how detrimental it actually is to countless others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The highly destructive nature of that truth has already compromised and called into question virtually every mainstream media source of information. It has also done the very same thing to the DNC and Democratic Party in general. Neither can stop the damage to them that is still unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they can and are endeavoring to do, however, is inflict the same amount of damage on their opponents and characterize it in the same way, not armed with any "truth", mind you, but with unverifiable suppositions, innuendo, and accusations that they treat as if they were true, but are either outright lies or carefully massaged half truths that they're doing their utmost to palm-off as the real thing.

       nothing wrong with taking a meeting... is what you'd say if you voted for Clinton because she did it too. That's why you know what the Steele Dossier is. Let's prosecutor both of them.

       Did the Coast Guard look at it? No? Okay we are already at 16, ruling:3 Pinocchios. Speaking for them doesn't mean they agree, like the NSA said there is evidence Russia hacked but it's not limited to Russia and no one knows who WL's source is so they signed off saying it's possible but definitive. Kinda down to 3 if you actually count the ODNI which is actually just a bureaucracy not an intelligence agency similar to the way the Pentagon isn't actually the Army.

       What? Maybe if you actually read what you're citing. Hate to break it to you but not everyone with a degree is right all the time. Do you even know what law you're referring to? Every case he linked to was irrelevant.

       The law says nothing about in-kind donations. All you have to do is quote where in the law it says that opposition research is illegal only if it's in secret. I have quoted the law several times but you just refer to irrelevant blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so easy. You could win right now. All you have to do is quote the law. That's it. Just give me a quote and I'll concede. Do it.
