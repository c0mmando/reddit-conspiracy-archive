       <strong>
        This post discusses a topmindsofreddit mod previously working with a current conspiracy mod. It doesn't appear that this relationship still exists
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not much of a secret that brigading has become a problem in this sub. Crossposting in various subs helps contribute to this problem, yet for some reason the totesmessenger bot is banned from notifying us when something does get xposted. My first question is why this is the case when it could potentially help clean things up to a degree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, we know that r/topmindsofreddit is one of the most prolific subs in crossposting from here, and their primary purpose is to mock conspiracy theorists. This alone is enough of a problem, but one of their mods admitted to working with a current mod here. They deleted the post, but I was able to archive it first:
       <a href="http://archive.is/uwKbn">
        http://archive.is/uwKbn
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems suspicious, and I'm wondering if that mod would be willing to come forward and explain the reason for this partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit to clarify:
       </strong>
       the archived link shows a discussion at r/conspiracyII, but the comment by the TMoR mod admits to working with a mod in this sub.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm only here to help out where I can. I've worked with several former and one current r/conspiracy mod in the past so I don't see it as much of an issue.

       OP, don't you think the past tense is a significant qualifier here, and that your title is therefore misleading? I don't know who the mod is incidentally, but there is no collaboration between this sub and TMOR.

       It is certainly an important qualifier, and I'll add a clarification to the beginning of the post. I guess I could've worded the title better, but I still don't think it's misleading

       If one of the mods has been working with TMoR in the past, don't you think it would be a good idea to find out who and demod them?  I mean, just from browsing the mod log I can pretty much narrow it down to 3 mods...

       All he says is that he worked with a current conspiracy mod in the past. That mod may not have been a conspiracy mod at the time, and/or NJFS may not have been a TMOR mod at the time. In fact, it seems more likely that they were both mods of some other unconnected subreddit. I don't know.

       If you don't know who the mod is, then you don't know if there's collaboration. Anyone on your mod team could be working with them. It would be much better to say "I'm not aware of anyone" working with topminds.

       Look, we discuss some pretty far out things here and we should not mind when skeptical people point out some of the stupid bullshit that gets posted here (looking at you flat earthers, looking at you directed with a big ol stink eye).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to be reasonable and accept the reality that not everything we discuss here is 100% accurate and true.  We have to understand that is impossible for everything we discuss her to be true because there are conflicting theories discussed here and they both cant be correct.

       The way I see it, the truth has nothing to hide and is easily defended.

       You are correct and I agree with that.  But lets be honest. Most people do not know how to offer reasonable, skeptical counterpoints because there is no reward for it in this type of forum.  We get rewarded by making snarky, sarcastic remarks that belittle.  So thats what we get.

       But what is TMoR other than snarky and belittling comments? They merely add to the noise. I respect satire and I don't oppose the existence of that sub. But having a mod in cahoots with them while also blocking the totesmessenger bot seems counterproductive to what the real users here are trying to achieve

       To me, it's like living with nosy neighbors who gossip behind your back.  It doesn't matter, and truly means nothing.  I'm not thrilled mods are collaborating and it makes some sense when you see some of the BS posted here, but why try to fight it.  This entire site is overrun with people trying to alter opinion and discredit things they don't want discussed.  Trying to fight it is futile and pointless.

       If something's presented with a degree of cogency and evidence then no one's going to mock it. Some people won't listen to counterarguments and debate though, and expect their totally baseless assertions to be treated with respect.
      </p>

       The trouble is that some people (flat earthers, etc) post the same, easily-rebutted nonsense over and over again, and refuse to listen to reason. I've tried being patient and teasing apart their misconceptions, I've tried genuine engagement, but they just double-down or post total non-sequiturs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also a not-inconsiderable number of OPs that are so disjointed and garbled that they genuinely read like the result of a schizophrenic breakdown.

       we're in a conspiracy forum and the person i replied to originally was trying to say that this isn't the place to question the shape of the earth. I then offered a very mainstream example of a solid reason to question the mainstream. Welcome to r/conspiracy have a look around.

       Yeah, I'll get that to you. Some of it is in screen shots, some in archived posts, and I put together a nice timeline. Some came from a modmail conversation, and that is sacrosanct - so I'll have to make redactions if I share it at all.

       The totesmessenger bot is active here, but only the mods can see the posts. I think the reason for that is that we don't want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users following the totesmessenger links and creating a reverse brigade, which the admins could sanction us for.

       There are plenty of examples of T_D harassing other subs, so much so the admins had to warn them of possible punishments multiple times (but I will admit T_D is not "designed" for this practice....but they still do it).

       The moderation here is definitely infiltrated. Hence the ever expanding list of bannable and removable offences. It echoes the police state quite poetically. SWIM got banned and called a "marxist freak" by good old flytape for questioning the rules. Even the mods who disagree with banning people for political reasons find it's pefectly reasonable to ban someone for insults, particularly if they're directed at a moderator.

       They're petty little judges who think that just because they volunteered to moderate everyone, we endlessly indebted to them for their services.

       Is there? I don't think that's true at all.

       I'm all over reddit, and this place is the most ban happy non-curated sub I'm aware of. I can say a lot of shit on most subs before I'm banned. Gotta tread carefully here unless you want to be using another alt.

       I gotta disagree. This sub seems to Allow a fair amount of.....Attitude??? I got banned today from TD for Nothing. Really. Not that I give a fuck. If you've been there you know what I mean.....

       It's not the Trump mods who are collaborating with TMoR, I can just about guarantee that.  Spend an hour or two browsing the mod logs and you can narrow it down to three names I think.

       No one is happy with the decision other than the mod who made it. In my opinion, _Ph03niX and Spider_Jerusalem are essentially shills from TMOR whose job it is to discredit conspiracy subreddits.

       You're confused. The sub in question is
       <a href="/r/ConspiracyII">
        /r/ConspiracyII
       </a>
       , not this sub. The mod in question created that sub and the post is still up and is in fact stickied as an announcement.

       <a href="/u/Phoenix">

       No. The real issue is that this sub is about completely destroyed and no one is doing a damn thing about it who is in a position to do so. i.e. Moderators. That's the real issue.

       One of my pieces of evidence is that it received way more upvotes on
       <a href="/r/c_s_t">
        /r/c_s_t
       </a>
       . That has never happened no matter what I have posted. It's a simular crowd and they have way less numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway people might think it's lame to obsess about stuff like this but I feel there are posts that are messed with, hidden, or brigaded  (not just mine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a big fuck you to the topmindsofreddit crowd. They are so worried about bigotry yet they have no problem harrassing and humiliating people. Disgusting.

       I've noticed the same thing as well with many of my posts, which I usually duplicate over at
       <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">
        /r/AlternativeHistory
       </a>
       . Pretty much a bleed over in the user bases and there, it always receives way higher vote counts. Not that I care about points, it just bothers me because I know many people here would like to see many of the posts, but they essentially get buried. Granted I do post more "fringe" type topics.

       Yeah I completely understand! It is kind of annoying when you see the low effort posts they put on the front.

       And again I know there are many factors involved in what gets upvoted and what doesn't, but I have no doubt that something else is up.

       What was suspicious about my last post was usually I at least get a handful of comments explaining why they down voted me or didn't like my post. Not that time because it wasn't even really seen.

       I know, I don't like the linking here either but I can't find anything in the ToS that says what they're doing is illegal.  Besides, they're not the only sub that goofs at other subs and compiles drama.

       <a href="/u/totesmessenger">

       <br/>
       Ctrl+F "in conspiracy"
      </p>

       In 30 pages (about a days worth) there are 45 comments to r/conspiracy from the bot.
