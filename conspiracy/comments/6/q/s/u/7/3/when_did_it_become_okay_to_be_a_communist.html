        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People are very well educated on nationalism, fascism - the Nazis are well understood and quickly decried. Trump rightly gets criticized for demagoguery and other nasty habits by some people in this sub. Nazis are bad news and should be exposed. </p>

<p>On the other hand people seem to have an amazing tolerance for communism and socialism. What&#39;s strange is that communists have left a much bigger legacy and the reality is that they&#39;ve always completey fucked over the people, always, without exception. More people have died under Communism than anyother system ever in history. I remember when conspiracy used to be aware of this but these days it just isn&#39;t. We regularly and openly talk about over-throwing the elites and in favor of some sort of revolution which will bring about some sort of human equality etc. Ok that&#39;s a nice idea however, it&#39;s exactly what the Russians though they were doing a few years before Stalin instilled a ruthless totalitarian state. And this model has somehow continued to play out regardless of where it is tried, despite the best intentions.</p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s madness to for us to mess around with any if these ideas while remaining so ignorant of history. If I were acting like a Nazi I&#39;d be banned from every subreddit in existence and yet somehow I can get a free pass when I openly talk of &#39;purging&#39; people, promote utopian models etc. It&#39;s scary when you actually read about what these terms actually mean.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. Nobody is tolerating communism besides the very extreme left like Antifa, and the US already has plenty of socialized programs, a lot of people think they could use a couple more, but nobody wants full socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but you responded to a post about our society practically banning art and poetry at this point. </p>

<p>So the library being there and available goes directly against that line of thinking. </p>

<p>And to your point, my county library is actually pretty visited. Its 4 stories and there is always a line at the desk for check outs. They also host plenty of events, from yoga, ESL/math tutoring, Microsoft courses, Art classes, film &amp; book clubs, Tai Chi and Poetry/Writing clubs. </p>

<p>This is a suburb library keep in mind, not in the center of a major city, and its all free. <a href="http://www.camdencountylibrary.org/voorhees-branch">http://www.camdencountylibrary.org/voorhees-branch</a></p>

<p>GOT and Harry Potter are just what is hot and main stream right now/recently. That doesn&#39;t mean people losing interests in the more diversified arts. Just different people have different interests, not all diversified arts can occupy the mainstream at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism favours the strong.</p>

<p><em>&quot;In nature the wages of sin is always death. Nature does not love the wrong-doer, but endeavors in every possible way to destroy him. Her curse is on the brow of the &quot;meek and lowly.&quot; Her blessing is on the very hearts&#39; blood of the strong and the brave.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Too many weak people alive today. The welfare state literally incentives weak people to breed (because they are the best slaves).</p>

<p><em>&quot;Though, the survival of the strongest is the logic of events, yet personal cowardice is the great vice of our demoralized age. Cowardice is corroding the brain and blood of our species, but men have learnt to disguise this terrible infirmity behind the canting whine of humanity and goodness.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;How rich this degenerate world is in small, petty souled, good for nothings, who are forever excusing their infantile ineptitude behind some plausable phrase- some conventional make believe?</em>*</p>

<p>Capitalism is just a resource distribution system. The good and bad is human action. Communism wont change that.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Indeed men of initiative and enterprise are now in the regular habit of purchasing immunity from communal molestation by bribing legislatures and officials upon wholesale scale. The state is a blackmail agency.</em></p>

<p><em>Enterprises necessitating state permits and large preliminary expenditures of capital cannot be safely undertaken, until elective satraps have first negotiated a percentage of rake off. Neither life nor property is safe from the malignance,revenge or greed of government officials or their confederates.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>better form of government </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the wrong question,  the question,  it assumes that any man made institution is capable of functioning of itself,  which it isn&#39;t.    Notice that constitutions can be wonderful,  but the execution is where the problem always lies,  because ideals are not implemented.    Organically,   the world does not really function by ideals,  it functions by the nature of the organisms that make it up,  and those organisms have their own priorities,  most often not taken into account in ways that keep the checks and balances of government in order.    So the checks and balances break down before we realize it,  and we have corrupted the intent of the institutions we created.</p>

<p>Socially,  culturally,  people settle for what they are already used to,  which includes a lot of abuse, a lot of violence,  a lot of self medication,  a lot of inequality.    The history of any particular culture in any particular place or time,  is going to demonstrate degrees of cohesion,  degrees of alienation.   So,  we see the tendency to want the protection of thug like &quot;strong&quot; mafioso types,  who promise to favor our set of needs compared to the needs of rivals who pose a threat.   Nations often end up being a collection of competing mafias.    Institutionally,  this is not addressed or admitted,  it is dressed up in mythology and pageantry to be palatable,  and also to intimidate those who would pose a threat.    When you are doing this,  you are condoning secrecy,  condoning a continuation of concealed servitude.    The trajectory of past history is going to haunt anything you try to do,  and its going to take generations for this to adapt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically you are talking about ideologies,  and people who are fanatical about them,  basically enshirining a particular ideology within the absolute power of the state,  which is yet another ideology,  but one that has been pretty much universally adopted at this point.   Used to be the absolute power often rested with a church,   or other religious institution to where even monarchs had to submit to a pope or whatever.</p>

<p>Submitting to Lenin or Mao is certainly not healthy,  but then in the US we also submit to a mythology of free markets and democracy while having neither,   and increasingly we also no longer have a functioning rule of law.</p>

<p>So where do we go from here,  versus complaining about someone somewhere else being bad,  and invading them to save the world from Islam,  or save the world from communism.    Geez,  can&#39;t you see its a broken record by now.    Maybe we should worry about the mess we have made of our own country,  which as far as I can tell has many Soviet style bureaucratic bottlenecks in the education system,   justice system,  medical system,  party system,  etc.  etc.   Its a stage/problem all humans have had to deal with as the modern nation state has evolved.    We might recognize that a lot of it has to do with corruption.   Which is rampant and destructive of civilization in general.    Seems like corruption thrives on any and all ideologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes, exactly. When you take the time to understand you realize that there is no greater conspiracy than ideology. </p>

<p>The answer lies in the story of Pinocchio. He was a wooden puppet who was enchanted by a fairy (i.e Adam being given the power to choose good or evil). And ofcourse the first thing he did was run away from home and fell in with wrong sort of people. His father goes looking for him and ends up being swallowed by a whale. Pinocchio&#39;s redemption happens because he goes and rescues his father from the belly of the whale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a strange couple,   Tito and Franco.   Two strong men rulers,  one Yugoslavia,  one Spain,  one was popular with the right,  one popular with the left.   Both ruled over a time of reconstruction in their respective countries,  some say,  with an iron fist.</p>

<p>Two ideologies.    But having lived in Yugoslavia from 1966 to 1970 as a teenager,   I respected Tito.    </p>

<p>I also think Castro deserves some credit regarding the social conditions in Cuba,  literacy,  life expectancy,  survival at birth for mothers and children.</p>

<p>And I think that there have been a lot of societies with extremes between poverty and wealth where life was hell for most,  and could have been better with less inequality.    Rule of law,  minimizing corruption, is key,  where the productive in society are still motivated.    Tito managed that,    Castro also to a degree.    The Soviet Union not so much.    I think the Scandinavian countries did pretty well with it.   Roosevelt seems to have played with it.</p>

<p>The Reagan years,  after the stagflation of the 70&#39;s needs to be re-examined,  the failure of the US labor unions,  often by their own hand,  the left in the US was trashed,  and is gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory at the moment is that between the right and the left we are seeing a strong sort of Hegelian dialectic. Basically what this amounts to is a strong pull toward left through popular culture and education, followed by a partial collapse, due to economic factors. This is followed by a turn to the right, but it&#39;s not a kind of traditional conservatism. So far it tends to be the Reagan/Thatcher type which means a kind of beating down of labor and a ridiculous free market model that mainly serves corporate interests. I would argue that this is a lot closer to pure fascism than any sort of traditional model of the past. What seems to have happened is that the very tops of these establishments tend toward either neo-Marxism or neo-Fascism without returning toward any kind of traditional normalcy of classical-liberalism. So it&#39;s as if Nazis and Communists have done a deal where they form a power sharing coalition and hide behind the various right and left parties of which ever nation they inhabit. </p>

<p>This lays the foundation for a conspiratorial explanation for what we are seeing. The left largely control education and popular sentiment and the right is basically nothing but corporate welfare and any sort of nuanced approach is increasingly impossible for people to understand. People in the West basically have no idea who Tito was but from what I understand he was really just the embodiment of a good leader and not exactly a huge socialist. To give an identity to Yugoslavia in that way, under those circumstances was a miracle. It&#39;s exactly the type of thing we see less and less of. </p>

<p>So for sure Tito is a huge exception in my book, I hardly consider him a socialist. I don&#39;t really have a problem with discussing certain social programs in the right climate. Protection of freedom of speech, due process, and something like a free market are absolutely non-negotiable. After that I&#39;d be open to considering social programs with some reservations. </p>

<p>But anyway I think the geo-politcal issues that you raised mostly come down to a kind of Nazi/Communist axis (which are both basically socialistic in their own way). That might be a bit crude for every situation, but at least from a conspiracy stand point that&#39;s mostly what we are seeing. Neither side really prevent the other from the worst parts of their policies because essentially they understand that the people will cry for them once the election comes around. This is all just too easy. </p>

<p>What we need to return to is our intellectual heritage, maybe even consider theological foundations and get away from all this horrible Marxist materialism and Hegelian schizophrenia, a kind of European traditional renaissance. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the moral of Pinocchio, to wake up from your self-destructive tendencies to save one&#39;s father. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100 years ago,  WWI,  wiped out an older era after which a new era was ushered in.    WWI was immediately preceded the previous decades by an amount of social and technological change that included human flight,  mass produced cars,  radio,  movies,  telephones,  and the beginning of industrialized agriculture,  massive dislocations.   Ruling elites in Vienna,  Paris,  London,  Berlin,  Russia,  Turkey,  etc. etc. were eliminated and replaced.    In other words,  mass violence,  war with casualties that often exceeded 10% of the population.    The  kibbutz and the state based communes were invented out of WWI.   Prior to that we did have the Paris commune,  but that hardly qualified as a state based institution,  more realistically it was a brief anarchy.   No durable and effective state governments since,  whatever they were called,  ideologically,  wanted to see that kind of chaos repeated on their own turf,  but many have gladly pushed other countries,   their enemies,  in that direction.</p>

<p>The middle east has already effectively been in WWIII since 2003,  with whole cities and nations decimated.   It may spread.</p>

<p>Looking back at failed states,  of which there are already a quite a few since the fall of the Soviet Union and since 9/11,    reconciling the terms of their failure is somewhat academic.   All had elements of socialism,  fascism,   kleptocracy,  oligarchy,   monopoly,  oligopoly.    </p>

<p>Clinging to ideological expectations is starting to look like hoping to be saved by Jesus or Mohamed or whatever.    The work of fixing things and making them function is being postponed,  an inertia of hopelessness,  a preference for self destruction,  has overtones of adolescent or infantile excuses.   Why should we be surprised,  considering in the earlier era,  just 3 or 4 centuries ago,  the west was solidly still in the grip of a theological hallucination.    It amazing people are talking about bringing that back in any damn form rather than facing reality more squarely,  through a coming to terms with our ecological place within an amazing landscape called &quot;Earth&quot;.    No god planned out what Hubble was taking picture of,  or what electron microscopes can image.    Not to say it isn&#39;t awesome,   not suggesting science take the place of religion.    The rule of law works best when we take responsibility for the what we have made up and have the guts to go back and tweek it when it needs tweeking.    Like for example,  legal bribery of politicians by lobbyists.    How come that isn&#39;t number one on everyone&#39;s agenda?</p>

It does not help that prior to the internet, we were saturated with anti-communist propaganda where at one point lies like...&#39;everyone in communism dresses the same&#39; were considered good arguments.  </p>

<p>On top of this, a lot of anti-communist claims come from the religious right.  As people have more information and realized that they have been systematically deceiving about Darwin, it was not a hard inference to make that they are lying  concerning Marx, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The largest and most effective US propaganda conspiracy of the 20th century was that communism is the worst thing in world history; the John Birch Society (which keeps seeming more and more relevant these days) was a deep-state riddled propaganda club and early conspiracy mill, seeding the Red Scare and all kinds of US paranoia. Aside from being utilized as fodder for all the shittiest US war interventions and covert actions, this old school fear-mongering also helped lead the charges against the Civil Rights era, notions of equality, feminism, universal health care, and likely played a role in the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King. Numerous world problems have been the result of CIA intervention into running or burgeoning communist systems, so you can choose to blame the chicken or egg for the persistent conflicts that era unleashed. </p>

<p>Ideologically, the US has been lightly socialist since FDR, but obviously way heavier on the capitalist model, sometimes drifting into fascism&#39;s expansionist &quot;breathing space&quot; rhetoric in terms of foreign policy (oil, corporate expansion, war war war), opting for economic influence and control in lieu of classic imperialist colonization. </p>

<p>I think capitalism has it&#39;s good points, I think socialism has it&#39;s good points. Both contain flaws that haven&#39;t been ironed out and tend to lead to catastrophe-- attempted communism has fucked over a whole lot of people, independent of actual mass killings conducted by it&#39;s most insane practitioners. Some would say no dictator-run state has ever been close to getting there, others say it&#39;s a dead ideology altogether. Maybe it&#39;ll get ironed out itself in time. Until then, current international capitalism is currently fucking up the world way more than it&#39;s helping humanity survive IMO, and this includes the bulk of neoliberal practices. </p>

<p>I once knew someone working as regional director for a major aid organisation in Africa. He proudly mentioned that they managed to help double the income of families in a certain area. Sounds great right? Lifted out of poverty! Because when you go from 1$ a day to 2$ a day you are no longer &#39;poor&#39; in the statistical sense. </p>

<p>However in REALITY it simply means that the man of that family spends 1$ extra that day on a beer or similar, while the wife still has to labour all day in the fields to feed the family. Not exactly &#39;liftet out of poverty&#39;, and I bet the situation is like this for most (truly) poor in the world.</p>

<p>Communist and socialist ideas are pretty fucking awesome. The corruption of man is what dooms them, not themselves. </p>

The Constitution and Bill of Rights are clearly libertarian documents that were even controversial for far left they were at the time. I think we should trust in their wisdom</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism doesn&#39;t necessarily mean evil. I think it gives one person to much power. If I was to form a government it&#39;s leader would be a republic. The right form of government may have not been invented yet and could be a combination of communism, democracy, and socialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is the perfection of human society in the distant future.  Socialism is the path to get there.</p>

<p>The US is hyper-capitalist and its government wants to make sure its citizens revere their ideology.  Your Red Scare paranoia is the result of a lifelong psyop perpetrated on you by biased simplistic early education textbooks and the CIA-controlled media.  Everything you think about communism is wrong.  Your facts are wrong, your history is wrong, even your definitions are wrong.  You&#39;ve been purposefully mis-educated about it.</p>

<p>Communism is a huge topic people devote PhD&#39;s to studying.  Sound-bites by people who have never read the socialist writers themselves won&#39;t help you understand it, though it may give you a warm feeling of being validated.  Learn from modern socialist academics if you are really interested:  Michael Parenti, Slavoj Zizek, Noam Chomsky, Richard Wolff.  They have books and plenty of youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t have communism under Stalin. They had State Capitalism. It&#39;s the same with China.</p>

<p>Most people are not aware of this though.
They called it &#39;communism&#39; but it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Communism/Socialism is something else that has, in fact, never been implemented anywhere. Probably Cuba was close at some point, but 50+ years of sanctions likely ruined that or contributed to it. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t agree that &#39;Communism&#39; has killed the most people. Capitalism has created 100s of wars in the last 100-200 years. The entire continent of Africa is being held in extreme powerty because of capitalism (on purpose). So it all depends how you count. </p>

<p>Also remember there is TONS of propaganda on all sides. Once you start reading about socialism (and what it REALLY means), you&#39;ll understand why a lot of people like it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same argument made in most college classrooms, that what the USSR was not &quot;real&quot; communism so that means the theory is still valid and just waited to be tested. The same thing could then be said about ANY ideology or economic system, because it is a baseless remark and not even an argument.</p>

<p>We have a corrupt system, but let us not write off the hundreds of millions killed by Communist governments (their own people) in the 20th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to add validity to your argument by calling my argument &#39;college classroom&#39;. Nice. If you have a good counter-argument then post it.</p>

<p>Please describe in what way the USSR system was &#39;communist&#39;. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t. A main component of communism/socialism is that the workers control the means of production. This is socialism 101. In the USSR the GOVERNMENT controlled ALL the means of production and it was still operated in a capitalist way (people got salaries used to buy products, etc).. </p>

<p>Just because someone calls something a name doesn&#39;t automatically make it so.</p>

<p>Sure they were responsible for many deaths. So was/is many other systems throughout history. But the fact that a STATE CAPITALIST (please look it up) system was responsible for many deaths has nothing much to do with &#39;COMMUNISM&#39; as such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism works for insects, because unlike humans they are all essentially the same. Socialism fails miserably for humans because we are not the same. Communism and socialism does one thing to all who have practiced it, it makes everyone poor except for the criminals. I remember exchange students from Russia in the 80&#39;s, whose parents were surgeons and physicists and they could not make enough money to buy jeans. I remember my neighbors from Poland who literally cried at how much opportunity they had after moving tho the US. Anyone who preaches socialism is a fool. Socialism sucks and doesn&#39;t work. The Nordic countries will fail soon. Socialist states in South America are failing right now. Even China had to change it&#39;s version of communism to stay relevant. Socialism fails because it is a bad idea, it is based on nonsense and falsehoods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original colonies in this country, USA tried socialism and common ownership. It was an unmitigated disaster that played out rather quickly as the population attempting to implement it was so small. Socialism removes &quot;incentive&quot;. When there is no incentive to be able to achieve more, people stop giving a fuck. Because really, what is the point of working harder or better if there is no reward for it? Socialism is for people who lack a brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;lifted out of poverty&#39; yeah right.</p>

<p>I once knew someone working as regional director for a major aid organisation in Africa. He proudly mentioned that they managed to help double the income of families in a certain area. Sounds great right? Lifted out of poverty! Because when you go from 1$ a day to 2$ a day you are no longer &#39;poor&#39; in the statistical sense. </p>

<p>However in REALITY it simply means that the man of that family spends 1$ extra that day on a beer or similar, while the wife still has to labour all day in the fields to feed the family. Not exactly &#39;liftet out of poverty&#39;, and I bet the situation is like this for most (truly) poor in the world.</p>
