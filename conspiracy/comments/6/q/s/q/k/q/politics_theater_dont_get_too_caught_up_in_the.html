       ... It is the lobbyists who are sent from wealthy corporations and world banks that dump billions of dollars into politics so that the system is shaped towards their vision of totalitarianism... slowly but surely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire system is corrupt. We know this. It can be proven over and over again but we keep participating as though it could get better if we just vote and sign petitions for our changes as a unified group. We have to realize that we have to remove the entire group of people involved in politics and create a new system altogether. A system that is up to date using the scientific method and the latest technologies to provide abundance for everyone. I believe we already have it all, we just need to wake up more and more of us out of this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       We gotta pull out of the daily political banter and develop what is actually important... Living our lives free from debt slavery and government control.

       As much as I get and appreciate what you're saying, it seems a little weird that none of these responses were seen whenever there was controversy about Obama's birth certificate, but a thread like this seems to show up every time the Trump administration gets caught with their pants down in regards to Russia.

       The pattern is pretty striking. To me, it looks more like a response to the panic brewing among elite criminals regarding the possibility that some of them may finally face prosecution, particularly for their seditious acts against the country. This is the ultimate "flip the game board" move. Checkmate is already nearly certain, so we see the backup strategy emerge. These assholes are willing to push the nation into civil war. They would literally rather take their chances hiding out somewhere during a revolution than continue letting President Trump do his job.

       Look at McCain and Kerry. They were setup to be opposite sides of Vietnam ... war-hero loyalist POW vs war-hero disillusioned by his country going into politics to right things.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both work together to quash things about Vietnam (POWs) and various other military things. They're seen as ways to balance these committees, but really they perform cover-ups for military actions, while appeasing the left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they need that type of candidate, they are brought out for their presidential runs. Looking back neither McCain nor Kerry ever had a chance of winning that election, why blow your chance at the presidency in a sure lose race when you could have just waited four years and probably won?
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Vietnam and POW stuff not slipped down the memory hole, these guys would have been brought in to be the actual president -- right or left side, depending on what TPTB needed to sell then to retain a docile population.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not the only ones, but they're fairly obvious. It's amazing the way the walk out together and thus remove enough senior Senators to kill a session.

       Pure political theater.

       Organize movements to boycott elections.  It doesn't matter who wins, the result is the same.  If we reduce the turnout to close to 0% then the police and military can plainly see that they are protecting an illegitimate government.
