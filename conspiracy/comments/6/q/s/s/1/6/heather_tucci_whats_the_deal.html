       Don't know all the details, but here is my understanding from other YT videos...
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, this goes with the whole "Secret bank account -FED  social security number". A guy tried to use "his account" accessing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and was arrested for trying to use it to buy a motor home. She was "representing" him, and she too was arrested. Now they are going to court.

       Could be huge for the whole Birth certificate/SSN is our slave number under UCC (Maritime law - "we are all dead at see, and we're supposed to re-claim our name - trust") via the Cestui Que Vie Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll be interesting to see how it goes.

       No. People have tried that crap in court for years and years and years now, and failed every single time. The UCC is just a set of model rules for commercial transactions like leases; maritime law only applies to cases arising out of navigable waters; trusts and birth certificates are likewise totally irrelevant to this case.

       That's the thing--we already have seen. People try these arguments all the time in court. Just this year, and just off the top of my head, both Sean David Morton and Winston Shrout went down that road in their trials.

       Both lost, because the birth certificate/admiralty/UCC stuff is bonkers. It has no basis in law, history, logic or fact. It's an urban legend that persists among people who love to read about law in YouTube comments but can't be bothered to actually crack a book or take a class to see how it works in the real world.

       If you're curious, Coursera has lots of free law classes. You could see for yourself.

       I don't have any British masters. I think you're referring to the urban legend about American lawyers swearing allegiance to the Queen of England? Obviously not true. American lawyers don't swear any kind of allegiance to any foreign countries or actors, just the Constitution and laws of the United States of America.

       Crossposting from a comment I left on the other thread about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       For the curious, here's the scheme as alleged in the current indictment. Caveats: The defendants (Beane and Tucci-Jarraf) are obviously innocent until proven guilty. All facts are as alleged in the indictment, and nothing has been proven in court yet. They're very likely to be proven guilty. The indictment will also probably change, as counts get added later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently in July 2017 a guy named Randall Keith Beane (KB), along with Tucci-Jarraf (HATJF) and some other unnamed confederates, embarked on a scheme to defraud USAA. (USAA is a big financial institution, essentially a bank.)
      </p>
      <p>
       KB told USAA that he wanted to buy some Jumbo CDs, a kind of financial instrument like a savings bond but very expensive. I think they cost a minimum of $100k. KB said he'd buy the CDs using an electronic transfer, and gave USAA a routing number and account number. The routing number was a real routing number for the Federal Reserve. (Routing numbers are like digital addresses for funds transfers. Every bank has at least one, and they're easy to find online.) The account number was a fake account number. Based on my knowledge of the scheme they're running, which is based on watching YouTube videos and reading Reddit threads about them, it was probably some combination of the numbers on the front and/or back of their Social Security cards--not a bank account number at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what he did was try to buy a ton of financial instruments from a bank and pay with imaginary money in a fictitious account at the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       USAA transferred the CD before it actually processed KB's payment. This isn't that uncommon--clearing funds takes a few days, and often banks will want to complete the customer's transaction as quickly as possible. They rely on law enforcement to help catch the people trying to take advantage of the lag, as KB allegedly did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So "the vast majority" of the CDs KB tried to buy were blocked because the bank could tell that he didn't have a bank account at the Federal Reserve. But he did get away with two CDs before they caught on to him, worth about $1.5 million. He then used about $500k of that money to buy "a 2017 Entegra Cornerstone 45B," a "45-foot diesel motorhome." (Look that thing up online, it's pretty sweet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       All that is just alleged against KB. The reference to co-conspirators suggests that other people will be indicted for those crimes, possibly HATJ, but so far it's just him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tucci-Jarraf is only indicted on the last count of the indictment, money laundering. It's not really clear from the indictment just what she did, which means they'll supplement it later on with more detailed charges. It's based on the idea that she helped KB conceal the nature and source of the fraudulently-obtained money, and apparently she posed as a lawyer to do that. But she's not charged with pretending to be a lawyer, just money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the indictment came down the same month as the alleged crimes were committed means that this is a pretty open-and-shut case as far as the DOJ is concerned. They didn't bother to take additional time putting together the case, probably because they don't think they need to. And they're probably right, the facts as alleged are going to be pretty simple to prove (the crew pulling these stunts brags about doing this stuff on YouTube) and constitutes an open-and-shut set of criminal offenses.
      </p>

       Sorry for writing a book on this. I find these pseudolegal scams incredibly interesting, and it touches on my IRL expertise.

       It is widespread knowledge that the Federal Reserve prints money and uses it to pay off the US military to perform their dirty work.  The United States has been under banker occupation for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average American, let alone the average conspiracy-theorist, would be absolutely aghast to learn that someone could open an account at a financial institution specifically for members of the US military, and then not only use an account number at the Federal Reserve to buy financial instruments, but actually do so without even being prevented!  Who would believe that an individual even
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       have an account directly at the Federal Reserve?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "crime" is not in exposing this.  The crime is the fact that it exists in the first place.  Get it?

       Except that individuals don't have FR accounts. These guys didn't expose anything. If their theories about the FR had been correct, the CD purchase would have worked and they wouldn't be on trial for fraud.

       Based on
       <strong>
        your
       </strong>
       write-up, it sounds like the CD purchase
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       work, and no one at USAA batted an eye when they were given an account number at the Federal Reserve.  They just continued with the purchase as though that were a normal thing.  And based on all the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       evidence we have, it is a normal thing.

       No, it's pretty common for the seller the process the transaction before actually processing the payment. Otherwise it would take days to buy a CD, and banking customers won't put up with that. That's why they only got away with a couple of CDs. The bank started to process their orders, but figured out that the payment into was bogus while they were doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, the defendants
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       provide an account number from the Federal Reserve. They provided a made-up account number, and when USAA gave that to the Federal Reserve it failed to process because there's no such account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even using a made-up account number will work, right up to the point someone tries to process the payment. Then they refer you to the DOJ, as happened here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what's happening with the people who claim to have be done this successfully. They're using made-up account numbers, and it's only working up until someone runs it and the transaction fails. It's why the YouTube comments that used to be all, "I did this and cleared a student loan payment!" are now, "The bank is saying I still owe that last payment, please help me!"

       Right (and I know you're going to write another essay in response to this), but I'm going to point out
       <em>
        one more time
       </em>
       that it was
       <strong>
        an individual providing an account at the Federal Reserve
       </strong>
       .  And that should

        not

       be normal, because it is obviously just a vehicle for corruption.

       I don't think it is normal. And I don't think the bank understood that's what the defendants were trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the clerk just plugs in the given routing number, and unless they have the FR's numbers memorized they wouldn't know that the defendants were claiming to have an account there. Just that they wanted to use routing number X and account number Y to transfer $Z.

       This has been known for decades.  You (a lawyer) want us to believe that, instead of billing your clients, you spend your office hours coming to a conspiracy forum and arguing that, in 2017, banks don't perform minimal due diligence in order to protect themselves from obvious fraud.  I say you're lying.  I say this is a common practice, and it has been exposed as such.

       If it's a common practice, then they'll have an easy defense at trial, won't they? But they won't, because it isn't. There's no secret pot of gold accessible by reading the right YouTube comments and using a magic account number and wishing real hard.

       What would the banks do to close this avenue? Post a list of FR routing numbers for every clerk to check every time they process a customer's transaction? That would be a burdensome way to control a very small amount of fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be a bit like prohibiting tellers from keeping money at their desks, and making them go back into the vault every time a customer wanted change for a fifty. It would prevent people from scooping up the money in the drawer and running, which is a real crime that happens--I heard once that it's the most common kind of bank robbery. But it's not common enough, or problematic enough, to justify putting up inconvenient safeguards.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, very few people try this scam on the level these two did. And those who do have to be very, very, very ignorant of basic law and finance, which makes them a lot easier to catch. These guys made off with $1.5 million and, if I understand the indictment right, tried to keep it in the same bank they stole it from.

       So in addition to the one single possibility I mentioned above, yes, they could also come up with a second protection. You are clearly playing 8-D chess here.

       But the same issues apply. Why bother writing up a blacklist of routing numbers when this fraud is rare and easily caught? Maybe they will now that it's getting some social media buzz again, who knows.

       But "a bank fell for it" is really, really weak evidence for the super-duper secret FR accounts that are really secret everywhere except YouTube comments and Reddit. Especially when the people who tried to use those "accounts" got busted and are under immediate indictment for fraud.
