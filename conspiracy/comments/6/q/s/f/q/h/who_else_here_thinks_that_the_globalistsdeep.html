      <p>
       By take us down I mean real nuclear attacks to really cripple us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, dont the Globalists completely control China? Didnt they sort of set it all up as their near dictatorship to replace the manufacturing capabiloty of the USA decades ago. Back when the Clintons sold China nuclesr secrets and tooks millions from them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I think Trump brought in a general as chief of staff because he knows war is about to start.

       Just like all these people in here who have no degrees and no experience trying to tell us they know the earth is round/ flat. People don't believe the news, but they believe some shit they read on the internet. Pretty sure codaclouds was just joking, though I could be wrong.

       There's not enough time in the day to enjoy life and asks investigate every user, though I imagine it's pretty abysmal. I support questioning things, but calling shit fake without even offering a theory in return is pretty bottom of the barrel.

       As for NK ... the North Korean is on average 3 inches shorter than South Korean, now apply that same malnourishment and developmental gap to cognitive and intellectual performance.

       And now ask yourself can NK take over the sole global superpower?

       Genetic shortness is caused by malnourished? What about tallness? Are you just making this crap up as you go?

       North and South Koreans were a unified, homogenous population until the 1950s. There is no "genetic shortness" difference between North and South.

       It comes to my attention that people like to present themselves like they know shit when they don't. Please feel free to prove that sixty-five years of poor nutrition breeds shorter people. While you're doing that, you can prove that North Koreans are suffering from malnutrition. It sounds a bit like horse shit, if I can speak freely.

       Even if that were somehow remarkably true - and it's not, there are a lot more health problems in NK - it would still be a form of malnutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really sure what your overall point is unless your suggesting that North Koreans are not suffering as a people under the Kim family.

The refugees, he says, "come from all social strata and from all regions".
He has also studied data collected by the North Korean government and by international organisations working in North Korea, which he says support his findings."

       it is true that height is very plastic.

      <p>
       in napolean's time the dutch were tiny. tall for a man, 5'6" or so, normal 5'2". now they are the tallest in the world. tall for a dutchman is 6'4," normal is 6.

       diet played a huge role, but also did the flattening of the social status hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       during napolean's time, americans were the tallest people in the world, 6' was common...now we are shrinking. for us it is primarily a function of the steepening of the social status heirarchy. our caloric intake is what is keeping us from becoming midgets like 19th century dutchmen.

       I have yet to see a single statistic representing that North Koreans have been shrinking at all, and if they are that it had to do with malnutrition. Now, in the absence of these sources, we can only speculate three possibilities.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's outright horse shit. Very likely without facts to support the claim.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The claim is correct, and the determined cause is correct. North Koreans are getting shorter, and it's directly v related to a poor diet (two facts we're still waiting to have sourced. I've never had an issue opening a second window on a mobile device to get my sources, so not sure what the problem is).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         South Koreans are getting taller due to a better diet than they were subjected to 65 years ago.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If 2 is possible, then 3 is as likely. It's more likely that we would see more signs of malnutrition, including widespread death. The initial claim reads like more anti-Korean propaganda, so it necessitates sources.

       Foreign empires implode like Russia did in 1918.  They lost their main leadership prematurely.  The next leader was unprepared due to a crisis with Japan in 1905.  This cost the trust and allowed insurgents to create distrust due to the failing.  It is a case study on how to topple regimes, destroy corporate competition, etc.  Too big to prepare is the reason for it.  If the second in command/successor is not prepared to take the reins then it is perfect to destabilize the country, corporation, etc by removing the leader or maybe the first few leaders in some cases.  It is in my book.  A lot of leadership positions in the US takes years to really grasp and take the right training to successfully achieve.  This is why if you wanted to steal market share from a big company.  Check to see where they are in their leadership.  If the successor is still being groomed, then find dirt to remove the leader.  Then, if a major crisis event happens to an ill prepared leader, it will cause a lack of confidence in them which will result in an insurgence within.

       No, I don't think this is true at all, and here's why.

      <p>
       I believe North Korea is being portrayed as the new USSR (not literally) and shown as stronger and scarier than it actually is in order to instill fear in Americans, and in turn, money for the military industrial complex. The same thing was done with USSR during the Cold War. Look at the anti-nuke company's stock prices and media coverage of North Korean missiles.

       NK is a distraction.  Easy to hate on so people will eat that up.  We've already been in Korea once and it was basically a China - USA proxy war.

       Yes, this is exactly what is going on...
      </p>

       Also why the MSM runs demonization of Trump alongside war with NK bullshit, their CIA cohorts are initiating the false flag war.  Trump has the military trying to thwart this plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus is: the globalists will impeach Trump in the fall, full conviction in the Senate.  The Russia sanction vote proves this...

       The russian sanctio  votewas a complete peoof of gobalist control. There os no reason for America to have an issue with Russia and the President didnt want it. The only reason is the globalists wa t to break Puton and regain control of russian resources like they had with Yeltsin.
