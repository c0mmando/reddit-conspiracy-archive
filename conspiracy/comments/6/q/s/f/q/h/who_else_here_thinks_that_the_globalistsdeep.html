<p>By take us down I mean real nuclear attacks to really cripple us.</p>

<p>Also, dont the Globalists completely control China? Didnt they sort of set it all up as their near dictatorship to replace the manufacturing capabiloty of the USA decades ago. Back when the Clintons sold China nuclesr secrets and tooks millions from them?</p>

<p>Also I think Trump brought in a general as chief of staff because he knows war is about to start.</p>

<p>Even if that were somehow remarkably true - and it&#39;s not, there are a lot more health problems in NK - it would still be a form of malnutrition.</p>

Schwekendiek has studied refugees, but he rejects the notion that people driven to cross the border to South Korea are the most disadvantaged and therefore most likely to be stunted.

He has also studied data collected by the North Korean government and by international organisations working in North Korea, which he says support his findings.&quot;</em></p>

<li><p>It&#39;s outright horse shit. Very likely without facts to support the claim.</p></li>
<li><p>The claim is correct, and the determined cause is correct. North Koreans are getting shorter, and it&#39;s directly v related to a poor diet (two facts we&#39;re still waiting to have sourced. I&#39;ve never had an issue opening a second window on a mobile device to get my sources, so not sure what the problem is).</p></li>
<li><p>South Koreans are getting taller due to a better diet than they were subjected to 65 years ago.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If 2 is possible, then 3 is as likely. It&#39;s more likely that we would see more signs of malnutrition, including widespread death. The initial claim reads like more anti-Korean propaganda, so it necessitates sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foreign empires implode like Russia did in 1918.  They lost their main leadership prematurely.  The next leader was unprepared due to a crisis with Japan in 1905.  This cost the trust and allowed insurgents to create distrust due to the failing.  It is a case study on how to topple regimes, destroy corporate competition, etc.  Too big to prepare is the reason for it.  If the second in command/successor is not prepared to take the reins then it is perfect to destabilize the country, corporation, etc by removing the leader or maybe the first few leaders in some cases.  It is in my book.  A lot of leadership positions in the US takes years to really grasp and take the right training to successfully achieve.  This is why if you wanted to steal market share from a big company.  Check to see where they are in their leadership.  If the successor is still being groomed, then find dirt to remove the leader.  Then, if a major crisis event happens to an ill prepared leader, it will cause a lack of confidence in them which will result in an insurgence within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t think this is true at all, and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>I believe North Korea is being portrayed as the new USSR (not literally) and shown as stronger and scarier than it actually is in order to instill fear in Americans, and in turn, money for the military industrial complex. The same thing was done with USSR during the Cold War. Look at the anti-nuke company&#39;s stock prices and media coverage of North Korean missiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its just the opposite . I think north korea has been  building the missiles and nukes and setting them up before the public testing.</p>

<p>Ill bet they have 10 ready to launch with nukes onboard.</p>

<p>They donthave to be accurate.</p>

<p>People forget we did that in the 40&#39;s with analog tubes and basic electronocs.</p>

<p>Elon musk built a rocket that can orbit with a far greate rpayload and he assjust working oitof an old warehouse in los angeles.</p>

<p>This shit aint that hard anymore with modern technomogy and computers and metallurgy.</p>

<p>We can only hope our missile defenses have advanced far beyond anti missile missiles and kinectic energy weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is exactly what is going on...</p>

<p>Also why the MSM runs demonization of Trump alongside war with NK bullshit, their CIA cohorts are initiating the false flag war.  Trump has the military trying to thwart this plot.</p>

<p>Bonus is: the globalists will impeach Trump in the fall, full conviction in the Senate.  The Russia sanction vote proves this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The russian sanctio  votewas a complete peoof of gobalist control. There os no reason for America to have an issue with Russia and the President didnt want it. The only reason is the globalists wa t to break Puton and regain control of russian resources like they had with Yeltsin.</p>
