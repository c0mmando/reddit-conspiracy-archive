       Hi, I lurk here a lot and hate to see the infighting between the people of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - no matter if you are left wing or right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of people on this sub who genuinely argue with each other over the prettiest of shit and resort to name calling of "left winger!" and "right winger!" Is absurd! For christs sake people, at the end of the day the only difference between a corrupt republican and a corrupt democrat is in name.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real enemy is not another user browsing this sub forum, it is people like the Koch brothers, Soros, the Guptja family (South Africa), and the Rothschilds. If you are not willing to look at a conspiracy because of a certain party, there's a good chance you're being biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'm a bad writer, I know. But seeing the infighting between good people is upsetting.)

       What's wrong with socialism?  Socialism is the way to remedy the problem of poverty and extreme wealth concentration.  Socialism means sharing both the work and the rewards that a functioning community is supposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cult of the boot-strapping individual is at the root of the modern economic and social problems.  TPTB socially engineer Americans to hate sharing, hate each other, and destroy the concept of community.

       Do you use roads to live, street signs, street lights, and the police who maintain their proper functioning? Where did your customers get the wealth to be able to buy your goods, how many government institutions allowed that wealth to be generated? Do you require protection by the police? Where does the value of your currency come from(government institutions and laws that deal with countless foreign governments)? This self deluded narrative that appeals to the egos of humans is oh so typical of libertarians and self proclaimed "self made people". You, your existence, and "achievements" are dependent on the government in so many ways you are unaware of, it would make your head spin if you ever became aware. There is no such thing as self made person, stop lying to yourself kid.

       Typical of a socialist to have no idea about specialisation or skill development; typical reaction of a person who's done very little if anything at all to better themselves and produce anything of worth in their meaningless and short existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how much of what you consume is based on hard work, individual determination and motivation, artistic vision and creativity, and self-sacrifice on a level you'd be unwilling to make in this society or a socialist one? If you were aware of any of that it would make your head spin, but the truth is you're a born consumer and nothing more.

       Here are some questions :
      </p>
      <p>
       How is, "if everything suddenly disappeared you wouldn't be able to make money or survive!" An argument against capitalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how much IP you consume on a daily basis? Do you have any idea the level of skill involved in the creation of the IP you consume? Are you aware of the personal sacrifice involved by the people who create the IP? Are you aware of how you've contributed literally nothing to their life that haven't contributed to yours, while still consuming their IP and producing none of your own?

       Are you prepared to live in a world where all your mediums of interest and entertainment have either stagnated into state propaganda or disappear altogether due to more and more people thinking like yourself?

       Your top comment of all time is about a movie. You have no clue how much of a disparity there is in terms of skill and motivation spread among those involved in the creation of film.

       Well now we know you are a liar or you don't know how to do basic research for the claims you make. My highest comment was about a dog being woken up by an asshole cat and then goes back to sleep after it sees its human.

       Your post is some enormous ad hominem motivated by your egomania and narcissism. I am very much pro capitalism, it is awesome in how it finances innovation through competition which allows unparalleled resources to be used for such causes. Through this innovation we advance humanity and improve the overall quality of life. The competition for profit causes a race to the bottom for many goods that makes them accessible to the poor and large populations. Those are just two of the many awesome pros of capitalism that make it superior to any economic system ever devised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you went on some egomaniacal rant(which was quite embarrassing, full of ridiculous assumptions, and was motivated by your egomania and narcissism) I was referring to the amount of government resources you consume. You want to be and actually are a free loader obviously. You want to use all these government resources to make your wealth for free. The more government resources you use to acquire wealth, the more you should pay in taxes.  Stop being a parasite and wanting something for nothing.

       I already answered this... You appear to not be following the conversation. I will copy and paste the answer to your question. There are countless government resources that you owe your existence to, do you have workers, do you have customers, what economic conditions produce the rules of your industry, who educated your workers(probably public schools), patent laws, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you use roads to live, street signs, street lights, and the police who maintain their proper functioning? Where did your customers get the wealth to be able to buy your goods, how many government institutions allowed that wealth to be generated? Do you require protection by the police? Where does the value of your currency come from(government institutions and laws that deal with countless foreign governments)? This self deluded narrative that appeals to the egos of humans is oh so typical of libertarians and self proclaimed "self made people". You, your existence, and "achievements" are dependent on the government in so many ways you are unaware of, it would make your head spin if you ever became aware of them.

       that of an ungrateful person trying to get something for nothing. You are not acknowledging all the government resources you are using to make your wealth. Yes you should be taxed. Yes if you are super wealthy, you should be taxed more than the average joe. The super wealthy are using more government resources than the average joe.

       Then what exactly is wrong? I pay taxes, I believe in a functioning government and free market economy. I'm well aware of what a functional capitalist society enables is citizens to do, and I'm aware that the taxes generated from its citizens enable us to have infrastructure. I'm all for it, which is why I work hard, don't expect anything for nothing, and pay taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in socialism or communism, which is what the original post I was responding to was defending. Maybe you should learn to read.

       I wasn't talking about not paying taxes, dumbass. I wasn't talking about not using public infrastructure. I was talking directly to the guy arguing in favor of socialism. You want freeloaders? It's the people who want the government to pay them dividends from work I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, man... you should email aronofsky and tell him that he ought to be in favor of socialism since he uses roads and electrical power. That's how your entire argument is coming across due to how inarticulate you are.

       Go write and produce a film score, then bring it to me and tell me if you'd like to give it away for free. Go write a screenplay, and then produce it as a full-feature film.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are incapable of such a thing, consider what it would take for you to actually do it. If someone held your kids in prison until you produced the film, how old would they be when you finally saw them again? Couple days in your mind, I'm sure.

       We will give your film away for free and your compensation will be knowing how much youve contributed to humanity, sound fair?

       You might be right, but I don't think you are. It's one of those impossible to prove scenarios. Are special interest groups driving legislation, or are special interest groups media creations in order to shift the blame for legislation?

       That's not true. Take any group of people and you will find legislation and interest groups that threaten their core values. My point is that this is the scam. Whatever you believe in, I'm sure it is under threat from someone. The result is that at election time you basically have to vote for the one candidate who cares about the thing most important to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You care about tradition and values. There's a party for that. Someone else cares about the environment. There's a party for that. Someone else wants the flag to have a rainbow dildo on it. There's a party for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But almost none of the things these politicians run on get changed. They blame gridlock. But they have no problem passing military appropriations and giving money to big industries. But there is no party for that.

       I have no idea what you are talking about. I suspect you might not, either. The native peoples of Europe are white, and they are being diluted very quickly, without getting a chance to vote on it. This is sick. Anybody who supports or argues for the dilution of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       ethnic group is a sicko, pure and simple.

       I'm asking you, isn't that precisely how genetics works?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have errors in their genetic code, but as long as they don't have the same error it's unlikely to become dominant, but if you have two closely related people they are likely to have the same errors since they're based off the same DNA?

       Explain "diluted." Skin color is just a simple, semi-arbitrary distinction we humans make because we possess eyeballs. From a genetic standpoint, walling yourself off from other people outside your community makes your group weaker in the long-run.

       Humans are not water; they are not "diluted." That line of thinking leads to eugenics; also Tibet is a small and poor country, and any population change can have hazards. 6 million Syrians (and not even that many going there) in a continent of over 743 million, and it's not like all 6 million will immediately mate with a local upon arrival.

       It's not just Syrians or the recent migrants. It's been happening in Europe for decades. London is already majority non-British. Soon the entire of Britain will be majority non-British. I'm not British, but I think it's a shame that a few hundred years from now most people living in Great Britain will be non-British ethnically. It's no different than if Japan became majority non-Japanese, or Nigeria became majority non-Nigerian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every ethnic group has a right to exist without being wiped out or mixed beyond recognition. It's not racist for British or French or Germans or Swedes to want to preserve their ethnicity like every other group. For some reason, other groups are allowed and encouraged to be proud of their identity and want to preserve it, but whites are not.

       Just going to point out that modern Britons are not ethnically Britain; the Saxons from Germany and the Normans from France (by way of Scandinavia) and even Romans are their direct ancestors, who replaced the original Celtic Brits over the millennia. And before all that the Neanderthal were mated away by us Homo Sapiens in the same place. As travel technology improves the greater distances people will emigrate to, and our racial makeup will evolve, perhaps at a faster and larger rate than before, but it's not a new concept for our species.

       Yes, we're all aware of the complex genetics of Europeans. They all have some amount of Neanderthal, some amount of indigenous European, and some amount of Indo-European blood, with various conquests in different countries creating different blends. British people aren't "pure", but they are most definitely an ethnicity just like any other in the world. And more broadly, Europeans are a distinct ethnic group that is quite different than Sub-Saharan Africans, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you think all of the world's people should eventually blend together to form one mono-ethnicity. I think that's sad, and would kill the great diversity of the world's populations. And I don't know why only Europeans are being asked to breed themselves out of existence right now.

       That's a gross over-exaggeration; there is a huge difference in forced blending of all people and lowering restrictions on immigration (which there are many benefits to).

       Believe it or not, you are both wrong and right (but still racist). They are not "breeding themselves out of existence" but European birth rates are dropping (which is unrelated to immigration). In this case, immigration is a GOOD THING because the new populace is making up for rich(er) Europeans who due to their social status. Same thing is happening in Japan, and their economy is suffering because their harsh anti-immigration stances are preventing young people to come in and help out the aging native population.

       Europe has stable birthrates, around 2 per woman. France, for example, is at 2.07, which is precisely the replacement rate, which is much better than many parts of Africa which have unchecked population growth which has increased their poverty. Why would France want to bring in immigrants when it has high unemployment and a stable birthrate? The idea that Europe needs immigrants is a myth. Even if the population decreases slightly in some places, that's better than over-population, and with automation there is actually a surplus of labor in Europe right now, which will only get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, with increased immigration the European ethnicity will cease to exist. That's inevitable with the rates of immigration that are happening. Again, you don't seem to care. I do.

       cultural health and economic differences disappear when you spread races across the world and the same results appear. don't be obtuse because you think it sounds nice to say we are all the same. We are not. With that being said, i'm not advocating for discriminating or trying to arouse hate against any group.

       there ABSOLUTELY are genes that result in everything, including increased athleticism or intelligence. Black people have more fast twitch muscles, it's why they can jump higher and run faster (generally speaking). This is science. They were born with advantages that asians whites and others do not have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not familiar with what specific trait provides East Asians such as Koreans Japanese and Chinese with higher brain processing power, butnit absolutely exists. People are not the same. Evolution is real. Genetic coding is real. And our genetics are different depending on where you and your ancestors are from. These are facts.

       i never claimed to be an expert or even educated on genetics. This is shit you learn in fucking highschool. We are all born with different abilities, some people and some groups are better at things than others, and it's because of the way we were created (our genes). These change over time based on specific people possessing specific  characteristics going on to reproduce.

       we can not take in every countries poor people. we do not have the means to sustain them. We already have homeless starving people here, we do not need anymore.

       Furthermore, I do wish we'd let the shitholes bomb each other and stay out of their business. That does not mean Americans and Europeans should be held responsible to take all their citizens in to feed and clothe them.

       That's the cool thing about war, in that you don't have to do anything for anyone if you win. It's pretty absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who the hell invented the theory that if you wage war against a particular group, that you then have to invite them to be citizens in your country. It's the "teach a man to fish" quote in real life. There are countries that need some serious fucking help, and taking a few families here and there won't even scratch the surface of the issue. Not even in the same ballpark.

       what people don't be understand is we can't help them all. some want to take in every brown person from every shithole i. the ME and Africa and hook them up with a 2 bedroom apt near some suburbia or urban center an nice job and a pension.

       Ahh a Trumpet w/ a anime fetish. It's always you weirdos that have some type of inferiority complex. It's ok to be white bud, you're still a majority no matter how hard you try to victimize yourself. 🤘🏽

       Anime fetish? Jeez dude, you can watch anime without jerkin to it you know! Code Geass is awesome (at least that's where i assume you must've seen me discuss it? only anime sub i'm actually subscribed to). You should give it a watch!

       It wasn't actually at war for several thousand years. For most of its history, it's been far more civilized and unified than Europe. Even after Europe became dominant, it was still far more peaceful in the Middle East  under the Ottomans than it was in Europe where they had constant battles between different powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I also recall, it wasn't the Middle East that started two world wars either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: The dominant ideology in the Middle East before America jumped in was secular nationalism. Then the Americans decided that funding 'freedom fighters' was better.

       The Syrian refugee crisis was manufactured by President Obama's CIA, and the historic movements of 'refugees'. This was their desired solution to the manufactured problem. It really isn't about race or nationality, those are secondary factors to the true goal of global social engineering.

       They're "white" because they're ancestors came to Europe where lighter skin was an advantage to absorbing vitamin d. But their ancestors weren't white when they first left Africa, the climate of Europe made them white.

       Europeans are a massive melting pot of Saxxons, Arabs, Italians, Greeks, Jews, Slavs, Franks, Scandinavians, etc etc... That's what made European culture evolve so fast, cultural melting pots are extremely innovative.

       Lol!  It's important to understand, the reason there IS such a thing as black people. In reality there shouldn't be. Africa is a huge continent, sub-saharan Africa alone is bigger the continual Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it should be, Urubus, and Wambesis, Bantus and Zulus... etc. However since the  ethnicity of the African American people were taken from them during slavery, and they were mixed for breeding purposes, they largely don't know where they are from, or have no connection to that heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore they created the ethnicity of Black, to cover themselves for lack of any other ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't suddenly make all Europeans "white". The Nazis believed you could biologically divide humanity into 3 races, the negroid, the mongoloid and the Arian, with further divisions inside the categories.
       <br/>
       Of course it was utter hogwash, with no biological consideration at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they desperately tried to move the Jews out, claiming either they were some kind of negroid, or a type of nomadic Oriental. (not a joke)
      </p>
      <p>
       So while you can certainly describe a person as "white" if he/she has low melatonin, descriptions can be simple, it has no bearing on reality at all.

       The African immigration is to spread aids. The Arab immigration is to create havoc. Old school Arabs in modern settings is too much freedom so they know it would cause problem. More importantly, they can use all this as an excuse to create false flags and blame them terrorists from Arab ghettos.

       You seem to suggest that immigration is a bad thing. While I don't have a strong option on the issue myself, wouldn't it be fair to say that even if mass immigration was being (as you say) FORCED upon "white nations" that if wealth were distributed more equally within the country that crime/ideological tensions wouldn't be as high as they are now?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience, tensions only arise between races and/or ethnicities when there is a mass wealth divide which creates a sense of arrogance on the side which had wealth, a sense of helplessness, frustration, and anger on the side which does not, and a strong cognitive disconnect amongst them both.

       You mean why would humans want to share human resources with other humans? Oh I dunno, maybe because we're all human regardless of what colour or skin is and we all need and crave the same things - food, water, shelter, friendship, love.
       <br/>
       Why wouldn't you want to see other humans make sure they get these human necessities?

       there are a finite number of available resources the way our economic systems currently operate. we (the West) literally cannot provide these things for the entire world. it is impossible.

       I'd rather my friends and my people have what's theirs than be forced by the government to give half my land and food to foreigners who think i am a degenerate heathen because i associate with gay friends own a dog and think women should be allowed to do everything men can do.

       Finite at any given time. Food and water is renewable though over time. Food grows and water flows. The only reason our resources are stretched thin in the West is due to apolitical psychopaths in political power who don't care for bettering the country or world, but rather for personal gain at the expense of those who their banker overlords want to bomb at the time, so they siphon off as much money from the circulation as possible for the war machine and keep as bare little as they can available for us to spread thin in use growing our own food and bettering our education and schooling.
       <br/>
       From a physical resource standpoint, I was lucky to be born in "the west". I've learned that I clearly don't need a much as they try to convince us we need through our consumerist culture. Therefore I'm completely fine in sharing those resources with other human beings who need them because
       <em>
        I have enough
       </em>
       . We're not sharing these things with the whole world. Only the relatively small percentage who are coming to the west for refuge because their own countries are being destroyed by our militaries. If you're not willing to help the person whose family your tax money went to help kill then you're not a very compassionate person.
       <br/>
       Some people who've lived their lives somewhat isolated from Western socially liberal culture may not understand or respect it at first, so I can see your concern, but if you put in the time and effort to understand and respect another humans culture then they are more likely to do the same for you. You can't change a whole group of people, but if you put in the time to learn then you can change people one by one.

       I read about the laws and customs of other countries and cultures. I enjoy traveling so i make it a point to learn their basic rules before going wherever i am headed to next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many places are not so kind to what we consider to be normal and acceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what honor killings are? Do you know how many festivals in europe have been canceled because of sexual assault spikes? do you realize that women walking down the street in a mini skirt and a tank top are "asking to be raped" in the eyes of many? Do you know what the law says to do to women, homosexuals, basically any person who is not a Muslim man with a beard under sharia law? Do you watch the news showing the "peaceful protests" in europe with hundreds of middle easterners waving ISIS flags and claiming the Islam will conquer the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       it really blows my mind that others can witness the same world that i do and come out of it with the conclusion "huh, these people are just like me and are as nice as my friends and family. cultures are equal, morally and ethically across the world, please come bless me with your diversity."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck all that. I am an actual progressive in that i care about the rights and safety of my friends and of those not in power. If you ask me to ship a bunch of backwards barbarians from halfway across the world who want to kill them for having the gall to fuck who they like to fuck or wear what they want to wear, I forever and always will tell you to pound sand kick rocks and fuck off.

       So you're basically saying that you have zero experience and you're basing it because your cousin said someone in Europe bothered her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, an entire race and religious group are scum that deserve to be killed. Amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim majority country. Indonesians are the largest (or second largest) minority group in HK. Your cousin would've interacted with Muslims far more regularly and on a much larger scale in HK than anywhere in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly,
       <em>
        I've actually lived
       </em>
       in a Muslim country. And guess what? They're normal people. They're not mindless 'savages.' They're normal people that just want to get by. Some have progressive views (for example, American Muslims overwhelmingly vote for secular and progressive parties - Bernie Sanders won their vote - and are more supportive of gay marriage than American Protestants), and others have conservative views.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've probably never interacted with a Middle Eastern or Muslim person. That's why you've got such extremist views. You've managed to dehumanize them through stewing on hate forums to the point where they're just 'mindless savages' to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice is to actually
       <em>
        interact
       </em>
       with one rather than just listening to what ihatesandniggers66 on the_donald tells you.

       Uh. You do realize that the overwhelming majority of Muslim majority nations have legal systems based off of either French civil law or English common law, right? Religious law generally only plays a role in family law, and that's not something unique to Islam, Jewish courts in the US do the same thing.

       It remains that way because it's supported by the religious conservative majority since old colonial laws have many things in common with religious law.

       Umm if you are in the west sure that's how most religious courts work in western countries. I'm in Malaysia considered a moderate country, and this is not really true at all, religious law have more jurisdiction and can overule state law at times.

       You know how when you hear someone talk about "seizing the means of production" you can be pretty sure that you know what they think about the redistribution of wealth? That's an implication, and if it looks like a corporatist and sounds like a corporatist, you'll forgive me for thinking it's a corporatist.

       A lot of migrants to Europe are economic migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. Germany and Sweden aren't bombing Nigeria, so I don't really see why they're expected to take in Nigerians into their countries.

       Even if they were to learn the language and find a job (impossible for 80% of them) they would still idolize their "heritage" and learn to hate everything about the west. They will knowingly lie and claim that "real" Islam is indeed a peaceful religion when in fact we know that many of today's terrorists are second generation citizens born in 1st world countries which took their families in, offered them financial aid, opportunity and freedom...and they openly reject it.

       I give you that we're not going to agree over accepting refugees from, for example, Syria, but given that they ARE coming here, surely there are things we could agree on how we treat them if they are? I don't want them to come here without any conditions at all - it demeans those who want to work and start a new life, and it enables those who, like you say, are not at all interested in doing anything but harm those who are not like them.

       Good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop bombing people's homelands is a legitimate answer to the original post, but isn't that the conspiracy in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also true that influencing a nation's people to believe nationalist (cultural, ethnic) sentiment is a bad thing is pretty fucked up, and wrecked by "leftist" or "globalist," if either term applies, propoganda as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could all get along, yes. But the way they make us see it and the way the events are orchestrated are intended to create division. The root of the problem.

       Was more thinking of countering "don't engage with globalist shills", which I assume - possibly in error - to be everyone who sees benefits in a more connected world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But refusing to deal with everyone who disagrees with you on any topic is exactly how things got as fucked up as they are, when there are probably many things we could agree on that the politicians are being sourpusses about, or that you think we disagree about but are actually of surprisingly similar mind (thinking 'globalist shills' all want completely open door policies vs many of them being more in favor of a 'work program' with the possibility of immigration).

       More like "good faith effort" to be accepted - I don't see anyone who genuinely wants to come here to escape a bad situation to see those expectations as unreasonable, every one of them I've met would've been overjoyed to have the chance to make an honest living here.

       This is a post saying that labeling people as left wing or right wing is counter productive, and you labeled people as right winged for thinking a thing.  I would consider myself very left wing and I am a Marxist, but I do believe that government is, by and large, a bad thing.  Also, if you read any Marx, you would realize that he might as well have been an anarchist with how much he hated the government, and I doubt you would call him 'right winged'.

        The contemporary Right in the United States is usually understood as a category that includes social conservatives, Christian conservatives, free market liberals, and economic libertarians who are often identified with the Republican Party. In general, the term right-wing is understood to imply a commitment to conservative Christian values, support for a free-market economic system, support for a strong national defense, and support for traditional family values. The contemporary center-right usually defines itself as promoting deregulation of banking, commerce, and industry.[51]

       If you don't know the meaning of words use a dictionary or click the blue hyperlinks on the Wikipedia page. I will do the leg work for you this time but I should not have to hold your hand this way. "Free market" and promoting "deregulation" are words that mean what in your mind in regards to positions on the role of government and regulations? Stop being lazy.

       Wow you really are delusional and willfully ignorant. Being against regulations(aka for deregulation) is a position on the role of government... Being for "free markets" dictates a role on government. Stop the mental gymnastics. There is no reaching at all, just you not knowing what the concepts and meaning of words are. Again, look up the meaning of words and then reread that wiki article.

       You have no logical argument for your position. I presented one, you just put your fingers in your ears and said I was wrong based off nothing. Educate yourself on what these concepts are and you will realize how they positions on how much government should be involved in the affairs of the world. If you need me to hold your hand further along, I will be happy to explain these concepts and how they undeniably imply/dictate a role the government should play I affairs.

       My argument is that you were wrong. I proved that by showing you had no idea the definition of right wing. What's funny is that you've slowly changed your argument so you could seem right. I don't fall for that shit on Reddit. Move your goalpost back to your original statement and stick with it or admit you were wrong or over simplifying. You claimed it was defined as you said. You're flat out wrong for now.

       I didn't move any goal post... You just don't know what free market or deregulation means and implies and are too willfully ignorant to read the Wikipedia articles on those articles.

       You keep repeating the same incorrect things and try to justify them by saying that because you can read "code words" that it means something it doesn't. Please find me a credible political science definition of right wing that says they are against the government. Period. That was what you said. Your shit at writing and still don't know you lost.

       I already did. Like I said. Look back at earlier posts. Just because you keep saying the same thing didn't make you right. You're still wrong about the definition. It's up to you to provide proof backing up your claim with the actual words. Not your interpretation of what the words mean.

       It's not uncommon for those who support right wing politics to want SMALLER government and reduced regulations... but they are not inherently against the concepts. I have no idea why you would think otherwise, it's patently absurd.

       I just refuted your counter argument kid. You have nothing to say in defense of your argument. I think you and others are confusing my use of the word 'government' to mean "a government". Obviously people can be against their current government and not be right wing(if that is how you interpreted my original comment). I am discussing people's ideal role for government in the affairs of their lives and the economy. Right wing means you want smaller/less government involvement and fewer regulations. Around the entire world this is true. Left wing and right wing are not complete false social constructs(even though the specific differences between left and right vary per country), they refer to very specific concepts that are very real. It is important to know what they refer to. In the context of this conversation, this subreddit is obviously very right wing.

       you didn't refute shit? you just made a blanket statement that was so far from the truth, that you would need to break light speed to ever hope to catch up to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       you constantly state that being right wing means you don't want any form of government, yet now you're trying to play it off as though you were just saying they want smaller government, nobody is fooled by this. you clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about... especially since you're calling the
       <em>

       subreddit right wing.

       Not at all, r/conspiracy is probably the mosy evenly split on the political spectrum (that gets into politics anyways) next to r/AskTrumpSupporters. It just seems like its full of right wingers because they'd be out of the norm anywhere else. Making them stand out more here and give off the illusion of being a larger base than they are.

       That makes no sense. The "government is the devil" and trying to kill your kids sentiment is always the comment or post voted up to the top meaning that is the majority position. That means right wing is the majority position. If you think Asktrumpsupporters is evenly split your reality barometer is a bit off. Fringe alt right is the main demographic for that sub. Trump's policies are far right, any of the "leftists" who support him aren't leftists by definition no matter what they think of themselves.

       And who exactly are "they"? The evil media? Big corporations? Politics? Of course there are agenda's but we as people devide, generalize and discriminate on a daily basis, It's in our system to do so. You couldn't last half a day without generalizing because It's a very usefull survival mechanism. "Better not slow down at that crossing because not all crossings are dangerous, guess I'll just smoke because not everyone dies of lungcancer, those three elderly white ladies form just as much as a potential threat to my wellbeing as those hooded black teens standing on the corner".
Politics, media, corporations etc. are behaving as a logical extension of our behavior, not the other way around. There is no conspiracy here.

       I'd probably agree on this. It's such a stupid theory that he went genocidal because one guy didn't like his art.  Always confused me that people actually believe that shit.

       You forgot the "Jewish" adjective that always precedes any conspiracy about "globalist Jewish bankers " ruining the world. The strongest tool of both Nazi Fascist Totalitarianism and Soviet Authoritarian Totalitarianism was conspiracy, in order to breed terror among every citizen and to further their witch hunts. Please read a book.

       I completely agree. This depressing reality is something I would like to change. How do we do it without a full scale revolution? Will the federal reserve and wall street continue the cycle of bursting financial bubbles and creating wars until the end of time?
      </p>
      <p>
       When there's such a huge amount of money and politics involved, how can one or ten or even a hundred thousand people make a difference? I wish I knew the answer. I hate the power of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't big interests just be good people? We have multiple billionaires sitting on their asses, NOT creating worldwide food distribution methods, NOT creating massive clean energy farms, NOT caring if CO2 emissions literally destroy the earth as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to believe the world of mad max is our future. Unless the rich and powerful suddenly decide to work together in a meaningful, large scale, productive manner, I fear that billions will eventually die, simply from poverty. Automation
       <em>
        will drastically
       </em>
       increase the unemployment rate, and that increase in revenue and productivity needs to go somewhere. God forbid it goes back to the people, the people who helped create this world by living in it and contributing to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, let's just keep fighting pointless wars in the interest of oil and weapon sales, all under the guise of patriotism and "homeland security." If you didn't know, 9/11 was a false flag operation that involved many, many parties. I could go into this, but if you're reading this on this sub then you probably know more than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our rights and our privacy are being stripped at an alarming rate. I don't feel safe
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       around law enforcement. If you go against the grain, even legally, you will get fucked. If you look slightly out of place, you get profiled and treated like a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       America isn't free, and we haven't been for a long time. That income tax you pay? Unconstitutional. There is no law that requires you to pay income tax, or file a tax return. It's a scam, and the tax itself ONLY PAYS FOR THE INTEREST ON THE LOANS THAT WERE LENDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. It's a fucking scam, and hundreds of millions pay into it year after year. It is impossible to pay it all back. It's a machine that perpetually runs itself because we keep feeding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, fuck us for wanting societal equality. Pull up your bootstraps kiddos, we're in this for the long haul.

       And the "left" has been trying to raise this as an issue for decades, but they were decried as "commies" and now as "socialists." Meanwhile, the only commentary from the right is entirely tangled up in anti-antisemitism - they can't seem to keep  ahold of a valid criticism of the global elite without crying "Jews! Jews! Jews!"

       Yes I do believe that eventually it will happen. It doesn't have to be everyone, just enough people to make a difference. It's happening more and more every year, people are starting to become aware.

       It's not just left vs right. It's also men vs women, black vs white, young vs old, poor vs rich (not elite rich, just upper class). All of these divisions were pushed by the media in the past election more than they have in a long time.

       Now here's the thing. I work in confectioneries and we make chocolates, taffy, fudge, caramels, and some hard candy as well. Now I'm a straight guy. Sometimes it's necessary to pull the taffy a little longer until it's firm enough to stand on its own, or pack a little extra fudge just fill the package...

       What's funny to me about how this is dividing people is that it wouldn't work if we didn't have the technology we have. Without smart phones I'd bet a thousand bucks it wouldn't have been able to divide or at least "divide" the people.

       In my opinion I would have thought the opposite, funnily enough. I feel like technology and the ability to connect with people all over the world instantly is what's been enough to remind lots of people "oh yeah, we're all human. We're not that different after all." whereas before when people lived in their little, isolated bubbles of society they would have no idea what someone from half way around the world was like. You could tell someone they were an uncivilised savage and they'd have no way of proving you wrong.

       Thats the one thing that gives me more hope for the future than anything - I am old enough to have been an "Adult" in the 80s, when all we had was maybe 2 main news bulletins per day and the newspapers for facts.
lol
People still knew a lot was bullshit but if you only get told A by every source, then A has to be the truth, right?
Now we see what people without industry agendas think, the man-in-the-street for the first time has a voice that can actually be heard- not quoted or impressioned.
However, now we have the US attempting to stifle Net Neutrality, Putin outlawing VPN in Russia from November and the UK recently introduced the most intrusive data laws in global history- so bad even China is copying them almost verbiage to include them in Chinese law.
Still much to do, I think!

       True. There is also a tonnn of fake news circulating the internet that's increasingly being presented as truth only to be debunked later on. But the damage is already done in those cases and people don't care.

       this technology does nothing if whatever is blasted across these media waves is sourceless/factless bullshit.  but that's the problem most of the noise is and people believe it because of a bias filled and worded headline.  because maybe their education sucked?   it had to right?  because how else are they unable to verify sources?  how else are the unable to figure out what is fake news vs real news?

       Anyone with eyes open can see that both parties are part of the same control mechanism and neither is for the people. It has nothing to do with either party, both parties are only there to give an illusion of choice and to divide the people into two camps (that fight against each) that are essentially the same.

       Nothing. They're separate issues, that should be analyzed separately. But a political party is volunteering to think for your on those issues.

       that's got more to do with the Republican party being rebranded as the de-facto christian religion party.
      </p>
      <p>
       what's scariest to me in this country is the mass grassroots support for religious law governing this country.  Christian Sharia law if you will.

       the abortion issue is interesting because it's two separate arguments.  one side is saying "let these women choose"
      </p>
      <p>
       the other side is saying "this is literal murder"
      </p>
      <p>
       one is arguing that a woman should choose for herself what she does with her embryo, the other is saying that it is murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       which is right?   i'm not here to argue that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The democratic party has aligned itself with the "choice" and the republican party has aligned itself with "murder"
      </p>
      <p>
       so sure, what does foreign policy and tax rates have to do with abortion?  nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       so in the eyes of that type of voter it mostly goes like this.

       there's two choices in most election and one side sides with my faith in that YES THIS IS MURDER.
      </p>
      <p>
       well murder is the highest crime in the bible, so while yes, it doesn't mean shit for foreign policy, tax rates, environment, grabbing a woman by the pussy.   it's still murder and the other side is okay with murder and the republican party is not okay with murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       so it doesn't matter that said party is fucking you every other which way, they are "people of faith" because they don't want these murders to continue.  so you vote for them even if it is economically against your own best interests.  because you are a person of faith, you fear god, you believe in god and your time on this planet is short and you want your best shot into heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you don't give a shit about all other things, because people are murdering babies and this candidate says that murder is wrong.

       The sad part is the complete lack of pragmatism on the part of conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       By outlawing abortion, you are condemning some women to backalley coat-hanger abortions. Even worse, many conservatives would be quick to blame the woman getting the abortion by assuming she was an irresponsible whore. Women are going to get abortions if they're legal or not, may as well minimize any potential negative impact as best we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally abhor the thought of abortion but want it available for anyone that wants it. How I feel emotionally about something shouldn't weigh that strongly on law and public policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to say I'm both pro-life and pro-choice - is that even allowed?

       Yep.  I feel the same way.  One the one hand... it is a form of murder.  It's ending a life, even if preemptively.  On the other hand, some people are legitimately not cut out for having children, and they know it, and they will get that abortion whether it's legal or not.  I've heard too many horror stories of mothers that take a bunch of drugs or throw themselves onto the ground belly-first in an attempt to cause a miscarriage.

       Well, historically, left versus right has been about economic politics and what type of taxation and services we support. Getting abortion and identity politics in there has muddied the waters a bit, but it's not like the terms don't have any meaning.

       Well, economically both parties are very right wing, the Republicans more so (maybe 9.95 out of 10 vs 9 out of 10), but there is no left wing in America (at least not with a major party). On social issues the Republicans are backwards regressive psychos, and the democrats are pandering fools who get completely lost in the idea of equality that they completely miss the point/reality of most situations.

       No, there are left-libertarians (Greens, anarchists, etc.).  By your metric, feudalism would be a left-wing ideology, which is idiotic, because "left-wing" originated during the French Revolutions as a term to describe those opposed to monarchism.

       NEOlib Democrats and NEOcon Republicans are far right authoritarians.
There's no dominant left wing in America (Bernie got rigged against).
But anyway, labels can be deceptive so
it's better to just use common sense on each policy
rather than worrying about
"does this fit MY IDEOLOGY" (lol)
Better to be independent thinkers than take talking points seriously.

       There's a comment here saying avoid class warfare
and I agree if you mean super poor VS working class VS middle class VS upper middle class.
We're all in the same boat,
but the ruling class are fucking us over, but mostly
the corporations and (elite level) bankers who control most things.

       Bullshit, the desire to be peaceful (re: passive) and just ignorantly live a consumerist lifestyle is what has us in our current position. The problem is nobody gets mad anymore, yet the world is mad. We tolerate shit that is entirely unacceptable. But, we've been incrementally feminized and pacified like domesticated livestock.

       On the other hand, literally bloody controlled false "revolutions" are the result of violence.
I'm not saying to let the elite step all over us, (you have to fight back if they're going to pull the trigger on you)
but violence is a trap in my opinion.
Don't be the first to raise your fists or gun.
Last resort for freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many revolutions have been compromized.
Protests compromized and turned violent, 
thus character assassination for those involved
"see it's those violent youths!" and other crap.
As well as people getting hurt of course. :/
To go on a "let's hang the bankers" killing spree would be immoral,
overkill, unjust and let's not forget the Dark Knight scene where
Joker's goons made innocent people look like murderer clowns.
"Hey let's snipe them all, they're sitting ducks!....No! They're civilians, look at their hands taped with a pistol!"
      </p>
      <p>
       An (elite level) banker would kill dozens of low/mid level and fairly innocent people
before any "for the people" swat teams get to them.
It's seriously a bad move because it's difficult to pull off without getting innocent people killed.
We have to reform the government and justice system.
Destroy the two party system. Make those in washington powerless as they
see the people awake and not willing to comply, the system stops to a halt which doesn't really serve the slavery obsessed elite bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absolute absolute best route is to wake up 300 million people in America
(non-Americans can also do the same with their respective countries)
with the truth.
We the people will demand an independent and ending of the FED
and debt based banking system.
Violent revolution has often diverted back to oligarch control
because who's best at playing dirty and causing a bloody mess?
Psychopaths.
Well that's just my simplistic view of things anyway.
Violence should be an absolute last resort.
Make the people see what a corrupt government the colluding dem/repub system
is. The fake news meme dented the corporate media,
the anti-Bernie lies from the media made a massive dent,
pro-hillary lies, another massive dent (Bernie and Trump fans mostly hate Clinton).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still lots of nooby normies who think
Democrats are good and repubs are corrupt when they're both corrupt almost entirely,
so we just have to drop this normalcy of
"the govmint will protect me, but screw u homophobic repubs!"
These half red pilled people need to wake up.
The idiots will take the longest to come round
but the smarter sleeping people will wake up with enough evidence,
then they'll talk with their friend circles and the truth spreads.
Corporate media is on a fast road to hell (dying),
and people are losing faith in Trump and already millions lost faith
in Democrats, therefore it would be unwise to start going into
this fight guns blazing. We are sort of, starting to win.
We just have to put our win on steroids.
Campaigning with well thought out memes,
YouTube videos, anything that shows
"NO, conspiracy theories are not all crazy WAKE UP see evidence inside"
type stuff or "see I told you Trump/repubs and Clinton/democrats were corrupt from
at least 30 years ago, we have to take them down".
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion is a centrist (just slightly to the right of Bernie) independent 
with lots of security and coverage, a competing channel against corporate media,
online channels that cannot be compromized, anonymous presenters,
documentaries telling the truth about the establishment without overly dramatic music,
online campaigns on social media, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even without that prep,
the biggest hurdle to freedom is finding a way
to wake up the people.
If even 3/4ths of voting Americans knew about the two party scam
and were sick of it, (and increased the number of people voting, as the % is disappointingly low)
we could seriously crush the deceptive narrative of "you must vote either dem or repub".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion but I think it's the best course of action.
EDIT: also, another way to reduce bloodshed,
is to expose the fact elites sometimes bankroll violence in protests,
thus changing peoples' attitudes naturally.
And of course, the more police and military that know
the truth about the establishment, the less likely
they'd attack an innocent citizen.
Brainwashed police/military is a serious danger hence
we need to redpill as much as possible.

       Thank you, reasonable voice.
I'm center left and only slightly left libertarian (but sympathize with anarchists, etc.)
so would prefer to see a center left independent like Jill Stein (assuming she's not controlled)
but I would settle for centrist if it would make people
meet me half way and start waking people up
that right wing politicians have always failed the people because it serves the establishment (even conservativism is anti-worker, let alone NEOconservatives)
especially as they both tend to be extremely authoritarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree with you,
everyone who isn't an insane authoritarian ass kisser can come on board.
Moderate libertarians I can tolerate fine, but the extreme type
like Gary Johnson, Ron/Rand Paul, Laissez-faire bullshit, extreme right wing etc.
isn't compatible because these people haven't explored enought
to know it's a trap, a "liberty for the corps" type trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the political spectrum isn't a water right concept
and sometimes inaccuracies pop up,
as well as the U.S. being right wing-shifted (what's centrist in the U.S. is center left in Europe
so we in the U.S. obviously fkd up big time lol)
but as rough understanding, this seems like a reasonable alliance maybe:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ibp9S">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, anyone who doesn't want workers to be screwed over.
I know it's a very simplified view, but the image
sort of omits the most dangerous of maniacs and brainwashed people
at least, which would make it a lot easier to agree on a centrist candidate.
(Centrist in the U.S. is center right in Europe....but damn we have 
to start somewhere!!! lol)

       Thanks man, you too.
I've been working on a fairly long visual presentation to show my political points in a simple 
"The Matrix" like conversation between Neo and Morpheus but I always feel like it's not convincing enough to the most brainwashed who irrationally worship conservativism or the extreme right libertarian "tax is theft" nonsense.
I feel like I have to compile many angles to get people to drop their ideological mindset.
It already takes 20-30 mins to watch the presentation comfortably, adding more would be ridiculous.
Unless it was in parts or something. (But I don't know how to do that efficiently on Prezi).

       Mankind has been dividing itself into groups since prehistory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very real differences between the left and right with regards to domestic policy. If you look at outcomes of the different policies, it seems obvious to me that conservative policies further enrich the wealthiest and contribute to rising inequality, but I know that conservatives believe that liberal policies cause economic stagnation in the quixotic quest for a mythical equality.

       i was talking about this with a friend recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       we agreed that a two party system in a majority-rules republic is the only possible outcome.  the fact is that any number of "parties" or groups of citizens can produce a candidate; however, it will always boil down to the two candidates that represent the opposition of the issues at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       are you for the issues (candidate #1) or against the issues (candidate #2)?  each candidate is for or against a number of different issues and they even agree on a couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       the winning candidate is simply for the issues that the majority of americans are for.

       Corporate Democrats, corporate Republicans, largely the same bird. But leftists want to tax the super rich heavily and use the money for infrastructure projects and to help the poor. Right-wingers want to lower taxes on the rich, and the wealth will "trickle down" (laughter). Big difference.

       America is fucked because people don't know that their "Left" has shimmied over to the right side of the spectrum ever since Bill Clinton.  The Democratic Party is a staunch right-wing party.

       America has 2 major parties:  a right-wing liberal party that the CIA-controlled media misrepresents as "the Left" and a far right radical Christian fundamentalist party.  That's why nothing ever gets done for the benefit of the people and communities.

       Pretty much. Now the no-government/taxes right and the Dominionist right (both of which are riddled with deep state legacies, specifically Council for National Policy) have come into power at the same time, on the coattails of a lazy authoritarian billionaire reality show host with potent populist appeals. You have to drag the Democrats into even suggesting progressive policy despite all the neoliberal damage done.

       The ACA fucks a lot of people. For example i pay more than i ever have and cant even afford to actually go to the doctor. Im just paying out the ass for insurance in case something terrible happens but other than that cant really get healthcare. ACA is only going to get worse. We need actual free market healthcare and insurance needs to be totally rethought.

       The ACA was an improvement from the status quo but not enough. If the democrats really wanted to pass something to benefit the American people they would have pushed for single payer right then and there. Don't pretend like Democrats are not beholden to their big money donors just like Republicans.

       We were never going to be able to get single payer right away. The ACA was a good intermediary step that set up for future improvements like single payer.

       And the ACA is very obviously making it incredibly difficult to pass a healthcare bill that doesn't simplify down to "Everyone has healthcare". It raised the bar as to what an acceptable healthcare policy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       ACA isn't perfect, but it very obviously puts Republicans between a rock and a hard place. They campaigned on repealing it for seven years, but they know now that if they do it without covering everyone, they're fucking themselves.

       an ad from the Republican that ran for my State's Senate in 2020. In it, he explicitly mentions discontent with Obama's direction and one of his main points is to "repeal Healthcare". The ad is 30 seconds, so not a long watch.

       Your statement doesn't do anything. It's irrelevant because how long the ACA has been active has nothing to do with what I said. I said they campaigned on repealing it for 7 years. Whether it's been active for 7 years, 3 years, or half an hour is irrelevant to the fact that they've been campaigning on repealing it for 7 years.

       Because it's true. It's obvious if you pay any attention to politics that single payer is currently not viable. It's not regurgitating information to realize the sky is blue just because democrats said it.

       You and those upvoting you are uneducated on what you are discussing. The healthcare industry is 1/6 of the entire American economy. You can't just go from one type of healthcare economy to another over night, too many lives would be devestated. Look at the specifics involved and this becomes obvious. Think for yourself. If you aren't familiar with the specifics stop making uninformed assumptions.

       Capitalism is simply an economic system based upon rents, in the same way that feudalism was based upon tribute, and slavery was built upon pure coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of socialism is "from each according to ability, to each according to contribution."  It's not about the government controlling everything, it's about the workers and laborers removing the bosses and middle managers and living out business themselves.

       There's a difference between entrepreneurship and being hired to work for a wage.  Entrepreneurs have control over their own hours and working conditions, while wage workers do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it's disingenous to say that participation in capitalism is "voluntary" when the alternative is relying on others or starving to death.  Most alternatives, such as farming unoccupied land or squatting, are either illegal or unfeasible today.

       Wage workers have control over their hours and conditions. They can opt not to work somewhere that doesn't meet their criteria. It would be like saying "women have no control in marriage, they have to be in abusive relationships", no, they don't have to marry an abuser, they can just find a better guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an anarchist, I agree that its wrong for the government to make illegal those traditional methods of acquiring property (squatting and homesteading).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I say "eating this food is voluntary" and you say, no it's not because the alternative is dying, ok, we're not having much of a debate. My employee can work for me, work for someone else, convince someone to provide for her, or get charity. You can eat this food or that food or that food, it's voluntary. Yes, you need calories and resources to live, but that's a problem inherent to life, we can't make it go away. The most efficient and moral way to get those resources is freedom to trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relying on others is a fine way to require resources, by the way, its what females of most species have to do during childbirth/rearing.  And children and the elderly of course, they rely on others, no problem there. Plenty of people take vows of poverty, that's an option too. Or you can work for what you want. Seems like every option is on the table. If that's not voluntary, I dont know what is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that a world in which I'm not allowed to engage in free trade, which it sounds like your espousing, would necessitate using force against me, which would not be voluntary. Whereas in my ideal world, defined by anarcho-capitalism, you're more than welcome to practice what you like. You and your friends can start a commune and not use money in Ancapistan. Anarchism and capitalism are the systems defined by voluntary exchanges. Other political and economic systems rely on force.

       What do you take me for?  I'm an anarchist, too.  Specifically, a mutualist.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Capitalism is not anarchistic, nor is it voluntary.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before, capitalism is based upon rents on
       <em>
        capital,
       </em>
       such as machines or land.  The only way to ensure that these rents end up paid is through force and coercion, such as a state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't the nature of individual choices, as in your example of abusive marriages.  It's the necessity of making a choice in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter how nice individual husbands are if you're effectively forced to marry in the first place, which was more or less the case in feudal and early capitalist societies.  (Thankfully, we've mostly moved past that barbarism.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       to make a choice, the choice isn't voluntary.  The American legal system, at least, does not recognize choices made under
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_in_American_law">
        duress
       </a>
       as voluntary, such as a signed contract or sexual consent given after some sort of threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the factor of duress is the implicit threat of starvation.  In your theoretical Belgian Free State, there would be no social safety net to depend upon, and charity isn't always reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this metaphor:  if you were drowning in a lake, and anyone who could save you would force you to pay $20 for the service, could your payment truly be called voluntary?  The alternative is death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, homesteading and squatting are moot points with private property privileges.  Without an occupancy-and-use standard, there's nothing to stop a few tycoons to scoop up all arable land on the planet, and without nations, there are no international waters or agreements to leave certain territories "free," such as the Moon, Antarctica, and outer space.  (I am not arguing for nations, but simply against your ideology.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In your "anarcho"-capitalist society, there are really only three "choices:"  Work for a boss, break the law by squatting or homesteading in a world where all land is already owned, or die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note:  I don't oppose free trade.  I simply find capitalists' definition of free trade deficient.  There is no free trade when all ideas are patented, all land is enclosed, and all disobedience is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       An anarcho-capitalist society would quickly fall into the trap of balancing a commitment to freedom with an ideological preference for the hierarchical state of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a state to enforce intellectual property, private property privileges, and anti-union laws, there would be nothing to impair a workers' movement, peaceful or not, from radically reshaping society.  It helps that they have the numerical advantage, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the capitalist would be forced to allow themselves to become horridly obsolete, betraying capitalism, or they would bring down the full power of authority upon striking workers and unionists, betraying anarchism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for that long-winded rant, anyway.  I hope you got something out of that.

       I didn't get a whole lot out of it because I disagree with a central tenet. You say "The only way to ensure that these rents end up paid is through force and coercion, such as a state" and I would say you are forgetting ostracism, which is neither force nor coercion. If someone engages in fraud, you and your community stop trading with them (until they make restitution or whatever). You don't need a state, or force to enjoy private property and common law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say "ostracism is coercion", it's not. Not having sex with someone is not coercion, it's an entirely peaceful way of saying "no thanks".
      </p>
      <p>
       About the "not-voluntary if the consequence is death" argument, I'm trying to point out that it's a straw man. The consequence of not eating is death. But it's still your choice to decide when, where, how much you eat. The consequence of not "working", meaning fighting entropy, is death. This is as true for a little crab on the beach as it is for man. You have to do actions to get things. It's just nature. It'd be like a hermit crab complaining that he lives a life of coercion because shells are scarce. That scarcity is a function of us living on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your definition, everyone all the time is in a state of coercion, because resources are scarce. The fact that I have to get out of bed to go pee is coercion, not voluntary, because if I don't do it, I'll die.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are NOT only three choices (you said work for a boss, squat illegally, or die). I am an entrepreneur in a rather free market, I don't have a boss. My wife also doesn't have a boss, as we've agreed I should pay for her living expenses. My children also do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you're an anarchist, so I just ask if your system would allow for my type as mine allows for yours. You can be a mutualist, be a commie, in ancap world. Can I print money and trade freely in mutualist world?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, I would argue that I am enjoying a free market, where I'm freely trading capital, and would call that capitalism. If not, then you must be suggesting the use of force to stop me from free trade, right?

       Sure, I wouldn't stop you.  I just highly doubt anyone would willingly sacrifice their own working autonomy just to follow your orders, however.  Being an equal partner generally is more appealing than being a subservient minion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, just because work is necessary for survival doesn't mean that the current form that work takes
       <em>
        in today's society
       </em>
       is necessary for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bosses paying their workers less than they're worth, people having to pay rents just to farm land, etc., are individuals and governments unfairly taking advantage of others needs to become more powerful, and I find that at least a little immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should at least have free land and resources to provide for basic subsistence without having to beg others for table scraps.  That's what a commons is for.

       Great! If your system doesn't stop me from enjoying a free market, and respects my private and personal property rights (in which I would be trading capital), then I would define it as anarcho-capitalist. And maybe we're dreaming of the same world with different names?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to continue the convo though, you mention bosses paying workers less than their worth. I would like to ask you who defines that worth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am happy to cut my neighbors grass for $5 an hour (I love my neighbor, and I'm already cutting mine anyway), who is to say whether or not he is paying me less than my worth? Isn't that completely up to me and my neighbor? If the relationship is consensual, and voluntary, what makes it immoral?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that the only immoral actor in that scenario would be a third party (currently the state, or maybe you?) saying "NO NO, you CAN'T hire him for that much, I will stop you from doing it, he's worth more!" Now that third party has used force to interfere in a consensual relationship. Currently minimum wage laws are doing this exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you say "people should have free land and resources" that's when I know we're really on different pages. Resources aren't free, they require work. Land is scarce. Resources are scarce. If you want to give away yours "for free" to some people, I applaud you (I am charitable too). But when most folks say "X should be free! Healthcare should be free. Education should be free! Food should be free!" What they're saying is they support the forced transference of that property from one group to another, which again meets my definition of immoral. Food isn't free, somebody has to work for it. And land isn't free either, it generally requires work to be habitable. And even if you did steal it from me and give it to the homeless guy, I would hardly call that free.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to insult you, but when I hear someone say "X should be free", it sounds juvenile. Remember, being a kid, didn't you say to yourself, like I did: "damnit why do they want money for candy, candy should be free!" And then you grow up a little bit and realize everything has a natural cost to it. For an anarchist, you sound exactly like a big-statist, because they too have the illusion that there's a wand that can be waved to make things free. The truth behind the illusion of course is that they're advocating violence and theft, and the destruction of private property and human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that everyone could enjoy free subsistence resources.. we're talking about feeding and clothing and housing 7 billion people? For
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       ? No cost to anyone? Do the resources just rain from the sky? That's magic, that's heaven. I'd love to be a part of that too, but we're in the wrong universe!

       Capitalism requires the use of force to enforce private ownership of businesses and to enforce wage slavery by criminalizing attributes that poor people have and removing safety nets. Coercion is not voluntary.

       You didn't respond to my example of my business relationship. Would you consider it coercive?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your definition of capitalism is different from mine. Mine just means freedom to trade. Free trade is voluntary and not coercive, do you agree?

       Couple of preschool kids, one gives a handful of cheerios to the other for his blue crayon. They can do that because they had private ownership over their property. Are you saying there's force or coercion involved there?

       You mean worker's councils? That means we have a democratically controlled economy, that's good thing. The problem is when every capitalist super power is attacking said socialist country and forcing them into a destabilized autocratic state. But that's no reason to give up. Obviously capitalism is the problem, and we need to overthrow it so socialist countries can have a chance to thrive. It's a fact that when corrected for equal economic development, socialist countries have a higher quality of life

       Both are in power, generally wealthy, want to stay in power, will probably do whatever it takes to stay in power or control...they have things in common and the issues we quibble over are laughable to those at the "top" because deep down they probably dont give a fuck about the major issues for each side.

       One side actively attempts to stifle voter rights, gerrymanders districts, consistently votes on the side of corporate interests, consistently uses objectively false conspiracy bullshit to muddy the waters, and consistently placates the most militant, zealous, and gullible among us...

       Arguing that the right is even on equal footing right now is utterly ridiculous. I don't care if it sounds partisan. We keep hand-holding the yokels and turning a blind eye to straight-up constant disinformation from the right, and it's fuckin' killing us.

       Why should loans you willing took out be forgiven? It's no societies fault that you didn't get the job you wanted or chose to study in a field where a Ph.D. has become the minimum requisite degree for employability. You delusionally believe that we're supposed to be able to make a living doing something we

       doing.

       Either you completely lack any empathy or seriously have no clue what it is like to fall on hard times. Even someone with a good job who can afford to feed their family can fall into this situation. Should they just abandon their kids that they already have because they now can't afford them? And I disagree, it is our responsibility as fellow Americans to help our fellow countrymen.

       Again. Only one side is trying to keeping it a 'debate.' Only one side votes unanimously against repealing Citizen's United, or re-instating Glass-Steagall, or raising the minimum wage.

       The right have been pushing this "both sides are the same" bullshit since 2008, and it's working, apparently.

       People still believe this, while ignoring mountains of evidence that this is objectively false, and only holds weight at the most superficial level of political discourse.

       As much as it hurts me to say it, Trump was right about the deep state thing. Both parties work for the deep state, and it keeps the masses distracted from what's really going on. You have no idea how deep the rabbit hole is.

       Everyone argues about which side is correct, while ignoring the fact that we're getting continuously screwed over. Their job is to keep you distracted, and it's clearly working.

       You can't even articulate who "they" are without going into cryptic token conspiracy soundbites.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't say nothing is effective when you actively choose not to pay attention or participate. Must be nice to write everything off as "another ruse by the deep state" instead of following what happens, and extrapolating a valid opinion.

       You're just assuming I'm not paying attention to what's being done? Choosing not to participate is one thing, but willful ignorance is quite another, and I resent the insinuation.
It's not a conspiracy, and who the hell is taking Alex Jones seriously? I figured this out on my own, well before I'd ever seen any of his conspiracy riddled nonsense. He's a joke who convinces people that they're 'woke'.

       This is demonstrably false. Voting on legislation is a thing. Whether you want to accept it or not, you have some fucking agency, however miniscule, over who gets in and who gets the boot. You can look at behavior, and decide if you're willing to be complicit or facilitate change.

        Media has its inherent biases, obviously. Demographics are a thing. Also, media literacy needs to be a thing. Too many people are fuckin' incapable  of making the distinction between verifiable info, and unsourced, facebook-tier horseshit.

        America is run by corporate interests. On that, pretty much any rational person with a cursory understanding of reality knows this shit. Pray tell, which party seems to
        <strong>
         always
        </strong>
        vote unanimously in their favor? Which party
        <strong>
         always
        </strong>
        seems to invoke God, cataclysm, imminent danger (distractions), whilst committing the most shady deals here and abroad (privatized military contracts, de-regulating banking institutions, lowering taxes for the elite class, stagnating wages on the lower castes, union busting, tax havens and re-patriation practices, revisionist history, dissolving separation of church and state, militarizing local police, voting against data encryption or open access to the web as a basic utility in this age... etc.)? One of these things is not like the other.

       While I agree politicians could care less what side they are on and vast majority are just rotten with corruption. I do see "left" and "right" views in issues.  Most people sway left/right per issue. Some people will sway one way on vast majority of issues and to me they are left/right wingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe a lot of extreme views are mislabeled on both sides. My father is as right wing as any even has a picture of Reagan in his ol home office(plus....his exwife is retired air traffic controller) but like 99% of right leaning people I know, he has no issues with gays at all. My more left wing friends aren't opposed to voter ID and think PC has gone too far

       I can't imagine that political/philosophic/societal/and legal spectrum that creates "left" and "right" is just a sham.  Racism is a fool's argument, for example.  But what you choose to believe and how to act in this life is about as clear and truthful of a difference we have as a society.

       We

       seemingly have some united concerns.. but again.. those aren't seen the same by everybody.

       The core of politics is the disagreements people have regarding the role of their community. I will agree that the media and the parties themselves use these disagreements to their advantage .
      </p>
      <p>
       However you cannot invalidate the very real differences in opinion people have regarding politics because each political view has a consequence that affects people's lives.

       Your point is very US-centric, just because your main political parties are a joke it doesn't mean there is no benefit to terminology that helps define an attitude or point of view. Even if we all agree that there is no real distinction between the parties there is still a tangible difference between right and left wing policies.

      </ul>
      <p>
       So people should learn the definition of fascism, and while claiming to be the opposite of it, see if they are not fascist themselves.

       I was actually thinking about this today. Left or right both sides just want what they think is best for the country, no? How can there be so much hate and derision when we have a common goal, we should be cooperating and making compromises. If they really wanted America to be great they'd be working togather towards that goal instead of working against each other to prevent it. I guess they'd rather rule over nothing than not have any power in a Utopia.

       It's useful if you're being very broad and casual in a discussion. But it's almost always better to discuss things issue by issue. Who cares if an idea is left or right? What matters is whether it's a good idea!

       I see no sign of authoritarianism from the right, far from it lol. The essence of conservative 'right' wing ideology is small government and keeping it out of peoples lives, free and open markets, self-responsibility/individualism, and a respect for western values and tradition. That hasnt changed but since Trump is more lefty on government it has begun to shift folks on the right more towards the lefts worldview on the role of government as we see with the healthcare debate. More and more republicans now think its the governments job to provide healthcare to all as opposed to people being responsible and buying health insurance on a free and open market.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe its leftism all the way down. They are all big government socialists with the only difference being whether they want open borders or stricter borders

       This is bunch of bullshit.  You have your head firmly jammed up your ass.

       The parties have SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES - in healthcare, net-neutrality, support for schools, who gets to sit on the SCOTUS, taxation, environmental issues, civil rights and dozens of other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying they're the same just means you're a lazy insubstantial smart-ass who is useless in politics because you're so jaded you can't form an opinion.   Go throw your vote in the toilet with Gary Johnson or Jill Stein.  Maybe they'll kiss your ass enough.  I'm not up for it.

       The recent resolutions in Congress against Russia were totally bipartisan and veto-proof, so I don't think your point is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyway, is it possible that Russia and Putin have been doing things that deserve some anger and action against them?  I think so.  They've never been our friends.  Putin is not a democrat, and his country's corruption is well-documented.  Don't be so quick to blame America for everything everywhere.

       So every war in every part of the world is completely similar?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many American ground-troops are in combat in Syria?  Probably none.   There are some advisers, otherwise it's been an air campaign.   And anyway they've been fighting ISIS.  You really want us to just let ISIS do it's thing there?

       In Iraq we peaked at @ 165,000 in 2007 and were @ 150,000 for 6+ years, for a much weaker premise - nonexistent WMD's.

       We have a couple of thousand that we admit to.  But we're supporting factions that are anti Assad which inhibits his ability to fight Isis there.
      </p>
      <p>
       and it's just a well known fact that Syria is sort of a pro-Russian presence in the area and messing with them is very likely to get Russia involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that Assad is great mind you, but I'd like to see generally more normalized relations with Russia and stability in the middle east.

       There may be a lot of them there, I don't know, but as far as anyone knows they're not in the war zone.(except the pilots).  You may not trust that, but trust is a whole other issue. I think the media would report it if we were on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you really think it's in our interests to be pushed around by Russia?  It's an aggressive state, supporting a very bloody, evil situation there.  Being pushed out is not a good trend.  It sends a terrible message to all our other allies.  I know it's a catch-22, but that's the human condition.  Don't pretend you can escape it.

       OK.  Putin's "manufactured consent" is somehow better?  Why is that?  You know that a whole bunch of journalists over there have been killed.. Doesn't that cause you some concern?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't or won't trust any of the Western news sources- and there are many, all supposedly independent, then what is the point of talking to you about anything?  You're 100% unreachable on everything and therefore useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I (tentatively) trust the news sources is that there's So many of them.  BBC, Bloomberg Al Jazeera, NPR, NBC, ABC, the WSJ, the NYT, The Atlantic, Mother Jones, Drudge, Salon, TalkingPointsMemo, Busfeed, Politico, Slate, and a hundred others.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of them were saying something substantially different then the other news-outlets would either pursue it to disprove it or corroborate it.   They're in competition, which ultimately makes them somewhat honest.   That's how it's supposed to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it's all a gigantic - 500+ news-outlet conspiracy to fool you then I think that's not a supportable position.  I don't see the world that way.     Conspiracies do sometimes exist, but I don't believe that one does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should reconsider.  You can be skeptical, but you run the risk of being so doubtful that you disconnect from reality.. and that's bad.

       I don't think they compete.  I think they parrot what they're told.  What I see is you have one side catering to nationalists led by the drudge report and to a lesser extent fox news.  If you listen to talk radio at all that's essentially what they do.  they comment on the drudge report and fox news.

       The left wing media pretty much follow the narrative of the new york times and cnn.
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have a third option which is the Internet.  And I feel that the same forces that control the main stream media are at work in the Internet flooding it with bullshit that people like you ad I have to sift through to find little nuggets of truth here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the whole thing is designed to make the average person, making a living and not having the time or money to actually travel around the world doing research, come to this conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I guess I have to trust SOMEONE.  I mean you can't just not trust ANY of it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not a good little boy to sit here and believe whatever talking points they spew out as truth.  And yeah it sucks in a lot of ways.  But I don't care.  The first thing I always do when I see an incendiary headline is ask myself "who is trying to scare me or make me mad here and for what purpose?"

       You should believe things that are true, and which have evidence to back them up. You can believe anything you want if it's not true, but if you do that on important things then you're worse than useless.  Stop being that way.  Open your ears.

       I agree that elites play people against each-other but ideology does matter. I believe progressive policy is the best way to make a fair, sane and successful society and for that reason I am a pretty staunch liberal. I honestly believe the brand of conservative individualism (get mine and screw everyone else) that we see especially in the States is the wrong approach to making the aforementioned best society we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal ideology informs my deeply held beliefs before we get anywhere near naming a politician of any kind.

       Funnily enough I was thinking about this on a semi-unrelated topic last night. People were shitting on white males who get all pent up over the 'white males are responsible for everything bad' debate. I decided to challenge their post regarding this in order to try and see things from their side (not my own personal view bare in mind). Here's my reply to someone who had the maturity to challenge his own perspective:
      </p>
      <p>
       I just like to try to see both sides of the coin. It's something society severely lacks and challenging our own perceptions or in the least, attempting to just understand someone's point (admittedly the hardest thing in the world when you 100% disagree) just goes a little way to developing a more united society. We're being torn down the middle by the powers that be and the only way to overcome that is to at least entertain someone elses view. I have my lines in the sand, but so long as someone is willing to hear me out then I'm happy to wipe that line out, if only for a moment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        left and right wing segregation will slowly diminish as we give someone we don't agree with an ear. I believe the more we open ourselves up to others, in turn they will eventually do the same. On the other hand however, a part of me believes society is too far gone. This world has accepted control with open arms with way too many unwilling to budge on their views over the most trivial of matters. I hope that part of me is wrong, but more than this I fear that I'm right.

       Actually, dividing political views between left and right is extremely wrong. And, yes, we should indeed fight people who oppose freedom.

       It is arbitrary. Atleast with the left. Putting a political spectrum for only capitalism could be acceptable, ranging from radical socdems to ancaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism is impossible to fit on a spectrum of that kind because it's a negation of capitalism, not an ideal of its own. And the spectrum is based on ideals.

       To me, socialism fits really well on "low economical freedom", meaning you can't choose what to do with your earnings/capital/labor/life.

       Yet you caould also make the reverse case. Lets make a comparison of the last things you listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism/earning: Your earnings are determined by your employer
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism/earning: Your earnings are based on the use value of your own production, meaning you can determine how hard you work and for what result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism/Labor: your labor is commodified meaning the market determines your labor
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism/Labor: Your labor is free to be used however you like it, though the quantity of your labor determines what your recieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism/Life: Your life is threatened by money meaning your labor needs to be spent as commodities for other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism/life: To all according to their needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simplyfing the differences between capitalism and socialism to a spectrum makes it practically useless. As you can see, this kind of simplification makes it easy to call both sides economically libertarian/authoritarian.

       Your understanding of capitalism is wrong, and socialism is wrong in its roots, so that sentence it's also wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I guess you truly believe in socialism and, for me, that's like explaining to an atheist something about God.

       Yes, this has become painfully obvious in how they have got even this sub divided. Some people just cannot fathom the fact that Trump really is an outsider shaking things up by the roots.

       They go to such mental gymnastics to explain away how 6 months of trump catches more pedos that 8 years of obama did.

       that is just a smoke screen, the dems turn into republicans consistently to give little advantages to their donors. they are gradually injecting more evil bills so people wont notice. then they make big deals out of issues people care about to make it seem like they are still helping the people(net neutrality)

       You saw a lot of movement during the Obama years to take power from the ruling class did you?

       And FYI there is a very good bit of evidence of data tampering and general suppression of dissenting views on global warming.  When you look past the apocalyptic predictions it starts to look like trying to build manufactured consent for a world government with pretty much limitless power.

       The right wing and left wing werent pushed on the people, the people created it. Humans have an innate need to connect to something bigger than themselves, and to feel like there is a true right and wrong in the world.

       This is just a word salad that means nothing. The fact is, we all have views on how to fix the situation- some believe in right wing individualist solutions, some believe in left wing collectivist solutions. Just because we stop using the term left and right doesn't mean we as a people don't drastically disagree on the way forward. It's okay to admit this difference and work through it rather than pretending it's not there. Sorry, left v right is not a conspiracy, it's a real thing, and one of them is correct. Read books and discuss

       Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But things matter to you and don't even pretend that's not true.  So put your energy into those things and affecting them now and don't worry about making some kind of transcendent lasting improvement to humanity.

       You want to give up and live in depression you can.  Or you can figure out what and who you think are important and put your energy into those things and people.

       TLDR: I find the fact that nothing matters in the end to be freeing and comforting.

       Nihilism does not have to lead to depression, it can lead to pure freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, no matter what I do the end result is the same. Kill a million people, heat death of the universe. Save a million, heat death. Succeed in business and love? Heat death. Fail. Heat death.
      </p>

       Every road leads to the same destination, so I am free to act as I choose. As long as I'm willing to deal with the consequences, I am completely free to do anything I want.

       FYI, Left and Right does have meaning; it's just been butchered over the years. I'm on the Left, which means that I support economic policies that are in the interest of poor and working-class people, as opposed to the rich. I want a much higher minimum wage, good social services, higher taxation for the rich. That's what the term has historically meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "identity politics" bullshit has complicated things. I'm anti-identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do try to bridge the gap between left and right with libertarians who are opposed to the drug war. In my opinion ending the drug war is the most important issue of our day, and we can get support for it from both left-progressives and right-libertarians, and it's imperative that this coalition continues to be built and ends the drug war. Ideally, a pro-freedom left-right coalition could work to end mass surveillance and reign in the unchecked power of the intelligence community as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot that leftists and reasonable right-wingers could come together on, but let's not pretend the terms don't have meaning.

       No. The Right wing is just an extension of the business community, doing what they can to increase profit. You will never see a "left-wing person hoping to cut education, mistreat the environment, abuse Labor, reduce financial oversight, marginalize or persecute any type of minority or sexual orientation, etc etc

Hillary's foundation provides AIDS medication for millions of adults and 75% of the children affected with AIDS worldwide. If you're going off like Alex Jones about some lame conspiracy within the Clinton Foundation, you really have no idea what is going of.

       That's not who she is. I would argue that you have no idea who she is.  You should cut back on your Fox News. 
So she gave a speech at Goldman Sachs. So what, people want to hear what she has to say, like hundreds of other groups of people. One thing is for sure, as president she would never have appointed a fucking former chairman of GS to run the Treasury. Do you even know what that means, and you're worried about a speech?
You really should cut back on your Fox News/ Alex Jones/ Rush Limbo intake, it's making you sound really stupid

       No one in these parties at the grassroots level is anything other than a decent human being with strong ideas about how the country ought to be run.  Their entire career is a vetting process by groups like the CFR to see who will play ball.  Thinking your guy is great and the other side's guy is a monster is exactly fine with them since whichever one you choose is their pawn.

       It's hard convincing right-wing people that money is the root of all evil and that in order for civilization to advance we need to abandon this fantasy. I certainly try though.

       This sub wasnt like that until after TD was created. People have become more engulfed in left right bs than any time in my life. People weren't even this exaggerated during Reagan, even though everyone kept saying he would kill us all with nukes. I didnt hear the word liberal or conservative 500 times a day during Reagan like i do now.

       At the top there is no political difference, we are under  a Bi partisan oligarchy. Bush and Clinton Golf together. Trump wanted to put Hillary in jail and backed down immediately, said we didnt belong in Syria and bombed them anyways. Said Nato was outdated, then he back tracked and sucked their dick. The President is a puppet and has been since JFK was murdered.

       More similar with foreign policy, sure. Domestic they are completely different in almost all facets. They were more so before the GOP started to outspend Dems back in the 80s. I get the argument, it's just wrong and not based in reality. Having worked at the state level, GOP and Dems are very different. If a person doesn't see this they should become more involved in the process. Than they will understand.

       You're right of course. It's very hard to maintain a grip on that knowledge though, when you feel that values core to your very being are under attack by others. Even if that attack is directed, instigated, from somewhere else.

      <p>
       We love our friends and families-- when we feel they are imperiled, threatened, or even just made fun of it's really hard to be objective about it.

       It is more complex and organic than that. How about we would have had Obamacare either way. Why does everyone forget that. Obama was accused of ripping off Mit Romenys plan, so we were getting healthcare whether the president had an R or a D next to their name.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why would anyone in their right mind support an incomplete plan?  Obamacare was shit, everything proposed since has been much much worse. Not better.  Also how many GOP refused to vote for it?

       It's easier to make everyone fight when you can group them into polarized extremes. The sooner people realize we can agree on some things, but not on others and still be friends, the sooner we can get to fixing all of these problems.

       Broadly speaking, politics is the entertainment wing of the MIC, but when one side is putting forward a bill that would make 23 million Americans lose health care coverage and the other side wants everyone to be covered, it's not just a charade to guarantee infighting amongst the populace.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Republican health care overhaul passed by the House earlier this month would result in 23 million additional people losing health insurance by 2026 compared to coverage under the current Affordable Care Act.
       </p>

       I very much agree that our disagreements don't need to turn vicious, as they often do. I also agree that there are wealthy people who try to influence the population. There are, however, very real differences in what people believe and which policies the favor. Some policies are toxic to the country and the environment, others not so much or actually beneficial. The personal debates on this and other subs matter because each person's convictions represent (or ought to) one vote, hopefully for the better.

       Yes. Having an independent mind, idea or opinion is quickly dismissed by both sides. And it's disheartening that one can't even suggest or entertain an opposing viewpoint just for discussion purposes or for casual conversation without it turning sideways. Both sides.

       Collectivism is the root of our issues. People are inherently different and as a result, have opposing views oh the human condition. Only no person is willing to embrace their individual thoughts and defend them. We all throw them away to join the bandwagon of others "with whom we share views." The catch is those groups formed are no longer interested in nurturing their views but rather engaging in a war with those who harbor opposing views. This is what is commonly referred to as "us versus them." People start seeing victory in the losses of their opponents and fail to realize that when one group loses, we all lose.

       Left wing in terms of Democratic Party is really just the Center Right and Right wing is  anywhere between moderate Center Right and borderline fascist or extremely "religious" therefore intolerant and bigoted. Libertarians are strange and don't really fit neatly in one position on the spectrum because they champion social liberties yet worship corporations and the infrastructure of our fraudulent crony capitalism. It was clear as day Congress wasn't fuckin with Bernie Nina Turner or any person who is genuinely even remotely Progressive. They weren't fuckin with Ron Paul either btw.

       it's true that the left/right dichotomy is false and propagated to dissovle and prevent solidarity, but there are continuums of cosomological, ethical/moral, authoritarian/libertarian, mutualistic/individualistic ontological orientations that makes our simplistic republican form of govt the untenable mess is now, and are why dog whistles work so well.
      </p>
      <p>
       right now there is a growing call for a red/brown alliance to "defeat the establishment, the deep state, and imperialism." the primary proponents of this alliance are the alt right (their own chosen name) and progressive left (their own chosen name).
      </p>
      <p>
       while an alliance seems like a very grand idea and their joint goal a noble one, it all breaks down if you make each side define what they mean by "defeat," "establishment," "deep state, and "imperialism." it breaks down even further when you ask them who they want to replace the establishment with. when you do this you find their common ground is very shallow and based not on an overarching agreement of how this country should be governed, but pissed off people who want to make those who pissed them off pay for pissing them off. they have very amorphous and contradictory ideas about who, how, why, and when this retribution will be carried out and redressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no way for these two self-identified groups would ever be able to settle on a single candidate to represent them without a common enemy to unite them. however, once in power, their common enemy seemingly vanquished simply by their having won an election, they will fight each other and grow to hate each other with more bile than the generic right and left do now, because they really are quite different ontologically.
      </p>
      <p>
       as verboten as i know it is to say here, but as a proud conspiracist, the goal should not be getting people on board with pet conspiracies, but formulating and executing a plan to nullify current ones and prevent future ones. trying to solve a conspiracy is fun, but it is just masturbatory self indulgence if the real goal isn't to use what we know fix the overarching circumstances--boiling water from a contaminated well, instead of digging a new well where the water is clean. right now--seth rich, 9/11, JFK, pizzagate etc are all just focusing on who contaminated the well, interesting, but unhelpful in the long run.

       Really, you see no difference between a party that is denying science, using a state run propaganda media outlet for 'news', cult like adoration and belief of Trump, and the left?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not the fucking same and are far far from it. When our elected officials fuck up we on the left call them out for it. I had plenty of conversations about Obamas flaws with my friends. Yet the right acts like they worship the republican party and disbelief of the blatant lies they tell is like disbelief of the bible. These people are off their rockers and nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are nothing fucking like them, it is not 'created' to make us fight, we hate the right for what they stand for, how they treat women, how they take away our healthcare, how 'librul tears' are a funny fucking joke and not the fact that people lives are being destroyed by idiotic republican policies. And I like drinking fucking water without getting diarrhea so give me back my fucking EPA you right wing twats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only people who believe that the right and left are alike are ignorant or right wing people trying to make themselves feel like they are on the same level as the 'elite libruls'. We are not on their level at all we are way fucking above them. Not because elite, but because they have dug their dumb asses so deep in shit and keep digging.

       Left vs right was a big thing in the 20th century, but I believe it is a thing of the past, since new things have become important. Look for example at the pirate party in Europe, which has members all across the spectrum, who fight for a free internet, the free flow of information, a new copyright law and many other things important to us netizens.

       I have no idea what you are talking about. I suspect you might not, either. The native peoples of Europe are white, and they are being diluted very quickly, without getting a chance to vote on it. This is sick. Anybody who supports or argues for the dilution of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       ethnic group is a sicko, pure and simple.

       The Syrian refugee crisis was manufactured by President Obama's CIA, and the historic movements of 'refugees'. This was their desired solution to the manufactured problem. It really isn't about race or nationality, those are secondary factors to the true goal of global social engineering.
