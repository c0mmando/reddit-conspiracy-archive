<p>Red Flags -</p>

<p>1) The Seth Rich story was coming back around thanks to Awan Story</p>

<p>2) Seth Rich now linked to the term&quot;conspiracy theory&quot;</p>

<p>3) The term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is now linked to Trump</p>

<p>4) Story hits top of page calling a conspiracy that most in this sub already subscribed to, a hoax.</p>

<p>5) Same story from different sites hits the front page of this sub 4X times</p>

<p>6) Most linked to MSM sites, where the titles suggest the entire Seth Rich case was made up</p>

<p>7) The story itself suggests that the entire story was made up by Trump, which I know is not true because I followed George Webb for months before Fox ever made mention of it.</p>

<p>8) Images such as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IrzO4ZX.png">this</a> (examples seen in this sub as well today) -</p>

<p>The exact same conversation from the people saying it&#39;s all a Fox/Trump Hoax. If I ever believed something and I saw an image like this &quot;confirming my beliefs&quot;, I would immediately stop talking, unplug and reconsider everything about it. Internally. Using your own intuition and common sense. </p>

<p>These are pure red flags. Don&#39;t get lost in the hype. This is proactive damage control from the inevitable Awan story. A distraction as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really going to muddy the waters with all of this &quot;dis-credibility&quot; from every angle. However, I do think that it will end up biting them in the ass by reenergizing the story. If something happens, like Wikileaks can prove Rich was the leaker, then this could be a huge issue for the shills trying to cover this murder up. That&#39;s my hope at least..</p>

<p>To all the shills - I&#39;m not a trump supporter, I don&#39;t sub to T_D, I simply want the truth to come out about the murder of Seth Rich. We know what happened, and the public was about to get red pilled if the truth ever came out.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right it had to be Fox so the rest of the MSM could effectively paint it as a conspiracy. TPTB must be concerned this is all gaining traction if they are willing to go out of their way to bring Seth Rich up at all in an attempt to discredit the whole story. Funny how they tried to also take a jab at Trump in the process. Well played TPTB, but justice for Seth Rich will be had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actual like Oliver but I found it odd since there are so much more important things he could have done and he has already burned Jones a couple if times. He also used Sandy Hook as an example and that pisses me off, there is a difference between going after the parents directly and disagreeing with the official story. The funniest thing is he&#39;s implying conspiracies don&#39;t happen while a special investigator is investigating a White house conspiring to collude with the Russians. Which is it people!!!</p>

<p>You mean like the difference between finding these Awan characters totally sketchy, and turning up at their kids&#39; school?  Or between disagreeing that there isn&#39;t a child trafficking ring being run out of a pizza joint&#39;s non existent basement and turning up with a shot gun to self investigate that?</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ll find the difference lies in people.  Some people who believe Sandy Hook was a hoax harass the dead children&#39;s parents, others just encourage them and feed into their behavior.  Some folks who believe pizzagate really think they are intrepid investigators who are going to rescue a bunch of trafficked kids; some just feed into that behavior, and some people who think the Arwans are sketchy have no human decency and turn up at schools to harass little kids over it, while others just feed that conduct.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is he?  Did he rail against &quot;RICO&quot; type laws which are entirely premised on and targeted at conspiracies?  Did he do a bit about one of the many people convicted on &quot;conspiracy to....&quot; charges and locked up in prison as a consequence?  Was he really actually implying conspiracies never happen?   </p>

<p>Never mind, I&#39;ll just go watch for myself.  He can thank you for the advertising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is you have no point.  You don&#39;t like that he picked Sandy Hook, you don&#39;t like the implication which is code for you making up shit and attributing it to him so you can complain about it.  You wouldn&#39;t have liked if he&#39;d used pizzagate, because you&#39;d still be prattling about the implication and about him trying to discredit it to boot.  You don&#39;t like it if he uses an example you consider bullshit, you wouldn&#39;t like it if he used an example you think is real because then he&#39;d be &quot;discrediting the investigation&quot; by acting like it&#39;s proven to be bullshit.</p>

<p>The reality is, while you were making up implications, the actual core message is about the money making side of Jones&#39; operation.  The fact is Jones did spread the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, parents were harassed and many people (I believe Oliver is one of them) are very confident Jones spread it just to make money and not because he believed it.  Perhaps it&#39;s his disgust at this that makes it such an issue for Oliver.  </p>

<p>Because to anyone with a scintilla of human decency that is rank and worth mentioning anytime and every time Jones&#39; name comes up.  It&#39;s fricking despicable what he&#39;s willing to do to grieving families just to make a buck.  It should be at the forefront of every conversation about that very nasty and very greedy man.</p>

<p>Your anger at his choice of example is baseless bullshit.  His actual example was something entirely different.  Rather than an example he was putting what Jones did at the forefront of the discussion which is entirely reasonable.  It lets the audience know something about the character of the man being discussed that is directly relevant to the following discussion which used the example of  gay frogs/chemicals in the water rants in terms of the conspiracies given as examples (the point of the piece was the use of the conspiracy fear mongering to sell shit, including solutions to the problems presented by Jones).</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get the point because you have no point.  You are angry in search of a point to justify that anger.</p>

<p>Bullshit.  The point of Alex Jones is to make money for Alex Jones.  The point of Oliver&#39;s piece was to point this fact out and frankly I don&#39;t think you were paying enough attention if you came away unconvinced that the point of Alex Jones is to make money for Alex Jones.  In my opinion Oliver presented a very compelling case for this fact and I don&#39;t see what grounds there are to reasonably disagree with Oliver&#39;s point here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There also is a clear implication that , conspiracies in general are crazy,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He never said that but you need to feel butt hurt so you&#39;ve decided to infer it and blame that inference on Oliver who never actually said it by asserting he implied it.  In other words you are using the word &quot;implied&quot; to put your words into Oliver&#39;s intentions since they never came out his mouth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You understand you can like someone </p>

<p>I do&#39;t understand why you think I care whether or not you like Jon Oliver.  I&#39;m not his mother or his girlfriend.  Why the fuck should I care who does and who doesn&#39;t &quot;like&quot; him?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. </p>

Even if Seth Rich does turn out to be the leaker, which I whole heartedly believe, it does not nullify the russia conspiracy. The reverse is true as well.

<p>And considering how Trump flipped out after hearing Muller was going to look into his finances and soon after Trump&#39;s asking about how pardoning works it&#39;s obviously, to a logical thinking person who puts country over party it&#39;s quite evident that Trump has something &gt;&gt;illegal&lt;&lt; to hide. </p>

<p>I agree. The point i&#39;m making is there is no smoking gun in the trump case, just as there is no smoking gun in the rich case. Both are conspiracies, and you should be suspicious of anyone who promotes one while rejecting the other.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for common shill tactics of calling people names who disagree. </p>

<p>Shills generally have little fits and crys as it&#39;s frustrating and sad for them when everyday (like today) they fail to get their narrative accepted by the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, tax returns show ur income...and your debt. </p>

<p>What If trump owes millions of dollars to someone?</p>

<p>what&#39;s to stop that entity from blackmailing him? </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, do what we want or we&#39;ll triple your interest rate, we&#39;ll repo your property, we&#39;ll leak information that&#39;ll incriminate you or ruin you.&quot;</p>

<p>Or it could go the other way: </p>

<p>&quot;Hey buddy, we&#39;ll cancel your debt if you just do these simply little policy things.&quot; If it doesn&#39;t effect him financially why would he not do it.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the scary part. Trump has gone bankrupt several times and US banks consider him a high risk and will no longer lend to him like they used to. He won&#39;t get the high loans with low rates...not in the US anyway</p>

<p>So he has to go elsewhere to get loans. His tax returns will help show us where. He&#39;s released one return for 2005. Remember Trump is a real estate agent so his job isn&#39;t a salary that&#39;s the same every year. More importantly...what happened in 2008? Do you think a real estate tycoon was unaffected by it? The man opened a mortgage company in 2007. CDO&#39;s probably crushed him. Watch the big short.  It&#39;s actually a great movie.  </p>

<p>First, the 33000 emails were not subpoena&#39;d, the Benghazi emails were, Congress has no power to subpoena personal emails.</p>

<p>Second, the emails were ordered to be deleted MONTHS before they were subpoena&#39;d</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I know this, from the Comey testimony</p>

<pre><code>JORDAN: Did Secretary Clinton know her legal team deleted those e-mails that they kept from us?

COMEY: I don’t believe so.

JORDAN: Did Secretary Clinton approve those e-mails being deleted?

COMEY: I don’t think there was any specific instruction or conversation between the Secretary and her lawyers about that.

JORDAN: Did you ask that question?

COMEY: Yes.

JORDAN: Did Secretary Clinton know that her lawyers cleaned devices in such a way to preclude forensic recovery?

COMEY: I don’t believe she did.

JORDAN: Did you ask that question?

COMEY: Yes.

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia party vs. meeting with Russians for dirt on your political opponent for nothing in return.</p>

<p>One is very clearly illegal, the other is very clearly not illegal. Someone&#39;s going to have to prove that the Russians got paid in some way for the information that they didn&#39;t even share if you want to build a case on this one.</p>

<p>And this is still the only thing they have in the, &quot;Russia thoroughly influenced the outcome of the election,&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>Oh, really? Russia thoroughly effected the election by inviting Trump&#39;s son to a meeting in which they divulged zero information? </p>

<p>Man, they&#39;re good at subversion! I didn&#39;t realize something so unsubstantial could effect the entire population&#39;s voting habits!</p>

<p>Oh, wait, did they hack the election? Like, they legitimately changed the votes, right? That&#39;s what you&#39;re proving with the meeting?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wait until there&#39;s something a little more stable to stand on. It shouldn&#39;t be long since every fucking MSM reporter is doing their damnedest to find absolutely anything to make this real.</p>

<p>And all they have so far is a legal meeting. It&#39;s not quid pro quo. It&#39;s just an offering of information, which supposedly wasn&#39;t delivered, for nothing in return. Simply because Russia liked the idea of Trump being in office more.</p>

<p>Anything you&#39;re implying beyond that is absolute speculation. I&#39;ll be waiting patiently for actual proof while you guys foam at the mouth for impeachment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever stick, but if it does, have fun with Pence! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have to bake up some paint-Russia-by-numbers cockamamie, unsubstantial, unsubstantiated claims to get him out of the way as well. </p>

<p>But if I had to guess you guys will be crying about Russia for 7 1/2 more years. It would be 3 1/2, but if I&#39;m right and nothing comes out of this Russia bullshit, you&#39;re guaranteed to be the political party who cried wolf. I think we all know how that is going to go over.</p>

<p>Especially since all Russia has to do is have one of their people breathe the same air as Trump&#39;s son and the entire election results will become skewed. At least that seems to be the prevailing &quot;logic&quot; of this theory.</p>

<p>We get it. You all hate Trump. So do most who <em>voted</em> for him. Screaming about Russia for four years won&#39;t do anything to help your case next cycle. It&#39;ll just make those who hated the Dems too much to vote for them hate your side even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice job not staying on topic and assuming I love Trump just because I called you on your bullshit narrative.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t argue based on the merit of your accusations then your argument is shit.</p>

<p>Is your new argument possible? Yeah, it&#39;s possible. However, the evidence you&#39;re leaving out is Trump&#39;s denouncing Epstein and banning him from maralago. </p>

<p>He rode twice if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>And you wanted Hillary? Her husband has been on that plane countless times, never denounced Epstein, has a slew of rape accusations, impeached for sexual misconduct... And Hillary stays with him because politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say if anything your horse openly condones rape and pedophilia and the guy (not my horse) I&#39;m defending from your unsubstantiated attacks denounced the exact person you&#39;re using as evidence he&#39;s a pedophile.</p>

<p>Nothing like during a pedo supporter while throwing out <em>possibilities</em> that the other guy <em>might</em> be exactly the same, even though only one of those people denounced Epstein.</p>

<p>So, now that you&#39;ve sufficiently detailed the conversation with bullshit because you can&#39;t substantiate the Russia narrative, what else do you want to switch the subject to?</p>

<p>Is trump a Nazi now? There&#39;s literally enough evidence by your standards to prove that he&#39;s a reincarnation of Hitler. And by that I mean no proof is necessary whatsoever as long as it makes Trump look bad.</p>

<p>The dude&#39;s got enough ACTUAL issues to attack him on. Why are you idiots crying wolf? He&#39;s going to win next time thanks to this idiocy. Thanks for contributing to exactly what you&#39;re fighting.</p>

<p>Let me know when you have absolutely anything substantiated and substantial. I know it&#39;ll be in three and a half years when no one believes you anymore, but I&#39;ll be happy to listen, laugh, and say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what Cambridge Analytica shills want you to believe, that&#39;s exactly what they did during the election - claim anything that goes against the Republican agenda as &#39;shareblue&#39; then you can easily dismiss it without looking at evidence.

<p>&#39;Solely&#39; because you went through some of my history? I have posted on number of issues over a year but you only see &#39;Trump Russia&#39; as if that&#39;s the only one that exists. If I wasn&#39;t banned on r/politics, I won&#39;t be even posting here to get my daily politics fix. </p>

<p>Care to direct me to a few of your comments that go against MSM/DNC narrative?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a requirement now? Can you show me few of your comments that go against Trump/RNC narrative? You show me the way, how it&#39;s done.</p>

I just did a quick check - you&#39;re absolutely right. I confused you with another post. My apologies. You have my full respect.
I&#39;m headed into work, but it looks like this is mostly us taking back and forth at this point.
Is it cool with you if I get back to you later tonight? It&#39;s totally understandable if you don&#39;t want to continue what might essentially be a pointless debate, but I actually really appreciate hearing the other side. There&#39;s been plenty of times that I&#39;ve realized my misconceptions through conversations like this, so I think it could be beneficial to both of us to see it through.
Your call, though. I&#39;ll respect your decision either way. And again, sorry for confusing you with the other poster.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see anything even close to this rational in your history. This is from a very sorry scroll. I have plenty that go against RNC AND Trump.</p>

<p>Do you wholeheartedly disagree with DNC/MSM on ANYTHING?</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t look that way and I&#39;d love for you to prove it. You know the conversations you&#39;ve had. You can find it quicker and shut my accusation down.</p>

<p>Why won&#39;t you?</p>

<p>This is not a conspiracy, Jr admitted to collusion, Manfort was fired, Flynn was fired, Comey was fired for investigating Flynn, Page met with Blackwater dude, Kushner set up backchannels and that&#39;s just from memory, a lot of things happened. Where&#39;s the conspiracy here?</p>

<p>(m)To solicit. For the purposes of part 300, to solicit means to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation is an oral or written communication that, construed as reasonably understood in the context in which it is made, contains a clear message asking, requesting, or recommending that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation may be made directly or indirectly. The context includes the conduct of persons involved in the communication. A solicitation does not include mere statements of political support or mere guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.</p>

<p>When did he explicitly instruct or ask the Russians to supply something of value?</p>

<p>It&#39;s unclear as to whether the law means monetary value or not, which I have heard actual lawyers mention. </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s possible that the courts would find that he did not solicit, nor did he receive, something of value.</p>

<p>How is this, &quot;checkmate, 100% proven?&quot;</p>

<p>Even the people who are trying to charge him won&#39;t pursue it because they know it won&#39;t stick because of flimsy evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly astonished. I just went through your ENTIRE post history.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have a SINGLE post that doesn&#39;t pertain to Trump in some way, shape, or form, other than your very first two posts to r/India.</p>

<p>Months upon months of nothing but you bitching about Trump.</p>

<p>It really makes so much sense. You&#39;re so fucking dug in on this that is literally all you do on Reddit. Either that or your purpose is more nefarious.</p>

<p>How was the move to America? Or are you still in India watching the porn you so desperately wanted Modi away from?</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least if they&#39;re outsourcing this work to India. It also wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you bought the account.</p>

<p>What WOULD surprise me is if you moved here during the end of the election and got a Trump boner that you just can&#39;t stroke away.</p>

<p>Maybe Modi is there watching you fap to Vox.com. Must make it awkward, like you said.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be surprised if you see this copy pasted every time I see your name on this sub. </p>

<p>You guys really need to start throwing in fake trails to throw off the scent of bullshit in your post histories. This type of shit will destroy your credibility in the eyes of the readers, and I&#39;m damn sure going to use it against you.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t prove me wrong earlier, <em>like you implied you could</em>, that you&#39;re not a shill, because everything that&#39;s actually in your post history implies the opposite.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m still not accusing you of <em>being</em> a shill, but I&#39;ll be damned if there&#39;s not more evidence for my theory of you shilling then there is for your theory of Russia-Trump collusion. And you know I&#39;m right. That&#39;s why I expect you to run to a mod and let them know I need a good old fashioned Rule 10 removal.</p>

<p>And have fun with that, because I&#39;m just saying shills are real, and you share A TON characteristics with them. I&#39;m leaving plenty of room for you being a fucking idiot whose been beyond brainwashed to hate Trump until the day you die.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s the more likely of the two options. Occam&#39;s Razor and all that.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to ask again - <em>which conspiracies other than Russia-Trump do you actually believe in?</em> </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing zero, since you&#39;ve never shown any interest in actual conspiracies. Just repeating MSM talking points. </p>

<p>Come on dude. That sounds so delusional. What&#39;s worse is if this situation was reversed you&#39;d be so convinced by now.</p>

<p>You need to stop filling your head with that Hannity/Tucker bullshit! btw, have they, since Trump became president done any negative pieces on him? </p>

<p>anywho...so Here&#39;s your logic:</p>

<p>I buy meth from a cop. According to you It&#39;s the governments fault cause they allowed the cop to sell meth and so i shouldn&#39;t get in any trouble and in fact it&#39;s actually the cop who is in the wrong and that makes me completely innocent of any wrong doing.</p>

<p>As I said on Twitter I&#39;m not a big Webb fan, but he did bring the Awan situation to my attention months ago (same as the OP). </p>

<p>And being a so-called conspiracy theorist from way back my first thought was--here&#39;s the narrative to discredit any and all legit incriminating evidence George has dug up.</p>

<p>Also should George mysteriously turn up &quot;suicided&quot; well, he had a history according to family, right?</p>

<p>I want to see all those involved in this Awan stuff rounded up and interrogated for all the corruption they know about.  I&#39;m sure that big black hole runs deep and ugly.</p>

<p>Like trying to push through &quot;health care reform&quot; that deprives dozens of millions of their insurance, spikes premiums for the most vulnerable, allows insurance companies to prey on their customers, all in the name of cutting taxes for a few dozen billionaire families.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technique #3 - &#39;TOPIC DILUTION&#39;</p>

<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>

<p>Another lie, Fusion GPS was hired by Republicans to create the dossier</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you had that law within three minutes?</p>

<p>What, is it on your desktop? I&#39;m sure preparedness is part of the training over there, so this adds to my theory.</p>

<p>Also, what specific section of that law was broken? It&#39;s about contributions. Contributions with a monetary value. So which specific part was broken? And what&#39;s the proof of your charge?</p>

<p>A link or anything more than a copy pasted legal code would have been a better way to support your accusations</p>

<p>Change topic when asked for proof.</p>

<p>Every time I have responded with something you have asked, you have further personally attacked me. Why would I care about going through my history to prove something that you will dismiss and attack me on anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you check all three of those boxes we aren&#39;t debating the topic at hand no matter what I say or do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blah blah blah</p>

<p>I posted the exact statute when you asked and then you complained that I was being too specific and it was copy pasted. All you do is complain and put up a show for &#39;others&#39;, you have no interest in the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought.</p>

<p>Have fun proving that political candidates aren&#39;t allowed to hold meetings to get dirt on their opponents.</p>

<p>You might actually do us all a favor and bring down all of those fuckers.</p>

<p>I get the feeling the courts will find that information is not considered an object worth value.</p>

<p>Plus, can you prove any information was passed in that meeting?</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a big, fat, &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t there, and we&#39;re all waiting to see if anything comes of it.</p>

<p>Some of us are so ravenous that we promote it as proven collusion, because that&#39;s what those people want to be true. That&#39;s your camp.</p>

<p>The rest of us are waiting for proof of fucking anything before we start trusting the first conspiracy the MSM has ever pushed.</p>

<p>You honestly have nothing. It&#39;s quite entertaining.</p>

<p>This will lead to four more years. Enjoy it!</p>
