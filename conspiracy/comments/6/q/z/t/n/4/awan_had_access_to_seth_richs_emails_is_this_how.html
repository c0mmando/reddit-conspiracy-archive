       -Imran Awan is IT guy who worked for the DNC
      </p>
      <p>
       -is arrested for bank fraud in an airport while trying to leave the US for Pakistan, where his wife is currently at
      </p>
      <p>
       -Awan was making fraudulent loans for up to $300,000
      </p>
      <p>
       -as an IT guy, Awan was accessing the files of House’s Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees, was accessing their computers without their knowledge, transferring their files to remote servers, and stealing hard drives
      </p>
      <p>
       -this wasnt just Imran, but the Awan family was all involved in this. 
okay, so this one guy was just running his own scam, right? It wasnt the DNC, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       -while the Awan clan was fired, Imran kept employed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz up until he was arrested
      </p>
      <p>
       -Awan began his career working for new york dem representative in 2004, and was hired on by Schutlz the next year
      </p>
      <p>
       -from there, he secured jobs for his wife and other family members
      </p>
      <p>
       -most people in this profession make around 40K, but Awans youngest brother Jamal had a starting salary of $160,000 for some reason
      </p>
      <p>
       -the family made 4 million dollars from US tax payers as well as running various other scams from capital hill
      </p>
      <p>
       -fast forward to after Imrans arrest, and Schultz is making cryptic threats to the police investigation on the case, why would she do this if she just got scammed? wouldnt she want to help the police in this case?
      </p>
      <p>
       -The Awans had access to highly classified intel
      </p>
      <p>
       -DNC is claiming this was unauthorized access they didnt condone, but in 2016, they wrote a letter to the house intel committee that their staffers should have "unbounded access" to "Top Secret — Sensitive Compartmented Information" the highest level of classified info
      </p>
      <p>
       -ranking member of the subcommittee this letter was addressed to? Debbie wasserman schultz
      </p>
      <p>
       -few desperate whimpers from democrats saying this is "islamophobic" targeting, but a distant family memeber of the Awans says that she was blackmailed by Imran who threatened to kidnap her because he was so "powerful" in a police report she reported to the Virginia state police
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been butting heads with the police and FBI investigating this case as well

       Hope it isn't just bank fraud they get him on. Can see Awan admitting to bank fraud to save his bacon as it is better then a stay at the hole in the bay which as a foreign national he is entitled to.

       The DC police had the computer before he was arrested. She made the threats in May or so. But yeah, she was involved in some shady ass shit.

       If any DC official goes down it will be DWS. Nobody above that will ever get touched.

       Over how many years and how many employees is that 4 million number from? I see 3 IT people over 10 years ... $133K might be high for government, but low for industry, and when you need the best and most corrupt you can pay extra.

       This fact is the one that helps make the others seem silly, and that's unfortunate.

       The dnc did not write a letter asking for them to have access. The dnc is not the same as several democratic

       <p>
        Imran Awan is IT guy who worked for the DNC
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, he worked DWS who ran the DNC and other Congressional Democrats. Did he have access to the DNC systems, probably, but this is uncertain. I would assume DWS would be given root privileges by the actual DNC sysadmin, but we don't know that as a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't conflate the DNC computer network with computer networks in Congress. In fact, there is a law called the Hatch Act which makes it illegal to fundraise in US government buildings, including the Capitol. The DNC is primarily a fundraising vehicle for the Democratic party, so DNC business shouldn't happen in the Capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Awans worked on Capitol Hill. One reason, DWS could be freaked out about her laptop being investigated is that it could show her fundraising while on Capitol Hill in violation of the Hatch act. Or it could show more. Awan is only linked to the DNC through DWS, not because he or his family actually worked there.

       They were on DWS' payroll as "adviser," which allowed them to circumvent a lot of that kind of thing.

       Being a DWS payroll as an adviser is different from DNC.

       From what we have seen of Hillary I'm sure they floated across several organizations.

       Still not clear if the Awans were working for Hillary or extorting the rest of the DNC,  They could be doing both.  They stole Bernie's money and diverted it to Hillary.  So, they weren't working for bernie.  After Debbie Wasserman Shultz got fired from the DNC.  She went to work for Hillary and kept the Awans employed so by association, they are on team Hillary too.
