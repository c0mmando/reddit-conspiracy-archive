       Before, I felt clueless. Susceptible to any information being broadcast in my face and unsure how anyone could ever know the holistic "truth" behind any event anymore, because an enormous amount of people profit off of being able to spin any random occurrence in whatever political direction they fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the peak of my first LSD experience a few years ago, that uncertainly melted away entirely. I just knew: everything's bullshit. Even that which I witness firsthand, it is interlaced with my own memories and beliefs, therefore it is tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even have to think about it, the awareness overcame me and I felt, finally, at ease. The relief of realizing I don't have to ever read another news article again and I'd be better off for it, the sudden understanding that almost anything with an audience is propaganda. It was scary for a moment, then empowering.
      </p>
      <p>
       My life after this: an effortless but amazing reclamation of my own narrative in this life, my own will to decide, my unwavering right to believe that I am inherently safe and I can remain that way if I stay aware, unbiased, and optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This poem, which once reeked of romanticized gullibility and foolishness, is now very dear to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Be an unlocked house
in a neighborhood of robbers.
Palms open, arms stretched.
Voice unshaking.
Extending yourself like a target to say,
Aim. Shoot.
I am ready.
I invite hope in.
I know failure may follow.‚Äù

       It's curious, because I've come to the same conclusions under the intoxication of alcohol, albeit enough to kill a small elephant, let alone a small elephant.. The mind is a finicky thing and we all act differently, depending on state of minds. I've yet to try hallucinogens, minus one I ingested (absinthe). Just watched this, and it was pretty fascinating:

       He's using the same narrative as the hallucies. He's not vindictive, he's just not explicitly saying hallucinogens are bs.

       Yes keep telling yourself that you are more wise and mind blowing than others...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you strongly need the ego killer that is a mushroom trip. Psychedelics aren't only about hallucinating and see trippy shit and "opening the gates of understanding" and that sort of stuff, a big part is the self evaluation that occurs with it and I think youd greatly benefit from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You bragged about your ability to put down liquor and then down played others being wise while boasted yourself as being more wise than others

       What if I told you, I have already partaken in a past life, and do not need to in this life? What if I told you, that was one of the reasons I came back here now. I do not need to meditate to astral project, nor do I need a hallucinogens to see. I'm an old soul, and trying to help and remind some of the "younger" souls here.. Think about that for a minute, while you light up or eat a mushy... Truth is stranger than fiction....

       I remember, and it's coming back more and more strongly as we go further into the Great Awakening/Unveiling. I'm here for a reason. My spirit being reminds me, sober.. It's enhanced, though, while I'm under the influence. I've learned to channel it, though. Most people have not nor cannot...

       I believe there is a reason why I'm appalled to trying such things (and trust me, I've had my chances). I don't need it.. I've seen things, and been through things without it. I do not need it for a reason. I'm here trying to help others, maybe that is the point, for people to rebel.. I do not know... truly.. I hope this makes sense...

       This is what a personality disorder sounds like, possibly alcohol addiction.  Not saying you have either, but in case anyone reads this and goes "what the fuck" .... That's what the fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       This person should abstain from all drugs including and especially all alcohol, and possibly get competent psychiatric care.  But, you can probably tell just from their words that seeing a psych doctor is probably the very last thing they would want to do.  So, abstinence and stress reduction.  And awareness, but that's probably a long time coming as well.

       I had somewhat of a similar experience after sort of waking up a bit. It was like a chain reaction I saw bullshit in on aspect in life and it was mirrored in another and another until I realized that it's all bs. And I began to live a bit more freely.

       Are you sure getting older wasn't the parallax change you're attributing entirely to psychedelics? If you tripped  once, and now think you're woke, then I have to say keep trying. If you're talking about an amount of psychedelics that would actually turn your mind over properly, then it took many times over the course of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you hadn't experienced psychedelics all those years. Do you think you've still be in exactly the mindset you were years ago? I think you should give the adaptability and progressive nature of the human mind extra consideration.

       You are awesome. I appreciate your insightfulness, and as I let your thoughts steep, I do believe I can accredit at least a portion of my paradigm shift to growing up. Nonetheless, I personally suspect it would have taken a lot longer to come to these realizations without the help of a good, positive trip.

       Have you taken a Myers-Briggs personality test before and after?

       My working theory is that a mans prefrontal cortex matures at around age 30.  And womens' probably mature 10 years prior to that.  LSD could hasten this process.

       Most definitely. I came to this awareness naturally, without any propositioning other than being under the influence of the drug itself. It was an unexpected shift of thought and felt so pacifying yet enlightening.

      <p>
       what does that mean exactly? it means preparing yourself in many ways, to make sure everything goes well. do all of your household chores, so your setting is a nice clean, organized, orderly space. take a shower and groom yourself so you feel fresh and clean. make sure you have nothing planned that day, such as work or anything else thats important. make sure that you have all your groceries and whatnot stocked so you don't have a reason to leave and/or drive somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       try to plan exactly what you will do, where you will do it, when you will do it, how you will do it, why you will do it, as opposed to doing unplanned, unexpected errands and/or talking to random people, and especially avoid any authority figures like your parents or the police which can make you paranoid and have a bad time.
      </p>
      <p>
       avoid any media that is unpredictable, such as TV, radio, the internet. you will be triggered by "news", so absolutely avoid all news. you can catch up on the news another day.
      </p>
      <p>
       instead, control your media consumption by playing pre-recorded music and/or movies
      </p>
      <p>
       try to elevate your vibrational energy, aka "vibe" by listening to Classical Music such as Beethoven or Mozart
      </p>
      <p>
       watch the Wizard of Oz synched to Pink Floyd. Yes it absolutely works. Synch album start to the 3rd roar of the MGM lion mascot, then 3rd roar of the Cowardly lion. it lines up perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you play a musical instrument, play along with music and/or movies. your mind, through active exercising via practicing music, will start to consume more blood and oxygen, and whatever else is in the blood
      </p>
      <p>
       fast (don't eat) for 12 hours before consuming edibles.
      </p>

       consume in the morning, with the sun rise

       let your ego collapse like a house of cards

      <p>
       have an awe inspiring revelation about how your soul fits in with all the other souls
      </p>
      <p>
       have your life flash before your eyes, where you recall every time you have ever been wronged, and every time you have wronged another person. every wrong is a thorn in your mind, but you hardly even realized it was there, irritating you, until now... those awkward moments when someone didn't hold a door for you, or you didn't hold a door for another person... they all accumulate in your mind, like pebbles in your shoes
      </p>
      <p>
       forgive and forget
      </p>
      <p>
       its not that someone who has wronged you deserves to be forgiven,
      </p>
      <p>
       its that you owe it to yourself to forgive them, so you can move on with your life, without that pebble in your shoe
      </p>
      <p>
       after you have forgiven someone, you are able to forget, sort-of

       I like to think that those thoughts come to nearly anyone living in a system set against them. Genetics and conditioning both play a part in ones understanding of things. There is no woke, but there are levels of understanding, and you can't take people to these places though you may introduce them to the concepts that will lead them there. I found psychedelics to be very beneficial, but I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone, and I truly believe its power to help you is limited by your ability to be helped by it. You can reach the same place without the psychedelics, in my opinion. I advocate people finding their own way, and not relying on these tools like a crutch.

       I had this pretty much this same experience on LSD when I was 18, then again when I was 21 via stimulants. Life changing epiphanies that forced me to think much more existentially. Ego melting events that reduced me to mere bone, dust. Truth be told, I can not fully describe how transformative psychedelics can be, and it's not over weeks or months, but hours..

       Every person on this earth with a stable mindset owes it to themselves to try them. They convinced me they can save the world, that's how profound the changes they illicit in us, are. I hope that doesn't sound silly, but I've had dozens of these experiences in my 22 years of experimenting with what I like to call
       <em>
        sacred substances
       </em>
       . As far as I'm concerned, the only danger they pose is in giving rise to new organized religions, but if you're aware of that possibility, you can negate its potential.

       My point is that there's no way to properly track this "growth" and even less chance that we could determine how 22 years would have changed you without psychedelics. You could have had a series of events that took you even deeper, but you chose this path, so you'll never know, and neither can you determine the difference.
      </p>

       That's one thing about psychedelics that I really like. It doesn't change the person, though it opens us up to introspection. Too many people out there acting without thought.

       I also have my observations of other people whom have used/use psychedelics. They are literally the most rational, down to earth people I know. Just look at every extremist that has ever existed- all non drug users. I think we can at least both agree that psychedelics can strip you of your ego, and that can change a person permanently?

       Its like finding a door in a house you have lived in your whole life, you would have bet your life you knew every square inch of the house and suddenly the possibility of new rooms are there. Awareness cannot be taken away and perspective is the most valuable thing in this world.

       Valid question. But it has been true for me since then. And if or when it is not my reality anymore, well, I just don't know at this time how that might change my perspective. I can only hope I have the grace and the sense to stay optimistic about life. After all life itself has come this far, against the odds.

       Psychedelics allow us to observe humanity from the outside in and most of the time what we observe are the things we already know but with different conclusions, the first time I ever did psilocybe I understood immediately why our government does not want us to do these substances.

       Have you read Timothy Leary's Politics of Ecstasy? Before-me thought the types of notions in that book were hippy dippy nonsense. After-me kinda understands it now, though I'm not always certain what to make of the ideas and their role in real/default life or whatever you call our shared experience woven into a society of numerous and conflicting mindsets.

       You are awesome. I appreciate your insightfulness, and as I let your thoughts steep, I do believe I can accredit at least a portion of my paradigm shift to growing up. Nonetheless, I personally suspect it would have taken a lot longer to come to these realizations without the help of a good, positive trip.

       I'm skeptical, but you should understand that. I'm just curious how exactly do you know it's real? I do believe in things along these lines, but I'm skeptical about everything. I believe the only thing I truly know is I know nothing.

       I had this pretty much this same experience on LSD when I was 18, then again when I was 21 via stimulants. Life changing epiphanies that forced me to think much more existentially. Ego melting events that reduced me to mere bone, dust. Truth be told, I can not fully describe how transformative psychedelics can be, and it's not over weeks or months, but hours..
