        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bill Bowder was a financier who got into Russia during the chaos of the 90&#39;s and became very successful. His business was being stymied by the endemic corruption in Russia so he began to document everything and turned it over to the Russian government. In the early 2000&#39;s, Putin was a new president whose power was significantly curtailed by this corruption, so his interests ran concurrent with BB&#39;s. A little corruption got cleaned up and BB thought he may have a responsive political leader to help him modernize Russia&#39;s economy. Sic Transit Gloria.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;a next move was to jail Russia&#39;s richest man and rip his company away from him on some manufactured charges. Putin made sure that cameras were in the courtroom to show Russia&#39;s richest man shackled and caged. This, understandably, had a chilling effect on the rest of the Oligarchs. If Putin could crush the most powerful of them the rest would be powerless. Putin then cut a deal with them, 50% of their income for his personal aggrandizement. They took that deal. </p>

<p>BB unawares of the sea change continued to report corruption to the government and media. He was subsequently detained and expelled from Russia as a national security threat. He immediately liquidated his Russian holdings and moved m the majority of his employees out of Russia. He kept a perfunctory office open in Russia to deal with any residual affairs. The office was subsequently raided and the contents of the office were used to falsify documents that transferred ownership of his companies, and allowed the Russian government to issue a 230 million dollar tax refund to his &#39;company&#39;, which was now owned by a convicted murderer. </p>

<p>Enter Maginsky (fucking up the name sorry dude).</p>

<p>BB contracted the smartest lawyer he knew and had him collect all the information from this incident. Mags was a 38 year old blood hound, he tracked down most of the parties involved with the raid and ripoff. BB then had him send this information to the Russian authorities. He assumed for all Putin&#39;s faults that he was still a nationalist and that ripping off the Russian treasury would anger him. He severely miscalculated.</p>

<p>Mags was subsequently arrested in front of his family and bounced from prison to prison. His accommodations included no heat during the Russian winter, open sewage in his cell, sleep deprivation, regular cell transfers, and irregular feeding. He was always offered an out, say that he and BB were the ones who took the tax refund, he refused. His health deteriorated and he was transferred to a jail with no medical facility. Eventually it got so bad that they had to transfer him to a prison with a hospital, when he got there he was strapped to a bed and beaten to death by eight men with batons. </p>

<p>What these assholes didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Mags was a brilliant lawyer who documented every abuse with his own legal council. We&#39;re talking about hundreds of legal documents with names and dates of a lot of parties and higher ups who communicated with him. BB took these documents and with a bipartisan effort for visa bans and asset freezes on the parties associated with Mags imprisonment and torture. </p>

<p>This is a huge problem for Putin. A Don who cannot protect his subordinates is no Don. </p>

<p>The keys to Putin&#39;s power are his subordinates and the oligarchs, and they ALL hide their money in Western nations. If Putin cannot protect their wealth he cannot guarantee their loyalty. The key to power is treasure and the Maginsky act endangers the treasure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody needs to read the transcript of Browder&#39;s opening statement as well:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/</a></p>

<p>Browder&#39;s testimony tells us why Putin is so keen to have the Magnitsky Act repealed. Putin is worth around $200 billion, and much of this has been skimmed from the Russian government itself. There is no justice in Russia, only the power of the oligarchs, who operate with the blessing of Putin because he takes half the spoils. A lot of the blood money of these oligarchs, though, is in the west, and the Magnitsky Act makes it impossible for them to access the money.</p>

<p>A lot of people have been murdered over this. And our president wants to be Putin&#39;s friend.</p>

<p>IMO the only plausible explanation for Trump&#39;s behavior is that he&#39;s been helping the oligarchs get around the Magnitsky Act by laundering their money for them through shell companies. The Russians helped Trump during the election not only because it destabilizes the west, which is Putin&#39;s overall foreign policy, but more immediately because <em>Trump had already been playing ball</em> and he thought by sweetening the deal (help with the election) Trump might be amenable to lifting the sanctions imposed by the Magnitsky Act.</p>

<p>The big pieces seem to be in place. This is why Trump was so antsy about Mueller investigating his finances. Trump has been abetting and benefiting from Putin&#39;s immense corruption, both financially and politically.</p>

<p>IMO the collusion in election meddling is part of this bigger story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is basically Browder&#39;s propaganda.  Browder got denied the tourist visa because he was accused of buying Gazprom shares for foreign investors when this was against the law.   Subsequently, those companies made a lot of money of those shares for which they did not pay taxes in Russia or the States.  In early 2008 HSBC and Hermatige were accused of committing fraud against the Russian treasury.  This was before Magnitsky events.   Browder&#39;s office was raided because of these investigations... concerning the fraud that occurred against the Russian treasury. </p>

<p>Magnitsky was not a lawyer.  Magnitsky was an accountant. He did not turn any documents concerning corruption, he was investigated after being named as a co-conspirator by one of the people that were found guilty of defrauding the Russian treasury.  That is why the offices got raided, and that is why Magnitsky was interrogated twice. </p>

<p>There is a great documentary that Browder is having censored in the West that goes over the official story, and looks at the actual evidence and interviews the people involved.  It makes a good case that it was actually Browder working with HSBC that committed fraud.  </p>

<p>You are getting this from a Russian propaganda &quot;documentary.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new Russian documentary about the Magnitsky case takes tried and true propaganda methods to a new level in its attempts to sway the U.S. government.</p>

<p>A new movie purporting to “expose” the real truth about the death of Hermitage Capital lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison was screened in Washington, DC yesterday.</p>

<p>The invitation-only event took place at the Newseum after a screening of the film—The Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes—was cancelled in the EU Parliament, at a movie festival in Norway, and on the ARTE TV channel. Relatives and former colleagues of Magnitsky complained to the EU authorities, asking them to not screen what they called a fraudulent movie, and the Hermitage Capital CEO William Browder sent ARTE a list of factual errors contained in the movie and threatened to sue the channel for knowingly broadcasting false statements.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The propaganda documentary was made by a Russia film maker in conjunction with Browder, it was only during the filming that the filmmaker started looking at evidence and found out that Browder is full of shit. </p>

<p>On top of this the filmmaker Nekrasov made films critical of the Russian government in both the Georgian war and Ukraine. </p>

<p>And of course in your article we know exactly where this is coming from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Browder published a full list of falsehoods c</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course the cancellation of the documentary was due to lobbying done by Browder and his legal team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last-minute shutting down of the documentary, “The Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes,” was engineered by lawyers for William Browder, the influential chairman of the investment fund Hermitage Capital and an associate of Magnitsky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in addition you post an article by Michael Weiss an actual neocon propagandist.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unz.com/article/michael-weiss-and-the-iran-u-s-hardline-nexus-that-led-iranian-american-to-evin-prison/">http://www.unz.com/article/michael-weiss-and-the-iran-u-s-hardline-nexus-that-led-iranian-american-to-evin-prison/</a></p>

<p>So how about you stop with  with the attempts to deligitimize through propaganda, and actually engage with the material, starting with:</p>

<p>Was Magnitsky a lawyer, or was he an accountant like his own mother states on film? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The facts of the “Magnitsky affair” are beyond dispute. In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky died in the medical unit of Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, after 358 days in Russian custody — not for committing a crime, but for exposing one. In the summer of 2007, Hermitage Capital Investment was raided by Russian police on charges of tax evasion. They seized documents from the company’s Moscow offices — then used them to re-register the company under different ownership, concoct $1 billion in fake tax liabilities, and eventually take $230 million, in the guise of a tax rebate. Magnitsky, hired by Hermitage to investigate, was instrumental in exposing this crime, which implicated Russian Interior Ministry officers, judges, and more; he even testified against some of them. Shortly after, he was arrested by one of the Interior Ministry officers he exposed and imprisoned. Over the next year, suffering increasing deprivations in Russian prisons — including, for a time, Moscow’s notorious Butyrka — he became seriously ill. His 20 requests for medical attention were ignored or rejected. Almost a year after his arrest, he was moved to Matrosskaya Tishina, where he was handcuffed to a bed and beaten to death by prison officials.</p>

<p>The facts of Magnitsky’s case have been affirmed by several governments and independent organizations, and even the Russian government has acknowledged some of the central claims.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, an active misinformation campaign is ongoing. Last year, filmmaker Andrei Nekrasov released <strong>The Magnitsky Act — Behind the Scenes</strong>, a “documentary” that suggests that Magnitsky was never beaten, that he never exposed a crime, and that in fact it was Magnitsky who stole money from the Kremlin. Veselnitskaya was instrumental in arranging a screening of the film at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. She also arranged a screening in Brussels, at the European Parliament, although it was canceled last-minute to forestall a libel suit. </p>

<p>None of this was unknown. On June 9, the controversy surrounding the Newseum’s plan to screen the film was reported by the New York Times and Buzzfeed. Nonetheless, this was the person Donald Trump Jr. welcomed to Trump Tower, and who received a face-to-face meeting with the highest members of the de facto Republican presidential nominee’s campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s astonishing how vehemently you choose to believe a &quot;documentary&quot; that supports Putin&#39;s position in a scenario in which so many key witnesses have been silenced. Putin is notorious for silencing opposition. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian director’s second argument is that Magnitsky was not beaten in prison but likely died of natural causes. However, the death certificate lists the probable death as craniocerebral trauma. Post-mortem photographs show the wounds from the handcuffs and bruises. In &#39;the act of applying the handcuffs,&#39; there is a mention of a rubber stick. Human rights activist Zoya Svetova, who was a member of the commission investigating the circumstances of Magnitsky’s death, was outraged by the filmmaker’s argument.
&quot;In the film, Nekrasov angered me, especially with the line that Magnitsky was not in terrible conditions and not tortured. When the doctor at the Matrosskaya Tishina detention center said Magnitsky had neurosis or psychosis and called 8 employees with sticks, Nekrasov then says they had no sticks and there were no traces of beatings. We saw a document which stated that they had sticks and there were traces of beatings. Most rubber batons do not leave obvious traces&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder why the doctor did not provide him with necessary medical aid, the human rights activist continues - and called upon a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist was not allowed in for an hour and a half. But this didn’t surprise Nekrasov at all. It’s also known he died in the chamber of prefab office. This was stated by the psychiatrist. Yet Nekrasov believes that he was dragged to the intensive care unit in the prison hospital, although there is no evidence of this and even the investigator said he died in the chamber of prefab office. In general, Nekrasov did not communicate with the investigator who led the case, he only spoke with Karpov who began the case against Browder. Nekrasov was interested in Karpov. Karpov seemed like a wealthy and modern man, and he expressed his arguments very well which Nekrasov strongly believed. The two of them even became friends, because he was one of the people who was invited to Brussels to watch the movie...&quot;</p>

<p>It is interesting that Nekrasov could criticize Putin in one film and support his position in another; however, there are many possible reasons for this and I am not going to try to figure out his motivations. Human rights activist Zoya Svetova, who was a member of the commission investigating the circumstances of Magnitsky’s death, had a few interesting comments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Many suspect that he (Nekrasov) was paid off: by either the Kremlin or by somebody else, — says Zoya Svetova. — I have no evidence to prove this. I think he believed that Browder was lying and he wanted to prove to the world what he learned. This man, who, at some point developed a narcissistic personality disorder and decided to prove to the world that he had uncovered Browder’s secret plot. He started tying legal factors to his plot which were inconsistent and essentially did not change anything.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;This is a very sneaky film. It’s bad that Nekrasov turned a blind eye to the fact that he was used, Svetova says. “He was on a par with the Prosecutor General Chaika, who said that he &quot;made a great move&quot;, and Mikhalkov. It’s a shame he presented Nekrasov’s film instead of talking about Sentsov. I&#39;m sorry to see Nekrasov on the other side, the evil side. And he has admitted this as well. He said that it is easier to be on the victim’s side, and I&#39;m on the other side.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh right, first you accuse him of being a Putin propagandist, then you feign not being able to discern his motivation all the while posting an accusation by the openDemocracy journalist. </p>

<p>How about this... Nekrasov evaluated the evidence, which he presents in the film, and came to the conclusion that Browder is lying and that it was Browder and HSBC who committed fraud against the Russian treasury. </p>

<p>Here is a part of the movie where Browder is confronted with discrepancies in the story, and then accuses Nekrasov of being FSB, and threatening with a campaign of attacking his credibility.  The fruits of you see in this thread. </p>

<p>The burden of proof rests on those who make accusations, like in law so in discourse.   If you don&#39;t have evidence then you brought it up as a point to assassinate his character.  This can be remedied, by not focusing on discrediting Nerasov or the documentary on innuendo, but rather engage the content and show where it is false. </p>

<p>Because he knew about the case through the media and was not familiar with details.</p>

<p>When Mr Magnitsky’s tragedy occurred, I myself was Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. I learned about this tragedy from the media.

<p>Second. I don’t know the details, but I am nevertheless aware of the fact that Mr Magnitsky did not die of torture. Nobody tortured him, he died of a heart attack. The inquiry into his case is set to establish whether he received or didn’t receive medical assistance in due time. If a person is denied assistance, especially in a public institution, of course we must figure out what happened. This is the second thing.</p>

<p>I also wonder why he is listed on these court documents as representing clients.</p>

<p>Because he worked for a law firm as an auditor.  Magnitsky had training in finance and economics:</p>

<p>He graduated from the REA. G.V. Plekhanov in the specialty &quot;Finance and Credit&quot; in 1993.</p>

<p>Where this is found:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the question becomes what&#39;s the next diversion?  These pseudo-spooks always emerge to throw things off course, but typically the narrative doesn&#39;t make it to places like this until there is more momentum.  Why they&#39;re getting a congressional audience is beyond me, but hey, Aston Kutcher can&#39;t appear every day...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You post two emails from Lauren Goodrich, a Stratfor analysts where it is stated that this information is coming from talking to Browder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I spoke with William Bowder the CEO of Hermitage.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure what to do with this info, but I had a lengthy
conversation with Hermitage&#39;s owner Will Bowder last night...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yeah... wikileaks has emails where Browder&#39;s version is shared. </p>

<p>On the other hand, how about Browder&#39;s mother, and acquaintance, in addition to a government document stating Magnitsky was an accountant. </p>

<p>In addition to this there were documents revealed in the last State Department leak about the documents that were supposedly shared at the Trump Jr. meeting.  Here is my write up, and you can find links to primary source material to read yourself there.</p>
