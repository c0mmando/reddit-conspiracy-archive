        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mean it could take decades learning of a single conspiracy.  I see hundreds of things I don&#39;t know much about but I don&#39;t know where to start.</p>

<p>I mean, people talking about the Earth being flat just can&#39;t be right.  People talking about the Saturn matrix thing is interesting and I wonder about those big black boxes everywhere.  But I see Saturn as a planet, not a giant CPU creating our reality.  Even so, we would be powerless to do anything about it.  And what would happen when we die, where do we go after being used as batteries on Earth for 80 years?</p>

<p>Are these aliens from a long time ago, demons, or fallen angels?</p>

<p>&quot;What is going on&quot; in a broad sense?  And what are we supposed to do?</p>

<p>It sounds like the richest people on Earth want communism and everyone to be poor with a very small number of people being rich and in control.  I have no idea what they want and why they don&#39;t just enjoy their money and stay to themselves.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we abolish the CIA and DEA, they are so against the people it&#39;s worse than &quot;russians&quot; meddling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m frustrated with so many tabs open and I don&#39;t know what is real honestly.  (Someone clearly wants me dead though).</p>

<p>Sorry for so much noobishness.  I&#39;ll gladly die for something worth dying for.  I&#39;ve been stuck in a bed for 10 years disabled so it&#39;s like prison but with a laptop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can&#39;t see them. ~ Steve Eley</p>

<p>Man is certainly stark mad: he cannot make a worm, yet he will make gods by the dozen. ~ Michel de Montaigne</p>

<p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. ~ Stephen Roberts</p>

<p>The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers. ~ Denis Diderot</p>

<p>All Bibles are man-made. ~ Thomas Edison</p>

<p>He who knows nothing is closer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors. ~ Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you&#39;d have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes religion. ~ Steven Weinberg</p>

<p>Men who believe absurdities will commit atrocities. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>It&#39;s not what you don&#39;t know that hurts you. It&#39;s what you know that just isn&#39;t so. ~ Satchel Paige</p>

<p>All natural institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. ~ Thomas Paine</p>

<p>It is hard to free fools from chains they revere. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>Religion, comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but in amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion. ~ Sigmund Freud</p>

<p>Religion is the end of love and honesty, the beginning of confusion; faith is a colorful hope or fear, the origin of folly. ~ Tao Te Ching</p>

<p>A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism. ~ Carl Sagan</p>

<p>Where it is a duty to worship the sun, it is pretty sure to be a crime to examine the laws of heat. ~ John Morley</p>

<p>If you pray for rain long enough, it eventually does fall. If you pray for floodwaters to abate, they eventually do. The same happens in the absence of prayers. ~ Steve Allen</p>

<p>If you believe in the existence of fairies at the bottom of the garden you are deemed fit for the bin. If you believe in parthenogenesis, ascension, transubstantiation and all the rest of it, you are deemed fit to govern the country. ~ Jonathan Meades</p>

<p>A man&#39;s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. ~ Albert Einstein</p>

<p>The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. ~ Thomas Paine</p>

<p>Cast aside those who liken godliness to whimsy and who try to combine their greed for wealth with their desire for a happy afterlife. ~ Kahlil Gibran</p>

<p>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi</p>

<p>I saw a human skull the other day. There was an inscription below it: ‘Look long and hard at me, for I was once as you are and you will soon be as I am. ~ Unknown</p>

<p>Be happy while you&#39;re living, for you&#39;re a long time dead. ~ Scottish proverb</p>

<p>The first clergyman was the first rascal who met the first fool. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>I know of no crime that has not been defended by the church, in one form or other. The church is not a pioneer; it accepts a new truth, last of all, and only when denial has become useless. ~ Robert G. Ingersoll</p>

<p>Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn&#39;t go away. ~ Philip K. Dick</p>

<p>If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. ~ Thomas Szasz</p>

<p>When did I realize I was God? Well, I was praying and I suddenly realized I was talking to myself. ~ Jack Gurney - &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity? ~ Arthur C. Clarke</p>

<p>Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith ... we need believing people. ~ Adolf Hitler</p>

<p>Which is it, is man one of God&#39;s blunders or is God one of man&#39;s? ~ Nietzsche</p>

<p>Each nation knowing it has the only true religion and the only sane system of government, each despising all the others, each an ass and not suspecting it. ~ Mark Twain</p>

<p>The Church says that the earth is flat, but I know that it is round, for I have seen its shadow on the moon, and I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church. ~ Robert G. Ingersoll Quoting Ferdinand Magellan - no citation</p>

<p>Could a being create the fifty billion galaxies, each with two hundred billion stars, then rejoice in the smell of burning goat flesh? ~ Ron Patterson</p>

<p>Science has done more for the development of western civilization in one hundred years than Christianity did in eighteen hundred years.
~ Jeff Burroughs</p>

<p>I read about an Eskimo hunter who asked the local missionary priest, ‘If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?’ ‘No,’ said the priest, ‘not if you did not know.’ ‘Then why,’ asked the Eskimo earnestly, ‘did you tell me?’ ~ Annie Dillard</p>

<p>I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.
~ Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>I don’t really miss God, but I sure miss Santa Claus! ~ Courtney Love</p>

<p>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. ~ Alfred, Lord Tennyson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conciousness is the knowledge of the soul and life </p>

<p>Perspective is a conspiracy because people only believe they have 4 options when it&#39;s actually limitless if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Perspective is why we still have racism, or why &quot;white people&quot; can&#39;t acknowledge their privilege.</p>

<p>Yes that was bait.</p>

<p>The thing is you can be a concious racist because you lack perspective.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t have perspective and be a racist, but you can lack conciousness. Meaning you have no knowledge of your soul or life. </p>

<p>The two actually go hand in hand.</p>

<p>The issue today is people lack either both or one which causes a imbalance. Which often then not leads the person full circle making them what they hate.</p>

<p>Easy example is liberals and conservatives. They aren&#39;t any different. Only different sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>People are still operating on a flawed paradigm and no amount of obscure &quot;conspiracy&quot; knowledge will lead to enlightenment or perspective if your still using the rules of the &quot;abuser&quot; which in this case is a mixture of the elites and western society.</p>

<p>Perspective is damn near non existent, while conciousness or &quot;woke&quot; is a tad easier to reach on a superficial level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it comes down to knowing Jesus or not.  I don&#39;t like politics.  But Jesus is the only way to eternal life with ever growing joy.  Most people sadly go to a very bad place for eternity.  Sure 90% of &quot;Christians&quot; don&#39;t know Jesus at all, it&#39;s a religion to them.  Jesus is my best friend.  We talk and he communicates very clearly daily.</p>

<p>Liberals hate Jesus.  They think followers of Jesus hate gay people and that&#39;s not true at all.  So many shills out there, wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing.  No one see&#39;s what true Christianity is because it doesn&#39;t make money.</p>

<p>If your flat earth map is correct it would take 10 times that time to fly from Auckland to Santiago.</p>

<p>That means that it would tale about 60 hours to fly from Auckland to Santiago on a flat Earth map.</p>

<p>Multiple airlines can make that flight in less than 13 hours:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best to ask that in /Christians.  They probably have some stuff already written up.</p>

<p>You have to go through the reasons of what God was doing with His original people and why there was The Law that no one could follow.  The old testament is foreshadowing of Jesus (Isaiah 53 prophesy).  Jesus came to fulfil the law and we are now in a period of grace and the gentiles (everyone who is not jewish) have been brought into the fold as the Jews turned against Jesus.  The Jews will be brought back into the fold though near the end.</p>

<p>All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  All deserve eternal torment from a young age or birth.   We all go to court when we die and everyone is guilty unless Jesus died for you and His perfect sinless record plus the sacrifice transfers to our account, and we are adopted by God.  I have a house in Heaven right now.</p>

<p>Romans explains it all. Ecclesiastes (nothing new under the sun) is one of the best philosophical books in history (people just won&#39;t read the Bible because the World laughs at the concept).  Proverbs is great.  Romans really shows you this is real though, it hits you like a pile of bricks.  </p>

<p>God loved us SO MUCH to send His son to die for us when we were still His enemies.  This is God&#39;s &quot;Grand Demonstration&quot; of his glory in His grace that He did that...killing His son to save his enemies, and then loving us like children for all eternity.</p>

<p>Idk, it&#39;s frustrating talking about it and people just make jokes.  It&#39;s my entire life and always will be even after I die.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t come from a Christian home at all.  God came to me, I didn&#39;t want to read a stupid Bible...  Then He showed up and made it clear what was going on.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convert anyone, I&#39;ve never converted anyone.  I just see people walking off a cliff and people say just let them go and don&#39;t be rude pushing &quot;religion&quot; on them.  So I watch people die and I hate myself for just watching that without at least trying.</p>

<p>Read the Bible, you most likely will become a Christian.  Knock and He answers.  A person could try this for a few weeks then decide it&#39;s not real.  I just think it deserves some study since it&#39;s clearly the only Belief system with a book that speaks to you.  I wish I could explain that but Jesus speaks to me now.  I got my degree in Psychology then became disabled.  I hate religion made by man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep telling myself I will read the Bible one day but I still have not. I&#39;m skeptical by nature so I don&#39;t think it will change anything for me, but I know feeling that way before giving it a chance is ignorant. Thank you for taking the time to write this response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to read the bible last year out of curiosity (i&#39;m probably the least religious person ever).. it has some crazy messed up stuff in it.</p>

<p>Not sure how anyone who believes in the bible could judge others over ANYTHING. there&#39;s incest, rape, drunken orgies, etc, etc. in the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great list man thanks.  I absolutely would say 911, the money system, and the raw food diets are way up there.  It proves our government will lie and kill us to push a narrative.  We are realizing that a large part of the Pharm industry is corrupt and poisoning us with things like pain pills that are killing people and anti-depressants that have side effects of suicide.  </p>

<p>And I just recently learned about raw food diets and fasts.  I fasted all today and don&#39;t feel hungry at all really.  I did this detox for your liver with olive oil and lemon juice and I basically had the flu for 2 hours.  The toxins got in my blood I think.</p>

<p>I need to learn more about the legal name fraud</p>

<p>It sounds like the richest people on Earth want communism and everyone to be poor with a very small number of people being rich and in control.</p>

<p>Here you have misused the word &quot;communism&quot; to have the direct opposite meaning of the dictionary definition.  This is the result your indoctrination by American media and education system who conspire to confuse the public on political economic history and theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend reading The Deep State by Mike Lofgren. It&#39;s very solidly supported, even though Lofgren thinks that the problem is just a lot of individuals following their short-term interests, not a deliberate malevolent conspiracy. </p>
