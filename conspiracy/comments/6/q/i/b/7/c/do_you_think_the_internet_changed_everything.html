<p>a spider has no idea why sometimes when you go into the world outside of the dark you get killed instantly (by people). but in their arachnid minds, perhaps we are perceived as something completely different. </p>

<p>to us humans, we really dont know more than what we conceptualize and perceive in our brains. so there really could be something thats interdimensional sucking negative emotions. who fucking knows.  </p>

It saddens me and makes me feel like most people are hopeless, but I want to believe there is still value in sharing this information with people who will never get it because maybe one day their curiosity will get the best of them. Either way, it is downright astonishing how willingly people accept the mainstream media compared to how willing individuals are to look into anything labeled &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>Second question: what do you think would happen if the entire internet went down for a day? A week? A month? A year?</p>

<p>For this hypothetical, let&#39;s say the electricity&#39;s still on, but someone figured out how to disable the entire internet for a period of time.</p>

<p>It might be an interesting thought experiment to consider just how much we&#39;ve adapted to and are dependent on new technology by imagining life without it. If you were to remove the technology, but preserve the effects, particularly the &quot;awakening&quot; you&#39;re talking about... what might happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are addicted to learning and sharing on the internet. If it went down, we would take the habits out into the real world and connect IRL. Since most of our jobs depend on the internet, our lives would instantly change. We would suddenly be free to... do as we please. </p>

<p>I think, given the types of conversations we have online and the type of information we seek, many of us would use that time for some type of activism and exploration. I think our priorities and worldviews would forever be changed. We would wonder why we have focused more on money and being Human Resources than growing our community and getting fulfillment out of life. We would need to build sharing communities to survive and would focus on more real and important topics with unimportant garbage suddenly not entering the public consciousness - such as celebrity news, advertising, and divisive programming. Only good would come of it IMO. The internet has done a good job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. 10-15 years ago, we just took any information that was presented to us as a fact.  Now with the internet and social media, you have the ability to search for yourself. It could have been very easy for the Elites to hide or destroy evidence that could implicate them in some shit. Now with forums like this, twitter, facebook, youtube. It&#39;s a lot easier for things to be brought in the limelight and thankfully, there are people who are onto them and are onto their necks non-stop, with every step they take. I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re changing something, but we sure as hell ain&#39;t making it easy for them to do what they have done for so many years. Of course, the internet has it&#39;s many negatives as well. But it&#39;s in our hands to use it properly. </p>

<p>The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s more in line with what I feel about the internet. It gives a few people unprecedented access into the minds of everyday citizens. It was a good trade-off for them. Give us the tools to educate ourselves knowing that only a very small percentage of people will take full advantage of that. Flood the internet with useless entertainment so that we get side tracked easily. Slide hidden commercials and propaganda into social media comments and posts. Big data analysis of every person&#39;s online behavior for deep access to the inner workings of their minds and new ways to implement control measures. </p>

<p>Probably the most useful tool they have in controlling what we think is peer pressure. If you believe that a lot of your online &quot;peers&quot; believe a certain thing, you are more likely to adopt that belief. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j5grtzyb&amp;amp;sh=b3565e5d">They can easily fake mass peer consensus.</a> These fake grass-roots programs are becoming automated. The amount of astroturfing will no longer be limited by the number of personnel hired to perform the labor. </p>

<p>Also see <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/23/sentient_worlds/">Sentient world: war games on the grandest scale</a>, reported in 2007. Data gathered from social media will increasingly be used for psychological control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the transistor is what changed everything</p>

<p>the alphabet and printing press are the only other comparable invention</p>

<p>transistor led to processor, led to networking, led to wide area networks which led to blockchain technology</p>

<p>everything else in there, ebay, email, gifs, reddit, vr are all obvious derivative uses of this technology</p>

<p>the blockchain is what can save us, true authentication over distance unsubvertable by human institutions. </p>

<p>what most people consider the internet died around 2010 once all traffic was bulk collected</p>

<p>now its an infinite onion of darknet and walled gardens and secret backdoors, anything not well hidden will be public record one day</p>

<p>anything not verified by blockchain will be a shill festival like reddit is, with vr then inception style</p>

<p>that is the next twenty years for you for free</p>

<p>beware of being secretly microchipped, that tech could take over the planet without firing a shot</p>

<p>read that novel nexus and have a good fluid purity freak out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the internet is a double edged sword. The amount of information and communication is invaluable, especially for learning the true masters and motivations of our society. On the other hand, any sort of revolution is hindered by the internet because it gives people an outlet for their frustration. The keyboard warrior mentality stops a lot of actual action. </p>

<p>With both these points to consider, the internet changed everything as now we can learn from sources other than those who own the media companies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I spend a lot of my workday looking at long-view trends in history and it changed everything, like the printing press and wheel before it. I&#39;m not sure the change is as widespread or one-directional as your post implies. Many people are tuned out from just about everything. They pass little snippets of information along to each other and are happy with that. </p>

<p>But the younger generations will of course be transformed by it more and more as time goes on. We&#39;ll soon have widespread VR schools and self-driving RVs. The Internet will permeate everything and may later be used as a scaffolding for different forms of consciousness. Who knows? It could be more dangerous than it is useful. More than anything, it seems to be killing that long, almost fundamental connection we had with our ancestors. I can&#39;t figure out if it&#39;s a good or bad thing, but it&#39;s been on my mind lately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it absolutely did change everything...the most basic being how we relate to each other.   The internet brought instant information to all but also allowed instant porn and a way for degenerates to find each other and group.  </p>
