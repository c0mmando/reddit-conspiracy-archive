       So, I don't have a ton of free time, but I thought I'd just do the first pass at fact checking the recent AMA by Alan Green (
       <a href="/u/TheBardCode">
        /u/TheBardCode
       </a>
       ) in the hopes that others would also contribute further observations. He posted quite the pile of videos, so I started at the beginning and checked his numbers on the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/xHiad18ZwcY?t=3m7s">
        very first claim in the very first video
       </a>
       . This claim, it turns out, is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grabbed inkscape, took a screenshot from the video and also
       <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mw0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
        grabbed the original text on Google books
       </a>
       and loaded both up both of them into inkscape. Now, to be fair
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gIrOs">
        the resulting image is a bit of a trainwreck
       </a>
       , but I'll explain why that is...
      </p>
      <p>
       Problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        On the original page, the aspect ratio is different than in the video, so no amount of proportional scaling will make them line up, and thus the "perfect right triangle" no longer connects the "G-dot", the end of the first rule and the "Imprinted-dot".
       </li>
       <li>
        Even if you only go by his video and measure the lines yourself, you come up with a ratio of around 3.24. That's not the two-decimal places of accuracy on pi that he claimed!
       </li>
       <li>
        If you measure the actual right triangle that passes as close as possible to going through all three points on the original image, you come up with a ratio of about 3.07.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume that he wasn't simply trying to lie, here. I assume that this was a mistake caused by measuring imprecise blobs of ink on a scan at the wrong aspect ratio. 3.142 isn't so far off of the measurement that I got that it couldn't just be that he was off by a bit (in fact, the lines he draws over the image in the video look like they stop at the edge of the dots, rather than going to the centers. Indeed, in the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/xHiad18ZwcY?t=4m2s">
        case where he concludes that
        <em>
         e
        </em>
        is hidden in this title page as well
       </a>
       you'll see that the lines stop just outside the dots on different sides...
      </p>
      <p>
       With that much slop, it seems like the error bars on his calculations should be around 0.2 which then makes the coincidences seem
       <em>
        much less interesting
       </em>
       (that you found a right angle whose legs form a ratio of about 3.2 and another whose legs form a ratio of about 2.6 isn't nearly as surprising). At that point, we can apply Occam's Razor for a much simpler answer: connecting dots randomly had to result in some ratio, and these ratios are not shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the danger in accepting information over the Internet as valid without confirming it yourself or looking for peer-reviewed sources. But even if you can't get that, always ask someone who is providing data what their margin of error was!
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to contribute your own measurements below, especially of the values I didn't cover here.

       He had that AMA up for a week, so it doesn't really help your case that you waited until it ended to make this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice that you tagged him, and maybe he'll be gracious enough to answer, but do you see the narcissism in doing a singular callout and expecting special treatment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point may be valid. IDK. Anything involving John Dee---especially in heroic fashion, which I don't think he deserves---is suspect in my book. But you've done yourself no favors in the way you handled this.

       My "case" is that his math is wrong. That doesn't change based on my having missed him while he was here. Facts are facts.

       And how is that? Showing up after his AMA? It's on the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       right now. That's why I saw it. But it's over, and there's no point commenting at the bottom of an AMA that's closed, so I created a new post.

       This post you are replying to was the question. Essentially your math doesn't work. You're making assumptions based on fitting noisy data to your expectations, with margins of error that, when considered, render your conclusions unsupported.

       Measuring off a screenshot is pointless!

      <p>
       To make your case, you need to get a high-definition image of the original front page of the sonnets, ideally incorporating vertical and horizontal rulers so that we can be certain the image is a true representation of the original (ie no aspect distortion).

       either you're the sloppiest, most careless, unobservant "fact-checker" of all time, or you're a malicious troll attempting to discredit good work with a crock of bs. you have not done any "fact-checking". i presume that your intention is to deceive, and i can easily prove it: the "trainwreck" image you provided,

       contains a different version of the Sonnets title page, known as the "Wright" printing,
       <em>
        superimposed
       </em>
       on a screenshot from the video. this is so easy to see, that you couldn't possibly have done it without full knowledge of what you were doing. (unless you're just a total nincompoop. i can't rule out that possibility.)
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone can look at the image and see on the bottom, where it says "to be solde by John Wright", this is superimposed on top of "to be solde by William Aspley." the reason much of the image looks blurry is simply because the 2 different versions, the Aspley and the Wright, do not align perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yes, obviously, if you superimpose 2 similar images on top of each other, you're going to introduce a significant margin of error. but that was your move, not Mr. Green's.

       Let's focus on the facts, not our feelings.

      <blockquote>

        contains a different version of the Sonnets title page

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You bring up a good point. I could be lying or introducing an invalid version of the book or any other sort of thing. You
       <em>
        should assume this by default for both Green and myself
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so let's assume that there's a different version than the one at the Harvard Library. Let's assume that the only difference in this version on the title page is its aspect ratio (the only difference between what was shown in the video and what was in the edition on Google Books, which I demonstrated by overlaying the two).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough? We're matching your statement to the observable reality, so I assume you're on board with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, look at what I said. Look carefully.
       <strong>
        <em>
         In the version he worked on in the video
        </em>
       </strong>
       (which I presume you are asserting is the one that contains the features in question) the math doesn't work. Full stop, no overlay, no other version. It's just broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead, confirm for yourself. I don't want you to take my word for it, I just want you to exercise some critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, try measuring
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the points he does (he doesn't measure center-to-center on the dots, so be careful to measure exactly the edge that he measures).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ratio you'll get will probably be off by a bit from the result he arrives at. It might be quite close to his measurement or it might not; I won't pre-judge. You find whatever you find.
      </p>
      <p>
       With me so far? I hope so, since so far all I've asked you to do is confirm that he's right, which I presume you're expecting, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so
       <strong>
        <em>
         without superimposing anything
        </em>
       </strong>
       , try moving the measurement to the centers of the dots as one might expect. You'll find that the ratio changes by about 0.2. That's not a big change at all. It's "pretty close" in fact. But here's the kicker: it changes a measurement from exactly "pi to 3 [sic] decimal places" (he says 3, but he means 2 because you don't count the differing digit) to "approximately 3". Approximately 3 isn't pi. It's just not. So arriving at pi requires that you select, very carefully, where to measure from.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       why you should never trust any mathematical result based on real world data that doesn't tell you what its error bars are!
      </p>
      <p>
       My comments about the other version are important, but
       <strong>
        <em>
         you don't need them to understand the problem

       This is the precise thing you had the opportunity to post about and ask in his AMA. Even after the man himself came in here and told you he was still answering questions, you didn't do anything. Now it appears he is done. Sorry if I sound frustrated, but the reality is he put about as much work into his AMA as anyone I've seen, and you seem more intent on just "debunking" than actually addressing it with him.

       He did respond. He responded by saying, "thank you for your considered input." Frankly, I can't say I'm surprised. I didn't expect that he'd want to talk about the error bars (or should that be "error bards"? ;-) on his data.

       So the move would have been to copy/paste your questions/input into the AMA, where he was addressing everything (until recently). He was confused (understandably) and said "I don't see a question from you in my list. But please re-send if you do have. Thanks." You then vaguely replied with your math is incorrect and you're using noisy data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how this all would have been a lot easier to deal with in a stickied AMA where everything was condensed and easy for him to address? I don't begrudge you for questioning things, but c'mon man, he was doing all that he could and you didn't meet him halfway.

       This should be the top answer. Alan explains--in excruciating detail--exactly how he arrives at the figures, what the "rules of the game" are that he abides by and much, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is merely a summarization of his findings. If OP based all his conclusions off the video graphics, then those conclusions are inevitably going to be wrong.

       Yes, I read his little PDF. It's even more flawed. He calls out the fact that the points on the dots he chooses are arbitrary, but fails to follow through and consider that this makes his entire claim rest on ignoring the margin of error.

       Evidently you didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       In PDF 2 Alan states that vertex E of the 3:4:5 triangle is largely predetermined, the rest follows from there. In order to encode all the constants, each additional vertex (whether on a dot, a line, or the circle) follows on from the placement of that single vertex "E."
      </p>
      <p>
       All the dots are sized precisely to accommodate the small variances required. No bigger, no smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read them again, but this time pay more attention. I made the same mistake :)
      </p>
      <p>
       (If you still have reason to doubt his findings, do so in context of those explanations please, referring to the specific PDF file, line, vertex etc. It's the basis for Alan's theory, so it ought to be the basis for your counterargument too.)

       Each of those dots is quite large, and elsewhere in this thread I've demonstrated with far too much rigor for this topic that choosing the left or right side of a dot can swing a result astonishingly. The example I give clearly shows that the result he claims is

       That phrase doesn't, mean anything. Variance introduces error. Error is fine as long as it's accounted for. But he never does. Put error bars on those supposed constants and all of a sudden they're much less interesting.

       Let's just suppose for a moment that the 12 constants Alan identified from the triangles and circles, which are also the same exact 12 that can be derived from the dimensions and geometry of the Great Pyramid,
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you encode all of that using nothing more than dots, lines, and a hidden circle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that it's also obviously hidden. There must have been a reason for hiding it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you need to encode all 12 constants using a bare minimum of dots and lines, to ensure the secret stays hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's self-evident. Those dots have to be a specific size to encode the information. There's no other way to do it with so few bounded data points. The "margin of error" that you describe is actually a designed tolerance that gives the game away from its exact compatibility with the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the author had wanted to encode it using regularly sized dots, he would have needed more of them. Or a completely different pattern of dots and lines that might be impossible to conceal given the otherwise sparse design and layout of the Sonnets title page.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the backstory about how Alan arrived at his discovery it becomes quite clear that it is all intentional. John Dee was a polymath genius. There are few leaps of logic in Alan's reasoning, if any, in any of the materials I've so far reviewed. The hardest part has been tracking it all down, as some of the more detailed explanations are embedded in other people's podcasts (see Dan Winter's youtube channel, or the AMA.)

       How can there be error bars for interdependent calculations that describe mathematical constants? This is the key point. Each calculation is precisely obtained; to arrive at three decimal place precision for those constants means there's almost zero margin of error for any of the vertices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tolerance
       <strong>
        for the overall theory, and one presumes also the original intended goal
       </strong>
       is to bound all vertices using the dot sizing alone. Not the position of each point within the dot. Those individual vertices have to be
       <em>
        exactly where they are
       </em>
       to arrive at the constants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The size of the dot enables vertices to be closely grouped but not identically placed, and no more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed if you look at the enlarged diagrams you'll see certain vertices are only just inside the boundaries. But they are all inside.

       I'm just not sure what your point is. You seem to be approaching the theory from a particular angle, one of raw mathematics alone. That's only a sliver of the overall theory Alan presents. Of course if you limit yourself to that angle then you'll fail to discover the hidden meaning. Error bars and raw numbers don't tell the whole story.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I mean by that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory Alan presents assumes that the author who created the Sonnets title page had knowledge of the 12 constants that can be derived, plus knowledge of the Great Pyramid's precise location.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that information was encoded using four dots (some bigger than others) and two lines. Each of those elements is the exact size it needs to be in order to encode that knowledge. No more and no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is possible when drawing the lines and triangles and the hidden circle to nudge values this way or that, and to then arrive at values that
       <strong>
        don't represent the constants.
       </strong>
       And in fact, that's where the true beauty of this encoding method lies. It's
       <em>
        clearly designed to be undiscoverable to anyone except those who already have the knowledge.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time the page was created, several of the constants were officially unknown. Latitude and longitude coordinates were imprecise (at least, officially anyway) not to mention the problem of not having a single, official prime meridian at Greenwich. The fact that all that knowledge is right here in this cover page, with the same 12 constants also encoded in the Great Pyramid tells us that the author intended to convey that knowledge specifically. One assumes that the knowledge was considered "forbidden" or heretical hence the need to encode it in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it beginning to make sense now? Effectively the entire theory is predicated on the fact that the values obtained are not revelations per se, but that they were simply not commonly known at the time. Once you realise that the author
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       know this stuff, and that he has linked it to an even older source--the Great Pyramid--it becomes a lot more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, you can put your blinders back on and stick to raw mathematics, error bars, fuzzy numbers and statistical probability if it makes you feel better. I'll stick with the overall mystery of this story, cheers.

       my apologies if you are genuine. however you missed an important paragraph in the original AMA post:
      </p>
      <p>
       "to anyone genuinely committed to finding the truth and willing to do their own checking, the math does not lie. For those of you in that group, much of what you may want to ask is already answered here:
       <a href="http://www.ToBeOrNotToBe.org/math.">
        www.ToBeOrNotToBe.org/math.
       </a>
       " this specifically addresses your objection. i'll just briefly draw out a couple of points from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the video was not intended to be the most accurate demonstration. its purpose is to get the message out there. Mr. Green used the best possible high resolution digital copy of the page he could get, but not for the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       the video is still quite good though, there is just one more thing that you need to understand. the G dot was intentionally over-sized to give a bit of wiggle room. it would be mathematically impossible to recreate what was done using smaller points. still, every triangle vertex lies within the boundary of the G dot, and also on the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       the result is several perfect right triangles, all on the same circle, and all sharing
       <em>
        almost but not quite
       </em>
       the same hypotenuse. if the G dot were just slightly smaller, it would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       so sure, if we were talking about just 2 or 3 triangles with interesting ratios, i'd agree that's just a chance result of the wiggle room. but for every additional precise ratio found independent of all the previous ones, the chances drop exponentially. pi, phi, e, e-1, and the 3-4-5 triangle are all geometrically independent, yet here they are intertwined in a simple figure. the fact that this is even possible is frankly astonishing.

       But it turns out that it's accurate enough to explain what's going on. You just have to understand margin of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       He even
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       talks about this in his "math" page. He mentions that if you zoom in, you'll find that he's choosing the side of the dots and placement on lines carefully, which we, the reader, might think is such a small "selection" to make that the fact that it gives us such a startling answer is profoundly unlikely.... it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the diagram he gives on his math page:
      </p>
      <p>
       Measuring from point B to point C and from C to G, you get two numbers. I'm using the program "Inkscape" and its distance measuring feature. Inkscape is free software, go ahead and try this out for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do this, and divide the larger value by the smaller (as he does in the video) you get, depending on what side of the dot and the line you select your point, anywhere from 3.04 to 3.16. Let's think about that for a second. If the result he'd come up with had been 3.04, would you have said, "wow, that's almost exactly pi!" Probably not. Indeed, few would.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 3.16... now that's pretty close, still perhaps not all that surprising, but closer. He chooses a start and end position that gets him to 3.142. Pretty impressive, no? But why that value? With the margin of error I cited above, he could, quite correctly point out that
       <strong>
        <em>
         exactly pi
        </em>
       </strong>
       falls into that range. Why call out 3.142 instead of the actual constant, pi?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if he did that, then it might be easier to see the problem: you're taking measurements of imprecise ink lines and making rather precise claims with them. By choosing 3.142, he (deliberately or from simple ignorance) makes it seem like the approximation arrived at has the expected amount real-world "give".

      <p>
       This is backwards. If the G had been intended to signal a particular constant or constants, it would need to be smaller so that it's clear that you're not just making up numbers you want to see.

       Oh, no! There are more!
      </p>
      <p>
       He missed square root of two, one of the most important irrational numbers! If you measure from the top of the "A" in "AT LONDON" straight down to the base of the "E" that's suspiciously pointing to the "A", and then straight to the right to the end of the "for" that is strangely wider spaced from the following "T" than it is from the preceding "d", you will find that the ratio of those two legs of a perfectly and undisputably right triangle is square root of two!
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it's not. The first time I measured it, I came pretty close, but I can massage it into place easily enough and get
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       root-two. Not an approximation. Not two decimal places... the exact constant! What are the odds?! Pretty good, really. it was the very first three points I chose. I chose them like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       First I looked up a whole bunch of common constants to see which ones he didn't get in his results. Root two was an obvious winner. It's close to 1.5, so I can eyeball that sort of ratio and then fine-tune.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "A" looks nice and big and it's the first letter in that area, so I started there. I want a right triangle, so let's just drop straight down. Hey, that "E" is italic, so it looks like it's pointing to my starting point, even better! Now, go left or right about 1 and a half times and you find the "r" in "for" and the end of the "y" in "By". I arbitrarily chose the "r" and found  that using the far end of its baseline serif gave me 1.4. Great, that's very close to root-two's 1.414. In fact, all I have to do is wiggle that triangle back to the left a small bit so that it is still on the tip of the "A" and base of the "E" and then extend the last point out a very, very small amount back to the end of the "r". Boom! With enough work, you can demonstrate that exactly root-two falls within easily constructed limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this proof of more hidden numbers? No! It's proof that if you want to find a number on that page, you can do so and then justify it.

       no he didn't. it's right there in the video at 9:30.
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously if you mess around with random points on the page, including letters, you can construct various ratios. what you can't do is take all 6 periods off a page, plus 2 blank lines, draw a perfect circle around 4 of the periods and the right end of each line, and then find more than a couple of constants within the wiggle room granted by the size of the periods.
      </p>
      <p>
       even if we ignore the ratios, the plain geometrical anomalies are enough to show that these points and lines were clearly placed intentionally. the circle is already impressive by itself. then look at the final period at the bottom of the page, "1609." from there, one line passes perfectly through the second
       <em>
        T
       </em>
       to the top period. now look at the image from 9:15. another line passes perfectly through the period right of the
       <em>
        T
       </em>
       to meet precisely the end of the upper line. again from this same period, the line to the other end of the upper line passes through the diameter of the circle at a right angle. now look at the line from the G period to the left end of the lower line: it's parallel, and hence, a perfect tangent to the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can ramble on all you like about uninteresting triangles that join the ends of letters. just let me clue you in on one rather crucial detail...take a look inside any geometry book...what symbol is used universally to indicate a geometric point...?... now tell me how many of them you used in your pointless triangle? what's that? you didn't even use the universally accepted symbol for marking geometric points? that's a fail.

       I'll admit that the circle he drew is a nice little piece of coincidence. It's not VERY unlikely, but certainly I'd expect less than a majority of texts to have something that appealing that you could do with it. Maybe a third of books at the time? Just guessing...

       Is it really arbitrary though? The points you chose in your example seem much more so. The points used by Green along the circle are all important and distinct features of the cover. The 2 lines are "arbitrarily" different lengths in a way that perfectly accommodates the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love for you find something like this anywhere else. (I'm sure Alan would too! He has spent the last 12 years studying this one cover. Imagine if he had another, nay thousands of others to study, he'd be in heaven!)
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you draw shapes on a cover and call it equal I challenge you to make something that contains a similar number of constants using actual significant features of a page. I can save us both time and suggest that you wont be able to. If you can, I'm happy to eat my words.

       here is your desperate attempt to discard it all as random chance. you say "effectively 6 of 10", but effectively it is 9 of 10. as i pointed out in my previous reply, the left end points of the line each form a right angle with the circle's diameter when connected with one of the lower dots. and one of the "T" dots is colinear with 2 of the points on the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       you could spend the rest of your days searching for something comparable. you would not "quickly find a book". instead you would convince yourself that every little thing you see proves your point. you would be forced to look at very noisy, crowded pages with writing all over the place, because ones as simple as the Sonnets page, with lots of blank space and minimal substance, have an astronomically low chance of containing perfect circles and parallel/perpendicular lines (besides lines parallel to the axes, of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       every additional point on a page exponentionally increases the likelihood of anomalies. much moreso it increases the likelihood of having an excess of outliers that don't fit in neatly with a tight core design. but ultimately it doesn't matter. if you refuse to believe it's possible, then nothing will convince you otherwise.

       I came to a slightly different conclusion after quite a few back-and-forths with
       <a href="/u/TheBardCode">
        /u/TheBardCode
       </a>
       .

       The dots aren't really dots, but small circles. Each dot therefore has a precise circumference bounding all possible X:Y coordinates that can fall within its area.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads one to realise that the apparent "wiggle room" in each dot isn't wiggle room at all. What it is, instead, is a side-effect of using the smallest possible circumference for each dot (or circle) that still allows all required vertices to be precisely placed where necessary, in order to describe specific lines, in order to describe specific triangles, which ultimately lead to the derivation of 12 specific mathematical constants to a high degree of precision, and also to encode the actual coordinates to the Great Pyramid itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me re-phrase that, but in reverse as I think that makes it much clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Key Supposition/Assumption:
       </strong>
       The author of the title page (possibly John Dee) intended to encode 12 specific constants that are found in the Great Pyramid, plus a raging clue that leads directly to the pyramid itself to provide an irrefutable link between the two. This is the entire point of the Aspley Sonnets title page design (although Alan did hint there is still more information embedded... can't wait to see what it is!)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The author's key constraints:
       </strong>
       Hide the encoded information well enough that no layperson
       <em>
        of the time
       </em>
       will stumble across it. Do so in plain sight, though, so that somebody sufficiently well equipped in mathematics and knowledge
       <em>
        eventually
       </em>
       will discover it in future.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the objective was to get that information on the page without revealing it too easily. Not an easy task!
      </p>
      <p>
       The author is then faced with a fairly rigid set of rules that define how he can arrive at those results, given the need to also conceal it within a functional Sonnets title page. This necessarily rules out most of the "random" solutions and leads to a
       <strong>
        very small
       </strong>
       number of mathematically feasible solutions that also meet
       <em>
        all requirements
       </em>
       . *
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the solution Alan Green has discovered is probably the one originally encoded, unless it is somehow possible to ever-so-slightly move vertex positions around within the circumference of each dot, or make a different set of triangles using the same dots, but still arrive at the same constants (and Great Pyramid co-ordinates!) and to a
       <em>
        similar or better
       </em>
       precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: * To further strengthen Alan's theory, I would like to see a software program try to find the constants and co-ordinates if given the precise positions and dimensions of each dot and line, plus the freedom to draw right triangles and a circle intersecting those right-angle vertices in any way that obeys the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such a program can brute force its way to a valid solution within those constraints (plus the additional constraints Alan later imposes, such as deriving the vertex of a later triangle from the intersection point of prior triangles) then it pretty much seals the deal.
