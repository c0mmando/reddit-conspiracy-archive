    <div class="md"><p>Listen......we&#39;ve been in this exact scenario before, during each of the past 2 August/September/October periods: 2015 and 2016. The Pope&#39;s visit in 2015/Blood Moon, and then Nibiru/Blue Star Kachina last year. This year, it is the Solar Eclipse on August 21st and the Revelations 12 constellation prophecy on September 23rd. </p>

<p>All I am saying is, I am starting to feel frustrated that this &#39;awakening&#39; isn&#39;t enabling me to experience and feel any psychic abilities. Maybe more time is needed (leading towards years ahead).</p>

<p>Why do all of these events happen around that time period?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nature runs in cycles. On earth we have days, months, years and what is called the Great Year. This Great Year depends on a very subtle wobble of earth&#39;s tilt. Kind of like a spinning top, the axis of our rotation isn&#39;t entirely stable and it draws one circle in the sky over the course of approx 25000 years. </p>

<p>Every Great Year is itself divided into 12 subcycles analogous to Great Months, in which one of the twelve zodiac signs dominates our night sky. For the last 2000 years, that zodiac was pisces and we&#39;re entering the next great month, the Age of Aquarius.</p>

<p>This transition is said to be accompanied by a great shift in consciousness. Make of that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, I get the whole &quot;perspective&quot; argument dealing with logarithmic scales. </p>

<p>When you are two years old, one year is half your life. When you are 50, it&#39;s only 1/50th, and your perspective reflects that. </p>

<p>But the problem with this is that lately it seems to speed up across the board for everyone by the same rate compounded with this perspective effect. My dad and I both feel like time is moving by faster. But it&#39;s at a similar rate... His isn&#39;t any &quot;faster&quot;... If that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder that or is it because we are in a time of chaos.  Jordan Peterson had mentioned it during the Joe Rogan podcast and it kind of stuck we me.  During a time like this the event horizon shortens because we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen and everything moves a lot quicker.  A very small example would be Trumps communication director Anthony Scaramucci who had the job for 6 days.  Just saying, seems like big event are happening everyday on various levels which may make it seem like time is going alot faster... When maybe it&#39;s not, covfefe was only 2 months ago and that seems like a year ago.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are oscillating between speeding up and slowing down who are just now awakening. If things are slowing down then that means you already awoken 5-10 years ago.</p>

<p>The rest of humanity then is just now catching up to your frequency or vibration. You tend to feel like time is slowing because your awareness and range increases. But to the rest of the awakening they&#39;re oscillating between different vibrations and frequencies. That process tends to feel like time is speeding up and slowing down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just barely scratching the surface to be honest. There&#39;s a lot of material on awakening on YouTube and in the metaphysical community. There&#39;s a book I&#39;m reading on this topic called The End of Your World by Adyashanti. </p>

<p>Basically, we live in a quantum universe that is traveling through space. Our entire solar system is both rotating around the sun, and also moving through space to different locations within the greater universe. The theory is we are moving to a place in the universe with a higher frequency, and vibrational range. This is causing people to awaken to these new frequencies and vibrations and possibly even evolving our species rapidly to some degree. These awakenings tend to awaken energy centers within the body sometimes also called chakras.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m researching this is I&#39;ve had several awakening events happen to me in the past few years and they&#39;re becoming more and more frequent.</p>

<p>The model of slow evolution over time is absolutely a half truth as best. In a quantum universe mutations and transformations can actually happen instantly if enough energy is applied. If you match the right frequency to anything in our universe really you will get that result reflected in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s something that happens when you get older. Every year that goes by becomes a smaller % of your total life. For example, at 20 years old 1 year is 5% of your total life and at 40 it&#39;s only 2.5%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes sense</p>

<p>So in recent weeks, I considered myself in a rut. I decided to start looking for a new job. I was offered one, the same week I was offered the job, my TV broke, my car was totaled in a rear ending accident. All of these things are very new, and certainly break my routine. Since then it feels like the time has gone so much more slowly than it did before. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certain after everything settles, it will go back to normal. But right now stuff seems to be going on forever.</p>
