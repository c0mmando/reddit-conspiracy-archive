<p>It&#39;s not difficult at all, because that&#39;s simply not happening. Everyone knows the right has been kicking this conspiracy theory around for a long time. And most people recognize it for the bullshit it is. The story &quot;resurfaced&quot; because a Fox News contributor just filed a lawsuit claiming he was misquoted and that Fox News and Trump worked together to get this story into the press in order to draw attention away from the Trump family&#39;s criminal ties to Russia.</p>

<p>Intent didn&#39;t matter for the law she broke. Multiple people have gone to prison for less than she did, and they had no intent to mishandle TS info either. But since James Comey told you how to think, that&#39;s how you think instead of thinking for yourself.</p>

<p>Funny you say that last point too, if Trump was presidential he wouldn&#39;t care about Hillary any more, but he isn&#39;t. He keeps calling for an investigation into her doesn&#39;t he?

    <div class="md"><p>she was let go because she had full establishment shield under obama hold overs. why are you even on the conspiracy subreddit. </p>

<p>if you call her investigation and investigation and claim 11 times, that&#39;s laugable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &#39;multiple allegations&#39; are all based on nothing substantial</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-The fact he worked in the voting department of the DNC
-was killed / unsolved / not covered until when he needs to be smeared
-kim dot com claimes it was him
-Rod Wheeler also claims he had contact with wikileaks before he flipped; <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/892494677823434753">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/892494677823434753</a>
-UK parliment official said he knew who the leaker was and it wasn&#39;t a russian, it was an inside (insiunitating to seth rich)
-wikileaks offers reward money for his info. </p>

<p>okay. and you&#39;re hear believing the russian conspiracy . and the only substational info over the past year is 1 meeting with a lawyer that happens to be russian (let in by OBAMA&#39;s DOJ) who isn&#39;t even connected with the government, and two meetings between people that worked in the capacity of government between russian officials - you know doing their job? </p>

<p>OH and Comey testiying under oath that Trump was NEVER under investigation, until they started the investigation and then turned it into &quot;OH LETS INVESTIGATE HIM for obstructing justice by firing comey, since we have jack shit else to throw out&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, the previous months, it wasn&#39;t a subject of interest on r/conspiracy either! It was an old story and nothing new was coming out of it since 2016. So there was not a lot of interest anymore.</p>

<p>This story never died. You&#39;re trying to prove that a single story from Fox was influencing 4chan and t_d autists, which is quite stupid to anyone that has been paying attention. You guys still think these people even watch Fox to begin with. I quite frankly don&#39;t believe you visit right wing message boards to even comment on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian pee story was from the British intel dossier... If you have a problem with what was in that report, take it up with MI6 or whatever British spy agency who wrote it up. And these news outlets did say, &quot;allegedly from the dossier&quot; not &quot;Trump fucking did this 100%.&quot; 
I didn&#39;t see that Russia/Vermont power grid article, can you send me a link? And also, I don&#39;t think Fox News has a monopoly on unethical reporting, but wouldn&#39;t teaming up with politicians to make up fake news for political points be a new low other outlets haven&#39;t sunk to? CNN has fired journalists who&#39;ve done unethical reporting, I hope Fox follows suit and does the same.</p>

<p>Unfounded conspiracy theories involving Rich abounded in the months after his death, in part because WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cryptically suggested that his death may have been related to the leaks of tens of thousands of emails from Democratic Party officials and their allies at the peak of the presidential campaign.
Fox News&#39; story, which took flight online and ran in segments across major shows, breathed fresh life into the rumors. Fox reported that the leaks came from inside the party and not from hackers linked to Russia — despite the conclusions of the nation&#39;s most senior intelligence officials. The network suggested that Democrats might have been connected to Rich&#39;s death and that a cover-up had thwarted the official investigation.</p>

Maybe you&#39;re some kind of sleeper shill who has no idea whos ideas you&#39;re actually spreading.</p>

How hard is it to go on any anonymous message board and start talking shit to other anonymous users about your &quot;theories&quot;, and when it spreads you start pointing out those conversations as evidence of your theories existence.

<p>When it goes from unsubstantiated theories to an actual news story, you would expect some honest investigation to have been done by the party that published it. But that clearly wasn&#39;t the case, and the Seth Rich theory is back at having absolutely zero evidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awan had root access all of DWS and many other democrats IT. Emails, server logs, phones, tablets, etc etc. Everything they knew Awan knew.</p>

<p>Awan was arrested last week trying to flee the country. DWS was still paying him even though he had been barred from congressional computers for months. Paying him for what? We don&#39;t know yet. </p>

<p>DNC, or people in it, had Rich killed for leaking to wikileaks. Awan knew. He&#39;s been arrested and now, after months and months of the MSM claiming this was all wild hype and nothing to it, now is pushing disinformation to put the whole story on shaky ground. </p>

<p>There is a base to the Rich murder. Npr says right in the title &quot;baseless&quot;. They are full of shit propagandists.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think &#39;baseless&#39; is uncalled for in the title of the NPR article. It does appear that the whole meat of the Fox article was based on made up quotes. There is alleged evidence in the NPR article that shows Zimmerman misattributed the quotes to Wheeler.</p>

<p>Even if it ends up being true that Rich had contact with the Wikileaks, someone cannot just make up a story that it happened without actual evidence. That is by definition Fake News.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not baseless. There&#39;s wikileaks/assange all but admitting he was the leaker. There was Wheeler himself, just days ago telling everyone to follow the Awan case because it is linked to &quot;other&quot; cases. (His quotation marks). There&#39;s the panda4progress stuff, it goes on and on. Calling it baseless is simply ignoring most of the story, something that NPR is great at.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/HomeBoy74.html">HomeBoy74</a> 2017-08-01</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I agree that it isn&#39;t &#39;baseless&#39; after reading the Fox article.  Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516112429/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/16/slain-dnc-staffer-had-contact-with-wikileaks-investigator-says.html">link!</a></p>

<p>It basically has three sources that are listed in it. An unnamed federal investigator, Wheeler, and WikiLeaks in some sort of fashion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News
This is the main quote from the unnamed source.</p>

<p>“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”</p>

<p>“My investigation shows someone within the D.C. government, Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward,” Wheeler told Fox News. “That is unfortunate. Seth Rich’s murder is unsolved as a result of that.”
These are the alleged fake quotes made up for Fox.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.</p>

<p>“WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,” the organization announced.</p>

<p>On Twitter, WikiLeaks announced the reward but said Assange’s statement “should not be taken to imply that Seth Rich was a source for WikiLeaks or to imply that his murder is connected to our publications” because WikiLeaks has a policy not to release the names of its sources, even after their death.
WikiLeaks information from the article</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the essential claim in this article is
*Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks</p>

<p>From documents pertaining to the lawsuit (texts, emails, voicemails, etc.) we have pretty good evidence that Wheeler&#39;s quotes were made up. You can make what you want of the unnamed source, but I am highly skeptical of them, especially when  we know there is at least one piece of fake news in the article already. </p>

<p>The WikiLeaks information was directed to the public (twitter, public interviews), so we know that is how they feel... But, they never come out and admit it, for reasons that we both understand.</p>

<p>So I see the base in the WikiLeaks information, but think the rest of the content (unnamed federal investigator, Wheeler&#39;s fake comments) is baseless if false. Means nothing...</p>

<p>At the end of the day I guess I think Fox and NPR are full of shit propagandists.</p>
