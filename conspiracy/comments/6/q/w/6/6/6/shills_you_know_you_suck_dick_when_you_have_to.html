       I mean, the lawsuit claims that Fox News recently fabricated a story to push the Seth Rich story, and people around here used that hoax as "evidence" that the DNC killed Seth Rich. Many people pointed out how shitty the reporting was at the time, and Fox actually had to retract it, but it didn't stop Trump supporters from pushing the story relentlessly.

       Guess what? The Seth rich investigation was happening with or without the fox article. No one cares about it but you people. We care about facts. And the apparent facts of that mans death do not add up in the official story. Not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's far more evidence suggesting that Seth was the leak or he was at least used to make it look like he was the leak. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest any Russian hack. All evidence points to the files being stolen locally. Whether it was Seth or not is completely different, but the point is that all you people seem to tb ink one thing means another and you try to emotionally lure people into doubting everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not try to find some facts to make a conclusion to actually make progress with an investigation? There aren't any facts at all in that thread, it's just conjecture. Just like the fucking media.

       "You people" push the Russian narrative that we still are not buying because it is a propaganda piece against Trump. When Assange implies it may be Seth Rich, and Seth Rich's death seems pretty strange, then yes I take that and I question that. I want to know what happened with Seth Rich. You guys make it like this Seth Rich thing was created by Trump and Fox News. Stop manipulating people with this bullshit.

      <p>
       Trump was told about this stuff by Wheeler, and said to run with it. It would have been run anyways without Trump. You guys are stretching it.

       If you just shot someone, would you want to hang around the area for even a second longer?

       If you were assassinating someone, would you want them to be able to talk to anyone for 2 hours after they were shot? Why are these people capable of killing Scalia with a heart attack gun but not able to easily kill Rich?

       I guess I better jump on the list.  Just because the White House may have pushed the story, doesn't mean that Seth Rich wasn't shot in the back for the DNC wikileaks release.  There are 2 different things going on here.  If you think it somehow means Seth Rich wasn't shot in the back for the DNC leaks then MSM is doing its job well.

       Eh it's standard practice for most political threads to have a comment like that near the top. Thread votes tend to be the primary focus, but often times it goes talking about shills from one side or another.

       It's always fun seeing when one of you two parties manages to get your narrative upvoted and then the other side gets to make a pity-party post where you can all jerk each other off and smugly pronounce how good you are at spotting all the "shills"

       Also, look at one page of OPs history. The fact that they are not at least on a 7 day ban is pretty fishy. I saw them all over last night and assumed they were actually a troll bc of their excessive emoji and rule6-riddled comments.

       Yea they're one of the ones that I see enforcing rules seemingly neutrally. I do assume that some regulars get the benefit of a pm warning. But ones like op and that other user who kept posting bold, large font MAGAs everywhere took waaaay too long, at least compared to other users who get the banhammer right away.

       I liken the Seth Rich thing to Michael Hastings and I think a good number of people in this sub still think his death was a murder by hacked car or some other craziness.
