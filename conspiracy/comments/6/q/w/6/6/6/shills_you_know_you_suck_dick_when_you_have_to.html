    <div class="md"><p>I mean, the lawsuit claims that Fox News recently fabricated a story to push the Seth Rich story, and people around here used that hoax as &quot;evidence&quot; that the DNC killed Seth Rich. Many people pointed out how shitty the reporting was at the time, and Fox actually had to retract it, but it didn&#39;t stop Trump supporters from pushing the story relentlessly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what? The Seth rich investigation was happening with or without the fox article. No one cares about it but you people. We care about facts. And the apparent facts of that mans death do not add up in the official story. Not even close. </p>

<p>There&#39;s far more evidence suggesting that Seth was the leak or he was at least used to make it look like he was the leak. There&#39;s absolutely no evidence to suggest any Russian hack. All evidence points to the files being stolen locally. Whether it was Seth or not is completely different, but the point is that all you people seem to tb ink one thing means another and you try to emotionally lure people into doubting everything. </p>

<p>Why not try to find some facts to make a conclusion to actually make progress with an investigation? There aren&#39;t any facts at all in that thread, it&#39;s just conjecture. Just like the fucking media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You people&quot; push the Russian narrative that we still are not buying because it is a propaganda piece against Trump. When Assange implies it may be Seth Rich, and Seth Rich&#39;s death seems pretty strange, then yes I take that and I question that. I want to know what happened with Seth Rich. You guys make it like this Seth Rich thing was created by Trump and Fox News. Stop manipulating people with this bullshit. </p>

<p>Trump was told about this stuff by Wheeler, and said to run with it. It would have been run anyways without Trump. You guys are stretching it.</p>
