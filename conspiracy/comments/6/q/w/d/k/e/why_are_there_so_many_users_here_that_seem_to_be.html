    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you something: Im not Trumpist, not even American, but Hillary is indeed evil and so was Bill Clinton and Obama and Bush. They were all corrupt as fuck. Reason there is such a big effort from media to make you and others like you believe otherwise, and that Trump is bad, is because there are millions of details and hidden agendas that go high up and go way above your head.Its so complicated that even Politics and corrupt people involved miss most of the plot. You having an opinion on Trump or anything else is like having an opinion formed about the entire House of cards tv show from watching 2 minutes of each episode.You and me cant talk coherently about stuff that goes way above our heads, and instead of protesting like histerical faggots we should instead focus on improving ourselves and making a difference by being honest and supportive in our day to day lives, and demand more serious explanations from politics before voting instead of childis insults and speeches that are nothing but dust thrown at your eyes.Media makes you worry about peanuts and while you are looking at the peanuts on the ground the Gorillas who run the show are passing by sitting on top of pink Elephants and you cant see them. Even if Trump was corrupt he certainly wouldn be less corrupt than Hillary Clinton because it is simply impossible to become a politic without being corrupt. Important thing is what he will do and he had time to do nothing yet and there are hidden powers trying using schemes to undermine him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt mean it that way. I wanted to say that yes he is coorupt but not more than any other politic. An it doesnt really matter even if he was more corrupt than hillary or Obama (which in my flawed personal opinion he isnt) because in the end it will still be way above you. Only way to change things is not to worry wether A is a racist or B is anti gay because those are peasant worries, the peanuts i talked about. What really matters is you educating yourself,being honest, minding your own business, hurt nobody and help when you can, not voting when these clowns turn elections into name calling circus and voting when there is someone who seems legit.These way, by educating yourself and your offspring and demanding more from candidates such as Trump or Clinton than waving peanut flags while hiding 99% of the iceberg, you will be pushing for humans to be less gullible and harder to con into worrying about false issues.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s saying that &#39;corruption&#39; has now been expanded to include &#39;being a perfect human being&#39;.</p>

<p>Case in point - if Trump really was corrupt, he would be impeached or indicted right now, unless there are people in the deep state who are sitting on information and refusing to act on it. Do you think that is the reality?</p>

<p>The guy makes a good point - to get to that level of power and influence where you could become a major political candidate, you are going to get your hands dirty at some point. Politics is not a clean arena, and I would challenge anybody to prove that it is somewhere that honesty and &#39;above board&#39; dealings actually get you anywhere.</p>

<p>We keep framing politics as if it has some sort of moral backbone to it, but that&#39;s just false. All of the complaints people might have about Trump and Corruption would be 5x worse if we had an establishment politician in office, but we don&#39;t typically come after politicians like we have Trump. What politician alive would have come out of the pressure cooker they&#39;ve put Trump into without some bad angles? Podesta and Hillary took tonnes of money and influence from Russia but that doesn&#39;t matter cause they lost. Almost everything that Trump has been accused of is done by the people who are itching to replace him. Why is that a better deal? I&#39;d rather have Trump than some subversive shadow entity that was never voted into office and holds no loyalty to the American people. IMO that is the darkest timeline/possiblity - that the establishment gets a blank check to do whatever they want in the aftermath of this all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a jump now, isn&#39;t? The most obvious situation is the current POTUS achieved his status from media manipulation (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/11/22/exclusive-interview-how-jared-kushner-won-trump-the-white-house/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">for example, his son in law was in charge of social media data manipulation to control a narrative, here is the story where they proudly admit it</a>), then to destroy any &quot;truth&quot;, any opposing news is &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot; and that we should trust that the &quot;humble&quot; individual Donald Trump is trustworthy to stop the media manipulation past his presidency?</p>

<p>“Of course the people don’t want war. But after all, it’s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it’s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it’s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit most of my comment here are about dismissing/disproving what people post. Why? Because there are a lot of posts here where people are either fooled by clickbait, don&#39;t understand or know something key about what they post, or jump to conclusions too soon. </p>

<p>If I see something that&#39;s clearly wrong and easily debunked I&#39;m going to point it out so that others don&#39;t waste their time on it. I support people debating and questioning but if someone is posting something obviously misleading or wrong then I don&#39;t think they&#39;re trying to have an open debate so I will shut them down before anyone else has to wade into a discussion based on a faulty starting point.</p>

<p>I, personally, think the facts make the Seth Rich conspiracy really interesting. A data analyst at the DNC, who was murdered in the early hours of morning, in a very safe part of DC, not long after the DNC emails were obtained by Wikileaks. Then, Julian Assange himself suggests that Seth might have been the leak, which turns out to have likely been a local leak rather than a hack based on the download time.</p>

<p>This shit happens all the time. Attempted robbery, it gets fucked up and you run. It&#39;s 4am for God&#39;s sakes. Seth Rich is coming out of a bar, he&#39;s most likely a little inebriated and he could&#39;ve fought back more than this guy was expecting. People just freak sometimes especially robbers realizing they just fucking killed a guy. Both versions show incompetence and yet one needs this person to be a DNC hitman </p>

<p><em>Who knows???</em> Obviously a lot of people would know this. This does not seem like it would be that hard of a thing to figure out.

<p>He&#39;s a total hack based on his own clusterfuck of a code of ethics. This is supposed to be the freedom of information &quot;expose the elites to the light of day&quot; guy, but yet when pressed on not releasing any Trump information, he claimed to have it, but, eh it&#39;s no worse than whats out there. Total cop-out, total bullshit. </p>

<p>But again why are we talking his half-assed word for it? This situation was literally the worst of all words: He either revealed a source half-assedly causing this sources family to be harassed (I&#39;m sure that&#39;s calming to their current and past sources) or he did it as a feint and caused somebody completely unrelated family to be harassed... And he provides zero proof which he obviously would have so nobody except internet punks can take it seriously... meaning the <strong>only</strong> thing that happens is this guys family is harassed and Trump get&#39;s a distraction. </p>

<p>Everything he&#39;s done has caused literally all of the consequences of revealing his source <em>except</em> the fucking veracity. He&#39;s a hack and it&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re sending a message to leakers... when there&#39;s no evidence he&#39;s a leaker and nobody believes it and that&#39;s what they want anyway? And if there was evidence he was a leaker and people believed he was... that would fucking implicate them in his murder! How on earth does this work as intended??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if i told you i had a conspiracy but before you accept it you must believe that water is alive and conscious that would make it a lot harder to swallow right?  Then after grazing over the foundation of the conspiracy people start focusing on the smaller details and circumstantial evidence to hold up the theory with strings.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s how a lot of the more wild conspiracies play out.  Stifling discussion is counter productive however so I understand where both of you are coming from.   Cognitive dissonance is the enemy.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would be pretty much my answer as my answer as well.  My comments (few and far between) generally &quot;question the narrative,&quot; but that&#39;s only because blatant bullshit pisses me off and motivates me to post.  When I see good provoking thought conspiracy posts I read along and don&#39;t have much to add, but when I see someone posting things that I know to be false, it&#39;s tough to not say so.  I want this sub to have robust discussions on the very real conspiracies out there, and crazy bullshit distracts from that.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are shills on Reddit, but not everyone who questions the posts on here is one.  As skeptical people we should all appreciate that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t that people are unduly negative.  It is that there are motivated entities that come here to work.  When someone comes and posts a shilly thread, some call them on it and some just downvote.  The OP then has the opportunity to cultivate it into a conspiracy thread or a shill one.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned to not take it seriously when someone replies upset.  Oftentimes, it is a bot.  I come to learn, and sometimes help teach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people who support trump see any story that is negative about him as &quot;liberal deep state CIA hiliary propaganda &quot; And a lot of people who don&#39;t support trump (does not mean they support clinton) see a lot of posts that make excuses for trump or &quot;hey don&#39;t forget about hiliary&quot;  posts as pro government propaganda/ diversion.

<p>In the world of science, most of the energy is put into trying to disprove claims. That&#39;s how they establish which claims are strong. If something can stand up to challenge and alternative hypotheses are addressed and found less powerful then you get something you can use.</p>

<p>If you care about the truth, you should want your ideas challenged. If your ideas stand up to the challenge then you have a reason to embrace them. If they can&#39;t, then they were weak ideas.</p>

<p>Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist</p>

<p>5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many posts get confused between conspiracy and speculation. Conspiracy has tidbits that don&#39;t fit the main line of thought, but they don&#39;t need actual proof. Discussion is great for these, it helps flesh out what the conspiracy is. Questioning aspects are great too. For example Electric Universe Theory, and seeking it&#39;s explanation for why the moon and Earth have opposite magnetic fields. A good conspiracy theory will have explanations for these questions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, speculation does not hold up to questions. For instance the John Oliver email colluding with the DNC. Questions like why do the other two emails involving John Oliver talk about inviting him to be a celebrity guest at a charity function. Questioning brings up misleading facets and flaws in the narrative. It&#39;s not a conspiracy, it&#39;s speculation.</p>

<p>Scrutiny and trying to debunk a conspiracy theory is good, why would you believe something that you can easily disprove. This is how science works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Story time...</p>

<p>Back in the era before the internet, being into conspiracies had a kind of romance about it. You had to go to weird bookstores, or mail-order from shady catalogs like Loompanics, or find particular libraries and shit. Sources were often conflicting, and not often super-reliable. </p>

<p>There was, then as now, a kind of spectrum of credibility to various conspiracy theories. Like, really proved and well-sourced stuff about CIA assassinations etc, drifting into murkier but fascinating things like the Kennedy Assassination, various flavors of Knights Templar continuation theories, and on into wingnut stuff like hollow earth, lizard-people, and so on. There was also a spectrum of ugliness, and no shortage of anti-semitism and other bigotry, overlapping parts of the conspiracyverse. There were sort of different &quot;wings&quot; of conspiracy-theorists, some very much at odds with each other. </p>

<p>But one thing we all had in common, when you met a fellow traveller, is that we were all <strong>skeptics</strong>. It was impossible to live in an echo-chamber, because there was no echo-chamber. If you wanted to learn more about a thread, you had to look up footnotes in paper books, and write them down, and then go to the library and see if they had that book (almost never), or if they could get it on loan, or you would mail-order it from the publisher, or whatever. You couldn&#39;t just go post on a forum where everyone believes the same version of the truth.</p>

<p>And because so much of what we were reading and thinking about was so difficult to source and to prove, everyone had a certain awareness that we were groping in the dark, and that we might be wrong. Conspiracy culture was based not so much on* knowing* the secret truth, but rather on <em>believing that the truth was being kept secret</em>.  </p>

<p>So, you could have this world where a black nationalist who thought that white people were devils invented by a scientist 6,000 years ago, could still have a conversation with a Bigfoot hunter. Even while they each had very different <em>theories</em>, they shared a foundational belief that there are secrets behind the curtain, that things are not what they seem. Kindred spirits, questioners. </p>

<p>UFOs, MK Ultra, Government experiments on psychics, Rosicrucians, Freemasonry, the Vatican, Trilateral Commission, Illuminati, the Kennedys, Elders of Zion, KKK, Skull and Bones, CIA torture manuals, all this stuff was stuff that was either part of your awareness, or not. You were either in this club of questioners, or you were one of the zombies who watches the evening news. </p>

<p><strong>The defining thing was not that we knew the truth, it was that we knew that we didn&#39;t know the truth, because we knew it was being kept from us.</strong> It was not some huge ego-blow to find out that a favorite theory was a dead-end, it was common. </p>

<p>Now, with the internet, it&#39;s different. You can live in a 24/7 circle-jerk of youtube videos and forum-posts all &quot;proving&quot; that bigfoot is real, and that the Zionist lizard-people are trying to kill him, if that&#39;s your thing. You can retreat into this bubble where questioning and skepticism are not allowed. Instead of being forced to suck on the false narrative of the three networks, you can choose your own false narrative, and drown yourself in media that confirms it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the side of modern conspiracy culture that I hate. The side that wants to tear down and band the false narrative of the MSM, so they can replace it with their own false narrative. I still do love the aspects of conspiracy culture that are always looking for clues, always questioning, always skeptical, but some of the romance of that side of things has worn off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. The danger of conspiracy theory culture gaining popularity like it has is what you pointed out. Wanting to tear down the false narrative of the media and replacing it with their own biased ideals as well. I believe it is the way the truth will be kept hidden from the world perpetually. It feels like there are many efforts to control the image and narrative of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; that have started since the last election.</p>

<p>I also believe that the truth will eventually come out as it seems generation after generation is becoming more open, accepting, and &quot;spiritually mature&quot; i guess is the term I would use. Their control of the education system will fade hopefully because it is a big problem for the future of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I first joined the sub it was to look up cool conspiracies and hear stories about why people thought there were aliens, or how the government was using mind control techniques.  The sub Reddit did offer stuff like that in the beginning, with discussions and people posting links to why they agreed or disagreed.  It was great.</p>

<p>Now I see one post in 200 with stuff like that.  Don&#39;t get me wrong there is some shady shit out there that needs to be addressed and discussed, but its a lot less thought out debating and more &quot;you&#39;re a shill pos who&#39;s wrong&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about...&quot; With no facts, articles, or thought out responses.</p>

<p>But if you ever want to debate stuff in a civilized manner let me know I&#39;m always game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that certain conspiracies are pushed by money or power to help a certain cause. A lot of conspiracies are pushed by religious to scare the flock into submission. Or to prove to them that they can&#39;t trust the government, only the church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lurker here, your title and the first half of the post seem to be considering a different problem than the second half. </p>

<p>The second half refers to people being condescending and even insulting. Obviously that&#39;s lame, but so long as topics are divisive, emotional and the community isn&#39;t focusing on upvoting standards, it&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>In the title/first half you&#39;re referring to people dismissing/disproving theories, which you contrast with having productive conversations about them. I&#39;m inclined to think those are productive conversations. Scientific theories are established and bolstered by such criticism, and I don&#39;t see why standards here should be different.</p>

<p>If you want a community that makes everyone feel good about every out there thing they believe and spreads those ideas, then either you don&#39;t take the theories all that seriously, you don&#39;t want your beliefs challenged generally, or you don&#39;t believe you could be wrong.</p>

<p>Regardless I agree politeness is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where conspiracies are concerned there is a lot of unknowns,  this incites fear. We like to fill in the gaps with bits of information  and through cognitive dissonance we reach our conclusions of what is true. People by nature are afraid of ideas that compromise this rationale. It is natural to lash out, its kind of like on the playground with two kids arguing who&#39;s dad is the strongest. Now multiply that with the fact that this is being conducted on the internet and there will be little to no repercussions to what you say. To put it simply they are children who think they know what they are talking about. In truth, none of us know the whole and absolute truth. Just half truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much enjoy conspiracies and believe they exist.</p>

<p>The things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All sorts of Intelligence Agencies (not just US) push out conspiracies to discredit the other side and cause confusion and unrest.</p></li>
<li><p>Some conspiracy theories add little facts which discredit the truth, and make it so the real conspiracies get overlooked because of the crazy little bits of easily disprovable things.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-- Examples: Gelitin B-Thing happened, and may very well have something to do with 9/11. However, it&#39;s always claimed they are Israeli when they were Austrian. (Hey, maybe they worked for the Mossad, but they are still Austrian.)</p>

<p>-- Tell a little bit of the truth an add a lie into it. When researched, the truth is ignored, because the lie overwhelms it. This is how disinformation works.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Right now the internet allows for complete free-flow of information. The tactic has shifted from burying things to manipulating them. Control the &quot;Mainstream&quot; and &quot;Truther&quot; narrative from the beginning. Have your op have a weird little thing in it (the viral component it), and you can do elaborate things and make people dismiss them as ridiculous.</p></li>
<li><p>People are too willing to believe everything. Look at my recent joking posts about the deaths of the two musicians and how it was obviously the Clintons. Of course a few days later an article comes out claiming the Clintons did it. Obvious bullshit, and it makes all the real Arkancide seem just as ludicrous.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a lot of real dirt happening, and it&#39;s hidden by making it silly.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>-- Example: Let&#39;s say pizzagate is true. Having this pizza element in the story makes it unbelievable to a lot of people. So tie your black op in with something silly and you cove it up.</p>

<ul>
<li>People want to believe everything is a conspiracy. The fact is there are a lot of conspiracies, and a lot of ones we don&#39;t even know about. Yet some of what gets put out here is obviously not real and meant to discredit truth finding.</li>
</ul>

<p>From a friend who&#39;s a professor specializing in Jordan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BTW Jordanian media is much more straightforwardly a conspiracy. The government runs the major papers and puts former officers from the political police in charge... editorials are written by the political police and cut down to fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of people including journalists think that the new online news sites are actually intelligence gathering fronts by the security services to incite people into giving away their plans and true beliefs. It&#39;s also interesting how many of the people telling me all of this are the sons of intelligence officers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberalism as privatizing the political police into &quot;the media&quot;?</p>

<p>Yeah, tbh I liked talking politics with Arabs a lot more before the powers that be cared at all what they thought and then started pumping a ton of money into shaping public opinion.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we have in the US is subtler ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems part of the strategy is not having a central Ministry of Truth, but sort of a decentralized system in which powers work together, compete a bit over exact implementation, but overall do the same general bidding … the way you can see the various mainstream news outlets (and of course the various not ones, but for more niche groups) cater to different cultural groups within America. They succeed in doing a divide and conquer as well as leading down a path. It’s quite ingenious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went to school with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bronfman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bronfman</a> so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Jr">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Jr</a>.</p>

<p>I have a cartoon (one panel) he made when he was 10 years old that involves a spook in a trenchcoat and sunglasses calling in news to CNN (well, it says CIA, just looks like the CNN logo) ... that&#39;s the kinda truth he knew at 10 as son of billionaire elite. I&#39;m glad I got out of the place, was training ground for the elite (my parents wanted me to go there because that&#39;s where JFK went) ... the stories I could tell of the children of NYC&#39;s political elites ... and the fact that they obviously knew what was up.</p>

<p>I mean, it seems the same way here is my point, just more subtle so that most people think you’re an idiot for thinking of such conspiracies, and anyone in the know thinks you’re an idiot for not realizing such conspiracies.</p>

<p>--- My problem is not the conspiracies, it&#39;s the blindly jumping on every bandwagon. There are people out there being paid to lead you in circles with this stuff. Then there&#39;s the other side of the coin with the elite schools, universities, etc.. that recruit the other side into the ideologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it is counterproductive to discuss things that either have been already disproven. Or are ridiculous. And hence majoroty if good discussion is often found in real world issues like pizzagate, watergate, rigged elections, and elite collusion, etc. Talking about things that either have iffy relations like aliens among us, is kind of fun, but in the end dont lead anywhere but speculation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because we&#39;re sorry for you, and we&#39;re afraid of the ideas you&#39;re giving people. Claiming the moon landing was fake, that 9/11 was an inside job, that vaccines are dangerous... It causes smart people to go down a bad path, it leads people to stop believing in the truth. If your conspiracies were harmless, then we wouldn&#39;t care, but they can cause actual harm if left unchecked. We simply come here to try and save those of you who haven&#39;t fallen too far from causing yourselves and others pain. We want you to understand and know the truth, and we know most or all of you ignore, fight, or call us shills, but maybe once in a while, someone will wake up. We don&#39;t want you to feel like we hate you, or like we have evil motives. We want to save you from yourselves. It may be a lost cause, but we HAVE to try, for our own consciences and for the sake of those who can be hurt by this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I come here rarely, and I often find myself on the &quot;disproving&quot; side of things.  What I see are some very interesting theories worth investigating, and some others which don&#39;t touch on reality all that often, aren&#39;t internally consistent, or are trivially falsifiable.  </p>

<p>I set the bar low, but occasionally there is something that looks like it was cooked up by some government propagandist who isn&#39;t allowed out of the basement often enough to understand the world around them.  Maybe N. Korea propaganda mills or something.</p>

<p>Occasionally there are people looking for answers, and I happen to know the answers and share them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started commenting on this sub occasionally in the last year, often times in opposition of some theories I personally feel are lacking in  credibility. One reason for this is because when Im intrigued or agree with a theory, I usually just upvote it, helping it gain attention. When I disagree, I feel I need to explain why. I know the sub is meant for people to post alternative unproven theories so if I disagree with something, I dont mean for that to come off as a protest of them sharing what they discovered. Im happy they posted it because it gave me something to take into consideration even if in the end I dont accept the proposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like conspiracies and I&#39;m interested in a great deal of them, but it&#39;s obvious that most of these are just attempts to bolster an already held political belief rather than search for truth. </p>

<p>There is also the complete failure to accept that many conspiracies aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. Both Trump and Clinton can and are involved in conspiracies. Why does it have to be one or the other in this sub? Both clearly have a history of cozy relationships with the Russians as one example.</p>

Youtube videos that dont provide any evidence of anything, articles from sources that have a history of lying and alot of people are just here to muddy the waters, call everything fake so that when something real hits people take a second to question its validity.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that propaganda has hit our country hard. There is evidence of how it started and what its being used for. Our people are fighting against their own best interests to promote fairy tales and this sub is the convergence of all types of thought.</p>

<p>Hopefully we will get out of this hell hole of irrational thought and people will be more protective of what they choose to believe. But I dont see this cancer going away anytime soon.</p>
