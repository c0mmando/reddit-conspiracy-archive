    <div class="md"><p>-Kate&#39;s law is from Cruz and Salmon, reintroduced after failure on 2015. So not Trump. And still hasn&#39;t past the senate.</p>

<p>-down payment on the wall did pass the house. Rest remains to be seen, especially since his new chief of staff isn&#39;t for it.</p>

<p>-The travel down has been shot down over and over again, only limited pieces of it made it anywhere, so hard to argue that a win.</p>

<p>-Supreme court was all the senate. Mcconnell is the reason we didn&#39;t get someone last spring, Mcconnell is the reason we got someone now. </p>

<p>-Yep TPP was shot down.</p>

<p>-Riding an economy that&#39;s been showing growth for 5 years straight (with one Quarter downturn in 2014). Yep that&#39;s definitely a Trump accomplishment /s.</p>

<p>So what else is there? </p>

<p>Oh yeah, the Russia investigation. But that&#39;s just a big nothing burger, and won&#39;t have any affect on the remainder of his presidency. Right? That&#39;s not actually conspiracy, Trump would never willingly engage in an actual conspiracy, right?</p>

You believe that 50 percent (more if you look at the popular vote) of the nation are &quot;emotional children&quot; and you think the best way to deal with them on a national political level is to insult and degrade them?

<p>so being fake and flip flopping is ok as long as you CURRENTLY support your chosen minority group.  real smart.  you realize the danger is that if she changes her mind for political reasons that can happen again?</p>

<p>Rod Wheeler is a former homicide detective who has worked as a “Fox News crime analyst” for over a decade. In 2007, he was forced to retract a story he reported on The O’Reilly Factor in which he claimed more than 150 “violent lesbian gangs” armed with 9-millimeter handguns in the D.C. area alone were “performing sex acts” and “committing crimes.”</p>

<p>She has, dumbass. Have you not been paying attention for the last 12 years? She was attacked back before Bush Jr. was out of office, because the RNC thought she was making a presidential play back then.

If Trump had an NGO that was as powerful and as dirty as the Clinton&#39;s, there would be an uproar and it would be discussed every damn day.

Even some were sympathetic, like Chris Matthews! </p>

<p>Come on wake up man. The Clintons are one of the heads of this new neolib machine. The fact that she and her husband have been attacked so much should show how clearly corrupt they are. The act that MSM is compelled to talk about it is a sign that the Clintons are protected in high places by very corrupt people. </p>

<p>And that was just fucking Benghazi, not all the other investigations that led to zero charges. Second off, if you replace the name of Donald Trump with Hillary Clinton, as well as children, aids, staff etc, then you guys would be all over this shit. Like why are Trump and co keep lying if it&#39;s a nothingburger? Why have people resigned over this shit if it&#39;s a nothing burger? If you really think the Russian investigation has no teeth then you aren&#39;t paying attention and that&#39;s not my fault. Like did you watch the Browder testimony on Russia? Like from here on out, when ever you yelp fake news, replace the name Trump with Clinton, Manafort with Podesta, DJTJ or Ivanka with Chealsea, and seriously tell me you would be defending Hillary Clinton as hard as you&#39;re defending Trump. </p>

<p>Like if you ask me, they are part of the same side (Trump donates millions of more bucks to Democrats, is a registered Democrat, Hung out with the Clintons, played golf with them, donated to BOTH of their presidential campaigns, they went to each other&#39;s weddings, he endorsed an Obama/Clinton ticket in &#39;08, endorsed Clinton for president in 2011, and then went to a Miss Universe Pagent in Russia and all of a sudden started to exclusively donate to Republicans then ran for president and Clintons are suddenly his worse enemy? Ok</p>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, that&#39;s fine, but the bitch has had more resources spent on investigations done on her than any political figure or scandal in American history. Like at this point she just looks guilty or Republicans are complicit in her crimes, your choice. </p>

<p>Also After looking through your post history you do literally nothing else but argue on political forums defending your dear leader and your government while bashing a party that has nearly zero political power right now, and you are praising the most powerful party in American history (yes the 2016-2018 Republican party has the most power of any party in the history of this country). You just push the &quot;buh muh great leaduh&quot; narrative&quot; </p>

<p>Keep it up, you government shills are fun to argue with. </p>

<p>These days I feel that we are amidst a multi-national propaganda war. MSM sources are 99.3 percent of the time correct. Problem is how they write their stories, and what they are omitting, and how they are framing everything. You have alternative media, but it is so spotty because there is no culture and roots that guide and protect it. You can read about Hillary being a reptilian from draco from one source, and in another you can get some genuinely good info that is NOT being discussed by MSM. Same with Trump. Why are Trump&#39;s connections to the mafia during the construction boom not discussed? Why is his friendship with Epstein and his flight on lolita express not discussed? There are many others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man you are right. I also think that identity politics is making the divisions even worse than they need to be. Everyone wants revenge, and everybody is a victim of something. Problem is this shit is complicated. Those on the right need to see that institutional racism exists, and need at least to be more empathetic. They also need to see that the Republicans are only for filling their pockets with wealth. People on the left need to see that some folks traditions and religious beliefs, which are thousands of years old, cannot be abrogated because it hurts peoples feelings. That their rhetoric is venomous and completely over the top.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t done a study on the subject. Trump is easy to call out because he does it through Twitter on a daily basis.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what he&#39;d like you to believe, because it makes him look like a good guy. Pretend for 1 second that he&#39;s not actually fighting invisible forces that are entrenched in governments. How do his actions look to you now? Do you have any evidence that there is some invisible grand conspiracy that is causing him to be portrayed as an incompetent and unstable person in the media? Is that any more likely than the possibility that he is actually incompetent and unstable? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Politics are exclusively seen in the media as dirty and corrupt. What media are you watching? It&#39;s also not simple. </p>

<p>People like Trump want you to think that we can solve all of the problems of government by &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. The problem is that the swamp is just going to fill back up again. Government breeds corruption when it is left to its own devices. That&#39;s why we have freedom of the press. Their job is to expose corruption before it can fester. Trump is actively trying to keep them from doing that by marginalizing them and fooling people into thinking he and he alone knows the truth. The sheep aren&#39;t people who follow the so-called mainstream media. They are people who were tricked into believing the media was feeding them lies by the very people that should be under scrutiny by the same media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I just see certain issues. One, is that most western universities have a pretty homogenized ideological range. They usually are either neo-left types, or are marxist of one stripe or another. This is not everybody, but in the humanities and social sciences this is usually the case. As a result a lot of the young journalists follow these ideologies. I have my own ideologies and beliefs, so I understand my biases. I fear that many in journalism do not do so. They believe in the trans-gender agenda and gay marriage agenda, and equate it to the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. They believe in the overhaul of capitalism and a transition to a fully formed socialist democracy. The USA is pretty much already there, though most Americans do not realize it. </p>

<p>When you see the traditionalists as evil regressive enemies of progress, how can you be unbiased? This just breeds radicalism in the far right, and many young people are going weirdo far right into nazism and ethnic nationalism. Try talking to some of those far right kids. I would say about 65 percent of them five to ten years ago were either moderate or mostly liberal. If it was not so fucked up and scary, it would be fascinating to study. The only times societies change this radically is when Caesarism, radical communism, and fascism poke their heads up from the muck. We are not going in a good direction.</p>

<p>Sorry I am a wind bag. What do you think, man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does neo-left mean? If you&#39;re talking about neoliberals, you couldn&#39;t be more wrong. Neoliberals are globalists and believe in a free market with government intervention only when necessary to support equality. I&#39;m a regular poster on <a href="/r/neoliberal">/r/neoliberal</a>, and I consider it one of the few places for actual political discussion on reddit. The reason the entire planet has been gravitating toward neoliberal policies for the last half a century or more is because they support policies that work and promote equality.</p>

<p>Far left ideologies appeal to students and very young people because they are simple and naive. Why else would someone support a political ideology that has been tried repeatedly and always ends in abject failure? The US has been migrating toward opening up trade with the rest of the world and striving toward a global community. In the long run, not only is this inevitable, but it will prevent war and exploitation of the impoverished because there will no longer be a &quot;3rd world&quot;</p>

<p>The far right is still a pretty big minority because people will use common sense when push comes to shove. Radical nationalism has never been a viable long-term strategy for anyone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump x Putin narrative began accumulating links because of the reciprocating Dutch ruddering between the two men being played out in media around the world. The Clinton campaign noticed the ostentatious bromance, then naturally accused Trump of being sympathetic towards a dictator. Whether Seth Rich is the leaker or Russia really did have multiple cyber squads hack the DNC, as our intelligence agencies have alleged, didn&#39;t make the two men any less gay for one another; it wouldn&#39;t alter any other connections Trump might have to Russian oligarchs, and by extension to Putin himself. </p>

<p>The Trump x Putin narrative metastasized after Trump took office and independent news organizations began uncovering more connections. Furthermore, Trump comported himself in exactly the way one might expect of someone who actually committed the crimes that the narrative was accusing him of, which only further bolsters it. You could argue that Trump&#39;s behavior reified a false narrative in the minds of many Americans, but accusing Seth Rich of being the leaker isn&#39;t enough to obliterate all links in the narrative network; it would still leave America with an idiot in chief, who is desperately in love with a foreign dictator.</p>

<p>Anything else like the Awan connection the night of the murder, or Podesta mentioning &quot;making an example the leaker&quot; are speculative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at the 3 minute mark, he is a lot more guarded in his language. he says that it is &quot;consistent with what he&#39;s found, to begin to think, that perhaps&quot;. that is completely different from the quote that was attributed to him, which says his investigation &quot;shows&quot; there was contact between Rich and Wikileaks.</p>

<p>neither did he say that the DNC is blocking the murder investigation. they&#39;re blocking <em>his</em> investigation, which he isn&#39;t entitled to pursue as he is a free agent and not with the police or the FBI.

<p>that&#39;s a pretty significant difference. hence why Fox News retracted the story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a thoughtful assumption, but anything Seth Rich tends to catch attention...as evidenced by all the conversations revolving around Seth Rich today. And all the conversations being had even when a Seth story isn&#39;t in the news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they lied. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>No need for the lawsuit then. Thanks for the heads up!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And if he went that far in a TV interview then it absolutely isn&#39;t a stretch that he actually said the quote that Fox News ran in their article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>..they did not call him back, but he is not the one in charge of the investigation. Therefore he never said that the investigation had stopped. The Police dept was still pursuing it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t say the police weren&#39;t pursuing it, he said the DNC was stonewalling it. If he was hired by the family to help investigate, and the police didn&#39;t want to communicate with him because of the DNC, then that&#39;s evidence of them trying to stonewall.</p>

<p>Pretty amazing to see the 180 spin everyone took on Rod Wheeler once the tune changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice copy pasta. 90% of that are just banal facts that are not evidence that Seth was the Leaker. Like </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;October 2015 — Clinton Email Testimony.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you expect us to believe garbage like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>May 23, 2017—Kim Dotcom releases a statement confirming Seth Rich was in contact with him. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>KDC is a proven liar who promised evidence like you and delivered an actual nothingburger. Why because it was a big PR stunt and you know it. And you pass this shit off as evidence? Sick how you piss and shit all over Seth&#39;s dead body in the desperate hope that the stench will protect your god emperor. </p>

<p>When it comes to Russia, Trump and his administration have done nothing but lie to the public. That you keep defending him with garage like this, shows me that you are a nothing more than a useful idiot.</p>

I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not an assassin and I&#39;ve not been schooled in assassination, but I imagine &#39;make sure your target is dead&#39; is like, rule 1...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shoot 1 bullet into his heart or lungs. That&#39;s not a hard task for a trained professional and you could still easily make it look like a random act of violence. Or, if you want to make it look like a robbery, just take his wallet. Maybe do it in a spot that doesn&#39;t have security cameras. There is zero evidence to suggest it was a hit because even if they were trying to make it look random they did a piss poor job</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try, the police aren&#39;t paid to not solves murders and conspiracies because someone (including the relatives) &quot;hate you people&quot;. Once over if responsible people care to solve a murder than they should be allowed to try, why would the family be opposed to that? Why do you think that genuinely curious people that go out of their way to connect patterns and track criminals are the people this family hates? Why does your massive ego tell you to bring your ass-hurt fake liberal dogma and try to smear this popular theory in a forum that you honestly don&#39;t belong in? </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you neckbeard your way over to the equally dim shills in r/worldnews where your fake Russian hacking and endless partisan circlejerk session is all the rage? Sorry, but history shows time and time again that many theories which are deemed crazy and fake by the majority turn out to be true. Trying to brigade a thread with pedo apologists, shills, and genuinely stupid MSM followers that listen to the accused criminals themselves for their baseless evidence doesn&#39;t make you right no matter how high your rigged karma meter is. Going into a anti-conspiracy, guilt tripping, temper tantrum (in a sub where you are the minority) makes it kind of obvious. </p>

<p>Mind you I didn&#39;t vote and I don&#39;t like Trump or Hillary. In my opinion Trump won because of one reason. Trump used shills to make an overly positive imaginary fan base whereas Hillary shilled for internet attack dogs that guard certain threads with fake karma and condescending comment flooding. One of which is way more obvious in a community as naturally paranoid as this one. Both Trump and Hillary should probably be in prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how your reading comprehension is awful. Try again. I said the police aren&#39;t paid to feel bad with the parents, they&#39;re paid to solve crimes and possible conspiracies. This doesn&#39;t mean their word is infallible. Get it? Then because you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re talking about you appeal to authority (the hive mind police that are one being in your eyes) which is a submission that you don&#39;t know anything but are egotistical enough to call your daddy over to try to intimidate me with names. You&#39;re willing to let other what unknown entities have the final word amd think for you as long as they sound important or speak in absolutes. You&#39;re a genuine idiot more than a conspiracy theorist. Why don&#39;t you leave instead of responding to my paragraphs with two sentence cries for help?</p>

<p>When half the conspiracy is about corruption in the police force you can&#39;t use the whole big police force&#39;s opinion to hold an argument you fool. You assume all the police are perfect angels that can commit no sin? Grow up and actually use your brain you moron, don&#39;t talk to me about my train of thought when you don&#39;t even have an argument besides &quot;teh powice osifers said its bem debunkeded wif wikiwedia&quot; you fucking train wreck of a person.

<p>if responsible people care to solve a murder than they should be allowed to try, why would the family be opposed to that? </p>

<p>Because some people are bat-shit-crazy and are using the Rich&#39;s sons death as a political scapegoat. You think the Rich family wants to keep seeing this whole affair, particularly the idea that <strong>the president might have used your dead son as a distraction to cover for his own possible misdeeds? You can&#39;t see how <em>insulting</em> that would be?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Batshit crazy people are not responsible people and anyone turning Seth&#39;s death into a political scapegoat aren&#39;t properly investigating the case. These people are easy to spot and ignore. Period. I or anyone on this sub can tell you there will probably never be a time without shitheads exploiting tragedy for greed (possibly like Trump) so you&#39;ll have to filter them out like everyone else. Furthermore to lump us in with real nutjobs that blur the line is probably more insulting to real CTs than whatever you&#39;re talking about. If they believe Trump is hiding behind them then it&#39;s basically on them and us to call him out for that.</p>

<p>I guess I understand what you&#39;re saying but you make it seem like we have dishonored the Rich family for all time because Trump and crew are Froth-mouth lunatics like Clinton and company and will use deemed lessers as publicly stunts. If they think Trump used them to hide his own crimes they should be taking this chance to blow up Trumps spot and ask for investigations against him instead of guilt tripping the curious. What do you want me to do? Make a designated safe space where the mourners can sit in a blank vacuum of no outside information and not face the bitter truth?  I have sympathy for them but they should be willing to endure just about anything to solve their sons case. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re upset with something the president did then they should put the spotlight on the president not alleged neckbeards putting strings on corkboards in their spare time and relaying the theories on public internet forums for others to read. Do you think the Rich family is literally on this sub weeping because of us talking about them? I guess you should feel bad to then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that the narrative now?...That any future evidence (not tying to the DNC) points to &quot;there is some truth to it&quot;.</p>

<p>I really like how one redditor pointed it out that apparently the Clintons are ninja assassins with 57 (and counting) political murders...yet are 0 for 2 in trying to get Hillary elected.  They are so deep state, they couldn&#39;t even get Trump&#39;s tax returns or leak other embarrassing things we now know about in 2015 or 2016....yet, they can kill at will without a single trace.</p>

<p>Lets punt to the other side if this Seth Rich conspiracy...the three key sources of info:
1) Assange - who strongly &quot;hinted&quot; it was Seth Rich.  Who I presume is wiggling his way as much as possible to get a pardon or at least get the Snowden (live in Russia) treatment</p>

<p>2) Kim Dot Com - who apparently is sitting on a &quot;mountain&quot; of Seth Rich evidence and was going to release it...yet didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>3) Rod Wheeler - whose quotes were used a few months ago to re-ignite the conspiracy again; who is clearly now discrediting all of this</p>

<p>4) Other - pure conjecture, hearsay...&quot;who has his laptop&quot;, &quot;why are there no cameras&quot; etc.</p>

<p>The amount of mental gymnastics you have to play to think this is a slam dunk DNC conspiracy, while all the constant info (perhaps not evidence) of Trump&#39;s dealings with Russia is a &quot;nothing burger&quot; is really impressive.</p>

<p>Please explain the mental gymnastics it takes to believe that someone can be shot and killed by a mugger who forgot to steal valuables.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, actually the burden of proof weighs heaviest on those with the more outlandish theory.</p>

<p>Botched robberies happen all the time (or often enough). Muggers do not typically intend to kill, and if it they do, particularly if it involves a scuffle before the shooting, their new priority is simply to avoid getting caught. This is <strong>far</strong> more likely than a hitman who left Seth alive AND didn&#39;t even <em>try</em> to make it look like an accident.</p>

<p>Lastly, WikiLeaks&#39; suggestion that this has nothing to do with Russia couldn&#39;t be any more transparent. JA cannot risk angering Russia in any way. Listening to his veiled suggestions about the matter is naive as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah actually you don&#39;t get to decide which theory is more outlandish because thats just your opinion, bud, you&#39;re wrong again. Logic just doesn&#39;t jump over your theory because you can&#39;t think of enough straw mans to knock down mine like the transparent bullshitter you are. Show me evidence that &quot;botched robberies&quot; happen all the time, instead of appealing to vague imaginary statistics that aren&#39;t similar to this case. Show me where it says &quot;Seth Rich was undoubtedly killed by a random mugger that got scared and ran away after using his own weapon to kill Seth&quot;. You can&#39;t and all your comments are visibly in retaliation of wikileaks and theories that aren&#39;t New York Times, WaPo and NPR headlines. Partly because you can only shill/usefull idiot hard enough to make your comments just barely look like a pathetic attempt to make an argument from ignorance. Why don&#39;t you actually follow those links I posted you fraud?</p>

<p>You are making arguments based off of your own opinions and ignorance, and that is a logical fallacy once again just like your initial fake appeal to emotion fallacy at the start. Read one of that last links I sent you, it literally states that their is no evidence proving it was a failed mugging but the police won&#39;t rule it out. You are wrong again. You keep talking and thinking what you&#39;re saying means anything but you just keep embarrassing yourself. Your bold text and strawmans about wikileaks makes it look even dumber because I can tell you are emotional set on believing your own story but you come on a sub reddit where nobody will fall for your shit ability to sweep a story and reason under your diseased blanket of anti-logic. You won&#39;t win this debate because you aren&#39;t smart enough to lie your way out. The truth is I hope I&#39;m wrong but you on the other hand refuse to believe you aren&#39;t right. (It makes it obvious)</p>

<p>Yea JA can&#39;t anger the Russia God or lest he be cast into the same retardation as u/ztoundas . If you look at a globe you can see that it says Russia on it, this must mean the globe is colluding with Russian hackers correct? Fuck you</p>

<p>I never said he was <strong>&#39;undoubtedly&#39;</strong> killed by a random mugger. I simply said this is a far more reasonable and likely event than the convoluted fever dream you present. Straw man #2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t you actually follow those links I posted you fraud?</p>

<p>While your assumption might make you feel better, it&#39;s false. BTW, the audio of the investigative reporter stating what he believes happened is not proof. Google &#39;hearsay&#39; for more info ;) Also, don&#39;t forget that this guy Hersch (while winning awards for good work) is also known <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/11719/index2.html">to have stretched the truth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_document_hoax">dealt with forgeries to try to make his case</a>. This does not prove he is lying now, but it doesn&#39;t help his argument that already lacks any evidence. P.S. since you are citing him, what do you think of his argument that Seth was in a high crime area? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read one of that last links I sent you, it literally states that their is no evidence proving it was a failed mugging but the police won&#39;t rule it out. You are wrong again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Straw man #3, again implying I stated it was <em>proven</em>. I did not. However, the evidence I mentioned <strong>supporting</strong> the botched mugging is the prevalence of mugging in the area, as mentioned by your own audio clip and of course this DC <a href="http://crimemap.dc.gov/CrimeMapSearch.aspx">Crime Map</a> showing <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Dibx7Ql.jpg">dozens of similar violent and gun related crimes in the area.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your bold text and strawmans about wikileaks makes it look even dumber</p>

<p>Yeah, also not a straw man. My statement that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/05/julian-assanges-claim-that-there-was-no-russian-involvement-in-wikileaks-emails/?utm_term=.30121e831436">JA and WikiLeaks suggested that these leaks had nothing to do with Russia <em>is exactly what he did</em>.</a> I&#39;m starting to think you don&#39;t know what a strawman argument even is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea JA can&#39;t anger the Russia God or lest he be cast into the same retardation as u/ztoundas</p>

<p>Oh yeah, members of the Russian media have complete freedom, how could I forget?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They utilize many tactics of the far left, and are fully in on the identity politics. On a personal level, they rub me raw because they seem like modern day rockefeller republicans. Fiscally conservative, and socially liberal. I am kinda the exact opposite in my leanings. So I guess I would rub you the wrong way as well, being a traditionalist and against globalism.</p>
