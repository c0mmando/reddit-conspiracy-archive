<blockquote>
<p>&quot;CNN is not publishing &#39;HanA**holeSolo&#39;s&#39; name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again,&quot; CNN said in its story. &quot;In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change,&quot;</strong> the article continued, suggesting a conditional agreement to protect the user&#39;s identity.</p>

<p>This brings up no points I&#39;m not already familiar with nor does it do anything to change what was physically written by CNN. </p>

<p>Most people aren&#39;t deluded in thinking there is a right to anonymity. That doesn&#39;t change that it was very clearly, without a doubt, a threat to dox. They have every right to dox the user, but it doesn&#39;t make them less shitty. The creator of a fucking meme isn&#39;t national news no matter how badly some want to paint it that way. </p>

<p>This opinion piece is also incredibly partisan. I&#39;m not a trump supporter or a conservative, I&#39;m a very liberal democrat. This was bipartisan outrage. </p>

<p>They never claimed that the account was him 100% only that reddit users allege that it is. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s different to report on a something some people believe (while implicitly stating it&#39;s the beliefs of some reddit users) than to threaten a user with revealing their identity because they made some content they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>Fox is shitty propaganda, but because they didn&#39;t have the malicious intent CNN did in that case I really disagree that they did more than CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen man, we have to protect these delicate freethinkers. Ideas have been proven to be more dangerous than the government themselves, so there is only one possible solution. Quit looking at links that people don&#39;t like, actually don&#39;t look at links at all. The whole internet is a vast right wing conspiracy and we are all just machines crafted by the Creator of the Universe. We each have our specialized role. I&#39;m a broken thinking machine after all, I can only see things through the reality I know. Our duty as machines is to soley get a reaction from the only machine with free will using YouTube video, 4chan posts, Dailycaller, and Fox news. </p>

<p>Honestly we should realize that people will always post bullshit on here, they are doing it in droves on both sides. We have to all start acting more like Bill Cooper and do our research and prove things through the research. We shouldn&#39;t be scared of leaving our bubble to look at inflammatory, dangerous, or down right false information because how else will we learn to decipher the bullshit from the jewels. We need to quit acting like we are fucking children whose ears need to be protected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to the articles (on cnns site) they did threaten because &quot;CNN is not publishing &quot;HanA**holeSolo&#39;s&quot; name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology&quot;</p>

<p>Wouldnt that boil down to blackmail?</p>

<p>Technically i suppose it wasnt a dox because they never released the info, but how is that not in the least a threat to do so if theyre demands (apology) werent met.</p>

<p>Of course cnn is going to say they didnt threaten anyone, why would they?</p>

<p>CNN for all of its faults generally holds its actual reporters to standards for fact checking and truthfulness. Last month when they got a story wrong, CNN forced the three employees involved to resign....... Because that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work if you&#39;re in the news business. Same with Dan Rather at CBS, when he got the story about bush wrong he resigned because that&#39;s how important getting your facts straight is.</p>

<p>When was the last time anyone from Fox News resigned for getting facts wrong, or just flat out making shit up? To my knowledge, never....... And they&#39;re constantly getting things wrong and making shit up.</p>

<p>Is Hannity going to resign over this? I doubt it........ O&#39;Reilly never did for making shit up, Glen Beck was a raging maniac spewing bullshit for years with no consequences, and Hannity has never seemed to care about the truth either.</p>

<p>There needs to be one standard that we hold everyone to, this business of holding different things to different standards is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone from the Trump camp goes on, and on, and on about &quot;fake news&quot;........ When it&#39;s been very clear for a long time that Fox News is nothing more than a conservative republican propaganda tool for years. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been caught so many times skewing facts it&#39;s not even funny. They were also caught taking talking points from the Bush White House, and whenever one of their &quot;reporters&quot; gets caught they defend the lies by claiming they&#39;re a &quot;commentator&quot; not a lawyer so the dont need to be factually correct.</p>

<p>Its so transparent what&#39;s going on here. This is all part of a massive plan to make the American public stop trusting any news source other than the right wing conservative sources...... Then the only official truth left is going to be the truth that Trump hands to you. And we all know that when it comes to truth, Trump really struggles with that.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to wake up and look at this objectively, this is 1984 level shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They bring up a valid argument. For years now the Republican Party has been propagating conspiracy theories designed for political gain. </p>

<p>Alex Jones went after Obama for years while leaving the Republicans alone. Donald Trump drove the &quot;birther&quot; bandwagon, which really was the beginning of his 2016 political campaign when you think about it....... It&#39;s where he recruited his base. That&#39;s why when the news cycle isn&#39;t in his favour, or if he&#39;s having a bad day he immediately starts attacking the Clinton&#39;s....... It&#39;s a distraction and it&#39;s throwing some red meat to the base that he carefully developed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not limited to the political right, but the political right puts out 95% of it and is completely unashamed about doing it. And when the left gets it wrong, they generally do the right thing and people lose their jobs over it....... I&#39;ll guarantee you that Hannity will still be employed by Fox News after this. </p>

<p>Trying to compare the left and the right in terms of &quot;fake news&quot; is a false equivilency. There&#39;s one side putting out 95% of the fake news, and that&#39;s also the same side that&#39;s trying to discredit any news source other than themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The better question is how many times has the NYT or WaPo printed something that was factually incorrect in order to score political points.</p>

<p>Nobody is arguing that various media sources can be slanted to differing degrees, we&#39;ve already gone over that. The primary difference is that the vast majority of flat out, completely unsubstantiated bullshit is coming from one side and it&#39;s often presented as fact....... That&#39;s the issue here.</p>

<p>Editorial content is one thing, but presenting editorial content or politically driven lies as news is an entirely different thing...... And taking talking points and pushing damaging conspiracy theories is on a totally different level again. </p>

<p>The other issue here is how different sources respond when they get caught lying or getting facts wrong. When has Fox News or Alex Jones dismissed an employee for this? To my knowledge, never. 
When CNN&#39;s Donna Brazille was caught giving debate questions to the DNC, that was it for her employment....... Is Hannity going to resign? Is Hannity having supper with Trump appropriate behaviour for a journalist? Did anyone from Fox News resign for taking talking points from the Bush Administration? No, yes and no.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an obvious double standard in terms of journalistic integrity, and thus and obvious false equivilency. </p>

<p>You make many valid points that I mostly agree with. Again, I&#39;m not defending Trump and fuuuuuck fox. </p>

<p>This may be unfair, please bear with me:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say fake news can be measured - I truly don&#39;t think the <em>danger</em> in fake news should be measured by quantity or number of errors rather that it should be measured by how many people it reaches. Infowars has nothing on USA Today by readership. So when USA Today prints a lie from Politifact they are making making PF an authority and making an appeal to that authority and suggesting a preponderance of evidence as well as argumentum ad populum - and in some cases, you are forced to conclude that is deliberate. Repeat this daily for a year across the 20 widest reaching media outlets in the English language and suddenly... What did Goebbles say? And not a trivial amount of that is conspiracy theory. But <em>you</em> wouldn&#39;t call it a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I had a discussion earlier today with someone in the Wikileaks sub regarding NPRs coverage of the Seth Rich. NPR stated (paraphrase) that the Rich conspiracy theory was perpetuated by Assange&#39;s &quot;cryptic&quot; messages. Interestingly, that is itself a conspiracy theory, yet NPR pushed it as a way of discrediting Assange. But the average Democrat isn&#39;t going to pick up on that because it fits a narrative. This example is only to show that this happens under the average nose and they are completely unaware that it even happened. </p>

<p>WaPo, yesterday, actually went on record advocating the use of propaganda. That post in /politics got some 5k upvotes (clearly supporting the practice). I shared that link here for 13 upvotes (presumably condemning propaganda). So, the left <em>wants</em> convenient truth <em>and</em> one of the most trusted outlets in the English language is <em>on record</em> in supporting convenient truth rather than simply...<em>truth</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. But there <em>is</em> more you need to know. What percentage of Democrats [believe that Russia altered votes?](dailycaller.com/2016/12/27/poll-52-percent-of-democrats-believe-russia-rigged-voting-tallies/) </p>

<p>As problematic as the this particular Obama &quot;birther&quot; thing is, at least it didn&#39;t spill over into the international community and actually assigning baseless blame on a thermonuclear power.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s laziness on the part of people spouting it as fact. </p>

<p>Your first paragraph kinda supports my statement - forgive me I&#39;m not trying to be a dick. Maybe it&#39;s you with a blind hatred (Again, I do see how you can come to that conclusion)? A news agency gets news... then publishes. Does the Washington Post <em>necessarily</em> have to hate Trump in order to report about him? </p>

<p>GG made valid points about the Russia story and actually called Assange a sociopath <em>early last year</em>. So I don&#39;t think this has much to do with whatever their relationship may have been. It&#39;s weird that their is verifiable true information that is being actively suppressed and it&#39;s the people supplying that information that are disassociated from reality and not the people hiding that information. You say myopic, I say he has journalistic integrity. </p>

<p>Every media outlet has done that. It depends on whether or not they did it intentionally. </p>

<p>Its problematic that you can&#39;t know for certain what the intent was when every major outlet repeated ad nauseum for <em>months</em> that 17 agencies blah blah. All it would have taken is a phone call. Why did it take a Congressional hearing to get the truth? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/07/06/trump-criticizes-media-over-alleged-mind-meld-of-17-intelligence-agencies-over-russia-meddling/">www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/07/06/trump-criticizes-media-over-alleged-mind-meld-of-17-intelligence-agencies-over-russia-meddling/</a></p>

<p>Why was the lie repeated for a <em>month</em> <em>after</em> the hearing? </p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not what they said&quot; </p>

<p>You&#39;re right. &quot;Intent&quot; is not a fair word to use. Advocacy, however, <em>is</em> accurate and regarding this specific matter, the distinction is not entirely necessary given that WaPo themselves published the lie and didn&#39;t do their due diligence in maintaining their journalistic integrity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They issued a retraction. And that&#39;s WaPo calling them on it. Are media outlets allowed to make mistakes? The NYT also had Judith Miller pimping the Iraq War. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judith Miller (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator. She worked in The New York Times&#39; Washington bureau before joining Fox News.</p>

<p>Long criticised for the strong anti-Islamic bias in her writing,[1] Miller became embroiled in controversy after her coverage of Iraq&#39;s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion was discovered to have been based on the inaccurate information in the intelligence investigations,[2] particularly those stories that were based on sourcing from the now-disgraced Ahmed Chalabi.[3][4] The New York Times later determined that a number of stories she had written for the paper were inaccurate.[3] According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller&#39;s Iraq reporting &quot;effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist&quot;.[5] Miller acknowledged in The Wall Street Journal on April 4, 2015 that some of her Times coverage was inaccurate, although she had relied on sources she had used numerous times in the past, including those who supplied information for her reporting that had previously won a Pulitzer Prize. She further stated that policymakers and intelligence analysts had relied on the same sources as hers, and that at the time there was broad consensus that Iraq had stockpiles of WMD.[6]</p>

<p>Miller was later involved in the Plame Affair, in which the status of Valerie Plame as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became widely known. When asked to name her sources, Miller invoked reporter&#39;s privilege and refused to reveal her sources in the Central Intelligence Agency leak and spent 85 days in jail protecting her source, Scooter Libby. Miller was forced to resign from her job at The New York Times in November 2005. Later, she was a contributor to the Fox News Channel and a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. On December 29, 2010, numerous media outlets reported that she had signed on as a contributing writer to the conservative magazine Newsmax.</p>

<p>Newspapers screw up. Sometimes a reporter goes rogue and the editors don&#39;t catch it in time. </p>

<p>But compare this process to Sean Hannity at Foxnews. He repeats known falsehoods on his show over and over and over again, often while the straight news department is contradicting him. The organization basically ignores his lies. Do you see how those are different things?</p>

<p>You only have to copy paste the link into a site like archive.is, barely any work and if it&#39;s too much work for some people I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll cut down on low effort content anyways.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can if you click the link. RES shows archive links as an image for some reason (assuming it&#39;s taking the<a href="http://archive.is/kCoK9/image"> image version here</a>). <a href="http://archive.is/kCoK9">For example</a>, here&#39;s an archive of your profile page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I didn&#39;t realize that. It&#39;s not a big deal then. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know that I truly support it because we all have different ideas on what would be grounds to do that, but there&#39;s not really any negatives to it either then. I think if we were going to go this route it would have to be all major publications and not just certain ones. All or nothing. That eliminates any drama like this. </p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be presented as XXX links not allowed though, the specification should be made that only archived links are allowed so that random users who come into the sub don&#39;t think they can&#39;t post anything from the certain sites (censorship). </p>

<p>Honestly we should do a similar boycott of all corporate websites, media or not. I think we can all agree here that the entire existing power structure needs to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few people are making emotional appeals.  </p>

<p>While its true that the given reason cnn links were banned is that cnn threatened to &#39;doxx&#39; a user, this doesn&#39;t make the mod decision to ban cnn links consistent with the non-ban of others.</p>

<p>By banning cnn links, the mods established that certain outlet&#39;s links are subject to banning if they don&#39;t meet some kind of moral criteria.  So what are the moral criteria which ranks &#39;threatening to doxx a troll&#39; as more ban-worthy than &#39;news outlet masquerades as independent journalism while colluding with state power&#39;?  The only criteria which would allow for that are the criteria which state that the only thing to be considered is threatening doxxing.  This criteria is excessively arbitrary and was only established after cnn specifically did that.</p>

<p>Hence, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to accuse the mods of hipocrisy -- they are making up excessively arbitrary rules as they go along to support their political ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well frankly the double standards are on both sides. For example a sizable minority here would defend Trump even if some pretty damning stuff were to come out. THis is wrong.

<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence that supports the fact that the DNC emails were leaked, not hacked. There is evidence that can put Seth in the right place with the right motives to leak.

<p>So you think that the Trump Campaign (and maybe Russia) had the capabilities and influence to fabricate, propagate, and control Seth Rich discussion on 4chan and 8chan (the most chaotic places on the net), Reddit, and among high-level people for over a year, and then decided to use it to their advantage in a relatively &quot;nothing&quot; moment?</p>

<p>If we agree that propaganda is not by definition <em>false</em> we can agree that the truth might have varying degrees of <em>truthiness</em> (more the philosophical sense than the Colbert sense). If we have varying degrees of truth, one of the most respected institutions in America announced their support for deviating from that truth <em>as they deem necessary</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>This right here. Anyone who denounces this report as media whitewashing the Seth Rich conspiracy is not automatically a trump supporter/fox news watcher. The timing of all of this is incredibly suspect, with the Awan arrest and a major non-MSM investigative story coming out in the next few days from OANN. Just because a news organization was told to run a story by the president 9 whole months late, one which obviously benefits the republican party, does not mean that it&#39;s fake. It just means someone saw a way to capitalize politically on the death of a civilian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from a reputable outlet. This is the Editorial board espousing their support of propaganda, where that propaganda happens is irrelevant. This is indicative of the values in place at the Post. </p>

<p>If we agree that propaganda is not by definition <em>false</em> we can agree that the truth might have varying degrees of <em>truthiness</em> (more the philosophical sense than the Colbert sense). If we have varying degrees of truth, one of the most respected institutions in America announced their support for deviating from that truth <em>as they deem necessary</em>. Even if operating within those confines of <em>acceptable truth</em>, they have stated their willingness to abandon their pursuit of what is the <em>most</em> true. That so few seem to see the problem is more than troubling. </p>
