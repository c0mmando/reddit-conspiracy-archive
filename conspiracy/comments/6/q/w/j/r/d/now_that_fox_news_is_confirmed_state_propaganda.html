       I could say the same about your claim that it's not true. But if semantics are that important to you, then direct links to CNN are banned because of their alleged threats to dox a Reddit user

       According to CNN it the sentence taken as threatening was put in during editing for legal reasons. The authors explanation is that the line meant to signify CNN did not come to any agreement with Han, that not revealing his identity was thier choice. CNN also stated talking to Han after the story that he never felt threatened and agreed with CNNs perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Han deleted his reddit account so there is no way for him to make a statement outside CNN without raising the possibility of being ousted. Unfortunately this means CNN is the only source of info. So it's either a big misunderstanding or they threatened him and then posted lies about him.

        "CNN is not publishing 'HanA**holeSolo's' name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again," CNN said in its story. "In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same."

       As someone else in this thread stated, that statement is more of a disclaimer than a threat. A threat would be, "CNN will publish his identity should any of that change".

       Subbing a synonym doesn't change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings up no points I'm not already familiar with nor does it do anything to change what was physically written by CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people aren't deluded in thinking there is a right to anonymity. That doesn't change that it was very clearly, without a doubt, a threat to dox. They have every right to dox the user, but it doesn't make them less shitty. The creator of a fucking meme isn't national news no matter how badly some want to paint it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This opinion piece is also incredibly partisan. I'm not a trump supporter or a conservative, I'm a very liberal democrat. This was bipartisan outrage.

       ??? They did not do it out of the goodness of their hearts to protect people from a "terrible racist". That is hiding behind a trope for creepy behavior. The guy had antisemitic stuff on his account, and this was used as a defense.

       Why do you think CNN would even care about a single meme about them? There are millions of them out there. This is a billion dollar corporation. They don't care that some kid made a meme. The story was that the president was retweeting a racist. It should be obvious why CNN would want to push this angle. And it was a lot more than just antisemitic stuff.

       They never claimed that the account was him 100% only that reddit users allege that it is.

       I think it's different to report on a something some people believe (while implicitly stating it's the beliefs of some reddit users) than to threaten a user with revealing their identity because they made some content they don't like.

       Fox is shitty propaganda, but because they didn't have the malicious intent CNN did in that case I really disagree that they did more than CNN.

       Listen man, we have to protect these delicate freethinkers. Ideas have been proven to be more dangerous than the government themselves, so there is only one possible solution. Quit looking at links that people don't like, actually don't look at links at all. The whole internet is a vast right wing conspiracy and we are all just machines crafted by the Creator of the Universe. We each have our specialized role. I'm a broken thinking machine after all, I can only see things through the reality I know. Our duty as machines is to soley get a reaction from the only machine with free will using YouTube video, 4chan posts, Dailycaller, and Fox news.

       Honestly we should realize that people will always post bullshit on here, they are doing it in droves on both sides. We have to all start acting more like Bill Cooper and do our research and prove things through the research. We shouldn't be scared of leaving our bubble to look at inflammatory, dangerous, or down right false information because how else will we learn to decipher the bullshit from the jewels. We need to quit acting like we are fucking children whose ears need to be protected.

       I'm wondering what the precendent is for OP's decision? We've never banned direct links to any establishment because of the integrity of the content they push. If that were the case, CNN would have been blocked years ago. If we're banning state propaganda by all means add The Washington Podesta to the list.

       There is no rational to how they didn't, it's just a talking point you'll see over and over with no explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be they didn't dox, but then people pointed out that threatening to dox unless the person acts a certain way is just as bad. Now it's that they didn't threaten either.

       according to the articles (on cnns site) they did threaten because "CNN is not publishing "HanA**holeSolo's" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology"
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldnt that boil down to blackmail?
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically i suppose it wasnt a dox because they never released the info, but how is that not in the least a threat to do so if theyre demands (apology) werent met.
      </p>

       Of course cnn is going to say they didnt threaten anyone, why would they?

       Still seeing a distinct lack of literally any sort of proof of your claim. Which I guess makes sense because you're lying, but still, don't draw attention to the fact that you have nothing to prove what you claim and can't even quote them saying what you claim they said.

       Lol why are you calling it private? They are publicly viewable comments posted on a public forum. They literally figured out who he was based solely on his public Reddit comments. That is not at all private.

       Again, they are fully within their rights to publish his name, and they have chosen not to.

       You are missing the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       His personal identity, which you refer to as "private information," was able to be discovered through Reddit comments alone. He surrendered that information freely and publicly. If he were posting the same shit on his FB account, everyone would already know his name. As it is, CNN has not released his name, and he gave his apology preemptively and because he realized his rhetoric might actually have consequences, and he couldn't handle them.

       Posting racist garbage becomes national news when it's retweeted by the president.

       Believe whatever you want man. The bottom line is he issued his apology prior to any contact with CNN, and he himself initiated that contact.

       The President tweets a meme. CNN, doing journalism, discovers who made the meme. The creator then realizes CNN can figure out who he is and discover the horrible racist shit he's been posting. The creator then called CNN and begged them not to post his identity, and posts his pathetic blabbering apology. CNN at no point threatened to dox him. He's just a cowardly internet racist that didn't want to be exposed.

       Every outlet has some kind of agenda but this is literally Big Brother stuff. Fake News created by the executive branch to cover up a different conspiracy.

       I have personally never seen collusion of this magnitude in any mainstream media source. Usually it's a shitty or biased journalist who makes something up or stretches the truth. But this is literally an example of  state-sponsored doublespeak/doublethink created to make us all forget the real news and argue over and focus on a random, trivial incident

       There's many different levels of wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN for all of its faults generally holds its actual reporters to standards for fact checking and truthfulness. Last month when they got a story wrong, CNN forced the three employees involved to resign....... Because that's how it's supposed to work if you're in the news business. Same with Dan Rather at CBS, when he got the story about bush wrong he resigned because that's how important getting your facts straight is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When was the last time anyone from Fox News resigned for getting facts wrong, or just flat out making shit up? To my knowledge, never....... And they're constantly getting things wrong and making shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Hannity going to resign over this? I doubt it........ O'Reilly never did for making shit up, Glen Beck was a raging maniac spewing bullshit for years with no consequences, and Hannity has never seemed to care about the truth either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be one standard that we hold everyone to, this business of holding different things to different standards is bullshit.

       Everyone from the Trump camp goes on, and on, and on about "fake news"........ When it's been very clear for a long time that Fox News is nothing more than a conservative republican propaganda tool for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been caught so many times skewing facts it's not even funny. They were also caught taking talking points from the Bush White House, and whenever one of their "reporters" gets caught they defend the lies by claiming they're a "commentator" not a lawyer so the dont need to be factually correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so transparent what's going on here. This is all part of a massive plan to make the American public stop trusting any news source other than the right wing conservative sources...... Then the only official truth left is going to be the truth that Trump hands to you. And we all know that when it comes to truth, Trump really struggles with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone needs to wake up and look at this objectively, this is 1984 level shit.

       As a Democrat, I know that most of what you just said is true. Its also not limited to the right or to conservative news. There are legitimate reasons "fake news" caught on and denying those is taking us to 1984.

       They bring up a valid argument. For years now the Republican Party has been propagating conspiracy theories designed for political gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones went after Obama for years while leaving the Republicans alone. Donald Trump drove the "birther" bandwagon, which really was the beginning of his 2016 political campaign when you think about it....... It's where he recruited his base. That's why when the news cycle isn't in his favour, or if he's having a bad day he immediately starts attacking the Clinton's....... It's a distraction and it's throwing some red meat to the base that he carefully developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not limited to the political right, but the political right puts out 95% of it and is completely unashamed about doing it. And when the left gets it wrong, they generally do the right thing and people lose their jobs over it....... I'll guarantee you that Hannity will still be employed by Fox News after this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to compare the left and the right in terms of "fake news" is a false equivilency. There's one side putting out 95% of the fake news, and that's also the same side that's trying to discredit any news source other than themselves.

       It is a valid point. I believe I said I agree. The left does push conspiracies too though. Here's the dangerous thing: they come from outlets you already trust. The currency of news is credibility and the reputable outlets cash that in from time to time but
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       (the average Democrat) don't realize it because you already trust them.

       The better question is how many times has the NYT or WaPo printed something that was factually incorrect in order to score political points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is arguing that various media sources can be slanted to differing degrees, we've already gone over that. The primary difference is that the vast majority of flat out, completely unsubstantiated bullshit is coming from one side and it's often presented as fact....... That's the issue here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Editorial content is one thing, but presenting editorial content or politically driven lies as news is an entirely different thing...... And taking talking points and pushing damaging conspiracy theories is on a totally different level again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other issue here is how different sources respond when they get caught lying or getting facts wrong. When has Fox News or Alex Jones dismissed an employee for this? To my knowledge, never. 
When CNN's Donna Brazille was caught giving debate questions to the DNC, that was it for her employment....... Is Hannity going to resign? Is Hannity having supper with Trump appropriate behaviour for a journalist? Did anyone from Fox News resign for taking talking points from the Bush Administration? No, yes and no.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an obvious double standard in terms of journalistic integrity, and thus and obvious false equivilency.

       Let's say fake news can be measured - I truly don't think the
       <em>
        danger
       </em>
       in fake news should be measured by quantity or number of errors rather that it should be measured by how many people it reaches. Infowars has nothing on USA Today by readership. So when USA Today prints a lie from Politifact they are making making PF an authority and making an appeal to that authority and suggesting a preponderance of evidence as well as argumentum ad populum - and in some cases, you are forced to conclude that is deliberate. Repeat this daily for a year across the 20 widest reaching media outlets in the English language and suddenly... What did Goebbles say? And not a trivial amount of that is conspiracy theory. But
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       wouldn't call it a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a discussion earlier today with someone in the Wikileaks sub regarding NPRs coverage of the Seth Rich. NPR stated (paraphrase) that the Rich conspiracy theory was perpetuated by Assange's "cryptic" messages. Interestingly, that is itself a conspiracy theory, yet NPR pushed it as a way of discrediting Assange. But the average Democrat isn't going to pick up on that because it fits a narrative. This example is only to show that this happens under the average nose and they are completely unaware that it even happened.

       WaPo, yesterday, actually went on record advocating the use of propaganda. That post in /politics got some 5k upvotes (clearly supporting the practice). I shared that link here for 13 upvotes (presumably condemning propaganda). So, the left
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       convenient truth
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       one of the most trusted outlets in the English language is
       <em>
        on record
       </em>
       in supporting convenient truth rather than simply...
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       .

       All anyone needs to do is look at how many people think Obama is a Muslim ( around 30% ) and how many think he was born in Kenya ( around 20% ) to see how many people are being influenced by flat out right wing bullshit. Bearing in mind, that it's around 40%-50% of Republicans that think he's not an American citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all you need to know. There's little to no actual evidence that Obama isn't an American citizen, and yet right wing media has convinced nearly half of Republican supporters that it's a fact.

       Agreed. But there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       more you need to know. What percentage of Democrats [believe that Russia altered votes?](dailycaller.com/2016/12/27/poll-52-percent-of-democrats-believe-russia-rigged-voting-tallies/)

       As problematic as the this particular Obama "birther" thing is, at least it didn't spill over into the international community and actually assigning baseless blame on a thermonuclear power. Still, I blame Fox for the BS from the left. It's escalation. I've argued myself for a Fox from the left. Now I know how stupid I was.

       Assange's laziness or the media reporting it?  Assange is so blinded by HRC hate and Obama admin hate that he can't even see what he's doing or maybe he can and is being paid handsomely for it - those pamela anderson vip visits didn't come cheap and I'm guessing he didn't pay for them.

       and this one - GG was sucking assange's dick for so long that he couldn't separate out his bullshit from reality, he's starting to separate himself now and coming around to other points of view and looking objectively at russian machinations but he was pretty myopic for a good bit of the election and runup.

       It's laziness on the part of people spouting it as fact.

      <p>
       Your first paragraph kinda supports my statement - forgive me I'm not trying to be a dick. Maybe it's you with a blind hatred (Again, I do see how you can come to that conclusion)? A news agency gets news... then publishes. Does the Washington Post
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       have to hate Trump in order to report about him?
      </p>
      <p>
       GG made valid points about the Russia story and actually called Assange a sociopath
       <em>
        early last year
       </em>
       . So I don't think this has much to do with whatever their relationship may have been. It's weird that their is verifiable true information that is being actively suppressed and it's the people supplying that information that are disassociated from reality and not the people hiding that information. You say myopic, I say he has journalistic integrity.

       accurate and regarding this specific matter, the distinction is not entirely necessary given that WaPo themselves published the lie and didn't do their due diligence in maintaining their journalistic integrity.

       They issued a retraction. And that's WaPo calling them on it. Are media outlets allowed to make mistakes? The NYT also had Judith Miller pimping the Iraq War.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Judith Miller (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator. She worked in The New York Times' Washington bureau before joining Fox News.
       </p>
       <p>
        Long criticised for the strong anti-Islamic bias in her writing,[1] Miller became embroiled in controversy after her coverage of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion was discovered to have been based on the inaccurate information in the intelligence investigations,[2] particularly those stories that were based on sourcing from the now-disgraced Ahmed Chalabi.[3][4] The New York Times later determined that a number of stories she had written for the paper were inaccurate.[3] According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller's Iraq reporting "effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist".[5] Miller acknowledged in The Wall Street Journal on April 4, 2015 that some of her Times coverage was inaccurate, although she had relied on sources she had used numerous times in the past, including those who supplied information for her reporting that had previously won a Pulitzer Prize. She further stated that policymakers and intelligence analysts had relied on the same sources as hers, and that at the time there was broad consensus that Iraq had stockpiles of WMD.[6]
       </p>
       <p>
        Miller was later involved in the Plame Affair, in which the status of Valerie Plame as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became widely known. When asked to name her sources, Miller invoked reporter's privilege and refused to reveal her sources in the Central Intelligence Agency leak and spent 85 days in jail protecting her source, Scooter Libby. Miller was forced to resign from her job at The New York Times in November 2005. Later, she was a contributor to the Fox News Channel and a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. On December 29, 2010, numerous media outlets reported that she had signed on as a contributing writer to the conservative magazine Newsmax.

       Newspapers screw up. Sometimes a reporter goes rogue and the editors don't catch it in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But compare this process to Sean Hannity at Foxnews. He repeats known falsehoods on his show over and over and over again, often while the straight news department is contradicting him. The organization basically ignores his lies. Do you see how those are different things?

       Of course you are done. Proving someone intentionally did something according to higher ups is a positive claim
       <em>

       It's not really about the trump camp, look a little deeper and it's pretty much anyone who has gotten in to conspiracy theories in the last couple years, vs people who have been around different communities for a long while.

       It's an insanely confusing time for a couple generations that basically had the future they were promised and prepared for ripped away from them.  Trust has been shattered in many spheres of life that had been largely stable for generations.

      <p>
       I believe a lot of them are just doing the best they know how in an era that so many are unable to cope with, but a lot of them are still clinging hard to the way life used to be before the economic crash. Looking backwards instead of looking forward.

      </p>
      <p>
       But now that he's in office, it should be abundantly clear what he's all about. He is an incompetent bullshitter that's doing everything he was criticizing Hillary for when he was campaigning. So if they don't want to open their eyes and look at his actions, that's their fault.

       Conspiracy itself being used a political weapon -- by the same party who wished for the "new Pearl Harbor" right before 9-11. The same party who "fixed" the intelligence on WMDs by stealing a college thesis and changing it up, pretending it was intelligence. The actual intelligence community wasn't wrong about the WMDs, the Republicans in power (and fake Labor Tony Blair) lied about it.

       Well, you can just make it to where people can only post archive images of the article instead of a direct link. So that way youre not helping there site traffic?

       I suppose so, but that's a lot more work for posters and you can't follow any links the article has (assuming, since it's an image). I get what you're saying though. I guess it would also help prevent people paid to post from posting here.
      </p>

       I just think if we continue this way we won't be able to post anything directly.

       You only have to copy paste the link into a site like archive.is, barely any work and if it's too much work for some people I'm sure it'll cut down on low effort content anyways.

       You can if you click the link. RES shows archive links as an image for some reason (assuming it's taking the

        image version here

       Interesting, I didn't realize that. It's not a big deal then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't know that I truly support it because we all have different ideas on what would be grounds to do that, but there's not really any negatives to it either then. I think if we were going to go this route it would have to be all major publications and not just certain ones. All or nothing. That eliminates any drama like this.

       It shouldn't be presented as XXX links not allowed though, the specification should be made that only archived links are allowed so that random users who come into the sub don't think they can't post anything from the certain sites (censorship).

       If being sued would publicize your name to thousands of people, and those people were crazy against you, you wouldn't laugh it off.

       for it to be a threat, CNN would have had to contact HanAssholeSolo
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       he made his apology. They didn't. HanAsshole called CNN after issuing his apology.
      </p>
      <p>
       you guys should really cut it out with this line of argument, lol. Next time CNN gets involved in a story like this they're gonna tell themselves, "well, being nice to that one guy got us nothing but shit, so let's just publish the name this time".

       In order for it to be a threat, the threat has to come
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       the thing that they're threatening. The dude realized he was caught, apologized, and deleted his account after CNN reached out to him but
       <strong>
        before any response
       </strong>
       . CNN said "hey, do you have any comment on your shit" and he said "oh fuck I'm gonna run and hide". Then CNN said "okay, this dude seems genuinely apologetic so we aren't going to release his real name, but if he starts this shit up again (thus proving he wasn't actually apologetic) then we just want to make sure that everyone knows we didn't give up our right to publish this guy's name."

       you're making it too complicated for these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you call your mom while she's away, and say, "I did all of my chores!"
      </p>
      <p>
       She says, "Okay, great, thank you! You can buy a game from steam if you'd like, since you were a good kid."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what exactly would that mom would do if she found out that the kid was lying about doing their chores? Probably revoke her gift, right? Or would that be
       <em>
        threatening
       </em>
       the kid with
       <em>
        coercion
       </em>
       unless he did his chores?
      </p>
      <p>
       imo, one of those two sounds waaay dumber than the other.

       Actually the lies were about the memer being a minor whos name was released, ending up in him being beaten up.  None of which was true but it was endlessly repeated after the story dropped, drowning out any real developments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, good grief, the line that got everyone so scared wasn't even formatted in with the article.  It was seperated out underneath it where retractions and legal issues are placed on an article.

       I'm not making that argument, I'm simply explaining why the community decided to ban direct links. If you want to start a discussion on using other criteria to ban direct links, then start a thread and I'll contribute. I won't defend Fox News because I think they're shit too, and I have no problem with using archived links for all MSM outlets

       That's literally what you said.... If fox did this, I would agree with you.... Dude, the WH is caught colluding and you complain about a threat to dox (which they didn't do). Reserving a right is not a threat. I reserve the right to cancel your gym membership if you don't pay me -&gt; you change the agreement, I cut you off. Same exact thing. Stop compensating for collusion. Fox is not good just because CNN has sensationalist tendencies

       Very few people are making emotional appeals.
      </p>
      <p>
       While its true that the given reason cnn links were banned is that cnn threatened to 'doxx' a user, this doesn't make the mod decision to ban cnn links consistent with the non-ban of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       By banning cnn links, the mods established that certain outlet's links are subject to banning if they don't meet some kind of moral criteria.  So what are the moral criteria which ranks 'threatening to doxx a troll' as more ban-worthy than 'news outlet masquerades as independent journalism while colluding with state power'?  The only criteria which would allow for that are the criteria which state that the only thing to be considered is threatening doxxing.  This criteria is excessively arbitrary and was only established after cnn specifically did that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, it's perfectly reasonable to accuse the mods of hipocrisy -- they are making up excessively arbitrary rules as they go along to support their political ideology.

       If the lawsuit is found in the investigators favor, then it absolutely confirms that they're state propaganda. Did you read what the lawsuit is about? The Rich family's investigated has insinuated that Trump read the article about the Seth Rich and demanded it be published. Media shouldn't be sharing articles to be approved or disproved by Trump, or any other world leader for that matter.

       Well frankly the double standards are on both sides. For example a sizable minority here would defend Trump even if some pretty damning stuff were to come out. THis is wrong. But this goes with those on the left protecting obviously corrupt people. There are all sorts of double standards because we are so damned polarized these days. It sucks.

       Ok, I think we all agree Trump is a wildcard (among other things) and I do agree the MSM is up the corporatocracies ass. However, Trump trying to bully through an agenda unlawfully and having partial success isn't showing very much of a pattern (Muslim ban anyone?)

       The voicemail said "the white house". Plenty of people work in there. They've certainly fired enough people already. They should just pick one of them to throw under the bus and claim they were proactive before the lawsuit was filed. At least that's what a capable, intelligent administration would do. So they'll probably do the opposite.

       First of all, no, it doesn't 'disprove' the entire premise--you don't know who started the theory and gave fuel to it. However, the issue isn't the

       It's not legitimate because there's literally zero evidence of any of it, and now we're finding out that the circumstantial 'evidence' was also fabricated.

       There's plenty of evidence that supports the fact that the DNC emails were leaked, not hacked. There is evidence that can put Seth in the right place with the right motives to leak. There are people who claim to have been contacted by Seth. There is enough there to warrant air time. Not to mention all of the evidence of mob-like behavior by the DNC, corruption, rigging.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many unanswered questions.

       So you think that the Trump Campaign (and maybe Russia) had the capabilities and influence to fabricate, propagate, and control Seth Rich discussion on 4chan and 8chan (the most chaotic places on the net), Reddit, and among high-level people for over a year, and then decided to use it to their advantage in a relatively "nothing" moment?

       So you think that The Trump White House (or Russia maybe) is so powerful it can entirely control the narrative on 4chan, easily the most chaotic place on the internet, and Reddit for over a year? And then waits until May 2016 to get the media to do any reporting on their false narrative?

       You are creating a parallel between fox news and this sub because they discuss the same thing. But they are not state media because of what they discuss, and no one claimed so. So you are either being dumb or purposefully trying to muddy the point with whataboutism.

       This becomes a question of censorship v. free speech. I believe that censorship for the most part is not constructive. HOWEVER. Fox News is actual state propaganda. I don't think that directly positing articles here is going to be worth a damn as it's simply full of state approved bullshit. I do think that we need to allow direct links however. I think that we should have the opportunity to dissect state propaganda and have discussions of the states role in the media. I think direct links allow for comment sections that spur these critical discussions.

       There is a paid slide going on in this subreddit to push the 'Seth Rich is FAKE NEWS' narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy seeing a subreddit push a story about gov and media colluding to create a conspiracy theory, when this very subreddit has been discussing the conspiracy theory well before it was picked up by Fox.

       It's a tactic to change the narrative. It's now becoming that the story "originated" on Fox.  Even though there is mountains of proof that Fox picked up on a story months after it was being discussed and considered a conspiracy/assassination.

       Wait, so when Fox News retracts a story, you progressives want to ban it, but when WaPo and NYT had to retract Russian narrative stories, you guys sing a different tune?

      <p>
       No you guys are just making a joke out of this because it infuriates you guys that CNN could be put on notice. The sickest part is you guys pretend to be indignant about "using" Seth Rich. Bullshit. Go back to r/politics and leftypol.

        Butowsky weighs in: "One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say." Later, according to the recordings transcribed in the suit, Butowsky acknowledges Wheeler hadn't made any claims of personal knowledge about emails between Rich and WikiLeaks. "I know that's not true," Butowsky says. "If I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that."

       There are only two political issues people should be prioritizing, because these two issues will solve nearly all of the other problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be vocally anti-war.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be vocally pro-transparency of government.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Any conversation that is taking place in the news is merely a distraction to cover up the corruption in government that is protected by secrecy.

       So they were advocating for U.S. propaganda

       Not from a reputable outlet. This is the Editorial board espousing their support of propaganda, where that propaganda happens is irrelevant. This is indicative of the values in place at the Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we agree that propaganda is not by definition
       <em>
        false
       </em>
       we can agree that the truth might have varying degrees of
       <em>
        truthiness
       </em>
       (more the philosophical sense than the Colbert sense). If we have varying degrees of truth, one of the most respected institutions in America announced their support for deviating from that truth
       <em>
        as they deem necessary
       </em>
       . Even if operating within those confines of
       <em>
        acceptable truth
       </em>
       , they have stated their willingness to abandon their pursuit of what is the
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       true. That so few seem to see the problem is more than troubling.

       This right here. Anyone who denounces this report as media whitewashing the Seth Rich conspiracy is not automatically a trump supporter/fox news watcher. The timing of all of this is incredibly suspect, with the Awan arrest and a major non-MSM investigative story coming out in the next few days from OANN. Just because a news organization was told to run a story by the president 9 whole months late, one which obviously benefits the republican party, does not mean that it's fake. It just means someone saw a way to capitalize politically on the death of a civilian.

       Yes because as we all know, economics, social inequality and climate change are flat out irrelevant. Like, just to name a few things that would of course be fixed by just being antiwar and having transparent governments. It's not like they are nuanced, real problems that plague modern societies, not at all...

       Gore Fisker scandal for example = environmentalism used as a cover for corruption. $500 million for a few cars to be built in Finland and for Gore to keep the proceeds.

       Uh huh I'm sure you do within the capacity that you are allowed to by the mods. How many articles on the fact that it seems like every week another member of the trump team is found to have russian ties? But noooo lets focus on  seth rich an already debunked story that has now been found to have the presidents fingers in it.

       How about all MSM media sites are banned and only archived versions of the links are allowed? Makes sense anyways since it would keep the version of the story the same in the link, and keep the story up and available if any media orgs take it down.

       Most of the people on here have no idea they have been trolled by Trumps team with this story.  It is really sad that Trump who is "not so smart" and "an evil person" could pull such a good one.  You will hear soon enough.  You should delete and save face because this will go down in the Troll hall of fame.

       A conversation about the revelations that came to light today is necessary to continue a productive discussion about the role of censorship in this subreddit.  Since there were already 20-30 posts on the topic, providing additional context would prove repetitive.   Wouldn't you agree?

       If the lawsuit is found in the investigators favor, then it absolutely confirms that they're state propaganda. Did you read what the lawsuit is about? The Rich family's investigated has insinuated that Trump read the article about the Seth Rich and demanded it be published. Media shouldn't be sharing articles to be approved or disproved by Trump, or any other world leader for that matter.

       First of all, no, it doesn't 'disprove' the entire premise--you don't know who started the theory and gave fuel to it. However, the issue isn't the
       <em>
        invention
       </em>
       of the theory, it's the
       <em>
        propagation

       of it. That is what the  NPR article is talking about, the promotion of this story from conspiracy status to being broadcast on Fox News.

       Not from a reputable outlet. This is the Editorial board espousing their support of propaganda, where that propaganda happens is irrelevant. This is indicative of the values in place at the Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we agree that propaganda is not by definition
       <em>
        false
       </em>
       we can agree that the truth might have varying degrees of
       <em>
        truthiness
       </em>
       (more the philosophical sense than the Colbert sense). If we have varying degrees of truth, one of the most respected institutions in America announced their support for deviating from that truth
       <em>
        as they deem necessary
       </em>
       . Even if operating within those confines of
       <em>
        acceptable truth
       </em>
       , they have stated their willingness to abandon their pursuit of what is the
       <em>
