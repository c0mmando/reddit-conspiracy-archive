       They literally ban people simply for making conservative arguments ESPECIALLY if those arguments involve logic and empiricism and get attention. How are they able to get away with this and still masquerade as being unbiased and a place for political discourse? It's obvious the intention of that place is to convince normies that the overwhelming popular opinion is authoritarian and "liberal," and they do this by banning any arguments that go against authority and neo-liberalism while promoting shills and bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun story: There was an account spamming that wikileaks had released false emails and he claimed to "work in cyber security and IT" but then I asked him if he knew how email cryptographic verification worked and he said it was easily fooled and then proceeded to call me a Russian dis-info agent and tell me that he "worked for his country," which basically means he admitted to being a paid shill. I reported him but he wasnt banned.

       When it switched overnight from being essentially pro Bernie and anti Hillary to propaganda for Hillary I unsubbed. It was so blatantly obvious.

       The there was the day after the election when it returned to normal cause they didn't think they would need to pay people to lie about them. That didn't last. Creepy and obvious as fuck.

       Possibly due to TPTB not having a social media damage limitation plan for the unexpected election result. Shills had no guidance so stepped away from the usual conversation manipulation.

       The numbers do not add up. I saw it firsthand, but that can be considered anecdotal, but the raw data you cannot overlook. Politics doesn't represent this data at all. The majority of reddit are millennials, 75%+, the majority of millennials support Sanders and his policies, similar numbers 75%+. Anything that speaks of Bernie or of his policies should be upvoted, that isn't the case at all.

       Then wikileaks and then pizzagate. Now alls left is "why did obama meet with alefantis in the whitehouse?"

       I've been thinking recently, looking at how formulaic posts on the_donald are (I do agree with some of their views, but you can't say that that subreddit is the place to find intelligent discourse when 90% of the posts are less than 10 words).... I've been thinking, do you know how AI chatbots learn? Like how they taught Tay-Tay to be racist?
      </p>
      <p>
       They just learn phrases and responses and stuff based on what other people have said. Then when someone asks them a question or something, they just give a similar response to what someone else said before. Now, if you go to cleverbot or a similar chat robot, and you open 2 tabs, and copy+paste the responses back and forth, it's a eerily humanlike conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So really, when I look at a board like Politics or The_donald, that's all I see. Even if there are a lot of humans there, they're just conditioned to give the same responses like they're robots. It's just really weird. Just a bunch of programmed responses to each other, manufactured so that outsiders looking in are fooled into thinking this is real.

       Boilerplate Trump disses and I assume that you could program a bot to comment common jokes as well. I havent actually been able to prove anyone is a bot per se but it looks suspicious when that is all a certain account posts. Shills on the otherhand are blatant and obvious and it's not inconceivable and likely probable that there are sort of hybrids that when responded to alert a user so that human responses can be incorporated. It's best not to underestimate your adversary and so i can only assume their techniques are getting more sophisticated each day.

        Fun story: There was an account spamming that wikileaks had released false emails and he claimed to "work in cyber security and IT" but then I asked him if he knew how email cryptographic verification worked and he said it was easily fooled and then proceeded to call me a Russian dis-info agent and tell me that he "worked for his country," which basically means he admitted to being a paid shill. I reported him but he wasnt banned.

       Not as fun a story as I was hoping for, someone saying their a shill doesn't mean they are telling the truth.. Nor does it prove they are shills in any way shape or form, you want a mod to ban someone based on the off chance they weren't lying? Do you really think shills would be going around telling people they are shills? Unless of course it's a double bluff, ah ha, say they are shills so people don't think they are.. Or maybe it's a triple bluff..

       Pretty much all of the big subs are bad. Reddit is terribly designed for discussion, the upvote system naturally creates hiveminds where popularity wins out over correctness and low effort contributions are rewarded more than high effort is.

       Just go to the goddamn sub.  It's blatant and routine.  You'll also find a lot of screenshots on T_D of people getting banned from /politics for mundane posts that don't tow the current narrative.  Your Devil's Advocacy is obnoxious and suspicious.

I was banned a week ago without explanation after making a few logical points that got a moderate amount of attention even though being downvoted to hell, and I didnt break the rules of the sub. A lot of the comments people make there break the rules of the sub but they are making fun of conservatives so then their incivility is ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because subreddit's are ran by users, and those users can run it pretty much how they please.
R/politics seems to be an "official" sub or something and seems to have administration all the way from the top. Ofc I can't prove it but the amount of traffic, fake or not, would logically get attention from corporate. If it really is ran by some random users then they are certainly receiving promotion from corporate, and it is not called r/liberalpolitics  but instead tries to falsely bill itself as unbiased just from the name alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Err... Reddit is mostly young people, young people are more likely to be liberal, it's not hard to put two and two together here.
There are plenty of anti authoritarian young people and r/politics is ALL about authority. The people that want the government to prosecute hate speech and whatnot are a VOCAL minority.
       </p>
       <p>
        and they do this by banning any arguments that go against authority and neo-liberalism while promoting shills and bots.
I'm just commenting from my own experience mostly but it's very obvious that sub is infested with bots and shills just look for yourself. Anyone with half a brain and time can deduce as much.
       </p>
       <p>
        Do you really think shills would be going around telling people they are shills? 
This guy ACCIDENTALLY let it slip that he "worked for his country" and was trying to say he works in IT security which to me seems very likely to have been from a paid shill when you take into account human psychology. It's anecdotal.

       Lying isnt ethical although ofc im not saying there should be a law against it or something but it's bad because normies think theyre looking at an organic and unbiased sub. R/politics is trying to convince people that the majority of reddit posters support authoritarianism and the neo-liberal agenda. This inspires false group think and "If i cant beat them I might as well join them" behavior. Although it's obvious what is going on to anyone with experience on the internet and deduction capabilities.

       It's bad though because like i keep saying, r/politics is a psyop targeting normies that casually get onto reddit just to take a peak at cat pictures and possibly see what is going on politically. It's like a false narrative. I hate authoritarianism but when things like this occur they deserve exposure, but somehow I feel like its improbable mainstream media would cover such a story.

       How about: Politics is a sub meant to make new and casual users of reddit believe the world universally loves H.Clinton, nothing bad is happening with them but nothing BUT bad things is happening with the currently sitting President (often when said President has nothing to do with it, like rebranding everything the military or other groups do as "Trump's This-and-That and how awful it is", and usually even that is a lie or misrepresented like saying X happeneded when in reality Y happened but X was mentioned in an unrelated manner.

       It's true, though. A very large percentage of the conversation (&gt;50% is my personal feeling) is fake. Media Matters has owned that subreddit completely for at least a year. They are very obviously 'home base' for ShareBlue and formerly CTR.

       Nothing. I go over and kill some karna every now and then. If you ask them for facts or point out their hypocrisy they stop responding and only downvote you. All of Reddit has become so strange, I recently switched to iOS and the official Reddit app won't let me filter out subs that Reddit is fun did on Android. So now I see the Trump spam and other bs subs. I hate that the conversations I used to have on politics are gone. For instances, I have no problem with gays serving openly, I served 8 years and ran a large avionics shop. My 2 best workers were lesbian and I would rather work with them to get a job done then the men in my shop. I hated sick bay commandos, people who stubbed their toe and had to go to medical. We had a lot of these people too. They didn't affect readiness because I didn't count on then at all, they weren't bad people, they were just useless in my eyes. Every trans person I've ever met seems to have just come from the doctor or is telling me about their next appointment, and really wants to tell about them. But here's where I think the American people really get screwed by letting trans serve. These people will go to medical for everything, which I should have done. I worked in really dangerous places I.e war zone, carrier flight deck, test cell, air refueling, but I never went to medical for anything and got out with 0% disabled, in the VA's eyes I almost didn't serve. Some trans that goes to medical all the time, build up their VA percentage and would probably take about 2 years to get 100%, which means 100% medical and dental for life, including paying for their transition. Then they can get out and be interviewed to CNN about how they honorably served. I know people really fucked up from serving their country who only get 20 or 30% and people who never did shit get 100%.

       My opinion, but a few years ago I could have this discussion over at politics. If I posted that opinion over there now, I'd be compared to Hitler slaughtering the Jews for not standing up to trans rights.

       Hmm the medical thing seems like a consequence of the public sector IMO. What do you think about hypothetically privatizing military aviation? Also what kind of aircraft did you work on?

       What kind of aircraft? Also, dont you think that the medical thing is a consequence of the public sector more than a sexuality issue? And how do you feel about privatizing the military, especially things like maintenance?

       I was AIMD, so I worked mostly on components from aircraft, so I could say all of them. I also worked on a system called buddy stores, air-to-air refueling, so I spent some time on the flight deck, fucking nuts is the best way to describe it. Testing engines on a test cell was also fun and crazy too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long term medical is never considered in the debates I've heard, just the first while active. I don't know the right answer, as I'm sure some trans will be great solders, but it seems like a stupid debate to be honest as it's such a small percentage. The military is and needs to be mission based, not a barometer for social change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I served from 91 - 98, and the F-18 seemed like a disposable aircraft, by that I mean we sent most parts on to depot (manufacturing) or tossed and replaced. The F-14 were my favorite to look at and watch fly, but least favorite to fix. The older helos had to leak to fly, if it wasn't leaking, it was out of fluid. So it seems with more advanced electronics more mainframe will be privatized, but not all.

       It's pretty much OVER for r/politics (just like r/news became a useless tool).  Last year they began removing content and changed their rules drastically, which included discontinuing "self-post saturdays."  The mods and jr. mods even went back months to remove posts/links (this affected searches more than anything).  I have no proof of this--but I'm pretty sure other users or mods of this sub will back me up on this (regarding the removals).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the original post which r/politics made to discontinue self-post saturdays--they said they might bring them back after the election (never happened).  I think that was in April or May 2016.

       There is a difference between liberal and neo liberal. Also try posting a comment supporting a left wing policy like single payer Healthcare. That's a ban. Not only is politics fucked but the entirety of reddit is dying. Or more like being murdered by corporate power. Don't make this a partisan thing.

       All very strange labels. Liberal is not neo liberal. Just like conservative is not neo conservative. Neo liberal and neo con are very similar to one another. As in crooked sell outs to the military industrial complex.

       I missed that one but I could definitely see that happening. Most people here are more concerned with having an opinion counter to the mainstream, whether or not it makes any sense at all is immaterial as long as it's "alternative" lol.

       The primary source of readers for r/politics is r/news. r/news's ranking in the has a habit of sudden jumps from the vicinity of r/gifs and r/gaming to the vicinity of r/askreddit and r/funny. It happened last week and again this weeks. Perhaps its a demographic artifact driven by the behavior of the subscribers, perhaps it is deliberate manipulation.

       No, that would be the responsibility of the moderators of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       and the Reddit admins. However, the moderators of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       and the Reddit admins have proven themselves to be some of the worst people on the planet, so the best we can do is refuse to be silent about the manipulative agenda behind the largest political subreddit.

       Okay, go ahead and dismiss the information war. This subreddit is irrelevant, right, so don't even bother standing up for the truth. Meanwhile, Media Matters spends millions to influence discussion here.

       So OP deleted their account. I assume this was intentional. However, does anyone here have proof that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       bans users for posting political opinions only? I haven't seen that to be the case at all. Typically if you sort by controversial, it's flooded with opinions that differ from the majority of that sub...

       They deleted the accounts. But if you dont believe me, make a throw away and try it yourself. Make some logical points criticizing global warming and see how long it takes you to get banned and try to be as civil as possible. Another hot topic is comparing Donald Jr's opposition research to the pee pee dossier.

       NO i did not imply that, the users deleted the accounts apparently but I wouldnt even know that because im not a hyper reddit user. Like I said, if you dont believe me try it yourself for a couple weeks and see how long it takes you to get banned but judging from what ive observed if you make enough logical points and they get attention then eventually you will be banned without explanation. Also when I witnessed this the comments that got the accounts banned were on posts that had thousands of comments and the original post was from a liberal source critical of trump or something similar.

       If you're so convinced, do it yourself and then post it here to

       I'm wary of breaking the terms of service that reddit enforces by shadow banning people but if I ever do see it happen again then I will surely document it but when users delete their accounts and comments after being banned then that makes it very hard like what happened with OP.

       The problem with reddit/redditors is they act like the United States is the only fucking country on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet and reddit are both global, yet
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is devoted to 1 country as opposed to global politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be fooled, this is very powerful. SEO dictates which communities become the biggest, and having a good subreddit name certainly helps.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       should be devoted to ALL politics, just like's it named suggests, and in it's current form should be changed to
       <a href="/r/uspolitics">
        /r/uspolitics
       </a>
       or

       Just because someone is outraged with a false narrative and blatant propaganda that doesnt mean they are supporters of Trump. They might be anti-authoritarian and support decentralization for example. Normal people dont sit on reddit all day and may not understand the nuances of each sub and may mistake fake shills for real people and not realize that any dissenting opinions get deleted/banned. That creates a false narrative and makes a vocal minority seem like an organic majority. This isnt good for liberals either because it discredits their community as well when people try posting there and see what actually happens.

       OP probably should have said "lurkers" instead, but falsely assuming anyone that questions the narrative is a trump supporter doesnt do anyone justice including liberals.

       Wow no need to be rude. But youre being incredibly ignorant if you think that posters on TD are the only ones that say normie. Have you ever been on 4chan and before you call me some name for going there, 4chan is actually more about hobbies and creative stuff but there just happens to be a political forum there as well.

       Theyre currently shutting down free speech ironically. I understand that it's in their right to do pretty much whatever they want but r/politics doesnt deserve to be credible anymore. It's atrocious that r/politics appears at the top of the webpage and isnt reported on by mainstream media. A massive shilling operation that "colludes" with admins and mods would actually be a good story yet you will never see it on CNN or MSNBC. It's amazing that people do not demand more quality from their media sources and even if I agreed with the narrative presented on r/politics I would be outraged that political discourse is actively discouraged. People should want the truth and for arguments to be logically debated and dissected because if the argument is correct then challenges to that argument only serve to make it stronger. R/politics is a disservice to all sides of the political spectrum.

       Go there and start challenging the narrative with logic and rational while maintaining civility and see how long it takes you to get banned. I dont know how to prove it otherwise but anyone that has experience or has witnessed this knows its true. Just try it and I promise if your arguments are strong and you get attention they will ban you outright with no explanation.

       It'll take a long time because they don't ban for that.

       Go ahead and prove it. You're claiming they ban even though their rules say they don't. Back it up.

       The problem is that using multiple accounts to evade bans could get my IP shadow banned from other subs besides the cess pool that is r/politics, but if i manage to do so I will make a thread on conspiracy. Anyway you sound emotionally invested in r/politics' credibility. I cant imagine why, and why the hell would I lie? I have "witnessed" people banned from there multiple times without them breaking the rules of the sub and that is simply a fact, although I lack evidence it is true and other people echo my experience so why reject their claims 100 percent instead of keeping an open mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not do an experiment yourself and find out for yourself? What do you have to lose if you love r/politics so much why not try to defend their credibility? I admit that it may be certain mods that engage in this behavior and not an orchestrated "conspiracy" but there is such a thing as turning a blind eye and claiming plausible deniability. It's not in their interest to investigate "rogue" mods if that is what is going on but it may actually be more deliberate than that. Why do you think this post received so much attention if OP's claims are completely false?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you really trying to tell me that r/politics and the people moderating that sub are actually trying to promote open political discourse? Why are posters that say rude things about conservatives ignored but even the smallest trivial "incivility" towards liberals used as an excuse to shut down their opinions? I'll admit that most of the bans i have witnessed have been with the excuse of incivility but I have seen people at least twice banned without a good reason other than they were providing logical and concise arguments proving hypocrisy in the left's narrative or challenging BAD SCIENCE like global warming and their comments received moderate amounts of attention despite being downvoted to hell. If the liberal arguments were so strong then wouldn't the mods want people to challenge them so that they can provide proof and rationality to support their points of view even stronger?

       Jesus christ you misread my posts. I have witnessed people trying as hard as they can to be civil and then still getting banned specifically for being LOGICAL and RATIONAL. The mods cant handle when someone makes a good point. The next time it happens i can message you but users have a habit of deleting their accounts and posts after they get banned so I cant show you proof now but when dozens of people have the same complaint you might consider taking them seriously. It doenst help you at all to remain delusional and it doesnt help the liberal narrative either when the mods act like that because they are only discrediting themselves. Tbh I think you are afraid to try it yourself because your ego wants r/politics to be legitimate or something similar.

       Youre not in my brain so how do you know what ive seen or witnessed? The last time it happened it took two weeks and im too fucking lazy right now and tbh it doesnt even matter to me whether you believe me or not but youre lying to yourself. How am I supposed to support this claim if the users kept deleting their accounts? If i get around to it ill send you a message when it happens next time but this conversation is going nowhere and youre unwilling to even consider an alternate point of view but I know what I saw and other people that have posted in this post and others have echoed the same experience. Like I said, youre lying to yourself or you work for (((them))) as well.

       I didnt say 100 percent of the posts get deleted. I said that I've seen it happen twice and those people had accounts that were a few weeks old. I dont think they ban EVERY single post but I think that eventually if you keep making posts that poke holes in their narrative you will get banned.

       This isn't really wrong. How much of a positive contribution users are generally factors into moderation. Getting emotional and popping off once in awhile is human. Constantly being a disruptive contrarian and treating others like shit isn't going to serve anyone in those circumstances they break rules. Because everyone breaks them from time to time. If every instance of every rule violation caused a ban, this sub would be tumbleweeds.

       Okay but when people on that forum say Trumptard and other rude and uncivil things about conservatives yet dont get banned that is bias. And the mods will ban any conservative post that uses even the most mild "incivility," or simply is too logical and gets too much attention.

       Anecdotal experience twice and a third person was banned for simply using emojis. And something you can easily see right now is that users are allowed to make rude comments about trump supporters but even the slightest humorous jab at liberals results in a ban. But twice i have seen a user being polite on purpose but the argument was extremely logical and they were banned with no explanation but the problem is that both the users deleted their comments and their account.

       I saw a guy get banned for questioning global warming and another for showing logically that libs were okay with opposition research from Russian sources like the pee pee dossier which was actually fake which makes it worse but it was against Trump so they liked it but then screamed collusion when Trump Jr. was trying to dig up dirt on shillary, hypocrisy. I cant find the posts now but in the future I will make sure to screencap when this happens. I also saw a person banned for using smiley faces and emojis while providing support for a conservative argument YET if you go to r/politics posters there mock and are uncivil towards trump supporters and are never banned. They are obviously biased and will resort to outright banning arguments that are too logical and get too much attention. If you dont believe me try it yourself.

       This isn't really wrong. How much of a positive contribution users are generally factors into moderation. Getting emotional and popping off once in awhile is human. Constantly being a disruptive contrarian and treating others like shit isn't going to serve anyone in those circumstances they break rules. Because everyone breaks them from time to time. If every instance of every rule violation caused a ban, this sub would be tumbleweeds.

       I didnt say 100 percent of the posts get deleted. I said that I've seen it happen twice and those people had accounts that were a few weeks old. I dont think they ban EVERY single post but I think that eventually if you keep making posts that poke holes in their narrative you will get banned.

       Anecdotal experience twice and a third person was banned for simply using emojis. And something you can easily see right now is that users are allowed to make rude comments about trump supporters but even the slightest humorous jab at liberals results in a ban. But twice i have seen a user being polite on purpose but the argument was extremely logical and they were banned with no explanation but the problem is that both the users deleted their comments and their account.
