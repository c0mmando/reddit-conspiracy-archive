       I've got tons of other conspiracies, but my mildest one is that the Republicans started a trend of obstruction which will follow suit with the Dems this time around. It'll cause a stalemate where the only ones who will suffer are the middle and lower classes.

       I don't think that's a theory. That's pretty much what is happening. The "theater" part is TPTB pretending it's a problem and not exactly what is wanted.

       I think it's just that requesting the investigation doesn't actually do anything, there hasn't even been a special counsel appointed as of yet.  They also seem to be focused on "as it relates to the 2016 election". I agree that it's a win, but so far it is a very small one that could still prove fruitless.

       Yikes I missed him and 4 other non-signers. Fixed my post, thanks. I don't know why, but it's just a lette so it dosen't require votes. There was no harm in him not signing.

       Because shills have chilled the discussion on the subject. When you know a positive comment about something like this is going to fill your inbox with shit shill comments all day, it makes you think twice about saying anything.

       I was discussing yesterday's happenings with a buddy yesterday who was bummed nothing happened. On the contrary, this DID happen, and it is really all we have been asking for in regards to these criminal politicians. And I'm extremely grateful this process has been started.

       Fair enough, but the post I was replying to was calling people shills, which is also explicitly mentioned in Rule 10. How is that not also deserving of a warning?

       Are you able to identify a user that they were referring to as a shill? No? That's why it's not rule 10, it is not personally attacking any user in this sub.

       I see your point. Without personally attacking, though, I do believe that blaming any general trend that one doesn't like on 'shilling' seems like a catch-all and weak excuse.

       The mods have full control of this sub and could implement several things to curb the bullshit. The very bullshit that you yourself have identified and called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We routinely get brigaded by other subs. Brigading is against the rules in of itself, yet the only users I see get banned are users of this sub who finally get fed up and say "shill". I see countless posts allowed to say that whine about "T_D2.0". Isn't that the same thing in different words? It is essentially calling someone a Trump shill.

       I feel like using the "admins don't do anything" excuse is a cop out. You guys have the ability and right to ban anyone you wish, which is exactly what the admins would do. If you are sure enough they are breaking the rules to report them to admins why not just do it yourselves?

         <li>

         </li>
         <li>
          Selected leaks of classified information related to the unmasking of U.S. person identities incidentally collected upon by the intelligence community, including an assessment of whether anyone in the Obama Administration, including Mr. Comey, Ms. Lynch, Ms. Susan Rice, Ms. Samantha Power, or others, had any knowledge about the “unmasking” of individuals on then candidate-Trump’s campaign team, transition team, or both;
          <br/>

       </li>
       <li>

       It's not a bigger deal because it will implicate many many people, some of which are charged with covering it in the media.  Covering this is against the interests of almost everyone involved.  I'm just hoping this isn't some sort of grandstanding i.e.  the "reopening" of the Clinton case in October.

       The real problem is they can't get the Wikileaks emails into a court for any reason. They can be authenticated and legitimized that way. Then courts get to go through them and ask how many people knew the US was arming ISIS and Al Qaeda. The answer is
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       . Just look at what's going on in the UK about this exact issue and between Saudi and Qatar. All based on that Clinton email. Trump wasn't making it up when he said everyone at G20 wanted to talk about Clinton's emails.

       I have not enjoyed myself as much as I did when watching those nasty people squirm in that hearing in a long time. It was glorious. There are still good men in government. You could tell who was going to be a piece of shit and who was gonna be cool just by looking at them, much less hearing them speak. It was insane.

       You're strangely right. I don't know if it's because our intuition is getting better or what, but watching the video, I knew almost instantaneously who was going to be on the right side of history.

       No, you're not wrong--I firmly believe in the power of intuition. And this comes from someone who was a Sanders (and Paul) supporter, and therefore has no such bias about Democrats being better than Republicans.

       Funny, I just tried posting this and ran into the other thread. A charitable view would say that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is sick of "investigations" or announcements of investigations and wants results instead, so discussion is minimal. The other less rosy view is that shills gonna shill and bots are going to downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any way you slice it, this is validation for many of us. Hard to imagine that we are one year out from all the roller coaster twists and turns of the 16 primary cycle. I hope this investigation is nonpartisan and justice is done to all who violated the laws.

       This is a great way of putting it. It's a huge deal, but all of us have "investigation fatigue" from the fact we've witnessed Benghazi, the FBI's ongoing investigation of clear and corrupt Clinton emails, the 911 "investigation"... all for nothing. At this point, the very word "investigation" means little to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have very, very cautious optimism.

       If you want an honest answer, this is nothing but a formal request.

       If the judiciary committee wanted this to have any weight it would have to be attached to some new evidence that would warrant a special prosecutor to dig deeper.

       Its a political stunt in the same vein as that one Democrat rep. (whos name escapes me) that called for impeachment hearings on Trump on the house floor. It adds some fuel to your political base, but is ultimately a hollow gesture.

       It certainly doesn't hurt, as a liberal I see it as baseless - but conservatives said the same thing about appointing a special prosecutor for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if some bombshells drop and implicate some of the people mentioned in this request, conservatives can wave this in the DOJs face and say "see! we wanted you to look into this months ago, its time to act"

       Thanks!  Likewise as a decidedly non-"liberal" I can totally see how this could be an attempt to counter the "Russian Investigation". But the sourced evidence has me leaning more towards this being a more truthful take on the circumstances surrounding the parties involved (DNC vs. Trump admin). And I could also see how both sides could be just a bigger cover for a bigger plan aka UN takeover agenda 21 etc etc

       It is a big deal, but ShareBlue hasn't worked out their talking points yet, so all they can do is slide the story off of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as fast as they can manage. Once the talking points are distributed, expect more threads on the story to come through so that the comments can be effectively subverted.

       heres a copy and pasteable version of the letter
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the specific issues it details:
1. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch directing Mr. Comey to mislead the American people on the nature of the Clinton investigation;
2. The shadow cast over our system of justice concerning Secretary Clinton and her involvement in mishandling classified information;
3. FBI and DOJ’s investigative decisions related to former Secretary Clinton’s email investigation, including the propriety and consequence of immunity deals given to potential Clinton co-conspirators Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Bentel and possibly others;
4. The apparent failure of DOJ to empanel a grand jury to investigate allegations of mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her associates;
5. The Department of State and its employees’ involvement in determining which communications of Secretary Clinton’s and her associates to turn over for public scrutiny;
6. WikiLeaks disclosures concerning the Clinton Foundation and its potentially unlawful international dealings;
7. Connections between the Clinton campaign, or the Clinton Foundation, and foreign entities, including those from Russia and Ukraine;
8. Mr. Comey’s knowledge of the purchase of Uranium One by the company Rosatom, whether the approval of the sale was connected to any donations made to the Clinton Foundation, and what role Secretary Clinton played in the approval of that sale that had national security ramifications;
9. Disclosures arising from unlawful access to the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) computer systems, including inappropriate collusion between the DNC and the Clinton campaign to undermine Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign;
10. Post-election accusations by the President that he was wiretapped by the previous Administration, and whether Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch had any knowledge of efforts made by any federal agency to unlawfully monitor communications of then-candidate Trump or his associates;
11. Selected leaks of classified information related to the unmasking of U.S. person identities incidentally collected upon by the intelligence community, including an assessment of whether anyone in the Obama Administration, including Mr. Comey, Ms. Lynch, Ms. Susan Rice, Ms. Samantha Power, or others, had any knowledge about the “unmasking” of individuals on then candidate-Trump’s campaign team, transition team, or both;
12. Admitted leaks by Mr. Comey to Columbia University law professor, Daniel Richman, regarding conversations between Mr. Comey and President Trump, how the leaked information was purposefully released to lead to the appointment of a special counsel, and whether any classified information was included in the now infamous “Comey memos”; Mr. Comey’s and the FBI’s apparent reliance on “Fusion GPS” in its investigation of the Trump campaign, including the company’s creation of a “dossier” of information about Mr. Trump, that dossier’s commission and dissemination in the months before and after the 2016 election, whether the FBI paid anyone connected to the dossier, and the intelligence sources of Fusion GPS or any person or company working for Fusion GPS and its affiliates; and Any and all potential leaks originated by Mr. Comey and provide to author Michael Schmidt dating back to 1993.

       I believe that while many of these members have their own agenda and motivations, the lot of them are constantly scrambling to prevent the public from seeing what is really behind the green curtain.

       It is a matter of choosing into which cash stream one is going to insert one's efforts and protecting, nurturing, and defending (if necessary) the entities that control it.
