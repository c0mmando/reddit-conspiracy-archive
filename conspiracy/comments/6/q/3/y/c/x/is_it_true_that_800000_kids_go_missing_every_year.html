        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have read on a few sites that about 800,000 kids go missing every  year. Something like a fourth of them are returned safely,but.... </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-children-america-unsolved-cases/story?id=19126967">This is ABC News, but I have found this statistic in more than on place</a></p>

<p>Anyone care to comment about the missing children?</p>

<p>EDIT: I AM NOT SAYING THAT 800,000 GO MISSING EVERY YEAR. I AM TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION COLLECTIVELY (USING YOUR HELP AND KNOWLEDGE) SO THAT I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. DO NOT COME AT ME LIKE I AM THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU OF SOMETHING.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I know this really isn&#39;t a surprise for most of us, as we know the sad fate that most of these kids will face. But, REALLY, you would think that this would be a hot topic, yet I never hear anything even close to this in the media. </p>

<p>Yesterday I went nuts on a lady&#39;s social media (I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore) who was making a big fuss about the transgender/military issue and I started bringing up REAL points. She immediately labeled me as a conspiracy theorist and only addressed 1 of my 6 points and she assumed that I was attacking her as a person when I was actually just stating information. I never attacked her, I simply brought up some questionable media about Chester Bennington/Chris Cornell, Monsanto, missing children, the destruction of the 1st amendment right before our eyes, and the whole situation about Imran Awan. </p>

<p>Is there any hope to make people think outside of the box anymore? I just wanted to plant a seed of thought in these people so that they wouldn&#39;t just follow the narrative and the BLATANT distractions. Everyone thought I was attacking her and I had to make it clear several times that I was simply stating information and NOT attacking her. Lmao everyone loved her reply to my comment basically labeling my entire comment as conspiracy and extremely disrespectful. They couldn&#39;t handle the stuff that I was throwing out at them. I basically told them that the trans/military stuff was a giant distraction and that we need to be focusing on more pressing issues and also not attacking each other, because that divides us.</p>

<p>Turns out, no matter what is right in front of them, they will only see what they want to see. Perhaps I am guilty of the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slate.com says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/01/800000_missing_kids_really.html">this</a> about it:</p>

<p>&quot;When the categories get conflated, the statistics can become confusing. Take the number 800,000: It&#39;s true that 797,500 people under 18 were reported missing in a one-year period, according to a 2002 study. But of those cases, 203,900 were family abductions, 58,200 were nonfamily abductions, and only 115 were &quot;stereotypical kidnappings,&quot; defined in one study as &quot;a nonfamily abduction perpetrated by a slight acquaintance or stranger in which a child is detained overnight, transported at least 50 miles, held for ransom or abducted with the intent to keep the child permanently, or killed.&quot; Even these categories can be misleading: Overstaying a visit with a noncustodial parent, for example, could qualify as a family abduction. Some individuals get entered into the database multiple times after disappearing on different occasions, resulting in potentially misleading numbers.&quot;</p>

<p>I added all of those up, so:</p>

<p>800,000 (base number) - 236,215 (figures in paragraph above added together) = 563,785</p>

<p>That&#39;s still a lot of potentially missing kids, regardless of how it happened.</p>

<p>I am not claiming to be knowledgeable of this topic, I just want some opinions from others to help me figure this out.</p>

<p>You only counted the abductions. Not every kid which is missing was abducted. Most just run away. These are not abductions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and I get that. What I want to know is how accurate the process is as far as recording the incidences and how many go unreported. I&#39;ve tried searching multiple places and many of them have different results with different numbers.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course that will be some percentage but as we have covered, of the 800,000 reports only 115 were actual abductions that we&#39;re interested in. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re talking about in this new scenario wouldn&#39;t be accounted for in missing children statistics but I would expect it is a very small percentage of the population engaging in such transactions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of those are runaways, and custody disputes.  Child is defined up to age 18, so any 16-18 year old who runs away from home, for whatever reason, is counted.  If that happens multiple times in one year, each time counts towards the 800,000.  And a parent keeping their child for an extra day on a custody weekend could also count, and again the same child could be counted multiple times.  The number of missing children who end up in desperate situations is a tiny fraction of that number.</p>

<p>Why is it the case that none of the missing kids charities can agree on an agreed figure collectively?</p>

<p>also there methods of collecting numbers and collating them is open to challenge.</p>

<p>Also why is it the case that the U.N. cannot get all governments across the world to keep accurate missing child figures has a principle of membership to the U.N.?</p>

<p>If a person gets really committed to seeing what&#39;s going on they&#39;ll find the answers.

<p>I really think people want to pretend that President Kennedy was shot by the Cubans because facing up to the fact that it was a CIA operation means that the CIA would kill a popular elected president and strongly implies that ANYTHING you put into the category of so sick and disgusting that there&#39;s just no way the Government would ever do that...yeah, it&#39;s all on the table to them.  Murder, torture, assassination, false flags, experimenting on unwilling humans.</p>
