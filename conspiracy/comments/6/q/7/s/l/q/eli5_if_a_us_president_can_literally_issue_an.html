       It's crazy to think about, psychotic people control the world we live in and we might never see their faces. Something's definitely up with Antarctica, based on it being the only place on Earth that all world governments are agreed on, maybe it's their HQ?

       Shit, How bad is it that no. 3 is the more likely scenario? I agree though, that's exactly what it would take to wrestle back control. J.F.K tried and his demise was televised. I thought of that as a warning to anyone else who might want to try to be the 'peoples President'.

       Tax payer money that only exists by borrowing it from the federal reserve, with interest of course, which also has to be narrowed in order to pay the original debt and interest. Then we get to barrow more money at interest in order to pay the previous money we barrowed at interest in order to pay the previous debt and interest. And so on.....until they own and we owe them everything.

       I guess it's the price for having the Fed manage the economy?  Would the Fed  be willing to do all that it does with government issued currency?   What would that change, if for instance, the Fed could still determine the amount of currency in circulation, the interest rates, purchase distressed assets, etc...  Would the method of money creation make that big a difference if the Fed still maintained control?   What if the Fed created the currency but the Treasury dictated intrest policy?  Would that look any different?  Which is the more powerful ability?

       Because that would need transparency, and countries that have done that had their currency quickly devalued by the other nations, leading to huge inflations. This would ruin US over a very short period of time. US economy functions on debt, hence the huge military is saving grace to a country in perpetual debt. US already prints its own money with no physical backing, imagine if someone like russia printed rubles, the inflation would be that of zimbabwe within hours. But russian economy functions on physical reserve and backing. The fed reserve is a private institution, hence the legality of president issuing this type of order makes no sense.

       Printing more money means more money in circulation, and inflation would occur because people now have more money which means demand would go up resulting in raised prices. It definitely makes a difference as to who prints money considering that only the government is allowed to do it and anybody else doing it would be a federal crime.

       Wrong. Start a mortgage? The bank just created money out of thin air and charges you interest on it. The Federal Reserve does the same thing: we pay interest on money that didn't previously exist.

       Except that's not printing money? I don't think you know what printing means. There is a huge difference between printing money and the way that banks loan money. Printing money would mean that you LITERALLY PRINT MONEY. If it was so simple like you apparently think it is then no government would ever have debt because they would just print money to pay for it. The money that banks lend comes partially from depositors. The other part comes from "nothing". Banks are required to have a certain ratio as a reserve requirement on hand. Banks can loan out more than they have but they still have to have to meet this reserve requirement. The banks then pay out interest rates to depositors while taking in interest rates from the people they lend to. So while the money might come from "nothing", the bank can't just lend out however much it wants. It still has to be able to meet the reserve requirements, so the only way to increase their lending capacity is to increase the amount of depositors. This also depends on the reserve requirement that is set by the Federal Reserve. So in a way you're only half right. They loan out more than they have but at the same time the money exists, just not as cash.

       You legitimately don't know what you're talking about. "Printing" money has changed in modern times - but 97% of money in circulation currently is digital - it's not even real. Because banks literally just create it in a computer screen.

       You're dancing around the issue. Why are banks allowed to create money out of thin air and charge interest on money that doesn't exist? Why not require that the banks purchase money from the government? This is how printed money works.

       I don't know why you think banks create money because they don't. They give out credit and loans against their assets, which is why if a banks goes under all your money goes with it.

       The idea that banks just loan out other people's deposits is very out of date (but I understand might still be taught in economics?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Loans are considered "new money" that didn't exist before. When a loan is created, simultaneously a liability appears on the bank's balance sheet. As the loan is repaid, the liability decreases to zero and the money disappears again. But whilst the loan is outstanding, there is money circulating in the economy until it is deposited again. This is how the vast majority of usable money is created in most economies.
The assets the banks hold as "reserve" might be as low as 1% of their liabilities. It's called "fractional reserve banking".

       Only 10% needs to be on hand. The other 90% is created out of thin air. What you're describing makes intuitive sense and how it probably should work, but it doesn't reflect reality.

       Nope. If you take out a mortgage for 200k they only need to have 20k on hand. Seriously, look it up. I'm surprised you're so confident about this.

       You are confusing two different things.   There is the precentage of customer assets that must be on hand and then there is the requirement or how much can be in reserves that they can loan against.

       But the money isn't coming out of nowere. It's either borrowed from the Fed., or money from current depositors.

       Are you implying that 100% of a loan is "either borrowed from the Fed., or money from current depositors."? Because I'm not seeing anything that suggests that.

       they nationalized the banks and stopped borrowing from others. I think you're missing the heart of the question, which is why do we bother with being charged interest when it only takes money away from us.

       Any profit the Fed makes doesn't keep, all surplus goes back to Treasury eventually. Look it up its true. This conspiracy unravels as soon as you look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The treasury only prints money the government has. Government gets money by borrowing at interest from the private central bank. Which sounds evil, but is actually a sensible check on the government's ability to cause runaway inflation by trying to print away its problems. If there was no interest in printing more money (or no private central bank seperate from the government), the government could print and spend money like there is no tomorrow, ultimately devaluation the currency and causing runaway inflation. Check out your history textbook for the million times this has happened in everwhere in history. Based on experience, we simply can't trust government to print it's own money without consequences. The interest is there to ensure government remains responsible with the money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Borrowing our money supply from a private central bank at interest, at a rate decided by macroeconomic experts whose job it is set the rate in order to hit inflation target, is a good way to prevent the government from causing runaway inflation in case politicians who run the government are corrupt, greedy and/or incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, having private central bank that is co-owned by banks, but run by government appointed, non-political, non-shareholding, independent macroeconomic experts is part of the check and balances in our system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the only way to keep the money supply and the economy stable? Probably not, but believe it or not, everything else we've tried has failed spectacularly and this has been going mostly smoothly for the last 50 years or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it vulnerable corruption, greed and incompetence? Very much so, but so is every other way and ultimately all attempts at governance, but again by having the government decide who runs the fed and having the fed decide how much it costs the government to print money, they mutually check and balance each other.

       This isn't really the question that is being asked.  Since we are borrowing money anyway, why are we borrowing it from the FED where we have to pay interest on that borrowed money when we can just print the same amount of money without interest. We could use the exact same amounts the FED prints if we wanted, and avoid paying interest to a banking cartel.

       It's more a question of, why not ceasing the federal reserves control over the economic and banking systems of the USA?  There is much more to this.

       A lot of people think trump is amazing, but I am fairly confident he is another zionist/cabal puppet, just trying to please one 'side' and piss of another to keep us distracted.  There are a few places remaining on Earth with independent non rothschild owned banks, north korea and iran.  Iraq, afghanistan, libya and a few others were other independents not long ago, the USA made sure that didn't last.
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/28/trump-to-sign-bill-levying-sanctions-on-russia-iran-and-north-korea-white-house-says.html">

       </a>
       This points to a corrupt behavior, one that says the zionists are pulling his strings entirely.  I don't really know what russia has to do with it, maybe it's just a continuation of a big distraction element, toss in this 'evil' russia with it, or maybe russia has been steering against their banks and cabal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Donald Trump said he would sign a series of bills that will impose stiff financial sanctions on Russia.  The announcement comes after Congress this week overwhelmingly approved packages to punish Moscow for allegedly meddling in U.S. elections.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       MSM: "Ohhhh russia hackers trump asked for put him in office!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: "Nut uhh, it was those border hopping mexicans, but I am going to sanction russia for hacking the election (possibly according to this article)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, I think the whole trump hillary thing is just a divide and conquer notion, dem and republican, basically all seem the same to me to a large degree.

       You know what happens if you print money without the fed reserve approval. Executive Order 11110 was issued by U.S. President John F. Kennedy on June 4, 1963. Abe had his greenbacks. Jackson went off the Brit banking system and they burned Washington DC. You don't mess with the bankers, and their present incarnation as the fed.

       This conspiracy theory is
       <strong>
        completely
       </strong>
       wrong. It's not even close to correct. JFK did the exact opposite of this theory. He
       <em>
        eliminated
       </em>
       silver certificates. Congress passed a law at Kennedy's request that stopped the Treasury from buying silver and printing silver certificates. The new law allowed the Federal Reserve to issue new $1 and $2 Federal Reserve notes to replace the silver certificates. The same day that Kennedy signed the new law, he issued Executive Order 11110 to allow the Treasury to keep printing silver certificates until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready.

       Now, to get back to your original question.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Congress doesn't directly borrow money from the Federal Reserve. The Treasury auctions off securities which anyone can buy. The Federal Reserve buys some of these on the secondary market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal government pays interest on all the Treasury bonds, but since the Federal Reserve gives almost all of its profits back to the government, there is almost zero interest on the portion of the debt that the Federal Reserve owns. (Actually, since 2008, the Federal Reserve has given the government much more money than it has gotten in interest.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If Congress just printed money instead of borrowing, there would be a lot more money and inflation. Remember, the Federal Reserve doesn't monetize all the debt, just a portion of it. Plus, if there's no 
interest, there is less incentive for Congress to try to balance the budget, which would lead to even more inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would especially be incentive to spend more and tax less just before elections. This would be popular with voters, who would experience the benefits right away and not feel most of the inflation until after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why most countries have central banks that are somewhat independent of the government.

       My American history's a little rusty, but according to Bill Still (in that 3 hour documentary he did on the history of the West's banking cartels), President Abraham Lincoln got a bullet in the back of the head because he revoked Congress' authorisation of the Federal Reserve's charter to print and issue privately owned currency. He also abolished slavery. The guy was dangerous.

       The Federal Reserve wasn't created until 1913, well after Lincoln. The closest equivalent organization of the time was the Second National Bank, which had its charter revoked by Jackson, well before Lincoln's presidency.

       Through monetary policy, fiat currency can be devalued or increased in value relative to foreign currencies.  This can be used strategically to achieve different goals, for example a weak US dollar makes US exports more competitive.

       Shit, How bad is it that no. 3 is the more likely scenario? I agree though, that's exactly what it would take to wrestle back control. J.F.K tried and his demise was televised. I thought of that as a warning to anyone else who might want to try to be the 'peoples President'.

       Nope. If you take out a mortgage for 200k they only need to have 20k on hand. Seriously, look it up. I'm surprised you're so confident about this.

       You are confusing two different things.   There is the precentage of customer assets that must be on hand and then there is the requirement or how much can be in reserves that they can loan against.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the money isn't coming out of nowere. It's either borrowed from the Fed., or money from current depositors.

       So my $200 in my kids savings account can be loaned out for someones personal loan or car loan.
