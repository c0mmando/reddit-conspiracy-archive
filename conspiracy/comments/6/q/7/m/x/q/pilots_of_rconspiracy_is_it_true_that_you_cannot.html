    <div class="md"><p>Those lines are a little exaggerated. &quot;Polar routes&quot; are considered as such on the 78th parallel. Not the 90th. That&#39;s roughly [according to G-Earth] ~1600 miles away. In any ISS video they only view ~1000 miles at a given moment. Meaning that even at 200km+ perspective limits people to 1000 miles in viewable perspective.</p>

<p>On the southern pole its even less revealing because nothing travels even close to the south pole. Basically only the outside borders of Antarctica.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I read there it doesn&#39;t make sense to fly over barren lands with no airports even if your plane is capable of doing it.  If something goes wrong there would be no alternative airports to make an emergency landing in.</p>

<p>As far as commercial flights go, they have restrictions based upon how many miles away from a potential emergency landing airport they fly at any given point of the flight.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem very mysterious to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Safest route from A to B is not always the shortest route.</p>

<p>Is this all tying into &quot;the earth is flat&quot; theory at some point? If so we probably aren&#39;t going to agree on much.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you have a 15-20 year old plane that is your company&#39;s work horse.  The plane itself is capable of making a 2000 mile flight but the plane is also prone to mechanical failures and passengers also contribute to the potentiality that an emergency landing might be needed.  Do you chart a route that has 17 major airports along it&#39;s path as well as countless small airports and military airbases or do you fly over a 1500 mile wasteland?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year, while more than 3 billion people flew safely on 36.4 million flights, there were 81 aviation accidents, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That was below the five-year average of 86 accidents per year, and the equivalent of one accident per 2.4 million flights.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that the airports which host the highest number of emergency landings per year are also the airports at the ass end of long ocean flights.  This is statistically important and all the more reason NOT to fly over the barren waste lands of the polar regions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if the earth is flat or square or a giant pyramid, it doesn&#39;t make sense to fly over the poles when there are no airports there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who took flying lessons, I have to agree with this.  There are minimal places to land, let alone survive in the Arctic until rescue arrives.  Whenever flying, my instructors were always asking me, where would you land in an emergency, right now.  How far could we make it from here if the engine stepped.  Don&#39;t aim for water, aim for softwood trees or a clearing if you can manage it.</p>

<p>Traversing the oceans is dangerous, that&#39;s why most commercial jets are designed to float for several hours on a water landing.</p>

<p>But floating in the ocean is not nearly as immediately dangerous as being unprepared in sub zero conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a pilot but I was a flight attendant for 7 years. I flew to US and Canada from Europe many any times and every time we would go no further up North than Greenland. I kept asking to all the pilots if we could ever fly over the North Pole. They always replied thinks like:
1. &quot;No we can&#39;t. It&#39;s forbidden.&quot;
2. &quot;Nobody is allowed to fly over the North Pole.&quot;
3. &quot;We can&#39;t, because is not safe for the flight instruments.&quot;
 ... and the most sincere answer:
4. &quot;We don&#39;t know why can&#39;t we. I guess there&#39;s something they don&#39;t want us to know about the North Pole. If we ask permission to re-route they never ley us get close to it.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember another pilot also told me a more scientific explanation but I was not paying much attention since I was to busy looking through the cockpit windows at all that ice melting down there... He said something about the atmosphere being to close to Earth in the​ poles making it dangerous to fly. Or something​ like that. Meh...</p>

<p>In my opinion, there&#39;s definitely a hole in there leading to either inner Earth (Hollow Earth model) or to a portal to somewhere else. But &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t wanna share with the rest of us. And when I say &quot;they&quot; I a probably talking bout Nazis. [end of MY opinion]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my reply I told you what they told me while flying. But my research goes beyond those pilot answers. Now, what I have been researching has a lot to do with pyramids, holes in the North and South Pole, giants, Nazi technology and stuff. Hard to swallow but way more fun to explore. I don&#39;t claim my opinion is closer to the truth or anything. I just feel like all these fantasy stories sound so crazy that it actually might be truth!
 I feel like round solid Earth and Flat Earth are actually the same Earth viewed from different perspectives. A Hollow Earth if put in 2D can be drawn as huge flat Earth. This is also my own  thoughts about it. 
 I always discredited Flat Earthers until one day I saw a map like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i37.servimg.com/u/f37/19/57/19/62/kfwnwb10.jpg">https://i37.servimg.com/u/f37/19/57/19/62/kfwnwb10.jpg</a>
(sorry for the bad quality of the image)</p>

<p>And it made me think it could be that the outer layer after the wall of ice is actually the inner Earth just represented in 2D. creating all this confusion about the flat Earth. 
Here&#39;s is a drawing of a Hollow Earth in case you haven&#39;t seen one:</p>

<p><a href="http://assets3.bigthink.com/system/tinymce_assets/2117/original/hollow_earth.jpg?1457088283">http://assets3.bigthink.com/system/tinymce_assets/2117/original/hollow_earth.jpg?1457088283</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not easy to find real images of the holes in the poles since most of them are edited. If you go in Google Earth and navigate to the exact North Pole there&#39;s always a plain white circle covering what&#39;s really there. Other images don&#39;t even bother into making it look like snow and stick a big black dot like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/z22RqApTcXo/hqdefault.jpg">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/z22RqApTcXo/hqdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>Anyways, all this is to more or less explain why my opinion seems strange after the pilots explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The North Pole isn&#39;t close to any airfield. For safety if possible airline routes are made to be within 3 hours of any airfield. Research ETOPS.</p>

<p>There are also several magnetic anomalies associated with flying over the North Pole, so that incase of an emergency the aircrafts backup compass would be useless. We also have to take in account for radios, it&#39;s much harder to maintain contact with aircraft flying over such a desolate region. </p>

<p>However, there still ARE flights operating near the North Pole. I highly doubt your credentials as a flight assistant tbh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is literally no reason to fly DIRECTLY over the north pole unless it&#39;s a research mission. You also ignored a majority of my argument. </p>

<p>Nobody called you a troll, and your proof of credentials as a flight attendant is still relevant. Also most modern airliners don&#39;t even have a second officer seat, they have a JUMPseat but why you&#39;d ever be in there instead of the cabin is beyond me(Unless of course you&#39;re on a space available flight, which then you&#39;d actually be off-duty.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reason to fly over the North Pole on a commercial airliner of course. Why put at risk all those pax and crew lives! you are right. I didn&#39;t ignore your argument, I apologize if I didn&#39;t make any comment about it because it does makes a lot of sense I understand why is not necessary to go so far just to take a look at what&#39;s there. There are too many risks specially due to the anomalies in the flying instruments when passing to close to the North Pole. Yeah I get it. That&#39;s all understandable and straight forward. </p>

<p>And yes, I called it second officer seat because in the airline I worked for, we had seats and jumpseats depending on the model of the a/c. The new A350s for example have so much space in cockpit that they put a seat in there (or maybe it was an all-the-time-deployed-jumpseat.. idk does it even matter?)
Also the world is quite big and all airlines have their differences in some terminology aspects. The airline I worked for has CPT F/O and 2nd officer, which is an F/O in training or observing. This airline trains pilots as a business too so we use the term 2nd officer a LOT. This airline has one or two seats (jumpseats) in cockpit apart from CPT and F/O in all its aircrafts which by the way are very very modern. </p>

<p>But anyway, the whole point here is that there is a huge conspiracy about the north and south poles. And for some reasons that favor the mystery, we can&#39;t just fly over there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say it&#39;s silly when you can&#39;t proof me wrong? I&#39;m just trying to make people think outside the box. It doesn&#39;t mean I am trying to convince you about my theories! The truth is not always in what we learn throughout our lives. In school they brainwash you with fake historical events and at the same time they prepare you to obey the authorities. If they made a &quot;good&quot; job brainwashing you with lots and lots of patriotic crap you might even end up in the army, where the brainwashing continues. Or also you might end up in a job where you spend most of your time to make your boss or bosses rich while you struggle to reach the end of the month. If you actually earn enough you end up being brainwashed anyways everyday through advertisement focused in making you fear something so you buy. For example: &quot;you need this smartphone otherwise you won&#39;t be able to communicate with your loved ones and take amazing pictures everywhere you go! You need a big car otherwise if you have an accident you&#39;ll die! You need beauty products because otherwise you will be ugly or unacceptable! You need to go to doctor and quit smoking or you are gonna get cancer!&quot; you get the idea... And then the doc just perpetuates your chemical dependency to nicotine by giving you nicotine patches or chewing gum... etc.</p>

<p>So my point is, don&#39;t let them tell you how to think and what to believe in. Anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is physically possible to fly over the north pole, yes.  However, for modern planes as well as their crew, it may be hazardous.  </p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s magnetosphere protects the planet from the Sun&#39;s solar winds, but the radiation does get through at the magnetic poles (such as when you see Aurora Borealis) , which can affect navigation systems, as well as control systems.  Since most commercial craft are fly-by-wire, these systems can potentially be affected or damaged by radiation, especially as a result solar events.  The biggest concern however, is simply radiation exposure for the crew, since radiation exposure increases with altitude as well as proximity to the magnetic pole.  </p>

<p>As far as commercial flights go, they have restrictions based upon how many miles away from a potential emergency landing airport they fly at any given point of the flight.</p>
