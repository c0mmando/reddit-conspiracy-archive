    <div class="md"><p>Intresting read and theorys but i dont agree with any of it. Even if its controller by a group or gouverment... then they underestimated the effect of it cause there are so many alt coins with good privacy and other options that they shot themselfs in the foot.</p>

<p>If it would ever be a gouverment/CIA/Illuminati controlled currency they would be dropped by the majority of the people who are into crypto and everyone would move to monero, Pivx... or any alt coin with very high anonymity.</p>

<p>They also triggered something they cant stop or control at all, with new blockchains coming to the market, like the IOTA ( Tangle chain ) a new sort of chain completly different then the original blockchain and even stronger the more people use it.</p>

<p>Also russia is more into ethereum cause the guy who started it is Russian.</p>

<p>Well thats my 2 cents, you could be correct! Who realy knows but in the end if ur correct they fucked themselfs.</p>

<p>Hard to argue with this! I think it would officially crash the bitcoin market to rock bottom.</p>

<p>Government programs have unintended consequences all of the time. Ever hear of Tor? lol. And Tor played a big role in the initial growth of bitcoin due to the silk road. </p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, what are your favorite alt-coins for security/ anonymity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Bitcoin market wil go rock bottom if something like this comes out thats why a lot of people &quot;informed&quot; gamble on altcoins. I still have 30% of my portofolio on bitcoin.</p>

<p>Ah yeah now you mention Tor! Thats on√© of those uninted consequences for sure!</p>

<p>Everyones favorit is Monero. My second favorit is PIVX. And then you have a few that i havent looked into much Dash, ZCash, ZCoin, ZClassic, ZenCash, Hush, verge, Komodo</p>

<p>I invested in 9 coins so far and next month i will get some Monero, Pivx &amp; IOTA added to my portofolio</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are totally correct, buy alts before 1aug fork. Because many people think they will get Free money (lol) But i still want to see what the market does 1/2 august and buy then. Im prepaired for 1/2 august, all 3 screens will be focused on exhanges and watch prices! </p>

<p>Also i read a lot about the coins im gonna buy and i havent research it 100%  even if the prices go up again it wount bother me much im a long time holder not a trader.</p>

<p>I research a coin for days if i like, i buy, i store (offline) and track my coins with <a href="https://cointracking.info">https://cointracking.info</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think my point about the $2.8 billion dollars really points to it being a group. How could an individual not sell at least some percentage of that wealth, for ten years? That&#39;s so much money to just let float out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only hinted at NSA since they are the only government organization we &#39;secretly&#39; pay taxes for to study and learn cryptology. Maybe some of them are patriots and wanted to develop a way to free the US from its oppressive financial system. I&#39;d like to think some white-nights still exist in our intelligence apparatus. But who knows really. </p>

<p>Even if they, or he, moves the coins the idea still lives on and works so it doesn&#39;t matter much in the long run especially if he sells them in an evenly distributed way. It&#39;s his grand idea, you&#39;d think he would be smart with how he handles it. He&#39;s also probably already sold tons of them and has a nice rainy day for himself, since there really is no way if knowing who owns any given public address. Mo money mo problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I don&#39;t think there are many white knights.&quot; There are literally millions of people with security clearances, and we&#39;ve heard of what, maybe 10 famous leaks in the last 10 years? Snowden, manning, reality winner, thomas drake, will binney.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a tiny tiny percentage. A lot of these people are &quot;private&quot; employees that have government money funneled in and are paid quite well. Snowden was in hawaii. A lot of them have families and such. I think that&#39;s why the leakers have general been young. Once they get too trapped/committed/ used to the life financially, they don&#39;t seem to be as apt to leak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If bitcoin was a government backed project it would be by a country that wants to undermine the USD, so then it would be China, Russia, Iran, or perhaps a Latin American country. Given the number of miners in China it could be a Chinese project. </p>

<p>If Satoshi Nakomot and hasn&#39;t touched his wallet maybe he died or was killed. If the wallet was encrypted maybe no one will be able to get the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point about all the Chinese miners; however, counter point to that is the Chinese government disapproving of all of the money laundering that wealthy Chinese are doing with bitcoin.</p>

<p>It could be a Latin American country. I consider a smaller country to be a wildcard just due to their having less resources in general though. However, one interesting piece of evidence is that &quot;Satoshi&quot; always posted during times that would suggest he was on the east coast of the US/ south american time. I also think it&#39;s equally likely that a government would be aware of this kind of evidence and use it to throw people off though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re overlooking the obvious. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm which was developed by the NSA. If the algorithm is compromised, it&#39;s possible that anyone who understands it can</p>

<p>1)read every transaction ever made on the block chain 
2)make financial transactions from any address to any other
3)mine bitcoin quickly</p>

<p>These are all possibilities whether or not the NSA developed bitcoin.  It&#39;s not who made it, but who benefits.</p>

<p>By the way, the Snowden leaks showed that one of the elliptic curve cryptographic protocols developed by the NSA was built with a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/">backdoor</a> already, so there is already some basis for doubting the integrity of some cryptographic protocols.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember ALL mainstream media (not just RT) is propaganda.  We&#39;re being lied to from all sides, and you can&#39;t single one out without including the others.  RT is important, because it shows another side to the propaganda...the truth lies somewhere in between ALL sides, and we need access to ALL sides in order to see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know ... currency is just one of many many ways to utilize blockchain technology. and while i don&#39;t think it will solve our financial problems, it is still a great piece of technology. it allows you build services without central databases and servers. this is huge.</p>

<p>forget the coins, fuck the coins, what happens when the power is out or internet is not working? can&#39;t even buy bread, it&#39;s worthless as currency.</p>

<p>i you want to hold it, hold it as commodity, but the real usages we have yet to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole satoshi is a mysterious japanese hacker thing is complete BS. That is some kind of fairy tale for the mass.</p>

<p>I believe satoshi is actually one big bank (JP morgan or GS maybe), or it could be the IMF or the fed or the world bank. They experiment with digital currencies. Eventually, their goal is to get rid of cash and replace it with digital currencies, i.e. meaningless numbers on a computer screen. It&#39;s a complex and tricky thing to accomplish. They cannot afford to go full digital currency overnight, and see people have no trust in it and move away from it to start trading again with gold/silver. So, they first need to conduct experimentations.</p>

<p>They manage to take down dark web marketplaces one after another. If they wanted to identify this mysterious satoshi who&#39;s supposedly still hiding, they would find him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always suspected that Tor is compromised. Even given my layman&#39;s understanding of it. First of all, invented by the Navy. And all it does is bounce IP addresses around the network. But still, you can find IPs that connect to it? Although undercover purchases and such is easy too. This is how supposedly Silk Road infamously went down. I don&#39;t fucking trust Tor and I think you&#39;re a silly person if you do.</p>

<p>Someone else in here thinks that bitcoin itself might already be compromised by someone cracking the security algorithm. I&#39;m not so sure about that, but I think it&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only have basic knowledge of how Tor works too. Look, they tell you it was invented by the Navy. Onion routing was further developed by DARPA. Why would they release into the public domain a technology that allows anyone to potentially conduct criminal activities under complete anonymity ? At this age of increasing global surveillance. It makes no sense to me. </p>

<p>As a general rule, one should not trust any technology which is not his or whose code is not open source. It&#39;s the same thing with VPN. Unless you&#39;re running your own VPN service, there is no reason to trust a 3rd party will fully protect your privacy. </p>

<p>If I were the NSA, or whoever listens to all communications, I would think Tor and VPNs conveniently help to narrow down searches and investigations, rather than giving equal importance to the whole online world. First, have people trust tools like Tor and VPNs allow them to be free and anonymous, then focus on Tor and VPNs users&#39; activity. Maybe 99% of Internet users have nothing interesting to watch.</p>

<p>Also, Snowden, along with others familiar with this subject matter, said that all Cisco equipments are bugged. And Cisco equips most of the whole Internet network.</p>

<p>I know how this all sounds, but hey, we are on the conspiracy sub aren&#39;t we ?</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies may be a great thing soon. But today, it is still unregulated, there is little to no transparency in the cryptocurrencies activity, and as a consequence much potential for fraud. I think one should exchange to bitcoin only dollars that one can afford to lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it sounds 100% reasonable. It has been my attitude that anything online is monitored and tracked, even if one takes at face value that TOR still isn&#39;t compromised (we don&#39;t), it seems practically inevitable that it will eventually be cracked, in which case they could figure out past activity anyway.</p>

<p>I agree with you that just following the narrative at face value doesn&#39;t really make logical sense if you spend a few minutes thinking about it. Tor/ VPNs do kind of act as a filter. You hear about a lot of nefarious shit on TOR, and one has to be some kind of moron not to think that law enforcement isn&#39;t all over the place there, if only doing undercover stuff. On top of the fact that it seems at the very very least plausible that activity can be tracked on there.</p>

<p>While legally speaking going after these networks just based on people wishing to remain anonymous seems to be an egregious violation of innocent until proven guilty, 4th amendment, that has not stopped the NSA from just collecting as much shit as possible. I&#39;ve heard rumors and read some things, I&#39;d have to go back and look, of law enforcement using illegal searches and then finding a loophole to get it into court. They have these secret courts which are a disgusting concept in and of themselves in the supposed land of the free.</p>

<p>As for VPNs, specifically, I don&#39;t know anything about them. I would think that it just depends on the VPN, some might be more resistant to .gov than others. but idk. I don&#39;t have a reason to use one.</p>

<p>The young Reddit CEO gave some creepy ass interview once where he was promoting his deep knowledge of his users. </p>

<p>All of the major companies, the NSA has stuff installed that just tracks and stores all traffic. Cisco, yea, probably. I just assume they have this stuff in everything and there is evidence of this. </p>
