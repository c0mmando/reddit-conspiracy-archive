       Everything now is a social issue that didn't need addressing and a coked out of his mind seeming press secretary.   Maybe the coke and crazy interview he gave are completely staged.   The right loves the shit like James O'Keefe does, and that comes off about as Archie Bunker as this current shit does.

       Trump has people from professional wrestling in his higher ups.    He paid politicians for years to get what he wanted.  He bought himself the White House.  He's going to give us one hell of a show.  Best ever.   Top rated presidency, many smart people are saying so..

       I'm every bit as pissed at the left and at the ineffectiveness of not having something more like a parliament representing various interests, not just two views and corporate interests.   Direct voting, flat taxes.      The right to have machine guns and explosives to guard your marijuana plants that are legal.    Stop wars and rebuild infrastructure.  Give young people the benefits of the military without the burden of being shot at or shooting at people to get a future.   Let people the fuck alone for a while.   Not that I'm expecting anything like that.  I ran away to Alaska 20 years ago this summer.   It's as good as distancing yourself from America you can get without a passport.  I hear Hawaii is pretty good that way too.   I'm looking into Puerto Rico or Portugal or Samoa or somewhere for retirement.   Been employed for 35 years at 48, just fucking done with it all.  I like walking in the woods a lot.

       It's not the quality of the hotel of the hotel or the resort, it's about how cheaply you can make it look like Rome.   Trump Steaks.  Trump Wine.  Trump Hotels.  Trump Presidency.   Number of wins, not what value they hold.

       Exactly.   I strongly considered the military when I dropped out of college to try something else,  but there was shit in the military that didn't appeal to me at the time. More power to those who chose it.   If I had known about Coast Guard, I probably would have joined that. I went a different way.   Life's like that.
