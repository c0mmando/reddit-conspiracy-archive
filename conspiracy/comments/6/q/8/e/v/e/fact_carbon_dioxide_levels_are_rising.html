       There is no evidence that CO2 is bringing us to extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was "evidence" that it was causing the drought in California and they would never have water again...
      </p>
      <p>
       Except, there has always been droughts in California and the water levels are back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence that it makes hotter places hotter, and hotter places cooler, and hotter places having no change. Which amounts to no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only independent means of measuring whether or not CO2 is causing the warming was stated to be the "hotspot". The hotspot has never been found. No evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may jibber-jabber about oh but there is a hotspot! No there isn't. They changed the criteria and then used a statistical tool called origins which can give you anything you want, i.e. it's useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after your jibber-jabber, your back to no unordinary manifestations of calamities as were predicted, for example, by Hansen in 1987 of NYC being underwater in 25 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead what you have is Hansen now saying...NYC will be underwater in...25 years.

       Oh, you know what, I was mincing words. You're correct in that there's no evidence that states it will lead us to extinction—it's a prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, there should be some area for discussion regarding humanity's march towards extinction in general. Surely you can agree with me that we're likely to be our own undoing?

       How so?
      </p>
      <p>
       We were likely to be our own undoing according to Erhlich in his "Population Bomb". He is famous for having been wrong about every single prediction he ever made. And not in a small way.
      </p>
      <p>
       During that period, almost all ways of measuring human existence have improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doomsday predictions have existed since crops experienced rain during harvest and a guy blamed it on another guy who had a wife that was too hot. They have never come true. Killing the guy and fucking his wife did nothing to improve the likelihood that rain wouldn't fall during the next harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to have a discussion on a conspiracy sub about our march towards human degradation, perhaps you may want to discuss people like the Rockefeller and their affiliated groups who all push their hundred trillion dollar climate change scheme and how people could instead be empowered to determine their destiny instead of being lead by power obsessed psychopaths.

       Well given that when we breath we extract oxygen from the atmosphere and release carbon dioxide I assumed it was obvious that as carbon dioxide levels increase, we begin to suffer in various ways. Setting aside climate change, do you agree that increased carbon dioxide indoors already impacts cognition?

      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that the oxygen/ carbon dioxide cycle in the human body is a little more complex than it first appears.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything about the carbon tax scheme but I don't think individuals should be taxed directly. Tax the producers who produce carbon dioxide, and let them pass the costs to consumers, or fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we may possibly be incorrect about the fundamental causes of climate change, however I also believe that extreme weather events are on the rise globally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that carbon dioxide caused a previous Great Extinction

       Maybe in the worst case scenarios. But raising ambient global CO2 level from 0.035 to 0.04% isn't the cause.

      <p>
       Your belief isn't supported by fact. We have media that will spend days promoting a weather event, only for the weather event not to happen. So, certainly, due to greater information access and the form of our media ("if it bleeds, it leads") you are hearing a lot more about weather events, but both the rate and severity of weather events has not increased.

      <p>
       Which producers don't create CO2 and what alternatives are available?
      </p>
      <p>
       Solar panels in Germany save 85% of the CO2 it takes to make them. Tidal cost my province nearly $1b already and was only in operation for a few months after years of delays.
      </p>
      <p>
       It powers 500 homes. 25% of the population of my province suffer energy poverty. No wonder when we pend billions upon billions on projects not trying to make energy affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The means we do have of limiting CO2 output, nuclear, is "off the table" for climate change advocates. In fact, they want France to reduce its use of nuclear.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you are ensuring that the cost will be passed onto the consumer. Of course, 50% of Canadians couldn't face an extra $200 bill as is, but you want to increase the costs of living for an imaginary idea?

       I think that the costs of living are going to increase one way or another. I think that when it comes to policy related to climate change or the environment the policy should reflect the state of the art of scientific knowledge. If our best minds say that carbon dioxide output needs to be reduced, then yes I think it should get more expensive to output carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The generations after the baby boomers have been shafted economically and environmentally, yes they have. The solution is not to kick the can down the road to the next generation. We should do our best to leave this tiny blue marble at least a little better than we found it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Ontario, more than 50% of our province's energy comes from nuclear power. Yes there is waste, and yes that is a form of kicking the can down the road but it beats coal and oil hands down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to another NASA article which indicates that extreme weather is indeed increasing: it discusses a number of different weather related studies and describes that extreme weather events are indeed on the rise, and that temperatures are hotter, storms are wetter, windier, and intensify faster. In general, I don't think that you can deny the increase in extreme weather; it is accepted as fact. Whether you can attribute specific events to global warming
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       debatable! I would even go so far as to agree with you somewhat, if you were to say: it is debatable that man is directly responsible for the current increases of carbon dioxide in the air. However, I must insist that you examine this statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        both the rate and severity of weather events has not increased.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I do not believe this is the voice of a reasonable man.

       Now I should pay a carbon tax?

       So certainly, the government will stop taking a 50% tax on oil while the producers make a few percent profit.

      <p>
       Certainly you will stop using it.

       You get your facts from those who have been shown to alter their data to fit an agenda, and then you expect people not just comply to the laws of the state, but want to fucking thought police people too?

       We put in scrubbers, but that wasn't good enough, we funded and encouraged people to transition to natural gas, and then when they did, we allowed the prices to be tripled. We have the greatest per capita of natural gas in Canada, and yet let foreigners set our prices. We tell people to use renewables, but then let the energy monopoly decide who can and then add taxes upon taxes to make a transition impossible. We fund the "energy efficiency audits" and then charge 4k to install a heat pump which costs $20 in China to have installed, and pay for it with our tax dollars. We spent 1.5 billion on to transmit "clean energy" so that we can have our energy rates increased. We spent nearly a billion on tidal power which powered 500 homes for a few months before being taken offline.
      </p>
      <p>
       What more do you want?
      </p>
      <p>
       50% of Canadians can't afford a $200 bill outside of their normal 173% of disposable income spending. 25% of my province suffers energy poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, what the fuck do you want?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, just a carbon tax so that we can decrease our purchasing power. Thanks. Go jerk-off over your altered data.

       I get the distinct impression that it doesn't matter what I say; you will never change your opinion under any circumstances. That's fine. However, I just stumbled over this recent study that was relevant to the discussion; I think it's the first study of this kind. I thought I'd link to it so that you can tell me to fuck off some more.

       It looked to me as if your questions were rhetorical; I didn't think you actually wanted an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that the government, in particular Ontario is completely screwing up when it comes to being responsible with taxpayer money and electric power, however at least we don't burn coal anymore, and the air is the cleanest it's been in decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it matters what I want, or what you want. I think that green solutions are costly in comparison to gas, especially when replacement batteries are factored in, and environmental costs of producing solar arrays etc. I think that power is going to keep getting more expensive, and quality of life will go down although there may be one step forward , two steps back. Batteries and solar are getting cheaper but raw materials are getting scarcer. I think that anyone who thinks that life is hard today in Canada is not going to do very well as life is only going to get harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I really don't like your tone of voice. I offered you a scientific study that was new information related to the topic at hand.

      <p>
       Honestly? I just want the general public to realize that the current level of resource consumption and economic paradigm is not sustainable; that's all. What they do with this information is up to them. In case I didn't say it before I don't think that a carbon tax directly on consumers is reasonable. I do think that carbon production and environmental degradation should be taxed, and the funds used to better the environment. Yes the government makes an awful lot of wasteful mistakes, but I still think we have to try to clean up our mess.

       Perhaps you should read your own links. I will highlight the part you may find of value:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.0 lifetime    no detectable limitations
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you have of something called "peak oil". What this means, and I am sorry but I feel you need it explained, is when half of oil has been consumed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manmade CO2 emissions from 1880 to now have increased the atmospheric concentration of ambient CO2 from 0.029% to 0.04%.
      </p>
      <p>
       While peak oil cannot be fully ascertained due to unknown reserves, we often hear that we have reached or approaching it. In other words, about half of our oil (with coal as well) has lead to an increase of 110 ppm. Using the other half will put us at around 0.05% if the relationship is linear. Or, at half the level of which their are no detectable problems.

       or 20% oxygen, 80% co2 would work in your opinion?

       Now I should pay a carbon tax?

      <p>
       So certainly, the government will stop taking a 50% tax on oil while the producers make a few percent profit.

      <p>
       Certainly you will stop using it.
      </p>

       You get your facts from those who have been shown to alter their data to fit an agenda, and then you expect people not just comply to the laws of the state, but want to fucking thought police people too?

       Fuck off.

       We put in scrubbers, but that wasn't good enough, we funded and encouraged people to transition to natural gas, and then when they did, we allowed the prices to be tripled. We have the greatest per capita of natural gas in Canada, and yet let foreigners set our prices. We tell people to use renewables, but then let the energy monopoly decide who can and then add taxes upon taxes to make a transition impossible. We fund the "energy efficiency audits" and then charge 4k to install a heat pump which costs $20 in China to have installed, and pay for it with our tax dollars. We spent 1.5 billion on to transmit "clean energy" so that we can have our energy rates increased. We spent nearly a billion on tidal power which powered 500 homes for a few months before being taken offline.
      </p>
      <p>
       What more do you want?
      </p>
      <p>
       50% of Canadians can't afford a $200 bill outside of their normal 173% of disposable income spending. 25% of my province suffers energy poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, what the fuck do you want?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, just a carbon tax so that we can decrease our purchasing power. Thanks. Go jerk-off over your altered data.
