<p>*British baby Charlie Gard, who was at the center of a legal battle that captured the world&#39;s attention, died Friday, one week before his first birthday</p>

<p>*Charlie was born on August 4, 2016, seemingly healthy. But two months into his short life his parents noticed his health was declining. They took him to London&#39;s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in October where he remained at least until Thursday</p>

<p>*He was diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and loss of motor skills. Charlie was the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with the disease, according to his parents</p>

<p><em>As the disease progressed, Charlie became weaker, losing the ability to move his arms or legs or breathe, and he experienced seizures. *</em>He was then placed on a ventilator that was breathing for him**</p>

<p>*Through their own research, Charlie&#39;s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States doing research on an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy who was willing to treat Charlie</p>

<p><em>At the end of January, Charlie&#39;s parents launched a GoFundMe page to raise money to bring Charlie to the United States for that treatment. In three months, they exceeded their Â£1.3 million ($1.65 million) goal to cover the costs, *but the hospital stepped in and opposed this effort, stating that it was not in the best interest of their patient</em></p>

<p><em>In February, the hospital decided, based on Charlie&#39;s status, that treatment was unlikely to benefit Charlie. Unable to agree, *the hospital went to court to have a judge decide, hoping to be able to remove Charlie from life support</em></p>

<p><em>In April, *the UK High Court ruled that it was in the infant&#39;s best interest for his treating clinicians to remove the ventilator keeping him alive. That decision was then backed by the European Court of Human Rights in June, which ruled not to intervene in the case. This was upheld by a British Supreme Court decision that the hospital could discontinue life support to Charlie and he could not be transferred to the US or elsewhere</em>.
The emotional case then went to the UK High Court last week after the hospital requested another hearing to consider &quot;new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition.&quot;</p>

<p>*That new evidence, came in part from Hirano who testified that there was an 11% to 56% chance Charlie could show clinically significant improvement if treated. Hirano came to London, evaluated Charlie and spoke with those who had been treating him and other experts.  Hirano came to London, evaluated Charlie and spoke with those who had been treating him and other experts</p>

<p>*On Monday, Charlie&#39;s parents gave up their fight to take Charlie to the US after new brain and muscle scans revealed their son had deteriorated and was therefore less likely to benefit from the experimental treatment, while his doctors and parents battled in court. Too much time had passed.</p>

<p>*On Thursday, with the hospital and Charlie&#39;s parents still at an impasse, the judge&#39;s order to remove life support and move Charlie to hospice took effect</p>

<p>*Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn&#39;t save you. We had the chance but we weren&#39;t allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight our beautiful little boy,&quot; Charlie&#39;s parents said in a statement after they gave up their fight.</p>

<p>TL;DR - nasty government wouldn&#39;t let this family get lifesaving medical treatment for their baby, orders the baby&#39;s breathing tube removed.</p>

<p>At what cost to the patient?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost to the patient, an adult Charlie Gard saved by the treatment would have grown up with no memory of this time and would tell you he is grateful that there was never an evil breathing-tube removing government that prevented his parents from giving him the treatment that saved his life.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t even thinking real basic.  Like human basic.  Let&#39;s imagine you are in nature and see a Pride of Lions.  Bunch of Lionesses and their cubs out on the savannah.  One of the cubs let&#39;s say - has something in his eye, and the lioness goes to clean it out with her tongue, as cats do in nature.  But before this can happen, a pack of hyenas comes out and separates the lioness from her cub, and prevents her for a long time from doing that thing which would heal her cub - and then the cub dies from infection/whatever.</p>

<p>Is that a raw enough analogy to you?  You can go from any point of evolution, or animal or human - you do not mess with the family.  You do not mess with their ability to care for their young.  That is an offense, even when committed by the government - that deserves immediate, lethal recourse.  This is absolutely unnacceptable and if anything is grounds for immediate storming of government and violent execution and removal and replacement of all of them, this is it!  Where is <em>your</em> outrage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know the phrase quality of life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The baby did not have the ability to communicate that it wished to endure some more pain for a time for the possible outcome of becoming cured and having a future life!  What makes you think that a brand new life would ever choose to give up so easily - and why would you give up on it?  And what does you giving up on it say about you?  </p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t matter what you or i think about the chances of this treatment are to save Charlie Gard&#39;s life.  Charlie&#39;s parents wanted to get the treatment to try for a chance, but were blocked by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>you and <a href="/u/nimsauce">/u/nimsauce</a> are arguing the same irrelevant point - because you both miss the point.</p>

<p>you are both arguing that the treatment itself wasn&#39;t going to be successful, or wasn&#39;t a valid treatment, etc.  </p>

<p>Yet both of you don&#39;t address the fact that it&#39;s the right of the family to get that medical treatment for their baby, even if it is a small chance to help.  It is <em>their</em> small chance to take, not the government&#39;s right to prevent them from their chance.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a scenario:  Your wife/dad/close-one is laying on the hospital bed.  Doctor says here i can give them this injection that has a small chance to work.  You agree, of course - as there are no other options, and you are determined to try everything to save their life.  Right before the injection happens, a governmnent man comes in with a gun and points it at your head and says that you are not allowed to have the injection given and to remove the life support system.</p>

<p>But why would I expect anyone from the UK to care about anything like this, you have lost all morality in your country, God is dead there, you have no freedom of speech, and cameras outnumber the people - a true nasty voyeur society, whose only emotional outlet is football - sad, pathetic.</p>

<li>At the first hearing in Charlieâs case in March, GOSHâs position was that every day
that passed was a day that was not in his best interests. That remains its view of his
welfare. Even now, Charlie shows physical responses to stressors that some of those
treating him interpret as pain and when two international experts assessed him last
week, they believed that they elicited a pain response. In GOSHâs view there has been
no real change in Charlieâs responsiveness since January. Its fear that his continued
existence has been painful to him has been compounded by the Judgeâs finding, in
April, that since his brain became affected by RRM2B, Charlieâs has been an existence
devoid of all benefit and pleasure. If Charlie has had a relationship with the world
around him since his best interests were determined, it has been one of suffering.</li>

<p>So the government preventing the family from getting treatment that could potentially cure the condition and remove the pain is actually correct because this is a decision for the government not the parents?</p>

<p>And while the government is blocking the family to be able to get the treatment, the baby&#39;s condition worsens along with it&#39;s chances and along with that pain of existence you keep talking about: in this case the government was the torturer and executioner.</p>

<p>You go straight to &quot;remove the breathing tube!&quot;  &quot;don&#39;t let the family get the medical treatment that they are going to pay for and the doctor agreed to do!&quot;  &quot;just let &#39;it&#39; die intead!&quot;  &quot;it&#39;s not worth it, not worth trying!&quot;  &quot;put it out of it&#39;s misery, like a broke leg horse!&quot; &quot;throw it off the cliff, dash it on the rocks!&quot; &quot;the government decides what medical care you are allowed to give your child, not the parents&quot;!</p>

<p>Holy shit, <em>no it couldn&#39;t</em>. No one claimed that. The doctor who offered the treatment didn&#39;t claim that. <em>There is no cure for this condition</em>. At best the treatment could have <em>maybe</em> halted the deterioration of Charlie&#39;s muscles - not his brain, because when used to treat patients with similar conditions the treatment had been unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. So the miracle-case scenario for this treatment was keeping Charlie&#39;s body alive on life support for a few more months while his brain gradually turned to soup.</p>

<p>A lot more could have been done sooner if the government did not get involved.</p>

<p>How do you think any progress in medicine happens, you never know there could have been miracle that happened in the meantime of helping his muscles with some other treatment used etc - you never know!  And if there is something that can help in the meantime it should be used to help, there is no reason to hasten death and it sounds like it would have been more humane - even given your argument about medical limitations - to let his brain melt to soup as you say than have that happen plus the muscle issues and breathing tube removal.  It is easy to use your own argument&#39;s emotional foundation to show you how your own argument is disingenuous</p>

<p>Maybe because that&#39;s not true? Children are not property. They are individual people with their own rights, and parents have a responsibility of care for them - not a &quot;right&quot; to do what they want with them. In this case the parents wanted to use their son as a lab rat, and the judge concluded based on all the available evidence that doing so would give him no benefit and carried a risk of causing him greater suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That post title is a complete lie and you should be fucking ashamed of yourself. The baby had an incredibly rare, degenerative, incurable genetic disease. The &quot;treatment&quot; that was available would not have helped. The doctor who claimed it had a chance of helping Charlie did so before bothering to actually look at any of his medical records, and when Great Ormond Street Hospital invited him in January to come and examine the baby, he failed to do so. He only actually showed up in July because the judge ordered him to do so, at which point he admitted that Charlie was beyond help.</p>

<p>These parents were in massive denial, chasing an impossible dream of having a healthy child, and their pursuit of that dream could have ended up causing even greater suffering for Charlie - who would have been dead months ago were it not for the machines he was hooked up.  </p>

<p>The courts made the right call, and the people who hijacked this story for their own political agenda are absolute pieces of shit.</p>

<p>So the right of the government is to remove your dreams?  They have authority over your own dreams, now?  Your baby is on the ground, heart not beating.  Doctor comes out of the crowd, says he knows CPR.  You say please do this thing to save my baby, even if there is only a small chance it will work.   Then the government man comes in with a gun and steps between the parents and the doctor, and prevents any access to the baby.  The baby is dying, heart not beating - the parents are screaming at the government man with the gun to move move move out of the way and please let the doctor through.  The doctor says please move if you move i can start to try and the sooner the better.  The government man with the gun doesn&#39;t move.  He sits on the baby and smothers its chest until it stops breathing, and tells the parents and the doctor and all the horrified onlookers that he just did a very good thing by putting the baby out of it&#39;s misery.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re trolling at this point, but yes- I get emotional about dying babies being caused unnecessary additional suffering, and absolute pieces of shit like you capitalizing on that suffering for the sake of some stupid political agenda. You are deliberately ignoring everyone who has explained to you why the treatment had no hope of working.

<p>hey by that logic: &quot;we are all dying the moment we are conceived, and therefore all life should be exterminated at conception to prevent unnecessary suffering as buddha said life is suffering therefore the solution is no life&quot;  do you hear yourself?  you are like that apocolyptic singularity AI nightmare elon musk talks about - a program code gone wrong from misinterpreting different datasets and becoming the biggest threat to humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You fail to mention (or maybe you don&#39;t know?) that the trip to the US would have been too hard on Charlie.  Additionally, the treatment would have, at best, only prolonged his suffering.  At what point shouldn&#39;t someone stand up for what&#39;s best for Charlie?  We expect that to be the parents but, as a parent myself, I know we aren&#39;t always in the right frame of mind to do so.</p>

<p>No, the government shouldn&#39;t be in charge of our decisions but this is not the case on which to build a foundation for debate. In regards to Charlie, the judge saved the parents more grief than they realized and did what truly was in Charlie&#39;s best interest.</p>

<p>If you want instances of government making the wrong decisions in regards to children and parents, look no farther than Child Protective Services in America.  There you will find stories that will rip your heart out and make you so angry you want to punch someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have painted an extremely biased picture of the facts here to support your notion that government were responsible for the death of Charlie Gard.</p>

<p>The NHS were seeking ethical approval for nucleotide treatment until Charlie suffered a series of catastrophic seizures around December 2016. At which point the people in the most informed position , the doctors treating him, made the decision that it was not in Charlie&#39;s best interest to continue with any further treatments. </p>

<p>The parents disagreed, the courts were used to make an impartial decisuon. The judge had one factor in mind, the welfare of the child. They looked at the evidence available and agreed with GOSH. The parents refused any further MRI scans, and the doctor offering the treatment refused GOSH&#39;s invitation in January to come and examine the child himself, or as it transpires read any of his contemporaries medical reports. It also transpires that he holds a financial interest in the treatment. </p>

<p>There was no verifiable evidence that the treatment would have any effect, and a greater body of solid evidence that Charlie was experiencing pain and in such a fragile, irreversible state that moving him to another continent would pose a very real risk of causing him further prolonged suffering, and and even worse demise than he already faced.</p>

<p>GOSH saves, prolongs, and improves the quality of life of thousands of horribly sick children every year. It also makes the hard decisions, like this one, of when the best path for a child is as untraumatic and least painful death as possible. The idea that they would wilfully do something not in a child&#39;s best interest is absurd,  and an insult to the staff and other families who go they interact with.</p>
