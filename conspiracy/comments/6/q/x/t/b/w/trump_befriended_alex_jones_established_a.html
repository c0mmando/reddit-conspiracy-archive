    <div class="md"><p>While I disagree with a lot of what is going on in the Trump administration, I believe that they get enough negative press as is, there would be nothing unique for me to add.</p>

<p>The issues I feel are underrepresented are those which I give my attention to. Libs and Dems are less likely to view their own politicians and their own agencies as corrupt, even though they are pretty blatant. I think politicians need to be held accountable. I identify as a liberal but I can&#39;t stand what the left has become. All of the sudden liberals don&#39;t care about accountability, they are being led around like sheep, this is what scares me the most. I used to think only conservatives were stupid, but now I realize that it&#39;s everyone.</p>

<p>If Trump committed the same crimes that Hillary had then the media would have a field day. I still can&#39;t figure out why Hillary got off scott free after breaking the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way of knowing if it was astroturfed into relevance by people trying to help Trump by hurting the DNC. There&#39;s no way of knowing if he had a hand in the strategy either.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned in the OP, he&#39;s capable of peddling conspiracies that benefit him. He&#39;s the one that opened his mouth publically about JFK and Cruz&#39;s dad. He smartened up after they called him on it by layering himself between his smear tactics. Cruz was convinced that the unfaithful/cheating allegations were started by Trump, but Trump didn&#39;t open his mouth about it. Instead a close tabloid of Trump did the work for him.</p>

<p>What we do know is that there&#39;s a serious allegation from Wheeler and a confession from a close Trump alley that he used Trump&#39;s name to sway Wheeler into doing his bidding. He covers Trump&#39;s ass by saying that he wasn&#39;t serious, but again... how much leeway are we giving here? There&#39;s a history and no signs of change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the GOP had Seth Rich killed, then I think the DNC would be more cooperative in the investigation.  Instead, they are stonewalling to the point that the DC chief of police resigned.  The DNC will not let anyone look at Seth&#39;s computers or phones, and they will not answer questions regarding who was with him that night.  The DNC story, I believe, is that it was a random act of violence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich was not killed a robbery, he was assassinated. Following the motive is extremely typical in any investigation wither it be by the cops or anyone with a vested interest. What is odd is that there seems to be a very well orchestrated plan to attack anyone who reports any part of it, and of-course we know what happens when they try to play that game. You get more and more people thinking they are on to something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way of knowing if it was astroturfed into relevance by people trying to help Trump by hurting the DNC. There&#39;s no way of knowing if he had a hand in the strategy either.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned in the OP, he&#39;s capable of peddling conspiracies that benefit him. He&#39;s the one that opened his mouth publically about JFK and Cruz&#39;s dad. He smartened up after they called him on it by layering himself between his smear tactics. Cruz was convinced that the unfaithful/cheating allegations were started by Trump, but Trump didn&#39;t open his mouth about it. Instead a close tabloid of Trump did the work for him.</p>

<p>What we do know is that there&#39;s a serious allegation from Wheeler and a confession from a close Trump alley that he used Trump&#39;s name to sway Wheeler into doing his bidding. He covers Trump&#39;s ass by saying that he wasn&#39;t serious, but again... how much leeway are we giving here? There&#39;s a history and no signs of change. </p>
