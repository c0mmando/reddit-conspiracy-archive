       Yeah, I'm just always reluctant to assume I'm smarter. I might think I'm seeing their true motivations, but I could just be falling for the tricks.

       I mean, what if they hid the truth by actually posting the truth knowing we would never agree with them. I doubt it, but still I try to remember that I know nothing.

       I think that the people who hold power are very, very smart and talented at manipulating the public. The fact that I am a conspiracy theorist does not make me immune to this. So when someone posts something that confirms my beliefs I try to ask myself if I'm just being manipulated. Even the truth could be used to hide the truth. How? Well let's say you have a secret that you think will get out. You could try leaking that secret to a despised group- like white supremacists- so that any normal person will be convinced it's just a right wing plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't going to leave anything to chance. All of us fit into one or more boxes and they have plans in place to manipulate each of those boxes.
      </p>

       Edward Bernays was the godfather of propaganda and he wrote some good books on the subject. He covers all of this, although he was in favor of it because he felt people should be manipulated for the greater good

       I don't have much reason to believe they are doing that. Bad news about Trump is always on the front page of this subreddit, as it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people posting articles saying FOX and Trump made up the Seth Rich conspiracy are clearly full of shit. I've been following the story for far longer than Trump has even been aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean that Trump and Co aren't pushing the story. Seth Rich was obviously murdered for betraying the DNC. Pushing that story distracts from Trump's problems, and so I of course he is pushing it. But he didn't invent it. Whoever murdered Seth Rich invented it.

       Nobody is saying he made up the Seth conspiracy. The story is he colluded with Fox news to push the story to get heat off him and Russia. It's also eye opening that Seth Wheeler was used as a pawn in this whole thing both by Fox and by the white house.

       No that's not obvious. As far as we know, he was murdered in a botched robbery. The idea that the DNC was involved is a conspriacy theory.

       It's obvious that his murder was not some random street violence, but rather an assassination. You are right that the connection to the DNC is only circumstantial and not obvious - my apologies for saying that. I don't know who else would have a reason to assassinate him, but that is besides the point.

       I'm pretty cynical about things though. If we did catch his murderer I expect he would get off. The prosecutor and judges would be on the take. It's great that we have a glimpse into the corrupt machine that runs things, but I don't think awareness alone will take it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't think anything will take it down. If someone came up with rock solid proof of what is going on and convinced every American that they are ruled by organized crime... the criminals would just crack down on us until they raised a new generation that believed a new set of lies.

       Pretty negative attitude, that's not how shillary was defeated. When they catch Seth Rich's murder, and they will, we will see what happens next. Beware all you hit men from SEIU, the police are onto you.

       HRC losing the election to Trump has changed nothing. What do I care who wears the crown? They don't rule anything.

      <p>
       We are still funding ISIS. The Pharmaceutical industry still keeps everyone poor and sick. We are still destroying the planet. The poor are still kept poor. WWIII is still being pursued.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even assume that HRC was supposed to win. Trump winning has left us even more polarized than we were before. That's what the elites want. Whether accident or not, Trump is a godsend for TPTB.

       Yeah it couldn't possibly be that people are coming in to see if anyone here is even considering the possibility of a Trump conspiracy. Must be that literally anyone who dares point out all his shady shit is a shill, but all the hatred for Clintons still is totally organic and not at all manufactured outrage.

       What are you talking about? I'm talking about shills - paid operatives coming in here to fill the sub with disinformation in order to either advance their own goals, or to stymie the free discussion that happens here. You are talking about Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you think that I think people are shills only when they are anti-Trump? No, there is plenty of pro-Trump shilling. The common thread is the strawman argument and the fake camaraderie: Posts with titles like, "Hey guys, can we please get back to digging into [insert false narrative here]". Then you look at the posters history and their fakeness becomes fairly obvious. Some accounts are better than others. It's amazing how many shill account names go AdjectiveNounNumber. I guess it doesn't matter. They aren't here to convince me, they are here to convince people who want to believe their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm one of those people who believe both parties are completely fake, so I don't really care whether their BS is pro or anti Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone murdered Seth Rich though, and it looks like people in power are doing everything they can to cover up that murder. Trying to tie this to Trump is just a pathetic attempt to distract, or at least give themselves a bit of plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that the emails Seth leaked weren't even that damning. It's always the coverup that brings criminals down. The DNC could have just said, "We're really sorry for collusion with CNN. We fired this production assistant to show how sorry we are." And the story would have gone away.

       Seth Rich probably was offed by the Clinton Cartel and Trump is an idiot who probably did collude with Russia among many other nations

       I was mostly wondering about the Seth Rich/Awan connection, but honestly it could be anything. My point is just that there is a dramatic increase in posts that are slying pushing mainstream narratives. Hence the hitting a nerve comment.

       I'm sure there is an uptick any time something "big" goes down. I see your side of it and that makes total sense. To me as the population of this sub has steadily increased, so has the potential for shilling and the potential of this sub hitting nerves which it does all the time. This is one of the most hated ridiculed subs on this site, so I guess you could say r/conspiracy has always been onto something and there has literally been a conspiracy underway to steer control and undermine it. Have an upvote.
