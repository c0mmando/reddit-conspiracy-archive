       For the first time in history,
       <em>
        it seems
       </em>
       , scientists have measured how FLAT the Earth is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be no curvature in any of the states they measured
      </p>
      <p>
       They are indeed as flat as flat can be.

        Their focus was
        <strong>
         human perception of flatness
        </strong>
        —since the point of the study, Dobson told me, was largely to combat public perceptions about Kansas’s flatness. (Those translate, he says, to public perceptions about Kansas’s boringness.) To estimate geographical flatness as perceived by the human eye, Dobson and Campbell put math behind the experience of looking toward the horizon and seeing a rise of land (in their case, to the height of a tall tree at a distance of three miles). From there, Dobson says, “we put together a simulation”—one that approximates “what you would see if were standing on one spot, and turning around 360 degrees, and recording what you see every 16 times as you turn around.”

       Your shaky understanding of basic geological principals was rampantly and painfully obvious from the beginning, to the point where it looks like you're just a rhetoric troll.

      <p>
       If you want to be able to entertain a theory you need at least a functional knowledge of the terminology to be able to progress from theory to practicality, or else it just looks like your a copypasta.

       So a measured line from one point of the Earth in 360° - measured every 100-1000ft or so [to compensate for the relative perspective] would not show curvature?

       I answered three questions of yours that demonstrated your own lack of understanding in the material you were attempting to demonstrate knowledge in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not anyone elses responsibility to do the basic elementary work for your own questions except for you, nor is it their responsibility to hold your hand while you do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain why you think your questions are relevant and not actually a failed understanding?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. Because you're just repeating other peoples failed works.  They aren't even your own thoughts on the matter.

       You don't even engage, you just continue with your script like every other roleplayer.

       Look at the way you used my own words to continue to your disconnected line of questioning. You didn't even have a theoretical grasp of what they mean to apply them to the geometry you've been told means something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention your misapplications of the socratic method.   You can teach through asking questions, but you have to have a wide breadth to support those questions as being worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       You demonstrated that you lacked that ability.  It calls in to question as to wether these are your own thoughts at all, or just the way you waste your life.

       Intelligence is your ability to gather information.  Intellect is your ability to whittle down that information in to data.  Wisdom is being about to use that data to make the right choice in the real world.

       If people believe a lie about the very nature of their reality they will accept any belief. Removing logical thinking operations from the brain. Not saying the Earth is flat, but also do not believe its the simple sphere presentation given.

       simple answer. From a child you are disconnected from your own senses and taught to believe whatever the system says regardless of what your senses tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really understand how someone could be upside down in Australia?  How water sticks to the "globe" despite the lack of a small scale experiment proving the same thing? countless other unanswered questions all can be answered with lies or trust your senses.

       yes it does. why doesn't the earth move under you when you jump or get on a plane? why doesn't the  atmosphere get sucked into the vacuum of space and vacuum has to be sealed from the non vacuum.
we can't see the curve unless you trust nasa "photos". horizon always rises to eye level.

       Science needs to be repeatable, agree? Show me anywhere else in nature, or create yourself, a differential pressure system that does not equalize without a barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because thats what you believe in when you say gravity holds in our atmo-"sphere" against the vacuum of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cannot recreate that, and still believe gravity to be the answer to why our air stays in place, then your beliefs are not scientific.

       If you're on top of a truck and jump, the truck won't move under you either (to the small extent it does it's because of air resistance).

       That's like saying "why isn't there a crocoduck" - you can't refute mainstream science by challenging statements that
       <em>
        no one's ever made
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is very weak compared to magnetism, I'm not sure if you can get that kind of effect out in space - and down on earth, earth's gravity is stronger than the basketball do you get that?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you can easily do that with magnets.
      </p>

       Why do

       It takes about 6 hours to fly across the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your flat earth map is correct it would take 10 times that time to fly from Auckland to Santiago.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that it would tale about 60 hours to fly from Auckland to Santiago on a flat Earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple airlines can make that flight in less than 13 hours, what is correct if Earth is spherical:

       So why can I see objects that have disappeared when I increase my elevation?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example. If a Ship sails over the horizon one way to bring it back into view is to increase my elevation. Shouldnt this be impossible if haze was the reason why it was obscured?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im still seeing as far if not further but for some reason an increase in elevation will bring objects into view that according to you are obscured by atmo.

       Because increasing your elevation means you can see further because the Earth is a globe.

       What youre saying makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the reason vision is limited on a FE is because of the "haze" as you call it then elevation should have little affect on the total distance I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see further because a higher elevation increases your total line of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pause and think about what youre saying. As for my quick math (And I would like to see yours) density isnt affected until 8km so everything under that should adhere to your theory that haze is to blame, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude we are talking an elevation of 10 feet can bring ships over the horizon into view, how much less dense is the air at 10ft vs ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did you come to your calculations? Or at the very least if you dont know the math where can I find your source?

       So you dont know or dont understand fully how to tell me why a raise in elevation of only several feet grants me additional sight.

       You are either wrong or at the very least ignorant to your own arguments.

       Why's it spamming just because you disagree with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular redditor may have strong beliefs that the world is infact not flat. So he wants to offer counter evidence to your post whenever you post.

       He is just countering your point. So what if its copy and pasted. If it is direct evidence against your claims, then why would he need to alternate it every time you post a non-alternating claim of the earth being flat?

       Nah let him post. Someone will always counter his arguments in claims. This way lurkers aren't just inundated with self reinforcement that. And if we maliciously follow his account, we will be demonized only making their claims seem more substantial.

       So, I don't believe in homeopathy but I will gladly use the homeopathic model to prove that the levels of dilution they are claiming for their treatments amount to less than one molecule in the known universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Bible is a work of fiction but I will gladly cite Bible passages to cast doubt on how Adam and Eve were the only people on Earth and had only two sons but later in Genesis it describes Cain and Able marrying women from somewhere else.

       I have never mapped out the world and the position and shape of the continents on my own, and it is a lot more difficult than most people think.

       You don't think the almighty Creator may have created another woman later in time? The Bible does not say Adam and Eve were the only people ever created, just the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it was just Cain who married, Abel died. Try reading the Bible before you find "faults" in its logic.

       If you really believed this to be the case there is a relatively easy and affordable way to test for the curvature of the earth.

       For fucks sake, this is like a high school science fair project these days and all you need is around 200 bucks, and an iq of 80. If you pass around a hat at your next dipshits anonymous meeting I'm sure you could scrounge up the money... I mean debt. The second requirement might be a little harder to come by, but you could try hanging out around the special education department at your local jr high with a bag of candy and trick one of the dumber ones into helping you.

       Actually, where I live, launching a balloon is illegal, as are drones.
This is a new law.
Im sure it has nothing to do with the growing number of flat Earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is sad that all posts countering a flat Earth argument seem always include some king of low brow "your an idiot" insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just cant be mature about this can you?
      </p>
      <p>
       All NASA shills? No. But do you honestly think every news article on the interwebz is telling the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the first link you posted. Why is that string so bendy? Im sure whatever is making the string bendy could not possible effect the horizon and make it look curvy as well.... could it?
