       So a few weeks back WH Anon claimed that there would be a series of events around July 27. There have been significant developments over the past few days, in my opinion. We've had a story break regarding Fusion GPS and the Russia narrative being spun around at the Democrats, we've had house Republicans hijack a bill at the last minute and specifically add language to target Comey, Clinton, Rice, Lynch, etc. But, before that happened, we saw Imran Awan apprehended by law enforcement as he attempted to flee the country. Or so they claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       These events appear significant enough to me and have validated WH Anon. WH Anon knew that something was coming around this time. My theory is that Imran Awan never evaded authorities. He was nabbed very quietly before he could ever flee. He was held and interrogated for some time. He cooperated so he was allowed to "attempt" to flee the country sometime this week. He went along with the plan and he was arrested. If WH Anon knew this info, he would have been able to leak to 4chan when to pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       WH Anon claimed that these events would send the United States down a very different path. It was alleged that Awan and his brothers were hacking government official  servers and providing that info to Debbie Wasserman. Additionally, there have been claims that Awan was also giving certain US  intelligence to Pakastani IS, Hesbollah, etc. If they know Awan was doing this and he was on Debbie's payroll, which he was, she's in deep shit. If they can prove she knew about it, she's in much deeper shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this is reaching, but in my opinion WH Anon has been vindicated so far.

       You're getting your timeline mixed up I think. I think they've had him since it was rumored he fled. Then they released him after getting him to cooperate. Then arrested him officially and publicly. Then released him on bail.

       So the story about the exMarine finding the hard drives is just a plot driver? PUNS heh. But seriously I find it hard to believe Awan just left that shit behind.

       I'm not sure to be honest - I wasn't following that particular sub story of this entire thing too closely. From what I understand, an ex-Marine moved into Awan's old house and stumbled upon a bunch of destroyed HDDs. Then, Awan showed up trying to get into the house to retrieve them. I'm really not sure what that's all about.
      </p>

       However, if he was truly underground, why would he risk going back to his home and causing a ruckus when he knows federal law enforcement is after him? It's a curious incident to say the least.

       White house anon is full of shit. He specifically said shit would go down last night/today. Nothing happened. Awan was arrested a few days ago. Anon said big name arrests would happen "soon." That can mean anything. It's easy to fool people on 4chan and some on here apparently. All you have to do is give gauge predictions and people will validate you if anything at all happens. I could predict that something big will happen next Tuesday and if anything happens at all, I could say I was right. Especially when you say "small things will start to build into something huge." That's basically a fortune cookie. Anyone can take a sentence like that and look for things to apply to it.

       Ok, I tend to think he's been validated but I can understand why someone else wouldn't. Regardless, I still think this theory on Awan is interesting and if true could indicate a serious sequence of events. After all, we're here to discuss conspiracy theories with each other. Not to shoot down every self post because you think op is gullible.

       So your last 3 points are all the same thing. As I said before, Awan was arrested several days ago. Why was he lubing you guys up last night? And yeah two mayors in Pennsylvania were indicted for corruption. Nobody here has ever heard of or talked about those guys. Those are the "big name" arrests? Give me a break. You know damn well you guys were expecting something to happen with Debbie WS.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for some congressmen announcing they want to investigate Clinton, that's what you were supposed to blow your load over? An announcement of an investigation that will take months if it even happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing you're applying the whole "small things will lead to something big" thing. As I said before, that's the type of shit a psychic tells you to always be right. Anybody can apply any little thing that happens and apply it. Congress has investigated Clinton a thousand times and nothing has come of it.

       Psychic analogy hits the nail on the head. A psychic works by making you connect the dots while seeming like they were leading you through it. They don't have to be accurate to keep ppl hooked, just enticing enough to make people want to believe it's real.

       Awan definitely could be a big deal, but he also might be nothing. Which would suck for people who believe there was a cover-up, since he's sort of a lynchpin in the most credible course of events.

       I do think hes a cover up. George Webb is a leftist and the Awans were guilty of bank fraud for a long time and those employing them knew it - now all this gets exposed and the DNC gets to have Awan arrested on completely unrelated charges and no one is talking about the Secretary of State admitting to arming ISIS.

       They were always known to be arming ISIS in the form of Syrian rebels. I don't think we were ar.ming them directly in Iraq or Somalia.

       Tulsi Gabbard has stated so. She was on the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Affairs Committe and Intelligence Committees as well as being the vice chair of the DNC. She is perhaps the only person as qualified as Obama or Clinton or Kerry or Clapper to make that statement and at least Clinton has stated so in documents that are now public.

       His post simply disagreed and did so in a condescending manner. I never called anyone a shill. Don't put your shit on me. Anyone can believe whatever they want on WH Anon. It wasn't the point of my thread, although my theory fits in with it because I tend to agree with him. I'd rather discuss the Awan details here. Thanks.

       No, that part makes sense, and I wouldn't be surprised if Schulz could be proven to have known and goes to jail, but tying it to "will change the face of this country" is a stretch. Not unless it gets public that all of them were sponsored by Israel or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think they would have been kept as random tech guys by most if they knew what they were doing. Schulz, tho? Nothing would surprise me about that woman.

       I swear, the naysayers are cancer to this sub I would just ignore that shit in this thread. Its like these idiots forget its r/conspiracy, where any and every theory one has should be open for discussion, not shut down by some idiot just because he refuses to believe something or not. This is the kinda divide and conquer bullshit that allows the higher powers that be continue doing everything in the dark without consequence. Keep on keeping on OPie.

       There's always a story. So simply say "something big is going to happen in a week" and then people will look for anything to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's what fucking fortune tellers and those "mediums" do. Say something vague enough and people will fill in the blanks and voila.

       And none of this came from the White House or had anything to do with the White House. Trump can't even get his advisors to work together yet you believe some aide has knowledge of the inner workings of everything somehow.

       It's laughable.

       Imran Awan is the tip of a deep dark iceberg. The House of Reps IT stuff they've done, sucking up hundreds of thousands of emails from members, all the classified emails and documents entrusted to intel committee members in particular is a big part here. The Awans clearly had important Reps on the hook, enabling them to get away with this for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is also the 11 houses owned around DC. The multiple loans they taken out on sweetheart terms from the internal House of Reps bank.The many, many businesses they registered and the list of those those that have bankrupted and defaulted on loans the Awans took out, once again from the inhouse bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the really juicy bits are that some of the businesses registered by the Awans are joint ventured with companies associated with well known swamp creatures. These joint ventures run drugs out of central asia to their consumers in the USA and europe. Others are involved in human trafficking and possibly procuring children for pedophiles. Then there are the Companies involved with human organ harvesting for fun and profit.  They also supply freshly graduated doctors from Pakistan for this kind of industrial scale looting of human organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are Awan registered Companies using diplomatic bags (actually diplomatic shipping containers) covering illegal shipping (both internationally and around the US) of uranium for conversion into depleted uranium ordinance. This one is really frightening. Do you trust Schiff or Schumer or Clinton or Obama to play nice with boatloads of uranium? Or in their mad rush to try and seize back control from Trump could they arrange a  'dirty bomb' to contaminate a port city and make a coup by COG?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally the Awans are IT people, their connection to DWS gave them access to the DNC and DCCC. It's alleged they stole the massive RGPVAN database with details on millions of US donors and Democrat registered voters. Stolen initially for Clinton and sent to the Clinton Foundation. But probably also for Pakistani ISI. the probability of this action is very high. Which leaves one wondering whether the whole hack/leak Seth Rich thing is somehow connected to the Awans also...

       This makes a lot of sense, it would be a very 4D chess/Bannon thing to do. Point is it is looking more and more like the entire Congress is so compromised and riddled with these Muslim Brotherhood types that our ability to even protect the country has been shot to hell. Martial Law? Arrest all members of Congress till they can be cleared?

       Psychic analogy hits the nail on the head. A psychic works by making you connect the dots while seeming like they were leading you through it. They don't have to be accurate to keep ppl hooked, just enticing enough to make people want to believe it's real.
