        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is not all of it. Some of the stuff was confusing so I had to ignore it. (Ie stuff on Linkin Park). </p>

<p>It looks like one of the human trafficking family names was Wasserman. </p>

<p>NASA swapped planes mid air during 9-11.</p>

<p>Dick Cheney showed the 9-11 plans to his employee that was helping with the plans and he said &quot;If you tell anyone about this, I will kill you and your family.&quot;</p>

<p>We have bases on moon and mars. </p>

<p>Catholic priests are used to smuggle guns. </p>

<p>The Israeli art students planted bombs (something about the 91st floor) in the twin towers. They also filmed and danced after they took down the buildings. Their van has an image of planes going into towers. </p>

<p>MSM knew about 9-11 as they reported on things not yet happened. </p>

<p>The 3rd tower didn&#39;t go as planned. </p>

<p>There are 200 million aliens in human form among us. </p>

<p>There&#39;s more but that&#39;s what I&#39;m grabbing after a quick scan. </p>

<p>Sessions might be some kind of double agent. </p>

<p>Matrix LLC might be a full blown CIA front that handles sessions. </p>

<p>Dems and republicans both bend the knee to a secret group called American Council of Families</p>

<p>The Russian Fertilizer Industry is controlled by the American Council of Families. </p>

<p>People from within these evil Families are seeking revenge against their own family because of the bad things they have done to them and have been working with VOTL this whole time. </p>

<p>Kushner is mentioned to have bad intentions. </p>

<p>Claims alien ships in the sky that are cloaked by changing their vibrational frequency so that the sight sense can&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>Putin considered white hat. </p>

<p>Hillary died 9-10-16. The Hillary on 9-11-16 was a malfunctioning clone. That is why she passed out. </p>

<p>Eric braveman is dead and what we see is a clone. </p>

<p>The Nazca mummy is real and cabal wants to deligitamize it. </p>

<p>Podesta is Chester Berintons father and he will go down this year. </p>

<p>Worldcorp is a white hat operation. </p>

<p>The suspected John Podesta abuse video is actually John Podesta. </p>

<p>The Podesta brothers took Madeline McCann. </p>

<p>Kill rooms for children exist all over the world including D.C.  </p>

<p>Podesta and deep state members in large Satan club. </p>

<p>Podesta offers children to powerful people. </p>

<p>JP ASH is John Podestas alias. </p>

<p>Some popular names in the Satan worshipping cult include Schumer, Clinton, Weiner, Pelosi, Biden, McCain, Graham, almost everyone at CNN, some late night TV hosts, and plenty in Hollywood. </p>

<p>Soros is high level cabal but there are 4 people above him that happen to be very, very old. </p>

<p>Also, here is a list of current happenings:</p>

<p>DWS/AWAN Story; congressional call for investigation into Comey/Clinton/Lynch; FBI lawyer being investigated; deputy AG in Cali busted for CP.</p>

<p>Images of email. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/46j7R">https://m.imgur.com/a/46j7R</a></p>

<p>Note: VOTL and the Anons are saying they were hoping for bolder happenings today but some things didn&#39;t go as planned but they all claim the DWS Awan scandal is going to spark the downfall of the DNC especially now that it was broadcasted on Fix News earlier today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so lets start with the basics. 1 - you cannot <strong>know</strong> without observation. 2 - all belief without observation is merely belief.</p>

<p>This is a philosophical axiom that cannot be falsified. It&#39;s truth.</p>

<p><strong>Awareness</strong> can be defined as the true information people store as &quot;knowledge.&quot; False truth would be a lack of awareness. Essentially a gang banger in Chicago could have more awareness than a banker who&#39;s afraid of the CEO. It&#39;s relative to the individual. The world you live in either has truth and awareness or false awareness and false truth.</p>

<p>In this sense its actually more likely for someone to <em>know god</em> [since its a personal experience] than it is for you to <em>know</em> 1% of the reality you live in. Because you aren&#39;t exploring or trying to understand it. And you certainly aren&#39;t observing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are talking about &quot;statements&quot; but epistemology is about personal or cultural observations. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t prove a personal observation is false. You can prove its true.</p>

<p>Looking back at my response its actually not far from what you seem to be projecting [from my perspective]. My only point was that someone could say <em>&quot;aliens have taken over this world&quot;.</em> while on another level someone else could see them as <em>&quot;demons are taking over this world&quot;</em> while on top of that <em>&quot;dimensional entities are taking over this world&quot;</em></p>

<p>All three are based on the awareness of the individual and not necessarily are any incorrect. If anything it&#39;s a nod to epistemological interpretation of reality.</p>

<p>Epistemology (/ᵻˌpɪstᵻˈmɒlədʒi/ (About this sound listen); from Greek ἐπιστήμη, epistēmē, meaning &#39;knowledge&#39;, and λόγος, logos, meaning &#39;logical discourse&#39;) is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t sweat the tone. I&#39;m good to full flame war.</p>

<p>I can put it in experiential terms. It is possible to prove that a statement is false here and now by making an observation here and now. It is not possible to prove that a statement is true always an everywhere because it is not possible to make an observation always and everywhere. (Well, I can&#39;t anyway.) It&#39;s also true that you can observe that a statement is true here and now by making an observation here and now, but that information is not useful because it is only applicable to there and then.</p>

<p>Very precisely, what science promises is an approximation to the truth that nobody has observed to be false ... yet. Read the history of The Michelson-Morley Interferometer that first revealed that Newtonian Mechanics is a sham.</p>

<p>Epistemological understanding is very important when it comes to a holographic universe. This doesn&#39;t mean &quot;simulation&quot; so much as a hologram. [2d beings on what they perceive as a 3d surface]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(A holographic universe, an idea first suggested in the 1990s, is one where all the information that makes up our 3-D &#39;reality&#39; (plus time) is contained in a 2-D surface on its boundaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html#jCp">Read more at:</a></p>

<p>You are probably familiar with this concept: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWyTxCsIXE4">Flatlanders for example</a></p>

<p>Given that a holographic universe allows for many variations in reality [as well as consciousness field theory] everyone could be the focal point of their own reality. Which has huge implications in epistemology. </p>

<p>Contrary and paradoxically on that point, sometimes its more relevant to the individual to employ basic logic in their life [which in the end breeds epistemological knowledge] where they might ignore outside opinion or unverifiable [personal] knowledge of someone else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in that I misrepresented the point you were making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t actually go around believing people are nihilists. That&#39;s like believing people are actual atheists [hilarious laughter here by a friend of mine - no hard feelings].</p>

<p>It&#39;s a logical fallacy. They are just confused. People cannot be atheists because they do not know what was before and what comes after death. At the very worst they can be agnostic. They are unaware of their creator so they cannot <em>know</em> they don&#39;t have one.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a definition of atheist from a supposedly famous &quot;atheist&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;An atheist has to know a lot more than I know. An atheist is someone who knows there is no god. By some definitions atheism is very stupid.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nihilist is in the same category but even worse. They should be aided in coming back to reality. They are lost. They need guidance. That guidance will be for nought if they don&#39;t seek their own spirit but at the very least they can be aided by those more aware than they are.</p>

<p>Existentialism often gets lumped in with post-modernism but lets look at the axiom that defines it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that each individual—not society or religion—is solely responsible for giving <strong>meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely, or &quot;authentically&quot;.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually a very easy test for this but it&#39;s immoral and unethical to suggest it. Also it may vary somewhat on each individual. It would still be valid no matter the spectrum but terribly negative if used by the wrong person - it also has a wonky turnover of a few months to a few years to a lifetime - so its not recommended. </p>

<p>The best proof is the fact that you will entertain nihilism at all as a personal philosophy. Pretend for a moment people wear their beliefs symbolically on their foreheads - and every one they meet then <em>knows</em> their <strong>beliefs</strong>. Firstly you are at a disadvantage because someone <em>knows</em> something about you that you <em>believe</em> which makes you a fucking moron - no offence.</p>

<p>Imagine walking up to everyone you meet saying - <em>&quot;this is all meaningless and nothing matters. Fuck you or fuck me. The latter is more beneficial to my animal ego. Choose wisely.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Your not a true nihilist since you haven&#39;t engaged the animal ego. A true nihilist would engage to the point they realize a potential, and also realize the opposite. The spirit. To be disillusioned is to have introspection. Which is good. Just drop it for a moment and live life. By the moment. You have a choice to bring meaning to life. If you think nothing has meaning then you would live life to the fullest material and animalistic benefits [and you wouldn&#39;t be online]. </p>

<p>But you don&#39;t do that because you are waiting for the spirit to find you. Find it yourself by giving some meaning to your life for fucks sakes.</p>

Im a nihilist, after all, and really dont have any firm beliefs about anything.  So, if you provide me concrete proof that is undeniable, then Ill join your team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no team to join but your own dude. If someone gave you weed and said &quot;do this and get high&quot; you might do it. And get high. They weren&#39;t lying to you.</p>

<p>If someone tells you to find the spirit but its super difficult and 90% of people fail or get sidetracked or get lost or end up in a cult [or worse - a religion] ... better just smoke the weed right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a knock against you. When you are ready you are ready.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as simple as: the anathema to the ideology you claim to entertain. Life has no meaning = Live life with meaning.</p>

<p>Ironically there are a dozen cheesy idioms that give the very basic truth. &quot;Be true to yourself&quot;, &quot;be the change you want to see&quot;, &quot;follow your heart&quot;, &quot;inside that matters&quot; etc, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>None of these memes help if you aren&#39;t open to them. Life is symbolic. If you cannot find meaning in life then at least <em>live</em> without meaning. Go do some really stupid shit and see if it makes you feel better. It won&#39;t [you may convince yourself it will for short periods]. </p>

<p>But at least then, eventually,  you <em>know</em> it won&#39;t. </p>

<p>The strong case is easily defeated because it is self refuting.  You can not empirically verify the verification principle that you postulate.  </p>

<p>There are also a whole host of statements that are not empirical, yet we know them. Mathematical theorems are an obvious example.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA swapped planes mid air during 9-11.</p>

<p>Dick Cheney showed the 9-11 plans to his employee that was helping with the plans and he said &quot;If you tell anyone about this, I will kill you and your family.&quot;</p>

<p>We have bases on moon and mars. </p>

<p>Catholic priests are used to smuggle guns. </p>

<p>The Israeli art students planted bombs (something about the 91st floor) in the twin towers. They also filmed and danced after they took down the buildings. Their van has an image of planes going into towers. </p>

<p>MSM knew about 9-11 as they reported on things not yet happened. </p>

<p>The 3rd tower didn&#39;t go as planned. </p>

<p>There are 200 million aliens in human form among us. </p>

<p>Sessions might be some kind of double agent. </p>

<p>Matrix LLC might be a full blown CIA front that handles sessions. </p>

<p>Dems and republicans both bend the knee to a secret group called American Council of Families</p>

<p>The Russian Fertilizer Industry is controlled by the American Council of Families. </p>

<p>People from within these evil Families are seeking revenge against their own family because of the bad things they have done to them and have been working with VOTL this whole time. </p>

<p>Kushner is mentioned to have bad intentions. </p>

<p>Claims alien ships in the sky that are cloaked by changing their vibrational frequency so that the sight sense can&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>Putin considered white hat. </p>

<p>Hillary died 9-10-16. The Hillary on 9-11-16 was a malfunctioning clone. That is why she passed out. </p>

<p>Eric braveman is dead and what we see is a clone. </p>

<p>The Nazca mummy is real and cabal wants to deligitamize it. </p>

<p>Podesta is Chester Berintons father and he will go down this year. </p>

<p>Worldcorp is a white hat operation. </p>

<p>The suspected John Podesta abuse video is actually John Podesta. </p>

<p>The Podesta brothers took Madeline McCann. </p>

<p>Kill rooms for children exist all over the world including D.C.  </p>

<p>Podesta and deep state members in large Satan club. </p>

<p>Podesta offers children to powerful people. </p>

<p>JP ASH is John Podestas alias. </p>

<p>Some popular names in the Satan worshipping cult include Schumer, Clinton, Weiner, Pelosi, Biden, McCain, Graham, almost everyone at CNN, some late night TV hosts, and plenty in Hollywood. </p>

<p>Soros is high level cabal but there are 4 people above him that happen to be very, very old. </p>

<p>Also, here is a list of current happenings:</p>

<p>DWS/AWAN Story; congressional call for investigation into Comey/Clinton/Lynch; FBI lawyer being investigated; deputy AG in Cali busted for CP.</p>

<p>Images of email. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/46j7R">https://m.imgur.com/a/46j7R</a></p>

<p>Note: VOTL and the Anons are saying they were hoping for bolder happenings today but some things didn&#39;t go as planned but they all claim the DWS Awan scandal is going to spark the downfall of the DNC especially now that it was broadcasted on Fix News earlier today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only one I can think of is an astral travel. Like a lucid dream where you take the body from one place to another through the veil. </p>

<p>I have lately began thinking space is the Astral plane. Another layer of consciousness reflected as part of our physical reality. Not accessible by rockets, but by using the consciousness to alter vibration and attention and use the subjective portion of the mind to manipulate reality.  Now how could slaves just be abducted and somehow then enlightened and shifted enough in their perception to then go be slaves and mine an asteroid?</p>

<p>See, it makes no sense. Especially if you know they can&#39;t get to space with any spaceship. The human consciousness has to expand first to alter how we approach space travel. As it is now it&#39;s one big limitation due to lack of awareness about reality and our own minds and what is our true potential if we didn&#39;t believe is false ideas.</p>

<p>There is an assumption there that technologies do not exist to interact with different dimensional planes.</p>

<p>Put it this way. The very idea of &quot;you&quot; is flawed. You exist in a larger system. Does an ant realize it answers to the queen?</p>

<p>What does it look like?</p>

<p>It looks like architecture. Not the type you may be thinking about. <a href="https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/comparch/large-icon.png">What about computer architecture?</a></p>

<p>Not trying to convince or project that we are computers or living in a simulation [by definition its impossible as this is the world we know ergo reality] -but the similarities are relevant.</p>

<p>For lack of better phrase: If you are nothing more than an electron passing through the ram on to the CPU [travelling along some major highway] - than what  in the name - do you think you might even be able to understand the world around you [??!]. Using basic OS loaded programming no less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, during the election there was talk about Hillary&#39;s Health, which was prompted by David Seaman, who later went on to PG fame/infamy</p>

<p>upon retrospect, it seems Hillary&#39;s Health was a carefully constructed red herring, to create a scandal where there was none, so that Hillary didn&#39;t have to address any real issues (that she&#39;s flip-flopped on) and she could just run out the clock to election day, because the media/polling/election was rigged and she knew it was hers to lose. </p>

<p>so by fabricating the Hillary&#39;s Health &quot;fake news&quot; scandal, they were able to discredit HRC critics by pointing to the HH scandal as an example of nonsense that HRC critics believe.</p>

<p>so was Hillary&#39;s Health a thing or not?</p>

<p>its hard to say. on the one hand, the supposed brain image that showed legions was stolen from an epilepsy website and professionally manipulated to look like HRC&#39;s, being leaked by a medical insider. </p>

<p>on the other hand, HRC camp had to respond to video of HRC collapsing getting into the van. </p>

<p>and then HRC&#39;s behavior when she left Chelsea&#39;s apartment, the incognito sunglasses, the weird interaction with the child, the lack of handlers...</p>

<p>at the time, i was convinced that the woman who emerged from Chelsea&#39;s apartment was NOT HRC, but an impostor... </p>

<p>and lo and behold there is a woman who makes a living being a HRC impersonator </p>

<p>Catholic priests are used to smuggle guns. </p>

<p>I know they were running drugs during Operation Gladio. That&#39;s likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Israeli art students planted bombs (something about the 91st floor) in the twin towers. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some evidence for this. Not art students, but operatives acting under that cover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dems and republicans both bend the knee to a secret group called American Council of Families</p>

<p>Change that to &quot;Freemasons and bankers&quot; and it&#39;s correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin considered white hat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s done nasty stuff to stay in power. But he&#39;s nothing like the US. So &quot;white hat&quot; for a politician.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soros is high level cabal but there are 4 people above him that happen to be very, very old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Soros would be roughly mid-level. The leaders of major secret societies (Freemasons, Jesuits, Knights of Malta, etc.), Pope, royal family, Rothschilds, and a few other super-rich families are definitely more powerful. But Soros isn&#39;t a slouch, either.</p>

<p>Almost everything else is totally unverifiable, or complete bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always believed in the intentions of VOTL and I still do. I also think a lot of his info is sound. I believe he is telling his truth. </p>

<p>Just a feeling, but he&#39;s not always getting perfect or complete information. He is a messenger of information that is funneled down between several people first, and he can&#39;t push the action. </p>

<p>This situation creates two problems for him:
1) The threshold for credibility is so absurdly high, even before he conveys info about current events. Basically, he loses 70% of the conspiracy community out the gate because not everyone believes the things about aliens. Conspiracy theorists also have the tendency to not only dismiss what they don&#39;t believe, but antagonize it. So, the 70% who doesn&#39;t believe him becomes hostile... and those flames are only fanned when VOTL gets antagonistic in return. Which he does. </p>

<p>2) His funnel of information is prone to errors, understandably. VOTL takes a big risk in pinning any events on specific dates and times because he himself can&#39;t push the action and such events are contingent on so many moving parts over which he has no direct control. The 30% of conspiracy theorists who do believe in his message then get whittled down to maybe 10% when he can&#39;t deliver on his projections. </p>

<p>3) VOTL still has ego issues getting in the way of his message that are being exploited by those with nefarious intentions. He gets frustrated when others do not see as he does, and when he&#39;s misunderstood or incorrect about things like July 27 prediction, he opts to tap out. Those wishing to promulgate his message have a hard time doing so when they are not given the full story about what&#39;s going on with him personally.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I commend him. He&#39;s doing the best he can with the situation he&#39;s in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and one more note.</p>

<p>I hope we as a community discuss more about what VOTL is pushing forth, rather than falling into the trap of discussing his persona. Truth is not an all-or-nothing thing. If we believe there&#39;s misinfo in what he says, then let&#39;s discuss that piece of information. If we think there&#39;s truth, then we should go from there. Most of us know what he put forth about 911 is truth. Even if we believe he&#39;s an unwitting person prepping us for project BlueBeam, then let&#39;s point out the ways in which we are concerned we&#39;re being groomed for that. </p>

<p>For example, I am glad to see they&#39;re looking into Haim Saban. Based on my own research I&#39;m 100% confident he&#39;s a part of the LA/Hollywood/UCLA MK Ultra group involved in sex trafficking. Look at the organizations <a href="https://www.selfworthfoundation.org/meet-the-founder">Cheryl Saban is involved with</a> and spot the red flag after red flag.</p>

<p>But for us to just look at VOTL and say, &quot;he&#39;s a LARP&quot; is as bad as discussing the hairstyles of presidential candidates rather than their actual platform (fully acknowledging my earlier post was doing exactly this).</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this, <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">/u/LightBringerFlex</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is the guy basically listed every major conspiracy theory besides flat earth(which would kind-of conflict with aliens) and says the Russia-Trump conspiracy is not real. This leads to almost any news on any conspiracy probably leading to validation tweets from them.</p>

<p>Secondly they provide no evidence in the emails, just anonymous sources(isn&#39;t that what we fight MSM about) telling him in emails.</p>

<p>Thirdly, even if you ignore the ONLY email that didn&#39;t have redacted email source name being from himself to himself, ALL the emails have &quot;sent from ProtonMail&quot;. Yes, every source of his uses the same email system.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not his persona, those are real facets of his emails. There is no new evidence with any information about the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly hear &quot;white hat&quot; as a term for an ethical hacker or the good guy in a western who wears a white hat (the villain wears a black hat) like what you might have seen recently in the series Westworld.</p>

<p>I think in the context of VotL&#39;s narrative, Putin is aware of the ET situation and is against the bad ones, hence he is a white hat.</p>
