        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was traveling via plane to visit some of my family, and on the plane I just so happen to sit next to a pilot. He was being rerouted to his next destination (fully suited up) in order to fly out. I honestly didn&#39;t really know this happened, but we got to talking and talked the whole 4 hours. </p>

<p>Just so happens, the guy flew to Antarctica one time. He went there with a friend that needed an extra pilot so they could drop off some supplies. On the way there, he told me they were given only a sack of money to bribe every customs officer, as the flight there is ridiculously long, so they had to stop in a few places along the way. They would go, &quot;Is this enough?&quot;, then the customs would say no, then they&#39;d keep handing out money until they let them through. </p>

<p>He said when they reached Antarctica there was a Russian mobster and his cronies who drank the whole time (which the remainder of his money went to). If the head guy didn&#39;t like someone, they wouldn&#39;t let them come any further than the landing area. He said he wasn&#39;t really allowed to explore, and for the most part, they only spoke about elite coming there and their friends of the Russian mafia. </p>

<p>I tried to ask him more, but he was limited to where they were allowed to travel, but wholeheartedly agrees that something fucky goes on down there. </p>

<p>Happens a lot on <em>every</em> sub. On literally every single active sub except places like TD, where people go to new and upvote everything, new submissions are routinely downvoted very, very quickly.</p>

<p>Go ahead and submit something to videos, or gaming, or any other active sub. Don&#39;t do it just once. Submit a number of things. More times than not, your submission will be quickly downvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the real conspiracy canon is (which also is why conspiracist occasionally go full blown 14/88) is that (clarifying one quick time this isnt my personal belief is what ive gathered as the most accepted hitler/draco theory)  ill make jt brief</p>

<p>jews are draco worshippers
reptile in bible is draco( draco =reptile species from another dimension)
dracos claim to be creator
Jesus is theorized as pleadien (light race, lost cousins of humans, believe universe is a mix of Christian beliefs/eastern vibration reincarnation meditation etc thrown in)</p>

<p>cut to actual history</p>

<p>The jews killed 20 million Christians in the Bolshevik revolution, created communism, and for first time in modern history pushed atheism as a mainstream belief.</p>

<p>jewish created communism was creeping into europe and surrounding Germany on all sides</p>

<p>Hitler comes to power in a last stand of the West, researches antarctica and other dimension</p>

<p>back to conspiracy</p>

<p>hitler found alien tech, allied with pleadians (where the pure aryan agenda came to play) </p>

<p>also pleadians supported his fight learning about the draco illuminatti. </p>

<p>the conspiracy is the actual good guy lost, jews were to be sent to Madagascar and died from disease and starvation, holocaust was a lie by the comminist jews to cover up their own Christian holocaust</p>

Tortoises do not age in the sense we think of it.  They might die from disease, or random happenstance, or cancer, but they don&#39;t have a clock that says &quot;too old lights out&quot; like we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Demons exist, are alive but cannot die or be killed (permanantly), what would you call them other than immortal?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the key distinction, biological immortality just means able to die, immortal means like a demon, it cannot die ever period. It will always exist in some form. You can kill lizardmen, which makes them biologically immortal, not true immortals.</p>

<p>immortal (adj.) Look up immortal at Dictionary.com</p>

<p>late 14c., &quot;deathless,&quot; from Latin immortalis &quot;deathless, undying&quot; (of gods), &quot;imperishable, endless&quot; (of fame, love, work, etc.), </p>

<p>from assimilated form of in- &quot;not, opposite of&quot; (see in- (1)) + mortalis &quot;mortal&quot; (from PIE root *mer- &quot;to rub away, harm,&quot; also &quot;to die&quot; and forming words referring to death and to beings subject to death). </p>

<p>In reference to fame, literature, etc., &quot;unceasing, destined to endure forever, never to be forgotten, lasting a long time,&quot; attested from early 15c. (also in classical Latin). As a noun, &quot;an immortal being,&quot; from 1680s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I thought this at first as well, but after a bit of deductive reasoning I came to a rather chilling hypothesis (no pun intended). To understand my hypothesis, however, we have to look at a scheme the reptilians concocted long ago: the Greenland/Iceland Plan.</p>

<p>You see, before the safe haven known as Antarctica was developed, the reptilians needed a new place to stay. They needed an area that would be warm enough for them to live in (with some assistance), but also isolated enough that humans wouldn&#39;t be around to bother them. The closest place they could find that fit these criteria was one called Greenland, a small island located near a bigger island called Iceland.</p>

<p>After reading that above paragraph, you may be thinking to yourself: &quot;Wait, isn&#39;t Iceland the smaller island located near Greenland?&quot; And after searching it up, you would think: &quot;Yeah, it is. This kid&#39;s fucking retarded.&quot; But if you did think that, you would be greatly underestimating the true reach of the reptilians and how much they can influence the world.</p>

<p>Upon discovery of Greenland, the reptilians began hatching a plan to keep humans off the island. After months of scheming, they came up with a solution: switch the names of Iceland and Greenland around in an attempt to trick the humans, thereby stopping them from discovering the reptilian&#39;s new paradise. They reasoned that humans traveling to Iceland would, upon hearing of the island of Greenland so close by, opt to travel there instead.</p>

<p>The reptilians executed the plan, and for the most part, it worked flawlessly. The majority of humans stayed away from Iceland and the few who did were disposed of. Although their plan worked for a time, eventually the humans discovered the island wasn&#39;t what the name implied it would be. By the time they found out, however, the reptilians had already finished developing Antarctica and had left, leaving no traces of their existence behind.</p>

<p>This now brings me back to my hypothesis. If the reptilians have successfully pulled the name-switching scheme before, had they done it again with Antarctica? If so, what other area could they have possibly switched it&#39;s name with? It&#39;s obvious something&#39;s up, but as of right now I&#39;m not sure how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the &quot;Genesis&quot; chapter of the Bible it lists the names and ages of some of the oldest people to ever exist. Adam, for example, lived to be 930 years old, an age that most humans today assume to be impossible to live to. What most people don&#39;t realize, however, is that the reptilians of today have special powers that allow them to drain the humans of their lifeforce. This power allows the reptilians to remain essentially immortal while making regular humans die much earlier than their biblical counterparts, whose reptilians had not developed said powers yet.</p>

<p>Over time, the growing human population has allowed the reptilians to take less lifeforce from individuals while still allowing them to maintain their sought-after immortality. This is why the average life expectancy of humans has been steadily rising in the recent years. Maybe one day we&#39;ll see a human breach the 200- or even 300-year barrier.</p>

<p>We also know without much controversy that human civilizations will definitely exist at sea level. The combination of these non-controversial facts puts any substantial prospect of finding remnant civilizations at about 100 feet below sea level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the idea of &quot;Atlantis&quot; is a proxy for any number of unknown ancient civilizations. Humans just like us, that is, homo sapiens sapiens, have been around for at least 200,000 years. Every couple of years it seems that number gets pushed further and further back. It goes to reason that human have made clever solutions to the problems of this swirling gravity well more than once in that time, and that our own history is not 4000 years old, but perhaps much older.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a stretch of imagination that groups of enterprising humans got together in the past and built cities. Some probably existed in complete obscurity to this day--especially if they were not stone builders. The question remains open. </p>

<p>What civilization created the map by which the Piri Reis map made? A great question. So, to your point, could  Atlantis be Antarctica, let me rephrase: could Antarctica be home to evidence of an ancient civilization? Perhaps. I&#39;m curious. </p>

<p>Random funny tips though. He said all planes are filthy and never get fully cleaned. That your devices do not interact with the planes electronics. They only say that so you&#39;ll have more attention for take off and landing. That the pilots and stuardesses aren&#39;t allowed to sleep in the same hotels anymore, as pre-marital relations was becoming more prevalent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, that last fact is as sad as it is glorious. I&#39;ve stumbled across a TV segment some day that showed the life of a pilot, and he too said that every pilot fucks their flight attendants, virtually without exception (except for the pilot they interviewed of course, he was a married man after all ;-))</p>

<p>I suspect that Barium, Strontium, and Aluminium (among other materials) are being added to the Jet fuel itself on specific days, in specific large airports. It would only really require a relatively small organization to oversee such a program (even on a global scale), and those involved could largely be oblivious to it too. Those who have to know are selected based on their readiness to do anything to &quot;save the planet&quot; and told it&#39;s all to stop global warming. I believe shill-farms work exactly the same, only that even fewer people would realize what they are really doing when all they do is they with jet fuel, rather than people who get paid to drive other people nuts and manufacture a consent.</p>

<p>The only thing a pilot might notice would be a slight variance in fuel efficiency (either up or down), and if they&#39;re old enough they may silently wonder if contrails really were equally thick and persistent in the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s as they are now.</p>

<p>I say I suspect these things because to say I believe these things would be reasoning from a conclusion. With the starting premise of chemtrails being real and everywhere, I considered how such a feat might potentially be possible. </p>

<p>Adding the stuff to the fuel seems to be the most logical option. We used to add lead to gasoline to increase burn efficiency until we noticed the ill effects it had on the people and the environment. I think at least this time it&#39;s added on purpose. Not necessarily to harm people directly, but for reasons of further control, this time of the weather and thereby all of nature. </p>

<p>For those who make those decisions, though, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM0uvgHKZe8">a few hundred thousand additional avoidable deaths a year, as well as sickness and further collective retardation are a worthy cost in exchange for more control and power.</a></p>

<p>Sorry, that turned into a rant. I&#39;m not fully convinced that chemtrails are real, but I can see how it might all fit a bigger picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing about this is complicated. You&#39;d just have to insert a couple of tank-fulls of a nano-metal mixture into the stream of jet-fuel along a pipeline or distribution center every couple of days. It would be no more difficult than water fluoridation or any other such process and it would be tremendously easy to keep it a secret as so few people need to be involved.</p>

<p>Granted, I&#39;m not an expert in internal combustion or jet engines, but two data points tell me it&#39;s likely not a problem for the plane to handle additional nano-metals in its fuel. In the above-linked witness testimony, one engineer highlights that there were proposals for just such additives to jet fuel to increase fuel efficiency, but it was shot down due to potential health risks. We did the same thing with lead in gasoline back in the day, until people noticed the ill effects it had on people.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a fair point. If I ever meet an aerospace engineer I&#39;ll ask them.</p>

<p>Following this, the passengers and flight crew decided to act.[1] According to accounts of <strong>cell phone conversations</strong>, Beamer, along with Mark Bingham, Tom Burnett, and Jeremy Glick formed a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers.[9] They were joined by other passengers, including Lou Nacke, Rich Guadagno, Alan Beaven, Honor Elizabeth Wainio, Linda Gronlund, and William Cashman, along with flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and Cee Cee Ross-Lyles, in discussing their options and voting on a course of action, ultimately deciding to storm the cockpit and take over the plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh...why not? You realize that pretty much anyone can visit Antarctica, right? There are cruise ships that regularly travel there, and promise that you will experience the &quot;midnight sun&quot;. There are tourist flights that overfly the Pole pretty much every day (including one that famously crashed into Mt. Erebus in 1979](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901)</a>).</p>

<p>Whenever I bring this up, the flatties always counter with &quot;The Antarctic Treaty Forbids Travel to the Antarctica except for a select few, hand-picked operatives&quot;, to which I counter &quot;you have obviously never read the Treaty, and have no idea what it says.&quot;</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll summarize the key points here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No nation shall lay claim to any part of Antarctica as sovereign land</p></li>
<li><p>No nation shall establish a military presence anywhere on the continent</p></li>
<li><p>Weapons of any kind are forbidden</p></li>
<li><p>No nation shall establish commercial enterprises on the continent for the purpose of mining natural resources</p></li>
<li><p>Any signatory reserves the right to inspect inbound traffic if they suspect that any of the above restrictions have been violated</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. If you want to charter a boat and visit Antarctica, go right ahead. So long as you aren&#39;t carrying weapons or mining equipment, your&#39;e good, and no-one is going to stop you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, no. Oddly enough, the treaty also bans any open flame (I guess that prospect of all that ice bursting into flame is somewhat horrifying). This presented a number of problems to the researchers who <a href="http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/00s/southpolefoucault.html">first tried to set up a Foucault Pendumum</a> at the exact geographic South Pole. Most pendulums use a match or lighter to burn through a restraining cord to start the pendulum swinging. This prevents unwanted oscillations from any sort of cutting tool, like a pair of scissors, which can set the pendulum swinging from side to side as well as sweeping across its arc. Obviously, this introductions distortions into pendulum&#39;s movement.</p>

<p>As the researchers explained:</p>

<p>It was difficult to make the pendulum swing in a plane instead of an ellipse. After several attempts with various techniques of holding the bob and dropping it we always got some kind of ellipse instead of a plane. This adds to our error because it is more difficult to locate and mark the pendulum arc’s apex. A way to do it is to suspended the bob by tying it off with a piece of string and letting it settle, then burn through the string. The bob would then drop without any outside force and swing in a plane. Since it is against the Antarctica Treaty to have any open flames at the South Pole we could not do this. After much practice Mike Town got very adept at dropping the bob so that it arced in a plane. It was difficult to make the pendulum swing in a plane instead of an ellipse.

<p>Do you have any idea how much you would pay for an ascent of Mt. Everest? It&#39;s in the same ballpark - 50-80K. And yet...no-one doubts the existence of Mt. Everest.

Where did this money come from? 3: He claimed he had just enough money for the remaining bribe. They must&#39;ve had this planned extraordinarily ;). 4: He claims the Russian mafia was in charge of everything at their place of landing and the surrounding areas as evidenced by them not being able to explore.

    <div class="md"><p>Now you are moving the goalpost. Before it was extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Now its surprising claims require extraordinary evidence. If you told me a cop killed your dog I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, but I would ask for evidence before condemning the cop. How is it well known that Russia has a vested interest in Antarctica, or do you mean it&#39;s a well known conspiracy theory. And when you use &#39;Russia&#39; in that sense do you mean the Russian government or the Russian mafia. And even if you claim they are one and the same, wouldn&#39;t they at least want to keep up appearances that they aren&#39;t.

People on the internet can always make stuff up and others can always say r/thathappened if it sounds unrealistic.

It&#39;s easy to verify that there are Russian scientists and military and navy doing work in the Arctic. This story <em>could</em> have happened.

<p>Here are some extraordinary claims about Antarctica:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There&#39;s a pyramid (that must have been built thousands of years ago by God knows who, possibly aliens).</p></li>
<li><p>there&#39;s a hole that leads to the inside of the hollow earth</p></li>
<li><p>Hitler ended up there and there is a base with the remnants of the Third Reich</p></li>

<p>The US government is doing something secret with OUR tax dollars, beyond known scientific research projects or standard defense spending.</p>

<p>OP didn&#39;t even claim the last one. Something going on with non-government Russians --and money. Could be as simple as drugs.</p>

<p>Uh, yes actually. It&#39;s called tourism. That&#39;s the main draw of going there, my physics teacher actually got married in Antarctica, he described it as the most beautiful place he&#39;s ever seen. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use your logic for, say, Cruise Liners.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t go into a bathtub for no reason, no?</p>

<p>The answer is tourism.</p>

<p>Or Australia.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t go into an oven for no reason, no?</p>

<p>The answer is tourism.</p>

<p>Also, technically Antarctica has zero permanent inhabitants. It&#39;s only weather and research scientists. &quot;Oh sure that&#39;s what they tell you, why would a research scientist want to go to Antarctica?&quot; Virtually no light pollution, and the closest area to the outer atmosphere.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a map. It would be way out of the way to go there, no matter where you are traveling. Besides because of the harsh environment planes need to be equipped with special surveillance equipment to fly in such a region, something that is not standard on any commercial airline.</p>

<p>Just so happens, the guy flew to Antarctica one time. He went there with a friend that needed an extra pilot so they could drop off some supplies. On the way there, he told me they were given only a sack of money to bribe every customs officer, as the flight there is ridiculously long, so they had to stop in a few places along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antarctica could serve one purpose. The modern day equivalent of Jekyll Island.</p>

<p>Back during the early 20th century, a bunch of rich fucks got together to make their plans to implement the Federal Reserve. They met at a place called Jekyll Island. Why?</p>

<p>Because they were so rich and powerful, if people saw them meeting for a whole week the rumors/suspicions would have been flying.</p>

<p>If you think about Antarctica:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limited physical access.</p></li>
<li><p>No civilians.</p></li>
<li><p>100% of communications are controlled. No cellphones and no landlines. If anyone has internet, it must be just a few computers working on satellite.</p></li>
<li><p>No customs or national borders to cross.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So a bunch of important people could go there and have meetings in as close to absolute secrecy as possible.</p>

<p>One other possibility that I&#39;ll just throw out there. There is one unique environmental factor that is present nowhere else. Antarctica is where the south magnetic pole is located.</p>

<p>So you have the strongest south magnetic field combined with whatever else has some interesting effects on the human body... or perhaps on human mental function?</p>

<p>In plain English, if you hang around at the South Pole long enough, you start getting smarter. If this was true, a civilization located in Antarctica would be the most advanced one in the world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch. But if <em>that</em> was true, it would explain Nazis/Neuschwabenland, Operation High Jump, all the secrecy and limited access etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, that last fact is as sad as it is glorious. I&#39;ve stumbled across a TV segment some day that showed the life of a pilot, and he too said that every pilot fucks their flight attendants, virtually without exception (except for the pilot they interviewed of course, he was a married man after all ;-))</p>

<p>I suspect that Barium, Strontium, and Aluminium (among other materials) are being added to the Jet fuel itself on specific days, in specific large airports. It would only really require a relatively small organization to oversee such a program (even on a global scale), and those involved could largely be oblivious to it too. Those who have to know are selected based on their readiness to do anything to &quot;save the planet&quot; and told it&#39;s all to stop global warming. I believe shill-farms work exactly the same, only that even fewer people would realize what they are really doing when all they do is they with jet fuel, rather than people who get paid to drive other people nuts and manufacture a consent.</p>

<p>The only thing a pilot might notice would be a slight variance in fuel efficiency (either up or down), and if they&#39;re old enough they may silently wonder if contrails really were equally thick and persistent in the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s as they are now.</p>

<p>I say I suspect these things because to say I believe these things would be reasoning from a conclusion. With the starting premise of chemtrails being real and everywhere, I considered how such a feat might potentially be possible. </p>

<p>Adding the stuff to the fuel seems to be the most logical option. We used to add lead to gasoline to increase burn efficiency until we noticed the ill effects it had on the people and the environment. I think at least this time it&#39;s added on purpose. Not necessarily to harm people directly, but for reasons of further control, this time of the weather and thereby all of nature. </p>

<p>For those who make those decisions, though, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM0uvgHKZe8">a few hundred thousand additional avoidable deaths a year, as well as sickness and further collective retardation are a worthy cost in exchange for more control and power.</a></p>

<p>Sorry, that turned into a rant. I&#39;m not fully convinced that chemtrails are real, but I can see how it might all fit a bigger picture.</p>

How is it well known that Russia has a vested interest in Antarctica, or do you mean it&#39;s a well known conspiracy theory. And when you use &#39;Russia&#39; in that sense do you mean the Russian government or the Russian mafia.
