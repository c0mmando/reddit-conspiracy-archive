        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve heard many stories about how marijuana is illegal because of racism, and while it is true that most drug policies stem from racism, let&#39;s focus on the difference specifically between why marijuana is illegal and tobacco is legal.</p>

<p>First of all, marijuana (while not &quot;healthy&quot;) isn&#39;t anywhere near as dangerous as tobacco. Tobacco comes in as the second most dangerous substance after sugar. There have been virtually ZERO ODs from smoking marijuana, whereas there is plenty of evidence that tobacco causes all sorts of cancer and is bad for thousands of different things that cause death.</p>

<p>Secondly, marijuana is a weed which means anyone can grow it, and it&#39;s super easy to cultivate. Tobacco isn&#39;t, it&#39;s an industrial crop, and requires many agricultural things to make it profitable, which leads to my third item.</p>

<p>Tobacco is profitable. Since marijuana doesn&#39;t require much to cultivate, there is no profit in making it completely legal (notice how in some states, you need to jump through a lot of hoops in order to even grow a plant).</p>

<p>If marijuana becomes fully legal like alcohol, then it&#39;ll probably be like alcohol was in its first legal stages, in which craft brewership was basically illegal.</p>

<p>Anyway, another reason why marijuana is legal, is also because of the pharmaceutical industry lobbyists. That one is just obvious.</p>

<p>All these stem from capitalism, greedy disgusting capitalism.</p>

<p>And if anyone says &quot;well come up with a better idea than capitalism, hurr hurr okay see I told you, you can&#39;t! Capitalism is the best!&quot;, lol all I have to say is, STUDY ECONOMICS 101, jeezus I&#39;m getting tired of people defending this greedy system.</p>

<p>Do you believe the government needs to get involved when the free market leads to a monopoly or oligopoly situation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not who you asked but I can shed some light on this subject.</p>

<p>There cannot be a monopoly or oligopoly without the assistance of government. ISP&#39;s for example, in this modern era, would have ten times the competition without government interference. The systems designed to prevent mergers and acquisitions only act as a legal barrier to smaller businesses that cannot afford the legal manpower to circumvent the law; or co-opt regulatory bodies entirely.</p>

<p>Since Joe schmoe and his neighbors cannot legally use their own money to create their own neighborhood ISP due to a regulation saying that &quot;Time Bell Warner Cast&amp;T&quot; is to be the sole ISP in that area.</p>

<p>If every Joe schmoe and their cousin <strong>could</strong> compete for your business, no &quot;Time Bell Warner Cast&amp;T&quot; sized company could do a crappy job at a high price and stay in business, or you would go to one of the other 50 competitors. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr : Government is the cause of monopolies, not the solution to them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are saying there have been some. Proof?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tobacco is profitable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tobacco is addictive. If you study economics 101 then you&#39;d have something useful to talk about. Tobacco is addictive because of the &quot;nicotine delivery system&quot;. It is what was identified as the central issue in tobacco&#39;s harm. And instead of regulating against the &quot;nicotine delivery system&quot; that the tobacco companies spent decades perfecting, the government decided to tax the shit out of it.</p>

<p>Now, stop trying to find &quot;ins&quot;. Everyone can see exactly what you are doing. Don&#39;t insult the real research that people do here.</p>
