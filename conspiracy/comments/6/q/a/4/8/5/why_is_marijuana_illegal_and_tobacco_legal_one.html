       I've heard many stories about how marijuana is illegal because of racism, and while it is true that most drug policies stem from racism, let's focus on the difference specifically between why marijuana is illegal and tobacco is legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, marijuana (while not "healthy") isn't anywhere near as dangerous as tobacco. Tobacco comes in as the second most dangerous substance after sugar. There have been virtually ZERO ODs from smoking marijuana, whereas there is plenty of evidence that tobacco causes all sorts of cancer and is bad for thousands of different things that cause death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, marijuana is a weed which means anyone can grow it, and it's super easy to cultivate. Tobacco isn't, it's an industrial crop, and requires many agricultural things to make it profitable, which leads to my third item.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobacco is profitable. Since marijuana doesn't require much to cultivate, there is no profit in making it completely legal (notice how in some states, you need to jump through a lot of hoops in order to even grow a plant).
      </p>
      <p>
       If marijuana becomes fully legal like alcohol, then it'll probably be like alcohol was in its first legal stages, in which craft brewership was basically illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, another reason why marijuana is legal, is also because of the pharmaceutical industry lobbyists. That one is just obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these stem from capitalism, greedy disgusting capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if anyone says "well come up with a better idea than capitalism, hurr hurr okay see I told you, you can't! Capitalism is the best!", lol all I have to say is, STUDY ECONOMICS 101, jeezus I'm getting tired of people defending this greedy system.

       I think capitalism can encompass free or fair or somewhere in the middle. Sure we can have protective tariffs if congress or the people wants to pass them but protectionism isn't a long term solution.

       Do you believe the government needs to get involved when the free market leads to a monopoly or oligopoly situation (in a given industry) and the lack of competition causes higher prices and reduced value for the customer?

       I'm not who you asked but I can shed some light on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       There cannot be a monopoly or oligopoly without the assistance of government. ISP's for example, in this modern era, would have ten times the competition without government interference. The systems designed to prevent mergers and acquisitions only act as a legal barrier to smaller businesses that cannot afford the legal manpower to circumvent the law; or co-opt regulatory bodies entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Joe schmoe and his neighbors cannot legally use their own money to create their own neighborhood ISP due to a regulation saying that "Time Bell Warner Cast&amp;T" is to be the sole ISP in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       If every Joe schmoe and their cousin
       <strong>
        could
       </strong>
       compete for your business, no "Time Bell Warner Cast&amp;T" sized company could do a crappy job at a high price and stay in business, or you would go to one of the other 50 competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr : Government is the cause of monopolies, not the solution to them.

       I agree with whitey below. If Walmart or Amazon can dominate all of retail, that's the natural evolution of the market. They won't hold on forever. Especially though, the government can never consider anyone too big to fail and bail them out. Risk is great, govt bailouts and safety nets are not.

       Tobacco is addictive. If you study economics 101 then you'd have something useful to talk about. Tobacco is addictive because of the "nicotine delivery system". It is what was identified as the central issue in tobacco's harm. And instead of regulating against the "nicotine delivery system" that the tobacco companies spent decades perfecting, the government decided to tax the shit out of it.

       Now, stop trying to find "ins". Everyone can see exactly what you are doing. Don't insult the real research that people do here.

       If marijuana is legalised then it will be regulated and taxed just like tobacco is. The law will come down hard on people producing their own marijuana for consumption, the same way it does on people who grow tobacco for consumption. Legalising weed won't mean people are free to grow their own.

       What the heck? Just about every restriction on the market was bought by a capitalist to screw over their workers and other competing capitalists. Capitalists

       No, that will never happen. Capitalism doesn't mean your theoretical perfect version of it, it means a society where the majority of resources are controlled privately and for-profit. Real capitalism will never allow utopian capitalism to exist.

       If marijuana is legalised then it will be regulated and taxed just like tobacco is. The law will come down hard on people producing their own marijuana for consumption, the same way it does on people who grow tobacco for consumption. Legalising weed won't mean people are free to grow their own.
