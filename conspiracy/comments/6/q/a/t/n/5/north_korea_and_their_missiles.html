        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it just me and my scepticism that thinks the whole North Korean missile threat is just a theatrical display? 
If the USA was really in that great of danger and the threat was real, you&#39;d think they wouldn&#39;t even let Kim get this far with his testing...</p>

<p>It just seems to me like NK is just like someone&#39;s annoying little brother who keeps poking at you and swinging something around till it almost hits you.. You let it go a little further because they are young and immature, then you punch them in the face and they stop... </p>

<p>It just seems that this missile threat is being played up to be a bigger threat than it actually is. Nothing is uncontrolled on this planet, The Powers That Be have their fingers in everything, and nothing is unplanned. It just feels like NK is just a little pawn to be used in a greater distraction.</p>

<p>Thoughts?..</p>

<p>Am I alone in thinking this?... I sure feel like it over in r/worldnews where they downvote me to oblivion because I expressed this opinion. They are cooked. They think THE THREAT IS REAL THEY WILL KILL US WE NEED TO STOP KIM OMG. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it differently. They are not a pawn; they are the whole arsenal.</p>

<p>An EMP would be devastating. 100k South Korea&#39;s dying in 30 minutes would be devastating. A stop in imports would really be devastating.  All that would likely happen. Fuck, even a dirty bomb would be bad. US dollar would likely go bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that NK is a pawn, but a front for everyone but the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea is one of the few nations without a Rothschild central bank, that means the globalists have reason to target them. NK could not even realistically accomplish anything damaging militarily. It&#39;s like a chihuahua barking at a doberman.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un is not a good guy but he has only really threatened to defend NK, the US is doing military exercises right at their borders, if NK was doing military exercises near the US border in Mexico or Canada would the US be ok with it? He has said he will turn the US to ash - if they don&#39;t back off - this is the important part, why poke the bear? Left alone NK wouldn&#39;t do a damn thing, but even if they did, I don&#39;t honestly believe they could hit a target with their strike, if they did successfully hit anything, it would likely have been strategically allowed to justify some other action, maybe that is the end game of all this drama.</p>

<p>China is blatantly annexing territories from nearby countries, but that is ok? They are framed as the good guys in the territory? We still hear about Crimea being annexed as a huge injustice, in spite of there being a referendum with the people there which supported it by over 90% - we hear about not because people are being victimized, it is because the crimean peninsula is a key strategic military location, and Russia is against the globalists.</p>

<p>So I agree it is all theatre, there is a larger narrative at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in the UK,  everyone knows about NK, but we don&#39;t seem to be whipped up into a frenzy like you (maybe) are in the US. </p>

<p>There&#39;ll be an article in the papers when there&#39;s a launch, the newspapers will say something should be done.. but then nothing. Life goes on. </p>

<p>No one&#39;s thinking we should invade, or preemptively strike them. We&#39;re just trying to second guess whether the US will I suppose. </p>

<p>Then again NK doesn&#39;t explicitly mention us in its threats, and we don&#39;t go and pull &#39;military exercises&#39; in their back yard. </p>

<p>Personally I feel that if we don&#39;t piss them off, they&#39;ll leave us alone. Other shitty countries have nukes too, and we try not to piss them off (in fact we seem to bend over backwards to accommodate them...) </p>

Just seems like NK could be easily controlled and neutralized if it really were a legit threat, and the USA is just waiting for the most convenient time to intervene. </p>
