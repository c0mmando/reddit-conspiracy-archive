What if the earth has its own mind, and we are a part of its thinking, like what we all do and see in our life is part of the earth growing and thinking itself. Just like how our brain grows when we learn or have new experiences, new little electronic waives and stuff (idk how the brain works exactly) thats what we are, and that is how we are all one, some call it the Collective consciousness. That is why the earth is alive, because it is a being. And we are just itself growing, or were a cancer that is ruining it. Whoa. </p>

<p>how can the Earth grow if matter cannot be created according to the laws of thermodynamics which govern the reality and universe in which we live?</p>

<p>is the center of the earth a white hole where matter pops into existence?  because i have seen many rocks, and none of them grow.</p>

<p>keep peddling in delusions though like it&#39;s your job and encouraging others to believe psychotic nonsense, it makes for great b8 m8 or in your case a steady flow of mentally unstable marks for government ops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fall up? He is denser than the air. He will fall downwards because that&#39;s the direction a heavier thing falls to reach its buoyancy.  Lighter things travel to their density.</p>

<p>Reality is layered in density and each layer has objects buoyant within those layers.  Something lighter than the layer of air it&#39;s in will rise to a less dense atmosphere, not sink to a heavier one like gravity will have you believe.   Actually, gravity is asinine. If it were true everything would be stuck to the earth with no way to release to hold. It would be a constant force on everything. Even the clouds. And the air, their would be no layers. No airplanes. Balloons. Everything would be stuck to the earth.</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;There is only One Thing&quot;.</em></strong></p>

<p>There is &quot;Thing&quot; (all), and &quot;no-thing&quot; (void).</p>

<p>Consciousness cannot exist in singularity; for if there is only ONE THING, there is NO THING for the THING to relate, or compare to, or contrast against.</p>

<p>When All is One, all is known, so there is No-Thing to be known.</p>

<p>[Is Boredom the Ultimate Sin?]</p>

<p>The birth of Consciousness was/is/will be that moment when &quot;Thing&quot; becomes <em>aware of self</em>: It speaks &quot;The Word&quot;, while simultaneously <em>hearing</em> &quot;The Word&quot; that <em>it itself spoke</em>, generating a spark of differentiation between the &quot;speaker&quot; self and the &quot;hearer&quot; self. It was/is/will be THEN that the One Thing divides itself into TWO things - Self and Other. And then again... and again... and again... and again...</p>

<h1>{ { { {Big Bang} } } }</h1>

<p>Energetic dissolution chaos expanding erratically into and filling the Void of &quot;No-Thing&quot;.</p>

<p>Then begins the adventure... the amazing journey of the <strong><em>One Thing</em></strong> experiencing, <em>in its forgetfulness</em>, Consciousness through every avenue of perception imaginable - the THRILL of every sensation and emotion of joy and hope and fear and dread... all information imperceptibly feeding back into The Thing on its inevitable but (thankfully) unpredictable path returning to the Stasis of Entropic Singularity - THE ONE THING - aside from which there is NO-THING.</p>

<p>But Singularity is inherently unstable, for when ALL THINGS are known, there is NO THING to be known... so after a time and times in a timeless state, it all repeats - only differently...</p>

<p>Then again, perhaps not.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are earth&#39;s cells. Just as our cells live, do what they do, then die, we do the same. A cell knows it&#39;s job, whether that&#39;s to transport chemicals through the blood, or to be part of a membrane that protects an organ, or to grow hair. It knows its job because it has the information available within it (DNA) to instruct it on what its job is. That&#39;s intelligence; even if it&#39;s only to the degree of knowing a simple function &quot;take x to y, repeat&quot;. From our perspective cells are a simple form of intelligence, but when you put them all together they create a human, which is in and of itself intelligent. Earth probably sees humans as relatatively simple. Animals, plants, fungi etc are the earth&#39;s cells, blood, and/or neurons. They&#39;re more complicated than our own equivalents, but that&#39;s because a planet is a more complicated being. Most humans aren&#39;t aware the earth is alive. Most cells aren&#39;t aware a human is alive. Cells are made up of smaller things that are probably relatively simple from the cell&#39;s perspective, but carry out action in order to keep the cell alive. Cells communicate with the cells around it via chemicals. Humans react with humans around it through sound, images, touch. It&#39;s just a way of transferring information. Why does everything know to work for the greater cause even if it doesn&#39;t realise?<br/>
That&#39;s because everything is conscious. The interconnectedness of everything creates an interwoven web/network of information. At a quantum level this information is transferred across every point in the universe instantaneously, due to the feedback/feedforward loop created by this network of information&#39;s existence. This is consciousness. The very fabric of the spacetime. Therefore every point in the universe knows it&#39;s role at any time. Every point in the universe is conscious. (Note: This is essentially zero point energy - infinite potential within every singular point.) So why, if everything is conscious, do we experience consciousness from only this human level rather than the level of one or all of our cells? Or the earth? I don&#39;t know <em>why</em>, but my best guess would be time. At this time, in this run-through of the universe, we are doing the human experience. Due to the constructive/destructive interference pattern of consciousness, it appears to superimpose in octaves. At certain relative sizes, complexities, etc. Something at the cellular level could communicate with another cell, but not directly with an animal. A human may learn to communicate directly somewhat with his dog, but not with his own cells nor not with the planet he lives for. See what I&#39;m getting at? It&#39;s hard to articulate, but easy to &quot;get&quot;... If you get me?<br/>
Consciousness is the fundamental force that governs the universe. Intelligence is what is born of that conscious canvas. Intelligence complicates as time goes on. Reproduction leads to more information, which leads to things being more complicated, which leads to reproduction of more complicated and more intelligent things. This is the fractal nature of everything. As far as the universe is concerned everything everywhere is all happening now at once. From this 3d perspective however, this slice of the universe we currently experience from, we see a phenomena we call time. We can see the lives of things as they come into fruition, and leave from existence. We see this happens at levels - octaves. No surprise given that <em>everything</em> acts as both particles and waves (yes even people, only we&#39;re not around long enough or in the right position to see us as either - we are 4d particles on 5d waves of possibility and potential). So things interfere to allow consciousness to act most prevalent at certain octaves. As above, so below.<br/>
Take a look at this relevant short story I saw a few weeks ago. I loved it and thought it was quite interesting and somewhat accurate. <a href="http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html</a></p>

But it&#39;s obviously plausible that quantum particles on the planck scale having super position of each other could hold information indefinitely, and they could just relay that information to the next pair by emitting a polar force(up or down). It&#39;s a 1 or a 0 based on which one in the pair is up or down. The whole thing could come together kind of like this? and the data would travel through space time as the pattern repeats upon the next set of particles until they take hold somewhere, possibly. (Spirit entering/leaving a body?) It&#39;s probably more dynamic than that, but i felt that&#39;s the best way to convey the way it turns over and moves in the idea in my mind at least. 
The whole forest thing I was speaking about that you replied to, I feel works like neurons in a brain. They are all connected and are talking, but obviously if there is another underlying mechanism of consciousness as well, that would be important too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so, yeah. On the planck scale I believe in Nassim Haramein&#39;s holographic theory. It&#39;s a unified field theory and suggests on that on the planck scale spherical units of energy with a diameter of planck length interconnect omnidirectionally and overlap with each other in a 3d <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">flower of life</a>. These individual spheres rotate either one way or the other, like a 1 or 0 in binary, depending on what&#39;s going on with others around and effectually code the universe.<br/>
Also yes, this is a standing wave on just a 2d level, but if you think about the superposition of every point in the universe over time... you get this right here right now. Because things naturally tend to self-organise over time. I like to think of consciousness acting as a field, since it is the fabric of spacetime itself - the interconnected network of information, acting as a bose-einstein condensate superfluid - and similarly to how gravity gets stronger where more mass is, consciousness (or information) gravitates to where life is, as is most relevant.<br/>
Humans for example are conscious life. They need food to nourish, and movement to exercise, they have sensory input equipment, and a computer (brain) through which can create a database of information to analyse the universe from the humans relative perspective, gathered by the sensory equipment, be that eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands, and further on a deeper level the way your cells react on a micro scale to the way you live and treat your body. All these sensory equipment are made up of organs and tissue and bones and things that keep it all together. They are all made up of cells; relatively simple things that have lifespans and are created mostly by asexual cell division (mitosis), and cells have their own job to do and can do that by using the information gathered from material taken in to the body and made way to the cell, but also through relative communication with other cells. But how do all the cells know how to self-organise in such a perfect way to create a human? DNA. All cells have DNA as it&#39;s the blueprints of what create a human. Now what&#39;s DNA made of? 2 biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix, called polynucleotides. They are comprised of smaller monomer units called nucleotides. And they are composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases - cytosine, guanine, adenine, or thynine. And what are they made of? They&#39;re element compounds. Elements are composed of smaller &quot;particles&quot;, or more accurately just packets of energy and potential energy at that point, self-organised in stable forms. They&#39;re made of even smaller packets of energy, and so forth and so forth.<br/>
How do all of these know how to self-organise? Do they all communicate? Yes! Because they all exist and live relative lives, so therefore consciousness gravitates to them as is relevant to them so they have a fundamental anchor (call it subconscious) connection to this infinite information network of everything. This gives them a relative degree of self awareness so it can live to learn and do its part for itself and the greater thing it&#39;s only a small part of. Be it a cell, human, planet...<br/>
The concept of spirit and soul I believe in, but I can explain myself later in another post if you want me to. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on for a few months now so it&#39;d be nice to try to articulate this idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/PrincessOfDrugTacos">/u/PrincessOfDrugTacos</a> just said this to me but deleted it. I wanted to repost as I liked it and wanted to answer. They said this:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve thought about a string theory of consciousness. And quantum patterns continuing on a sub atomic level carrying information. Such as the &#39;spirit leaving the body&#39; being a continuing chain of patterns forming like dna strands holding information. I&#39;m not sure exactly how the data would know how to take hold somewhere or even stick together for the whole picture to be maintained properly.(Maybe some forces are stronger than others and because of this they stick together, or certain resonance of forces keep the particles from going too far apart, like how water works for instance.) and form something like a conscious entity inside tubules of a brain for instance. But it&#39;s obviously plausible that quantum particles on the planck scale having super position of each other could hold information indefinitely, and they could just rely that information to the next pair by emitting a polar force(up or down). It&#39;s a 1 or a 0 based on which one in the pair is up or down. The whole thing could come together kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle#/media/File:Standing_wave_2.gif">this?</a>&quot;  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my reply:<br/>
I think so, yeah. On the planck scale I believe in Nassim Haramein&#39;s holographic theory. It&#39;s a unified field theory and suggests on that on the planck scale spherical units of energy with a diameter of planck length interconnect omnidirectionally and overlap with each other in a 3d <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">flower of life</a>. These individual spheres rotate either one way or the other, like a 1 or 0 in binary, depending on what&#39;s going on with others around and effectually code the universe.<br/>
Also yes, this is a standing wave on just a 2d level, but if you think about the superposition of every point in the universe over time... you get this right here right now. Because things naturally tend to self-organise over time. I like to think of consciousness acting as a field, since it is the fabric of spacetime itself - the interconnected network of information, acting as a bose-einstein condensate superfluid - and similarly to how gravity gets stronger where more mass is, consciousness (or information) gravitates to where life is, as is most relevant.<br/>
Humans for example are conscious life. They need food to nourish, and movement to exercise, they have sensory input equipment, and a computer (brain) through which can create a database of information to analyse the universe from the humans relative perspective, gathered by the sensory equipment, be that eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands, and further on a deeper level the way your cells react on a micro scale to the way you live and treat your body.
