        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I loved my childhood. Grew up in the 1990&#39;s in Minnesota. What a fantastic and gorgeous state. </p>

<p>I loved life. Having friends, relationships, loved my parents. The world back then seemed as though everyone was happy and enjoying each other&#39;s presence, working together. No racism or bigotry, just humanity loving and living.</p>

<p>Now I realize, I was just a kid. As I grew up, the concepts of work, school, and this whole organized and predetermined system and order of operations we all blindly accept never felt &quot;right&quot; with me. There were grotesque atrocities being committed behind the scenes, but my pure childhood vision saw the world as it SHOULD be, without the influence of elite greedy psychos. </p>

<p>Now I realize, I was right. The world should be that way. This group of psychos are manipulating us from behind the scenes and stealing our destiny as a species from us. </p>

<p>YOU&#39;RE right. Not them. Trust your instincts. They are a big tumor on our humanitarian destiny folks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s comforting, but there&#39;s also the possibility that those oligarchs don&#39;t actually have control and the ultimate answer is that it&#39;s just the inevitable deterioration of our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s just a natural human instinctual feeling, kind of like how &quot;pain&quot; is used to tell us something is wrong, right? </p>

<p>This is like a spiritual feeling of &quot;ya know....something doesn&#39;t feel right here&quot; that we all have deep down. </p>

<p>And if we were all able to kind of point out finger in unison at what exactly the problem was (The elite oligarchs who own us), we could resolve the issue and that feeling would subside. </p>

<p>I truly believe this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, which really trips me up... Is that even the point? Is the point outward, or inward? There is always a PTB, no matter what Age you live in.

    <div class="md"><p>We all understand how money works. Writing off these arguments as laziness or stupidity is part of the conditioning of capitalism, passed down from the Protestant work ethic and before that through feudalism and the nobility. All through history, the people who didn&#39;t have to work have told the people who do that working hard for relatively little compensation is something to be proud of. Why didn&#39;t the nobility or the clergy ever go out and plow fields if they believed it? Or is it more likely they needed a docile, endlessly replaceable population to carry out their will? </p>

<p>You can still function within the system while recognizing how trapped you are. But a life spent running oblivious in the hamster wheel is a pretty sad one. We don&#39;t hear about the billions of people who lived and died to support their lords and bosses. They were still people. Odds are you&#39;re one of them, and the upper classes know it every time they look at you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because of capitalism. Anyone reading this and being triggered to defend your ideology, just stop. It&#39;s a fact that capitalism is what is currently forcing this state of affairs. Everything has been made private property. You can&#39;t just go out and stake a claim and build a home and garden. That is literally not possible in today&#39;s world. But you need shelter. You need to eat. You need healthcare. So what do you do? You try your best to find a job, and go to work every day like a good little slave. Your employer <em>knows</em> your alternative is homelessness and starvation, and they <em>exploit</em> this desperation, paying you the absolute lowest which you&#39;ll accept. What else are you going to do? Roll over and die?</p>

<p>And people defend this state of affairs on the absurdly naive premise that all you have to do is make your own business, as if it were that simple. </p>

<p>We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fantastic way of learning about things rather than repeating memes like &quot;capitalism is trade&quot; which are obviously incorrect even from reading capitalist literature. Capitalism is a system of property ownership. Trade and markets exist independent of capitalism. Capitalism is simply a system whereby the means of production (land, factories, tools, etc) are owned by capitalists who may or may not even utilize them, more often instead engaging in a wage-labor relationship whereby a worker is rented, temporarily, and paid a portion of the value of his product in wage. In today&#39;s society, as I&#39;ve said previously, this is inherently exploitative because with everything having been made private property the worker without capital <em>must</em> submit to a capitalist employer or starve and die. And no, meme arguments like &quot;start your own business!&quot; or &quot;rely on charity and be an ascetic&quot; (someone literally told me this...) are not sufficient argument against the basis of this exploitative nature. </p>

<p>P.s. what&#39;s really ironic is that the system you described is pretty much a socialist/anarchist description of capitalism.  Property rights are enforced via police state, with force applied by the state on behalf of the bourgeoisie. There are dozens of examples of massacres and murders perpetrated on the working class by the police, and even by the National Guard, when owners&#39; abuses have become too much for the working class to bear. </p>

<p>The National Guard literally burned children to death fighting with striking miners. Please keep on telling yourself this isn&#39;t the utilization of force to steal, though, on the basis of some billionaire a thousand miles away holding a deed to the mine. Total justice requires state supported pieces of paper declaring ownership, apparently, and anything else is petty theft. Yuuuuuuuup.</p>

<p>P.s. your argument about theft of prior claims could literally be used to argue reparations for Native Americans,  the restoration of the monarchy, etc. This should tell you that you might want to think about the question &quot;What is property?&quot; just a <em>little bit more</em>.</p>

<p>Actually, I do so by pointing out the fundamentally exploitative nature of the capitalist system- that it is in actuality a form of tyranny, the most pervasive form of tyranny in fact. I was right about to do so again, here, when I realized I already did so in my previous comment. But you just ignore it, satisfied with your facade of daisies, smiling children, and etcetera...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t be blamed for the actions of a socialist government protecting a government favored industry, and neither can capitalism. Null argument!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you might want to try the following: </p>

<p>Go to a library, check out the philosophy section, and read some books written by socialist thinkers. This comment betrays a fundamental ignorance to even the most basic concepts as to what socialism is. I can tell you with absolute one hundred percent certainty that it <strong><em>is not</em></strong> the application of state force <strong><em>on behalf of the capitalist class, against the working class</em></strong>. Like, to call that socialist... if you aren&#39;t simply ignorant or stupid, then I&#39;m worried you might eventually hurt yourself from all the contortions your mental gymnastics are putting you through. </p>

<p>p.s. Just want to bring it back to this comment for one more &quot;you are completely fucking wrong&quot; moment: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the people who oppose that &quot;magic word&quot; always do so by proposing vicious tyranny as the alternative-- </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you lack a real understanding of what socialism is, and you reveal this by implicitly lumping in all socialist systems together. Marxism-Leninism-- by which I mean socialism as applied by state collectivization, through a single revolutionary vanguard party, although there&#39;s certainly more to it than that-- certainly lends itself to authoritarianism, but what about anarcho-syndicalism? What about any of the other forms of left-libertarianism? Are you even... aware that they exist? That&#39;s a legitimate question, because you pretty much seem to define socialism as &quot;the gubment does it, and it&#39;s authoritarian&quot; which is just flat out wrong. </p>

<p>So if I point out a socialist country that was doing relatively well and then fell apart with the introduction of capitalism, would you then start to question your beliefs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not because it is a given that socialists lie, and that socialists attribute to <em>capitalism</em> such things as government regulation, high taxes, and state-granted monopoly.  I hear it all the time, and I realize the whole &quot;repeat the thing that is not until it becomes true&quot; used to work in the past, but times have changed.</p>

<p>You guys had 100 years to get it together.  In case you haven&#39;t noticed, the whole world has lost patience, and your philosophy is going to be driven into a few boltholes like North Korea and Cuba.  Even Venezuela is going to turn you into Hunted Men.</p>

<p>For fun, here&#39;s a video of a socialist explaining to a mob of people how he&#39;s been providing them freedom and prosperity, a few days before he was killed: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s completely fucking retarded. This social darwinist bullshit does nothing but serve to comfort you at night, telling yourself that the stupid, the untalented, the ugly, &quot;the lazy,&quot; because they were &quot;unlucky&quot; they deserve to live their lives in wage slavery and boy, they better be grateful! It&#39;s the disgusting sort of ideology I&#39;ve come to expect from people so ignorant they don&#39;t even know what ideology <em>is</em>, much less the nuance between one ideology and another. </p>

<p>The thing is, entire works have been devoted to the question of property, what it is, how property rights arose, the systems that support private property and the systems private property supports in turn- but you&#39;re completely ignorant to all of it. You just handwave away the issue as being &quot;those with property for lucky&quot; which is profoundly <em>simple</em>, to put it nicely. </p>

<p>You seriously don&#39;t understand the difference between laboring <strong><em>for myself</em></strong>, while retaining <strong><em>the entirety of my product</em></strong>, and laboring <strong><em>for another person</em></strong> and only receiving a percentage of its value in wage? You really don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m talking about, no wonder it seems ludicrous to you. </p>

<p>Capitalism is natural, communism is a dream.</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny, when the fascists and landowners fled the growing influence of the People&#39;s Militia in neighboring Catalonia, the peasantry of Aragon- most of whom were uneducated, and completely unexposed to revolutionary ideology- spontaneously self-organized along anarcho-syndicalist fashion. It&#39;s almost like in the absence of state authority enforcing property rights to the benefit of a few at the expense of the many, what&#39;s <strong><em>natural</em></strong> is for people to take social ownership and work together to common benefit! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could walk away this very hour. You could dedicate yourself to a life of asceticism, and the charity of any number of denominations would provide shelter and food for you to live out your life in pure servitude to the creator. This would be following in the footsteps of many men and women throughout history, and would be in line with the teachings of Christ.</p>

<p>Anything outside of that lifestyle is your choice--your are choosing to exchange your man hours for paper, your paper for plastic, your plastic for entertainment, your entertainment for fulfillment, your fulfillment for purpose. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;capitalism&quot;, like you say. It&#39;s &quot;materialism&quot; (read: Satanism). It&#39;s eating the apple because you need to know what it tastes like, then covering yourself in shame because YOUR physical has replaced THE mystical. There is no you, so don&#39;t worry about the &quot;you&quot; that &quot;goes&quot; to &quot;work&quot;. Your job is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

    <div class="md"><p>That absolutely does not work because of government. It works because of the charity of the members of a group that believe in their God, and accept believers into the fold no matter their &quot;economic&quot; status. </p>

<p>If you were a true believer in the nature of God as experienced by the Shakers, or Amish, or Buddhists, or Muslim, there would be no shortage of people from that faith willing to put a roof over your head and food in your mouth, in exchange only for your contribution to the group, whether by physical labor or intellectual enlightenment/devoutness. This has existed in every society this age, and most historians would actually attribute it to the very &quot;invention&quot; of civilization as we know it.</p>

<p>YOU are the one who would replace the power of belief with the power of government. You are the one making the choice to not live that life because you need to &quot;check in&quot; to this system, and play by these rules. If you can do that, and maintain your path forward on the journey to enlightenment, than you have made the right choice. But if your days are beset by doubt because youre still worried about what the government can provide you/withhold from you, then you&#39;ve been lead astray by the materialists, who would have you believe that the consequences to your self matter more than the guidance you were given.</p>

<p>Onward.</p>

The problem is that Capitalism is, in practice, the mindless acquisition of wealth. It&#39;ll just keep squeezing and squeezing people to accept less for more because it&#39;s the only game in town. There is no escape, unless you choose to completely isolate yourself from society. Meanwhile, the rich are undeniably getting richer at the poor&#39;s expense, as they always have. Why is pointing any of this out a call to enslave other people? We all suffer under the same system, to greater or lesser degrees. </p>

<p>The best way I can describe it is that I felt the presence of every being in existence and felt the love of God(I guess). I&#39;m not really religious so I don&#39;t know how to describe that outsider. It&#39;s too intense to explain.</p>

<p>Tl:Dr : I became close friends with every living thing in the universe for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I understand the addiction concern, you don&#39;t feel you have the willpower to use once or twice but have enough willpower to not use at all. That&#39;s fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not worried about addiction but just safety in general. </p>

<p>I know what you are talking about. I believe all of life is one giant person experiencing itself in every various way possible and that is probabaly why you felt so connected with everyone. I think the DMT breaks through the filters placed in the human mind and so that people using DMT are experiencing a more realistic version of life in a sense. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t religious either. I was basically an atheist who used to be a Christian but I stumbled upon the matrix rabbit hole and that made me a believer again. The knowledge I took in is very similar to what people using DMT are saying which is an amazing coincidence. </p>

<p>They made it so the whole world is out fighting over the same few dollars that exists in the common economy. This was, they keep us working like slaves while at the same time preventing us for real peace and security. </p>

<p>One day we need to drop money and trade altogether and upgrade to a gifting economy which would make this world so utterly rich, we would all win in a huge variety of ways. The only gifting economy available is sacred economics. Here is a 12 minute video explaining how it works:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with money or trade.  Money is a transferable proxy for value.  Without a conduit for value transfer you can&#39;t have economic growth i.e., information growth, i.e., prosperity.

<p>I&#39;m not saying money and trade aren&#39;t corruptible.  They are, and more easily so than other things.  But a high high potential to create necessitates a high potential to destroy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure all living beings live within an ecosystem of predators and prey,  seeking and avoiding,  etc.</p>

<p>This post however is addressing the social arrangements of human beings,  the form of rule that they participate in.    Since the invention of the &quot;social contract&quot; or &quot;self determination&quot; within the order of humans,  rule of law,  civilization,  bills of rights,  and so on,  humans have had the option of making choices about how they are governed.    There have been times when slavery,  for example was outlawed,   times when interest rates were regulated,   times when workers rights were advanced and employers had to bargain with their workers regarding the terms of employment.</p>

<p>The point of this post is that growing up,  a lot of kids pick up that their parents are not involved in any choices at all,  that the terms of their lives have become non-negotiable.    Later on we learn that our living arrangements have been set up to exploit us and the claims that we live under democracy and free markets are largely untrue.</p>

<p>In other words,  the man made world has had wild swings,  and what we have made up for ourselves at this point needs to be re-examined.    The biological terms of our lives may not be as negotiable as the terms by which we order our society.    Even the terms by which our society is ordered are seemingly very difficult to change,   but history shows that they have changed and can be changed,  for the better or for the worse,  especially if we inform ourselves and take note of them.    Kids can pick up on stuff like that,   even in the classroom,  arbitrary nonsense is obvious,  and adults can look very silly.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for the poeple in this thread, however here&#39;s how we make the market work for us.</p>

<p>Have read what <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/">High Level Insider</a> proposed? The US government (because there are not many other entities in the world that could realize it) investing in a large infrastructure project: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qezLhypA0Y">orbital ring &amp; space elevator</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.takepart.com/feature/2016/06/27/solar-farms">space based solar farm</a>. It will be used to deliver very cheap (less than $0.01/kwh) solar derived electricity back to Earth. Other benefits are cheap access to LEO/GEO.</p>

<p>The project will be so profitable that the enormous US debt can be paid back in a few years and all people will become wealthier in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, school was a place where I was held back to the speed of my peers in some areas and forced to a pace that I could not keep in others. It was a place of violence done to me by other kids for no reason that I could understand. It was a waste of time that prevented me from learning/studying what I wanted to study, while getting randomly attacked occasionally. I hated it and I still hate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compulsory schooling never sat right with me. It wasn&#39;t that I hated school, I hated that I HAD to be there. </p>

<p>I love learning new things, I&#39;m an information sponge, and I&#39;m a born teacher. The issue isn&#39;t education, or even necessarily classrooms - I can function very well in that environment - the issue was the compulsory nature of public schooling. My whole day in high school revolved around trying to get out of the building. I spent a lot of time in in-school suspension.</p>

<p>Once I hit college and could practice some modicum of volition, I maintained a 4.0 and graduated summa. Even studied to be a teacher, but got to the practicum and realized there was no way I could make a career within the public school environment, specifically because the students weren&#39;t there of their own volition. I wanted to teach, not be a truancy officer.</p>

<p>(Also playing into that decision was the fact that public schools are funded through taxes and I wholeheartedly believed 20 years ago that taxation is theft. I still half-heartedly believe that, but have come to an understanding that <em>some</em> services must be socialized in order to allow the market - hell, society - to flourish.) </p>

<p>So, college was a waste of $20,000 for me - fortunately it was last century so the cost was relatively low. Still took me a decade to pay off.</p>

<p>Then when I had kids, I decided <em>not</em> to force them into public schooling when they were very young - tried to maintain some sense of wonder and curiosity. We homeschooled for elementary. </p>

<p>In a month, my 11yo starts public school for the first time. He has never sat in a classroom. His perspective on bricks-and-mortar is that it is essentially a warehouse where kids are held so that their parents can go run the rat race. </p>

<p>But, it isn&#39;t about quality of education right now, it&#39;s about socialization. His biggest hangup about the whole thing? Having to be there at a certain time on a certain day, having to function in a group all day, every day, having no choice over what and when he studies...his anxiety is based on the compulsory aspect.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid without the experience of compulsory education, he won&#39;t ever buckle down and work steadily enough to feed himself as an adult. Or have the opportunity for that Stockholm Syndrome bonding that occurs in public school with one&#39;s classmates. Or really grok the idea that people mostly don&#39;t get to just get up when they choose and decide what they want to do with their day. </p>

<p>I feel like a villain for &quot;subjecting&quot; him to it, as though this is some sort of necessary hoop to jump through to break his spirit a little so that he can function in today&#39;s world. At least, that&#39;s the feedback I&#39;m getting from many other adults in his sphere. It&#39;s awful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>In my country lots of middle-class people have kids, only to return immediately to work and stick those kids in childcare. Ironically the childcare costs can eat into most of their earnings. <em>What&#39;s the point?</em></p>

<p>With technological advances, we should all be working LESS; instead, we are working more than ever (apart from the parasitic elite class that is - but don&#39;t focus on them, look over there! The welfare queens/benefit scroungers are the real enemy!!!), spending most of our lives doing something we don&#39;t enjoy with people we don&#39;t like, in exchange for numbers on a screen. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a woman. I&#39;m supposed to be grateful for being &quot;liberated&quot; from the drudgery of raising a family so I can do THIS instead? Are you kidding?</p>

<p>&quot;Absurd&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to cover it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking the same this morning. We have a &quot;higher quality of life&quot; now... do we? Really? I see my kids about 3 hours a day during the week. They do all the child care crap etc. And the kicker is; more and more offices are moving to 9-5:30 now, so even less life to be had. When my kids are my age, I&#39;m predicting 9-6 will be standard. Probably with a Saturday thrown in for good measure. It&#39;s a farce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not 9-6, more like a required amount of tangible work that will benefit the State. I see the future of our world&#39;s economies evolving into a pay-to-play/dutifully-give-to-live kind of schema. </p>

<p>A large part of the current education &amp; work structures imo are designed to stifle creativity, individuality &amp; honest curiosity.

    <div class="md"><p>What you guys are truly arguing about is neoliberalism versus democratic socialism. It&#39;s odd to see so many Americans starting to stir since the Zionist convinced America that neoliberalism is good  - you guys called it Reagonomics or crony-capitalism. One of its greatest tools is globalism. You know who suffers the most from globalism? The middle classes of developed economies.</p>

<p>In Australia we had a majority democratic socialist government after ww2, right in the midst of keynesian politics, and it was great, but it went too far which caused the massive inflation and stagnant markets that all the developed economies had by the late 70s.</p>

<p>The true answer is still capitalism, but a checked mixture of democratic socialist with capitalism. This means regulations from the government and protectionist economic policies...who gives a shit if you can&#39;t get a cheap iPad, if you know long term money remains circulating in your own economy.</p>

<p>This is why I watched Trump with interest because before the elections he made some very good campaign promises....they just have happened. Australia is the same, we are stuck with 2 parties that are really both simply neoliberalist yes men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was really on for me having this epiphany, so to speak; I think I was in the fourth grade here in the US when I asked my teacher why learning the jingle to School House Rock was important. </p>

<p>The summer before school started, I spent my time with my family in Ethiopia where my mother is from &amp; not only did I find an amazing escape from western society as a whole but I got to experience a new kind of society that places value on things more &quot;natural&quot; in my opinion.</p>

<p>I was able to see true faith when I walked in lalibela &amp; spoke to people with not much more than their clothes &amp; love who said &quot;my god has &amp; will provide whatever is needed&quot; unlike the unfortunately common practice of many institutions that use these individuals as martyrs for their cause to amass un-taxable wealth. </p>

<p>I was also able to see such a rich &amp; timeless culture that is not discussed in American schools for reasons I can only ponder. I truly believe our education system is just a methodical process that trains our physical bodies &amp; our ethereal aspects to revolve around unnatural tendencies &amp; ideologies that only serve to exacerbate the ego &amp; stifle any chances at seeing the unity among the many pieces of one. </p>

They want more wine, exotic clothes, jewelry, (cars, smartphones, cheap burgers), and if you want items like that which you think you need to be happy, well then enters the <em>kallipolis</em>.

I just argued with this dude in this very thread who was flat out wrong in his basic conception of what capitalism is, and rather than admit that and reexamine his thinking he accused socialists of &quot;trying to bog him down defending every little speck of vocabulary&quot; like it doesn&#39;t matter at all -_- </p>

<p>But yeah, as far as I can tell capitalism is pretty much The conspiracy. </p>
