       The Bush family are the head of the Cult of Vulcan or more commonly called the Military Industrial Complex. George Walker Bush's presidential advisory team was known as The Vulcans named after the Roman deity of metal working, weapons making and fire. The Bush-Walker family are basically the unofficial monarchs of the United States and were involved in transforming the Virginia Company into the United States during the Revolutionary War through the Virginian politicians Francis Walker and his brother John Walker who was a representative for the House of Burgesses. The Bush-Walker family are war profiteers and are the founding fathers and major owners of the military industrial complex. The Bush family have been using the United States as a military corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vannevar Bush was the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development which oversaw the Manhattan Project. Vannevar Bush also founded Raytheon which is one of the largest military weapons manufacturers that is continually in contract with the United States Department of Defense with annual earnings estimated at 25 billion. The M163 Vulcan Air Defense System and the M61 Vulcan rotary canon are still in use and produced by General Dynamics for the US military. Raytheon is the largest producer in the world for guided missile systems. Northrop Grumman is another military defense and aerospace company in contract with the Department of Defense. Wesley G. Bush is the current President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer for Northrop Grumman. Wesley Bush is also on the Board of Governors for the Aerospace Industries Association which is a trade and lobbyist group.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Walker Bush's Vice President Dick Cheney was Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton energy company which has also been in contract with the Department of Defense. Jonathan Bush is a wealthy banker and who had helped to finance his nephew George Walker Bush's presidency and his Abrusto energy company. George Walker Bush made up the lie about "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq and made profits through their covert shares and control over the military arms industry. Prescott Bush, Jonathan Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, and George Walker Bush have all been initiated into Yale's Skull and Bones secret society. The Skull and Bones is a commonly used symbol for war. The Bush family are mass murderers and war profiteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon, United States Air Force, and DARPA have designed electronic weapons, microwave weapons, and other various Directed-Energy weapons that are being used on civilians inside the United States. Active Denial System is an microwave type weapon developed by Raytheon that burns skin and organs including the brain. The United States Air Force developed what they call the "dazzler" to impair vision and cause disorientation to their victims. There are non classified weapons that target the mind as well. I am under constant brain invading attack which make death threats against my body and soul along with microwave burns, skin itching, hair itching, electro-chemical manipulation in the bodily energies, intense pressures in the brain, and shooting pains in my organs. These attacks are called the "Crown of Thorns" and these attack are ordered by the Bush family through their Skull and Bones death cult. The name Bush refers to a pricker bush or bramble bush.

       I know you don't like me (for whatever reason - hoping to air that grievance), but you could use some better people skills. I also think it would be prudent to provide more links and sources to your work (give names - but also give links).
      </p>
      <p>
       You make connections that I've never seen before, but I have to go and dig them up (I'm willing to but most people will not). I think by adding them, you would hit a home run, damn near every time. Just my two cents, and friendly positive criticism...

       You've never given me sources. I'm on your team, here. I've been here for years talking about these things. You weave the minute so beautifully, I just think you need some more behind your work, to really hit a home run, with people (ordinary people who are clueless).
      </p>
      <p>
       Me, you, and maybe ~3 others here talk about this topic. Why you would turn on me, is beyond me. I'm a dick, sometimes, sure.. But I just want the truth to come out... I wish you didn't see me as an enemy, because I do not see you as one, and I upvote damn near all your posts.. Why? Because they're spot on... I just think you need more sources, to awaken people, fully...
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the paranoia or defensive mechanism, I truly do. I'm attacked on the daily, and I do not even go as detailed as you do... I understand. I'm not your enemy, I promise you that. Peace, please? It's far too important...

       Request a source for a specific fact or conclusion. I will not provide sources for a post that includes this many facts. That would need dozens of sources. I have stated this over and over again. Simply request a source for a specific fact or statement or get lost.

       Apparently everything he says is true. In fact it's what I've been looking for for a long time and researched. But there are things like rituals or drinking blood that make me impossible to ascertain or deepen. On the internet there is very little information on Stefano Massimo or Fabrizio Massimo Bancrazzio.
