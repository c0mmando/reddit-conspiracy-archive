To instill this response within the people, every year a couple of WW2 films come out portraying the Nazis and Germans as inhumane and illogical animals. This is also enforced in the media, which is also Jewish owned. This will never stop because they have successfully transformed the US into a multicultural and divisive nation with racial, religious, etc... conflict, so the people will never organize due to these differences. The demoralization has already been completed in Western Europe and ethnic replacement is currently underway. </p>

<p>Indeed, can a historian be called a researcher, if revisionism is forbidden? Isn&#39;t research revisionism by definition?</p>

<p>Also few people know of the article <em>Jews</em> in Voltaire&#39;s masterpiece, <em>Le Dictionnaire Philosophique</em>. It&#39;s been expunged from most (all) modern editions, including in French.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right and wrong, but that&#39;s also a part of the brilliance of a certain group&#39;s infiltration into all aspects of global existence, especially central banking and interest.</p>

<p>When you start off with &quot;The Jews,&quot; however you immediately discredit yourself with a large swath of the population who identify as &quot;Jewish&quot; (culturally, geographically, religiously) – and those who have friends who are Jewish – that are playing no part in this manipulation, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neturei_Karta">many &quot;Jews&quot; are vehemently opposed to it.</a> and Jews who are accepted and live peacefully in other nations without a central bank, like Iran and Syria.</p>

<p>Ken O&#39;Keefe recently did a fine job categorizing the controllers as something like the &quot;Jewish Supremacist Talmudic Satanic Pedo Bankster Cult.&quot; It&#39;s a mouthful, but that&#39;s how they want it. Maybe instead of &quot;The Jews&quot; we can start abbreviating: JSTSPBC. Y&#39;know, for accuracy and brevity.</p>

<p>My kid went to a Jewish preschool, because the teachers and staff there were the best in town and extremely &quot;reformed&quot; in the Jewish sense. Very open to all, very creative in their approach to learning, etc., etc. Of course, as goy, we were looked-at funny by a few of the parents, including one with a minivan adorned with the license plate &quot;CHABAD&quot;. The point being, that if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d be turned off by your saying &quot;The Jews&quot; because my experience with &quot;The Jews&quot; personally has been positive, and we have to speak to those experiences and people, perhaps more so than any others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, they are playing a part in it even though they don&#39;t realize it. Hardline, Zionist Jews (Hasidim, etc) are using these &quot;open to all&quot; good Jews to push so-called progress onto White nations. Feminism, homosexuality, transgenderism, diversity, equality, et al, are being used to destroy the self and the family unit, which are the foundation of civilization. This is genocide. Just research the Weimar Republic. All of this cancer was rampant back then, and it&#39;s what allowed the NSDAP to take power.</p>

<p>History repeats itself, and as long as Caucasians can shake off the guilt that has been heaped upon them for the last 70+ years, we&#39;re in for a wild ride. I would like to see a peaceful resolution to it all, Jews make Aliyah, negroes and the rest of the brown peoples repatriated to the country of their ethnic background. The ideals that America was founded on are not one of immigrants from all lands, but of Whites from Western Europe.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be peaceful, unfortunately. The darker the skin tone, the more violent the race. What none of the SJWs, liberals, progressives, negroes, Jews, mestizoes can get through their heads is that they love to cry about the ruthlessness and efficiency of Whites when we&#39;re finally brought to violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are playing a part in it even though they don&#39;t realize it. </p>

<p>But, m&#39;friend, &quot;globalism&quot; is an inevitable part of our planetary evolution, and the integration of all ethnicities and nationalities across borders is something no one can ever control, nor should they. You&#39;re speaking to a definition of &quot;nationalism&quot; that is already archaic, myopic and racist.</p>

<p>Your first paragraph has some merit, but the rest peer through some foggy scratched-up lenses.</p>
