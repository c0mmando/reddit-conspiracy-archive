       I listened to him for about a week until I realized it is almost 100% about selling product. He is an actor and that is a character he plays. The court case admission sealed the deal,  but I already got that vibe (from an anecdotal standpoint) from listening to his program.

       Why not just ask for donations instead of claiming that some water filter is going to protect his listeners from turning the frogs gay, and that if you buy his competitors' products, they will die.

       He's a fucking idiot, and his listeners are even more idiotic for believing his bullshit.

       You get downvoted a shit load for asking rational questions and making sane observations, which is becoming more and more frequent on this sub. Alex Jones is a pure snake oil shilling actor. I am not convinced he isn't controlled opposition. I have a friend who has been sucked into his show and his products, and it's disgusting how much time and money he spends on Jones' bullshit.

       This is the best way to put it. There's truth to what Jones puts out, but one has to use critical thinking and discernment on everything that states, "xyz is going to happen." People get into trouble when they run the predictions game and Jones is no different. But his coverage on what has already transpired (especially material which isn't covered elsewhere) isn't that bad.

       We got duped as usual. What if i told you this entire reality is a "Staged Psy OP". Aliens with advanced tech came into this dimensional and enslaved everyone inside an advanced V.R. Matrix. People can call me a "loser" and can call me "insane". But this is what is happening. At the very least, when you physically "die" pay close attention and you will notice the "White Light Tunnel" is a ridiculous trap. Refuse the almighty "Life Review" and tell the Parasitic Aliens pretending to be "Guides" and "Masters" that you are an ETERNAL FREE BEING...

       Ya it didn't take me long to figure that out. I returned to his show for a couple of days when the whole fake news narrative came out. I couldn't handle him for very long. Every second word that came out of his mouth was a buzzword. "Fake news this,  fakes news that, CNN this, CNN that. The left said..."

       Joe Rogan is just a curious guy, he admits when he's wrong and only seeks provable truths.  Eddie has done a few too many drugs and is seeking secret information.  Callahan is seeking approval and for people to believe he's stacked with information_quite often wrong).  Joey Diaz is just an old school New Yorker and he's only seeking his next edible, he doesn't give two shits about any of this.  Haven't seen much of Trussel.

       in between the advertisements for his goofy products he shills out there?

       Op is not lying. He has brought up a fantastic point. The potential for our so called "conspiratorial arena masters" as possible shills owned by the powers that be themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look deeper. The guy is a con artist. As a whole, he is shaping the image of our movement in a negative manner.

       People lie about AJ on here daily
      </p>
      <p>
       They say he doesn't cover stuff, but they actually don't watch his show enough to have seen that it was covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who act like he's just hawking products and complaining about liberals aren't worth listening to. Those people are skimmers. They don't listen/read carefully. Or they're being intentionally deceptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots of people here who think he's controlled opposition because he doesn't agree with their borderline schizophrenic theories
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that he spends too much time on the political divide, and I stopped watching him because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean OP gets to lie and say he doesn't cover any of that stuff at all

       The side that points out conspiracy despite whose in power. The side that is antagonists and skeptical to elites. You gotta put aside your political ideology, just because Trump's in office doesn't give him any passes.

       Alex Jones seems to be more for push Trump than actually revealing and inveetigating conspiracies.

       They've "talked" about all of it, generally in passing.  But it's not the hard hitting, informative, deep digging show it used to be.  When's the last documentary they released?  Why did Alex apologize to Alefantis when there's ample evidence he is guilty of paedophilia?  Why is there a three minute commercial every five minutes?

       My post history says otherwise.  I don't watch TV and already know Oliver is a shill, I wouldn't take my cues from that schmuck.  People who have watched Jones for more than a decade and aren't willing to admit he's changed the direction of Infowars are the big gat phonies.

       He was telling us about the spy grid and secret experiments before most anyone else, now he touches upon what's already in the news and hints at having information he can't share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the information on what will be coming in ten years?  Where's the next "Police State" doc, or any new documentary for that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't he hold Trump's feet to the fire over Syria?  He mentioned it in passing, in passing over it right to all of the good things Trump has done so we should ignore his continued bombing of a sovereign nation.

       The conspiracy is that Infowars is clearly not the same as it was before the election.  People are unwilling to admit to it, and moreover are defending Alex as if nothing has changed.  That does a great disservice to the community who stood behind him for years, and for those newcomers brought on board by this last election.

       How so? This is a completely untrue statement and I don't believe many people here on this sub watch or listen enough to know that.

       Instead people watch John Oliver and other snippets and smears and believe they know what's going with AJ.

       LMFAO!  Have you actually watched any of those?  Most of them have little to nothing to do with what the title says.  They create click-bait titles with whatever is in the news to get you to watch their videos, spend two minutes lightly touching on the subject, go to commercial, then come back and change the subject to how much MSM is scared and their going after Infowars so we really need to buy the products to keep the fight going; "now more important than ever, except now, and now, aaand now."

       I have a question. How do you expect him to fund his system he has going? He has at least 2-4+ reporters on his payroll as well as 2-4+ people working in the background. I'm sure they get paid more than minimum wage, he needs at least $200,000+ a year for his employees. He's promoting his own products, sure some of them are a little off. Also there's only a few videos like that.

       They were doing just fine getting the truth out before the election.  People are turning away from big operations like the MSM while AJ is trying to become them, he's turning a lot of ling time fans off.  How about he doesn't spend $220k on meme contests and creates a documentary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they talk about that stuff, they have to.  But they're spending more and more time becoming an entertainment channel and less time exposing.

       Some people thing Alex Jones is a CIA disinformation agent. I think that gives him too much credit. He's a useful idiot who wants money. If he's spreading CIA disinformation it's because it's fed to him by what he thinks are modern day deep-throats.

      <p>
       The guy is a joke. He might drop some truth here and there, but that's to convince a small audience. Enough bullshit is mixed in though, so that when people repeat what he says they come off as crazy and discredit that kernel of truth.

       OP is not lying. same as david icke  when your a bit more awake you can see they are controlled opposition.
as you get deeper into the rabbit hole you can see which subjects they wont mention.  judy woods, money creation, legal name fraud.
yet they push time wasting subjects.

       Alex Jones is a carnie.  He doesn't believe any of the shit he spouts, he just knows how to hoodwink the rubes.  Much like our president. He's the very definition of a snake oil salesman.

       AJ dances around the Truth like a drunk chick at Mardi Gras...I listened to that buffoon for over two years before I decided he was constantly bringing his audience down a dead end road away from the hard core truths. The man is nothing more than a paid distraction and fear gear salesman. A clown disguised as a Truther.

       I don't understand why people still listen to Alex Jones. I've been into conspiracies since the internet started and I've always thought he was a fuckin idiot. Plus he admitted in court that he's literally playing a character and it's all for show. It just blows my mind that there are still people out there that take him seriously.

Joey Diaz is just an old school New Yorker and he's only seeking his next edible, he doesn't give two shits about any of this.  Haven't seen much of Trussel.

       so, then, one could say that the issue is
