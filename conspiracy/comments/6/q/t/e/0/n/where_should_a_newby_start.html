       new to this sub and conspiracy theory as a whole.
starting a topic really throws you down rabbit holes, that its a bit messy. There's too much I don't know, so I need to break the whole thing down before attempting to consider the vast sea of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone help with providing a list that would be best for the conspiracist starter pack? ahah.

       i spent the last 12 hours link diving into the new world order and holy shits.

       The 'confirmed conspiracies' are largely comprised of state-endorsed and state-verified 'operations'. It is like looking over a person's autobiography to find evidence of crime. Sure, it might be in there, but why would you trust anything such a book has to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       A completely different angle of attack is to ask yourself what
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       currently believe
       <em>
        and why

       The language it uses when addressing certain topics. It says it's a list of things that normies believe, insinuating that conspiracy theorists would generally not believe most things on the list. But then there's things like "lizard-birds once lived on the earth but now they are the oil we use for fuel" which is very dismissive in nature. Doesn't use the word dinosaur and it gives the impression that it's silly if you believe in them. Also one that stands out is saying normies believe "plato was a real person", as if he wasn't. It's just a lot of general criticisms I have all stemming from the language. The dismissive language solicits an emotional response. It's not very objective and, to me, that indicates an agenda other than truth seeking/sharing is being pushed.
       <br/>
       I honestly don't mind discussing out-there topics, even ones I don't believe myself, but if you enter the discussion with what at least appears to be the mindset of "
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       topics are true and
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       are silly" - even indirectly - then it sends up red flags.

       Be wary of anyone telling you that 'this conspiracy is bullshit' and 'that one is not'.  Some believe, others won't.  Read as much as can, learn as much as you can.  You can then make up your own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       To prove my point, many people do not believe there was anything but the official explanation to 9-11 or the JFK assassination.  Others consider these almost like 'gateway-conspiracies', that it's so obvious there was something else happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only you should decide what you think.  Don't be swayed by my opinion or someone else's until you've really examined the ideas yourself.

       I mean 9/11 is the logical place to start, but it's so deep that you get lost and you'll go nuts after a while. I suggest finding a topic/conspiracy that moves you and dig in. Always entertain all sides and be aware of the possibility of misdirection. Don't get caught up in comment battles with shills.

       Great answers on this great question.  (Perhaps this didn't trigger any key word searches for the "paid traitors"  Can we call them Paid-tors??)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me start by saying I am no one and I know nothing.  So is everybody else.  This sub is incredible.  It's a bunch of no ones. 
 Sometimes I am in total awe of the pieces that are put together in this sub (and others-diversify.)  Good, smart open minded people. 
 It is inspiring.
  -  I think you should definitely start with something that interests you.  That may sound simple but it is much easier to research something that is interesting to you personally.  Or something with which you already have some information, knowledge or experience.  I find myself chasing things that I read that are contrary to what I am sure I know.  That gives you a solid ground, home base, place to come back to.  For example - I read that they found the passport of one of the terrorists in the rubble on 9/11 - If I work at a paper manufacturing plant, I KNOW that passport paper is really thin so it doesn't make sense that it would have landed so close to the crash site (I'm making this up.  I do not work at a paper plant and I am not claiming to know how far passport paper would float.)  If that is not logical to me, I start from there because I know that to be true.  For example - Jet Fuel can't Melt Steel Beams.  It's a home base - whatever your theory is, you gauge it against what you know is true.
  -  Don't dismiss anything straight out.
       <br/>
       -  Do not spend 12 hours a day doing this.  Then tomorrow you will spend 13 because you are on to something and the next day...
  -  One step at a time.  Trust me on this.  It's overwhelming.  Small bites.
       <br/>
       -  Reach out.  Make friends.  Have someone to bounce ideas off of or with.  The more you learn the more alone you will feel.  (I dunno did I say that out loud :)
  -  Go put your feet on the earth once in awhile.  For real.  I know it sounds fruity.  For me, I get wrapped up in all of this and it is a good reminder to stand up, walk away from it, clear my head, refocus and touch something real. I found out I really like how grass feels between my toes.
  -  Remember your journey so that you don't become one of those people that comments - eh, this is bullshit, move on.  Consider everyone's ideas as important as your own.  They do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall I guess my advice would be this - Take it all in, consider it all and keep the parts you want and dismiss the parts you don't.  Like THIS post.  Hopefully I have give you something worth keeping.
My Daddy says... if someone tries to give you a bucket of shit you should take it.  You never know - the bucket might be worth something.

       I've been doing a lot of research on CERN. I think its the most fascinating thing going on right now. You can look up CERN Revelation 9. Youtuber Jason A makes some pretty good weekly videos, they are Christian heavy but also highlight the upside down status of our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't link to youtube videos because my work has youtube blocked but my 2 favorite videos are Everything is a Richmans Trick as well as 9/11 the new Pearl Harbor. Those are between 3 and 4 hours long each but really get the ball rolling in various directions.

       The construction of your self is the biggest conspiracy of all. Your false/limited perceptions, your socialization, your body, nervous system and brain (constantly deceiving and creating stories), your sub conscious, you unconscious desires, propaganda, accepted narratives and presuppositions, your temporal and spacial alignment, language, and, of course, cats.

       yeah, thats something huge I think about. But where does religion end and spirituality start, because the two kind of seem to overlap in interpretation. If religion is a means of control, would it be made to consider the spiritual in order to make it just that bit more believable？Personally I think daoism peaks spirituality. Hinduism probably has something there.
