        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Basically, around 1910, the police forces in black neighborhoods were basically told to stand down. The black residents could no longer depend on the police and so they had to invest in guns. The few police that were still active were extremely racist and treated the black people horribly. This all goes back to the cabal&#39;s larger goals of divide and conquer. In this case, they wanted to divide the black from the whites. They are still working this division and you can see it first hand over at POL with the endless racist comments posted up by sinister government agencies of the cabal. Eventually, gangs emerged and became the local police force but these gangs fought against each other and havoc reigned. </p>

<p>The cabal decided it could further deteriorate the people by introducing drugs into the neighborhood which they themselves profit from. America doesn&#39;t have poppy fields or drug factories. The cabal simply produces this stuff outside of America and brings it into America with the help of the CIA and DEA and then sells it to poor, desperate minorities who are so hungry that they would almost give an arm for some comfort. These minorities then end up doing the cabals dirty work on the street and the cabal ends up making their money. But the cabal isn&#39;t satisfied with just that, they also use police officers to throw these minorities in prisons where they make money off the Prison Industrial Complex. </p>

<p>After the cabal drained the minorities down to shambles, they began to realize the white folk still have a lot of money and so they targeted them. Now, everyone is going through the same thing. They keep these drugs illegal so that nobody else can make money off of them plus they can use the Prison Industrial Complex to make even more money off these poor citizens. They don&#39;t even bother with rehabilitation because if they fixed these prisoners, then they would end up losing money from lost drug sales and lost prison sentences. </p>

<p>The cabal makes life real hard financially to keep the people desperate enough to sell their own souls for money. That&#39;s simply what happens when the economic conditions deteriorate. The deterioration is actually artificial meaning the cabal has volume control over the economy and they can raise up real high anytime they want or they can make it worse like they did when they removed 30% of all cash from the economy to cause the Great Depression which led to 5 million suicides. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that human beings (1 out of every 125 approximately), are experiencing intense suffering mostly for crimes of pure desperation. People who are sentenced to prison know how unfair it is but they feel helpless because we, the people, consent to this horrific terror. </p>

<p>Some facts:</p>

<p>America has 2% of the world population but 25% of its prisoners. </p>

<p>70% of prisoners contract some disease in prison.</p>

<p>Prisoners make about 19 cents an hour. Prison workers are essentially modern day slaves and many wealthy corporations make a killing off of their labor and yet they don&#39;t earn a penny of social security even if they work for 30 years. </p>

<p>Prisoners are bombarded with &quot;for profit&quot; corporations that charge money for everything. These prisoners make about 19 cents an hour so these outlandish charges (IE 15 cent per minute phone cards with a $3 surcharge) make life nearly impossible in prison. With the serious lack of resources, prisoners end up like old savage Tribes that end up killing each other for petty things like a roll of toilet paper. </p>

<p>Corizon makes 1.4 Billion per year by &quot;treating&quot; sick prisoners. Often times, they let the prisoner just die to save money. This way, Corizon gets tax payer dollars and spends little on treatment costs. </p>

<p>America has the highest incarceration rate. North Korea has the 2nd highest. </p>

<p>Prison is essentially a modern day torture chamber. Solitary confinement is essentially high intensity torture. </p>

<p>Punishment doesn&#39;t even work in the long run so all the punishment is for nothing. Rehab actually works but the government has no interest in rehabilitating prisoners. </p>

<p>This costs us 75 billion a year. </p>

<p>CCA Private Prison made 1.7 billion in 1 year. This company gives a lot of money to a lot of politicians. </p>

<p>Experimental drugs are put in prisoners food and water to experiment on them. Many inmates end up infertile and very sick. </p>

<p>Over 2 million Americans (almost 1% of the population) are in prison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck. That&#39;s fucked. I thought I knew how fucked it was, but it&#39;s more fucked than I fucking thought. Fuck. We should be scared as fuck to end up being fucked into that fucked up situation. So I guess be careful who you fuck, and how you fuck them, and be very careful what the fuck you do. Fuck. </p>
