       recently the trump adminstration has had some shakeups to staff lately.  we all know about the secretary of press in and out 10 days later deal.  plus the way he publicly calls out sessions, the resignation of rinse penis etc.  add to this the norks using a new long range missile that very likely could hit our mainland, russia reducing the amount of diplomats, iran taking a larger role in syria all of the sudden, the MASSIVE failure of the healthcare bill here at home,  i think other countries are paying close attention to this and seeing trump as weak.  if you add to that the fact that he has given to russia and got NOTHING IN RETURN in the form of allowing assad to stay in power AND agreeing to stop arming "moderate rebels", also trump has applied significant pressure to china and russia to deal with north korea, something they have refused to do which also makes trump look weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       in addition to all of this, governments are beginning to go straight to congress to negotiate things like trade deals like france did recently (i cant find the article on it right now).
      </p>
      <p>
       to me it looks like the rest of the world sees trump as weak, is pushing him around a bit, and trump is a weak negotiator on the world stage. althought i wonder if the fact that he is running on a barebones state dept has anything to do with it.

       Hahahaha hell no!  Man, he was awful.  I still think he was a shadow republican.  Also, he killed waaay too many people.  And there is a ton more but I can't say right now because i have to go to work.

       Actually Obama was not weak. Trump is weak as fuck. Obama may have been a neoliberal technocrat but he knew at the fuck he was doing I'm like orange rage baby with micropenis. You must be one of those fucking Trumptards trying to drum up false equivalency.

       He was not weak in destroying America. He did a pretty good job of that. As well as the 8 year apology/vacation tour with the tranny ape. You must be one of those people who went to a school that had common core. So eat a dick, let your significant other get pounded by Jamal and Daronte. But fuck off with your weak argument.

       She does look like an ape and has a penis. I have been labeled many things but white, cuck, fag, and middle-aged have never been one. That freaky deaky bitch on first glance fits the definition of tranny ape.

       Single-payer healthcare and cheap or free higher education work just fucking great in other countries. Medicare for all would cost 20 trillion less over 10 years than the current system. Open borders I am against though I am Pro legal immigration, I actually believe that a country's Health completely depends on it. Michelle Obama is a strong beautiful educated black woman. To call her and tranny ape is some of the most vile, racist, toxic bullshit that a normal healthy minded person could imagine. But then again, Trump Republicans are far from healthy and normal minded. They are literally the Idiocracy. Literally.

       I think a lot of European and Scandinavian countries really want to attract young people and talented people into their countries plain and simple. I think the right makes too much out of it. There are problems, for instance I don't think Sharia enclaves should be allowed to form. I also think the left at the college level goes way too far with all their PC bullshit. I also think the left in general needs take it over there Illusions about Islam and realize that it is a very dangerous ideaology. While I see these as problems, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Ultimately I think the lack of Universal Health Care is what will break this country and is probably the Maine reason I support Bernie. Now if you want to talk about immigration, talking about building a wall or creating a religious litmus test for who can enter the country even if they have a Visa is just ridiculous. If I thought Republicans were more serious about immigration and not just trying to Pander to a racist base I would take them a little more seriously.

       There is no need for immigration. The people coming through are not contributing anything. They are just leeching or providing corporations to pay lower wages. Universal healthcare has already broken much of Europe now that 3rd worlders are allowed to wander in. You really need to check sources. What you are describing is Sweden. Open borders free healthcare, welfare for all, free education.

       You will never see European citizens demanding a repeal of universal health Care in favor of a free market system. That's because it works. They can't imagine going to an American style system. It sounds like a nightmare to them... Because it is! A lot of what you're saying here just sounds like some gloom and doom fear mongering you might read on Brietbart or Red State. Too much protectionism is just as bad as open borders. It's too reactionary.

       No. It does not work. What sounds like a nightmare to them are hordes of 3rd worlders with toxic ideologies manipulating the system and wasting their tax money.  Their health care system is now a failure long waits, people being turned away. You want free healthcare, ok, get rid of the welfare system and deport newcomers not contributing to the system. You sound like an insane person.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of what I am saying here is accurate. When your Country has no go zones and it is illegal to raise the flag because it may trigger some Islamic zombie, that is a complete fail and cultural marxism at it finest.

       You sound like an idiot who has never left the Country, their parents basement and went to a liberal high school. You are welcome to look around and see that everything I said is accurate. See for yourself. If the videos are not enough, trade in your GBPs for a plane ticket. If you make it back you will then understand.

I don't give a rat's ass what they think of our music, fashion, or other pop culture bs but I certainly don't want to be hated by and isolated from my fellow earthlings.  You can deny it all you want but someday America is going to need help from the outside world and I sincerely believe it's going to be sooner than we all think.

       I'm fine. I've been talking about this for years. People are starting to wake up to this. You will say: "I wished I believed you". Karma is a bitch. You partisan hack. You are a lower vibration being, who will be caught up in the Cosmic storm. I warned you. Money will not help you with what is coming... You've been warned..

       Yeah it's fine. I just know what it's like to be in a dark place mentally. I've been battling depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time now.

      <p>
       I know sometimes people just need a talk with people who are willing to listen. I've had some family members who have committed suicde the last few years, and just making sure it doesn't happen to another family I guess

       Only a month or two ago a video of our PM Malcolm Turnbull here in Australia was leaked of him impersonating Trump. He was saying stuff like he had the "best polls, ask anyone" because of his "Russian guy." So yeah, seeing that another world leader literally thinks of Trump as a joke I'll say this seems likely.

       Is he a weak leader or has the media portrayed him to be weak?  The media has had nothing but negative stories about Trump since day one, the media in other countries are rebroadcasting the same stories, so it is likely other countries view us as week with this happening world wide.  Trump has been fighting this story for 7 months already, the media is influencing the group think of the nation to think this Russian story might be true when no evidence exists.  It is hard to get anything done when your own party which is swayed by public opinion as well turns against you because of poll numbers that are a direct result of the media bull shit in the first place

       i didnt take any media stories specifically about trump into consideration.  maybe the media protrays him as weak while others dont, but i only used verifiable facts in my assumptions here.  also, im only theorizing here, im taking all these outcomes and consequences and attempting to draw a conclusion.  i could very VERY well be wrong in my assumption here.

       7 months of continuous stories saying something Negative about anyone will inevitably lead to an overall negative opinion.  In this case we are talking about the president but it could be true about anyone.  The major news outlets other than Fox run solely negative stories on Trump, so since these companies have sister outlets in other countries we can assume their message is the same.  This leads to an overall world wide negative opinion on Trump with people  not really able to back up their opinion.  This is how public opinion is formed, and this is why our government hasn't been able to do anything it is an unfortunate situation.

       So the media is to blame for pushing us around?   I dunno man.  In many of the instances I mentioned, out administration had a chance to retaliate or negotiate better and they didnt.  But I will admit it highly possible that the media gave them the courage to go through with it.

       They aren't pushing us around because we know better otherwise we wouldn't be posting ideas to the conspiracy subs but the vast majority they are pushing people to think a certain way.  Like Obamacare being great after Gruber openly said people are too stupid to understand it so it was made vague on purpose
      </p>
      <p>
       If a nation is united then it has more leverage In negotiations, but our government is anything but United, and the media will glorify all negative things world leaders say about our president.  The media is pushing the negative view because they want the world to be a more open place.  Less taxes and border tariffs makes it easier for the largest of companies to make money by outsourcing every piece of industry they can.  The TPP was a huge part of That and it is dead for now.  These deals only make the richest of the rich even more wealthier.  They consolidate control between themselves all under the guise that these deals help everyone involved when they never do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is trying to think of the American but with 7 months of negative stories the public opinion the media is creating has made it entirely impossible to do anything

       I think what you are seeing is fear of the unknown and not vision of weakness. No one ever likes someone who is changing politics by trying to do what they said they would do. Most politicians these days talk but don't act. If I was Putin,Macron,Turnbul (fuck he is a piece of shit) even Merkel, I would be afraid. Because soon their populations will expect them to actually do what they say rather than just say it. I think Trump is the beginning of that, despite not agreeing with some of the things he plans on doing. Yes I do support him (im not american) but I feel that we are now going through a period of change in politics that will likely render the majority of career politicians void.

       This is why I support Trump. I do not support his policies, or even think of him as a competent leader. But I support him being so unorthodox in the current system that it makes everyone re-evaluate our political system.

       Left blames Trump. 
Right blames Democrat obstruction. 
No one blames the system. 
When the bubble pops, only more divide et impera.

       Hillary in office would have been too revelatory about the nature of the system, given her long experience close to the heart of the beast. That's why Trump had to win... he's the perfect fall-guy for what was long a coming.

       This reminds me of a video I watched about North Korean defectors first visit to US as compared to their impressions are of what it was like. They said watching the news in South Korea where they defected to they thought America was dangerous with shootings and violence happening all the time, but they were surprised upon visiting US how peaceful it was and how friendly the people were. It was nothing like it was portrayed in other countries. Just because something is portrayed one way in media doesn't mean it's the truth.

       I think a lot of European and Scandinavian countries really want to attract young people and talented people into their countries plain and simple. I think the right makes too much out of it. There are problems, for instance I don't think Sharia enclaves should be allowed to form. I also think the left at the college level goes way too far with all their PC bullshit. I also think the left in general needs take it over there Illusions about Islam and realize that it is a very dangerous ideaology. While I see these as problems, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Ultimately I think the lack of Universal Health Care is what will break this country and is probably the Maine reason I support Bernie. Now if you want to talk about immigration, talking about building a wall or creating a religious litmus test for who can enter the country even if they have a Visa is just ridiculous. If I thought Republicans were more serious about immigration and not just trying to Pander to a racist base I would take them a little more seriously.
