       Hi,
The following is PURELY SPECULATION (which I honestly believe is plausible) but I am going to make the following Assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subreddit r/quittingkratom , which by its very naure and name, portrays Kratom as very a highly addictive &amp; abusable plant source of psychoactive alkaloids. Maybe even harmful. And trying to finally stop Kratom after the powdered leaves caused utter chaos in your life is extremely difficult, maybe deadly or dangerous, and a long withdrawl process in which the physical withdrawl is absolute hell, and there is a big mental withdrawl as well-anxiety, depression, mood swings, etc....on top of the flu like symptoms, inability to physically function, and extreme gastrointestinal issues. Plus much more that makes the Mitragyna Dragon beat you nearly to death ...so the solution was to create this Reddit support group, a bit like a online Narcotics Anonymous Fellowship or any online support group. (I am VERY pro Kratom and taken it regularily, mainly for lower back pain, so I know the effects well. I've tried almost 20 sources with multiple strains from each Vendor, always powdered leaf-no extracts. I put a lot of effort into doing everything I could to keep Kratom legal where I am &amp; Federally and I know it is potentially threatened now)
      </p>
      <p>
       I maintain that r/quittingkratom, while helpful to some who need encouragement and advice, was created as a clever way to DEMONIZE KRATOM and to HELP IT BECOME ILLEGAL for the benefit of the BigPharma Cartel and Government Agencies including but not limited to the FDA, DEA, HHS and CDC. And let's not forget BigRehab/ The Substance Abuse Treatment Business.
      </p>
      <p>
       . Look at how much Reddit can be manipulated, if you aren't already aware. To manipulate the reader's opinions or what they think they know. Or what they do NOT find out via distraction, and so on...That has been covered elsewhere pretty extensively with proof. Have fun with that Algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the very nature of the title "quittingkratom", anyone new to Kratom who is looking up what kind of psychoactive plant it really is, regardless of if they intend to use it, will definitely see the quittingkratom subreddit in search results, and even if they don't look at the posts on the site, it will give the reader an implicit belief that Kratom is intrinsically  a hard drug and a real bitch to kick. No matter who you are. Kratom...Not Even Once!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have detoxed from the REAL OPIIATES AND OPIOIDS before- more times than I can accurately say. I once took a Suboxone prematurely with a significant amount of oxycodone in me, after several years of daily use-PRECIPITATED ULTRA RAPID DETOX IS SUCH AN INTENSE DISGUSTING FEELING. I had to take over 200mg of methadone to begin to push the Buprenorphine out of my Mu Receptors and I wasted 100mg of oxy and hydro trying to simply feel "normal". I can't belive I didn't spontaneously vomit like a volcano. The worst detox ever for me was from benzos, and later a benzos and a combination of opiates/opioids at the same time. All at once, cold turkey. With nearly nothing to take deal with any of my symptoms. (SSRIs and Trazodone made it worse FYI).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in the most unpleasant undesirable places to be. Rehab. Residential Run-Down Government Funded 12 Step Rehab. With real Cons and Real Psychos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kratom Withdrawl is physically harmless, barring dehydration, and maybe scary but its a fear of something that never happens. Everyone is different, your milage may vary, but people who were worse opiate abusers than I was have laughed off the idea of Kratom detox. Other opiate ethusiasts have helped me conclude that Kratom detox isn't as bad as some make it out to be. Anticipatory anxiety was always the worst part when I've been running low on Kratom. False Evidence Appearing Real...
      </p>
      <p>
       Kratom is one such tool in the toolkit of stuff that would make a Heroin detox less uncomfortable. And it is legal in 44 U.S. States and not as expensive as say, Suboxone. Well, we can't have that! Think of the children! We can't have a harmless (ZERO TRUE OVERDOSES RESULTING IN DEATH FROM KRATOM) Legal plant at a Addict's disposal to kick a Oxy habit. They need SUBOXONE or the new implantabble 6 month buprenorphine. Or they need to be on the Liquid Handcuffs for LIFE.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't have a legal way to treat pain that doesn't benefit Drug Companies!
      </p>
      <p>
       See where I'm going with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a r/quitting for every addictive drug?  I haven't checked. Just interesting that  anyone looking for subreddits on Kratom will automatically find &amp; see a really anti-kratom forum(and they are all about quitting without anything as an aid, so I hear, even Agmatine-which is a potentially hidden treasure for junkies)
      </p>
      <p>
       Who created r/quittingkratom ? When? Are they online and active on reddit? I maintain that it wasn't someone quitting Kratom. I'm not familiar with Reddit inside out-It's a rabbit Hole and I try not to get sucked in to it. I would bet that it was a Representative of a Government Agency, or the Rehab/Recovery Business Industry/ or most likely a BigPharma entity that created r/quittingkratom.
      </p>
      <p>
       In no way am I marginalizing the discomfort of people who wanted to or were forced to quit Kratom altogether for good. In no way am I saying anyone is exaggerating anything they have posted by default (I can count on one hand the amount of times I've been on r/quittingkratom, as soon as I heard that they were about quitting everything completely, I knew I best not talk to people who post hardline stuff on reddit when they aren't writing their Moral Shortcomings down on a notebook. I don't get along with most of the bigmouth abstinent rehab converts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a whole Conspiracy Theory about rehabs and the data mining they do, but I'll go into that on a separate post. P.S. if you love 12 Step and it helped you: I'm okay with that. Just stay in your own lane. I don't shitpost on 12 Step Oriented Sites (anymore). Helping the "Newcomer" and shoving your God and your Program down my throat and up my ass like a Prison Rape is what I take issue with. I'm all too familiar with being forced to read the Big Book OR go back to jail. I picked the Big Book &amp; will forever see 12Step as Punishment. Nothong more,. Forcing spirituality or religion on anyone who can only get away from it by opting for Jail isn't spiritual and it flies in the face of being Ethical. If this upsets you, help stop Judges from mandating that people go to The Bill Wilson Summer Camps. Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quitting Kratom may be very unpleasant, but if you've detoxed from IV Heroin, or methadone, or Oxycodone, hydromorphone, or even hydrocodone, codeine, or tramadol-especially abruptly- you know that Kratom is no big deal in comparison. Apples &amp; oranges. Different League. Orders of Magnitude in difference. Is there a r/quittingphenibut? (I didn't check). This was very improvised, and I'm cleaning up my typos and grammar then getting off Reddit for a day. I welcome any criticism if it is based on something truthful.  I know that Kratom withdrawl is nothong compared to phenibut"s detox from long term daily use. Phenibut causes a rebound in PEA and that may be why it causes aspecial kind of paranoid psychosis. And Phenibut is totally legal, moreso than Kratom (but it isn't a coveted pain reliever).
      </p>
      <p>
       How about r/quittingtianeptine? I only dabble in Tianeptine on a LOW dose occasional use because I don't want a rebound of Glutamatergic Hyperactivity plus an opioid type of withdrawl which Suboxone doesn't even help with....Good God. That has to be bad-maybe worse than anything I've experienced. Any tiaptine withdrawl support groups out there?
      </p>
      <p>
       So where is the subreddit for that? Why is there such a predominant thread on quitting a relatively mild type of physical &amp; mental addiction? Kratom does only so much as far as "Escapism", unless you are trying to stay in bed all day and sleep nonstop.  Kratom might help with napping and falling asleep but if you are awake &amp; on kratom, you're still grounded on planet Earth. I understand the idea of no one making a quitting coke or quitting MDMA subreddit because of the legal liabilities
for talking about illegal drug use if your anonymity is blown, but go look at the illegal stuff people talk about online / that they do. And the whole SWIM crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone knows the origins of r/quittingkratom and can disprove my purely speculative theory-please do. I get that some people like to be Professional Victims and tell about the hard times they've been through, and people naturally like to be acknowledged.
I keep thinking of Randy in the Wheelchair in the "Bloody Mary" episode of South Park. Sorry to conflate topics. If you think about Conspiracies / "Conspiracy Theories" a lot like I do, you might like to connect dots between seemingly unrelated or irrelevant topics. 
I won't start on my A.K.A. Theories. But it would be cool if Susan Ash or Paul Pelosi just said: "Here's the deal, if we bribe the right Lobbyists with a Sufficient amount of Money, Kratom will Stay Legal for at least another year. Here's our goal." I like brutal honesty.
      </p>

       It's not true. That sub actually really helped me to get off of the Krizz. I was addicted for quite some time. Many of the people there seemed legit addicted. It was nice to be able to talk amongst other people trying to quit.

       Well, that's an interesting twist. Thanks for spicing up the comments. I've never heard of Conspiracy research cheering anyone up. Then again, I have a morbid sense of humor. I can handle going to rock/metal shows without getting high as a prerequisite. I would not recommend that to most people in early recovery. I'm glad you got through your dark night of the Soul. I seriously am. I've been there. The difference between the poison and the cure can simply be the dosage.

       Curious about the implantable 6 month Buprenorphine you mentioned. I have heard of a 6 month shot being pushed lately but it contained Nalaxone which is an opioid blocker and used to reverse opioid overdoses under the brand name Narcan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does nothing to get you high or addicted. It does the opposite which is preventing you from getting high at all.

       Vivitrol is not buprenorphine. Vivotrol is Naltrexone. I just saw a new disturbing vice article on it. The 6 month Buprenorphine is being  branded as "Probuphine." I onew about clinical trials for it a couple years ago. I took a picture of the sticker for it advertising it.

       Looks like he hasn't been very active in over a year but he talks about why he made the sub in r/kratom. Sounds like one of those guys predisposed to getting addicted. He could have made it with his intentions but
       <em>
        if so,
       </em>
       i wouldn't discount the idea of the sub being co-opted for anti-kratom propaganda purposes.

       I wouldn't be too surprised if the DEA or Big Pharm is involved, but I'd put my money on it just being a sub full of over-dramatic kids vying for attention on whom has it worse off.  They probably see how much support actual addicts receive on reddit and wanted in on that sweet, sweet validation.

       Kratom isn't very physically addictive at all.  Sure, if you take obscenely copious amounts of it daily you're going to become somewhat constipated, but that is the first thing to clear up once you stop (unless you've been consuming it by the kilogram daily, then that bowel obstructions going to be there regardless) so that can't be considered a withdrawal symptom.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst you'll experience in terms of physical withdrawal is potentially restless legs/difficulty falling asleep, post nasal drip, and a very, very mild body-flu like feeling.

       All acute symptoms as H but turned down in intensity.its the POST ACUTES with this fucking plant that kick my and everyone I knows ass sooner or later. The first time I quit after a year of daily 30g+ use of maengda I was useless for a month. Kinda like Molly comedown but dragged out over weeks and for really long time addicts, months. Many people lose clumps of hair too. I didn't have that but it thinned a lot. I mean really... Why would some random guy make all this up?? I don't give AF who thinks I'm with the gubment cause I'm too goddamn dumb to work for them. All I can say is have fun with kratom if you insist but Mark my works, you buy the ticket, you take the ride... The WHOLE ride

       I've found it's so much more about duration of use instead of quantity.  I used 1-3 oz a day for a few weeks and was I'll for three days. Used less than half that for a year and a half and was royally fucked up when I quit

       As a Kratom user, I agree and disagree with your post.
I do find it plausible that it could have been set up by powers that want it banned. However, I think it is far more likely that it was set up by people who abused it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kratom is safe, especially compared to other opiates. You can't overdose on it because Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are partial agonists which don't recruit beta arrestin. However, it can be abused, just like everything else. If you look at the stories there, people work themselves up to 20+ grams a day and never take breaks. So, people without any discipline or common sense. They are a very vocal minority, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad you mentioned agmatine, it is definitely a wonderful substance. I'd add in Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone to that as well. I dose 2x a day and have no issues skipping doses. If I need to skip a day, I just add in a low dose of DXM to eliminate whatever minor withdrawal symptoms (usually just feeling mildly tired, yawning, slightly higher baseline anxiety; nothing big).

       Thanks for reminding me of LDN. I need to look into it. An AA member was the first person to mention it to me, in 2009-he claimed it helped his eczema or something with his skin. I see why he was really taking it. I was like whaaaaaa....that's ingenious! But don't know Doctors that Rx it.  Memantine, at doses of 10mg twice daily after the week of getting used to it, can potentiate Kratom heavily. I mean HEAVILY. Might have a place in a Detox protocol. Some day. Agmatine needs a lot of Guinea Pigs to try &amp; spread the word so anecdotal reports become common. Maybe homeless Junkies. Seriously. It would be economically feasable.  Agmatine is certainly safe-I can't name any real bad side effect or drawback to it. My neuropathic pain has lessened considerably since I started taking it late last year but I have a few other variables too. I've tried 3 different suppliers of Agmatine and it is worth spending more to get the higher quality stuff that is shiny like sugar, for lack of a better comparison. I won't mention the brand names here.

       No problem. And I need to note that I meant
       <em>
        ultra
       </em>
       low dose naltrexone, ULDN, which is different than LDN, which is used as a standalone treatment for immune disorders and other things. I wouldn't recommend taking that much naltrexone while on Kratom. ULDN is dosed in the microgram level. Personally, I take 50 mcg along with my Kratom, and 500 mg agmatine 5 - 10 mins before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took memantine for a while, didn't see much benefit from it. I titrated up to 10 mg/day. I did notice slight potentiation, but nothing to write home about.

       Maybe I just happened to have exceptionally potent fresh strains at the same time I had Memantine available to me-again, multiple variables.  I'm still a novice to biopharmacology. I keep learning how much I don't know. What's your means of even measuring and dosing ULTRA LDN? I won't ask about sources but are you working with with it in a pure, unadulterated form? Volumetric dosing in a suspension?  I appreciate your emphasis on correct dosage and correct decimal placement.

       Yeah, volumetric dosing. Naltrexone HCL readily dissolves in water. I have 2 solutions: 25 mcg/mL, and 1 mg/mL. The first was when I was experimenting with the dose; I thought I would need no more than 25 mcg. Well seems I was wrong, so I made the second solution. Since there are ~20 drops/mL, that'd be ~50 mcg/mL. I take 1 drop with my dose.

       Haven't looked into flumazenil any, can't help you there. :)

       It wouldn't surprise me.  I was addicted to narcotics for about three years,  worse three years of my life.  My lofe revolved around getting my next script filled when i ran out,  thousands spent on urgent cares to get refills.  Until I found kratom and it brought me out of the abyss.  I was off narcotics in a week with no withdrawls whule taking kratom.  I still use it to manage pain.  I stop occasionally and the only W/D affect I have is lack of energy for a day or two.  I do understand that everyone is different, and kratom does have the potential for abuse and ssevere addiction for some,  but I feel like its great to use shortterm for most to get the off narcs.  Big pharma is scared they wil lose massive profits if kratom was more widespread known.

       Kratom has saved my life. I have a chronic pain condition, became dependent on my opioids, quit cold turkey and now use Kratom for bad pain days. I would probably have killed myself by now if I didn't have kratom to help me get through my pain.

       Kratom's no joke. I've been a hardcore opiate addict in the past, so I know what wd is. Kratom interacted dangerously with some other meds I was on and landed me in the hospital. It was no fun getting off of, and I know several ppl who struggled with it pretty severely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd still much rather kick kratom than heavy opiates but I think it's a legit struggle for many.

       I was heavy Kratom user for 3 years - nothing else, no alcohol, no other drugs at all. Once you start using daily, it becomes a dependency . That sub Reddit helped me quit. If you ask majority of people on that sub, they would be for Kratom to stay legal, and leave the chose to consumer of  what things to put in the body.

       I welcome your point of view. Glad it helped you somehow. (Rhetorical question That I will repeat: Where is "Qutitting methadone or quitting heroin, etc ad nauseum for every other drug with the ability to create an even tougher habit. No thread posts could help me quit benzos and opiates ABRUPTLY, AND AGAINST MY WILL, Because I couldn't see straight to read what the red signs with 8 sides, wait ten sides....I'm getting sick trying to read the sign PUUUUUUUKEEEE. Not to mention, I was forbidden from even listening to an AM/FM radio, let alone using a cellphone or the internet in 08....AA KNOWS BEST! I shouldn't be given a A rifle that takes a Slide Fire, because I'd care and share the AK Way...Cute support group, but I'm suggesting quitting coffee. Its not easy. Not at all. I need support!

       I think Kratom is perfect drug to get of heroin/opioids. No one is saying it's worse. But it has been abused. The dangers of Kratom are fairly mild as well - your life won't spiral out of control, although you might accelerate hairloss due to effects on your thyroid, + T levels. You will be lathergic and moody without your "fix". You won't steal or rob anyone and most likely the only effect others will see that you're high is bloodshot eyes similar to weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within a 1-3 years effects won't be felt, but rather Kratom will be needed to feel "normal".
      </p>
      <p>
       When quitting expect horrible RLS and no sleep for 3-5 days. Lethargy, heavy depression and crushing anxiety, watery eyes, sneezing, no motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't compare quitting kratom to quitting coffee.

       I've always had a pet peeve with comparing quitting Kratom to quitting coffee(The AKA knows this is not trueThank their P.R. Firm.... but.. I just went 4 days witout any green shit and I had no physical symptoms of a detox, just the psychological ones up in my head that would make me a crabby dick to people without realizing it. No I always have RLA if there actually is such a "diaease" as RLS....I say that as someone who has detoxed from opioids several times SUDDENLY and COMPLETELY in the shittiest environment possible, aside frm being homeless the whole time(I was for part of that ordeal)...maybe if I waited a few more days I'd be 
Lacrimating all over this crappy tablet. My sleep qualitalways sucks. I need 3 or 4 sentenses to eplain that but My screen name offers me no protection from what Reddit and Twitter do, datamining my life and psychological profile and running numbers on what I am goimng to type next. Dtop raping my Penguinz! Get off of my lawn!

       Conspiracy is a word that implies 2 or more people plotting something malevolent. Collusion. I did this half baked post, which dose pose serious inquiries I have had, ALL BY MY LONESOME SELF. NO ONE I know personally really evemn cared that I had made it. I put my DISCLAIMER RIGHT UP TOP AT THE BEGINNING. Go re-read the top sentences of the original post. I stopped cold turkey-unplanned, last week, and I had 4 days withoutany kratom dust or anything. I had NODETOX. AS IN NO Physical Withdrawl,which would be OBVIOUS FOR A daily year-long heavy user of any opioid. I've been thru that. I had no kratom to bail me out forthatshit. No suboxone either.

       KratomUnlocked definitely isn't a sub made by big pharma. There isn't much conspiracy here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what happened is that some people on the kratom subreddit read that kratom was non addictive, that the withdrawal lasted a day and was like a minor cold at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then many of these people took kratom for long periods of time at high doses, like 15g+. When they quit, it was absolute hell, there are many stories of this. The withdrawal seems to really fuck people up when they take a high dose daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the reason that subreddit was created is because these same people reported their experience on the kratom subreddit, and their posts were sometimes banned or downvoted to oblivion. So they made a subreddit with a more real perspective on kratom. Similar to the trees subreddit vs leaves, people on trees say weed is completely harmless and good for you, people on leaves say weed ruined their life and that withdrawals are hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kratom subreddit is weird. They will not allow criticism of kratom. Sometimes they will straight up delete posts or comments. For instance, someone asked whether kratom has heavy metals or pesticides... The moderator, Hymander, said it didn't matter, because everything has heavy metals/pesticides in it (which is a bullshit way of thinking).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what's happened to the kratom subculture, is that when the ban was announced last year, everybody became extremely scared and tried their best to defend kratom. They put in a LOT of effort trying to make sure kratom wasn't made illegal. Everyone did. They liked it and they didn't want to part ways with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the ban was cancelled, that attitude hasn't really left. ANY criticism of kratom is now perceived to be a full on attack. If you criticize whether it's addictive, whether it messes with the liver, whether it's contaminated with poisons, etc, they will ignore it or make excuses for it. Just pay attention to their responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have criticisms of kratom but certainly don't want it to become illegal. QuittingKratom and the people on it don't want it to become illegal either.

       I am a long time kratom user. Going on 10 years. I was an advocate for it.. I do think its better than pills for sure. My blood work was always great. Until about the 8 year mark things started changing. Ive never been on anti depressants but I feel like I am now. Meaning, I cant feel my emotions anymore. Good or bad. Kratom did its job and worked wonders in the beginning. Now I want to stop and it is not easy by any means!! Its just another addiction.

       I typically take high doses of GOOD kratom every day....I'm in pain: Neuropathic and more but Sciatica was worse than I could have imagined based on another person describing it. I have taken Kratom EVERY DAY For the last 365 days, until a week ago-I ran out earlier than calculated. I stopped ABRUPTLY "Cold Turkey" until the mail finally arrived. 4,full days to begin feeling "dopesck"...GUESS WHAT? NO PHYSICAL DeTOX AT ALL WHATSOEVER. Yes, as with Anything that has a mood changing or mond altering effect, you'll have some psychological symptoms if you've always taken it. If you took it nonstop for 8 years I already know you're hooked on the rirual of taking it even if its crap but you still have your particular daily osing riual. Just like coffee, cigs, and ALL PSYCH MEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no longer conspiracy theory: that a "Truth about Kratom Fakebook Page or Group is now up and running. Its all negative and anti-Kratom, right in the wake of a VERY FUCKING SUSPICIOUS TOXICOLOGY FINDING for the cop that overdosed on Mitragynine.....This could be a coffin nail....and the A.K.A was possibly embezzling cash under Susan Ash (or she knows nothing about accounting or both)...that's not good.... So my wa ky nutty speculative concpiracy thforyhappens to have kernels of validity because the legality war is far from over.

       Hey man, I feel your pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not yet met a kratom user who ever had physical withdrawals when they were treating an actual debilitating condition to reach a point where their condition was tolerable.  Psychological withdrawals yes, and that can be bad depending on dose and length of use, but a solid taper plan can set you free easily, when followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I HAVE read countless stories of quitting kratom "sufferers" with horrible quits who used kratom for
       <em>
        total
       </em>
       relief.  Also those treating mental problems like depression and anxiety, non-physical problems, they have horrible awful quits too.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't surprise me at all.  Depression did in fact used to be treated with opiates, back before we knew that shit that makes you feel good doesn't necessarily fix anything.  I'm confident the same applies to kratom.  Sure it makes you feel the opposite of depressed, but it's not fixing anything.  Colloquial use of the word "anti-depressant" is going to fuck up access to kratom faster than all the quitting communities around, sadly.  Same with "anti-anxiety."  It's not really an anxiolytic either, just feels like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great for pain conditions when used moderately and only to reduce symptoms, not for total relief, and also great for other physical conditions that result in pain, like muscle disorders.  ...in moderation, always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never surprises me when recreational users suffer withdrawals, they weren't treating anything but boredom.  What's the saying about boredom, only boring people get bored?

       You do point out something that is conflated with a phtsical withdrawl symptom: the return of an existing disorder that Kratom was taking care of (example joint pain, back pain, anxiety/depression, lethargy-in cases where this was chronic prior to kratom for whatever reason. I have plenty of gabapentin, I take it only as an occasional sleep aid or adjunk s8nce in pairs well with true opioids for pain relief, however I try bot to take it-even if it didn't shave off IQ points and cause utter loss of energy-bwcause I want it to be a substitute for the shitty day when I can't get Kratom ansd have to go without. My fear that Kratom detox would compare to antuy opioid detox is an almost subliminal association that makeas me anxious about running out. Even though I finally c9nfirmed that in my case at least-I can live without it, and It is not like cagfeine withdrawl. I hate that because the standard AKA description ofKratom's addiction potential is that of caffeine in coffee. Well, no for many reasons, including one's subjective response to caffeine. Kratom is so complex and it even depends on which vendor and which strains I'd bwe runninng out of that wouldworry me more. I step down from a quality vendor-consistent great qualirty-like Lifeforce-for a cheaper and weaker and less predictable one like "Canopy" or "Legit"(they are less expensive for a reason, but at least they aren't head ahop pencil shavings or whatever that milled hay was I bought on a whim a year ago. LFK /LIFEFORCE is the best that I know of FOR THE PRICE, And they got a big selection. I'm bot shilling and I leave that to others who benefit from it. The best I havwe ever had was Carpo's-which is the same product as HerbResearch. But those prices are too high. I learned enough from Carpo to shoew my gratitude, still have a freebie from 2015, another thing I may never touch of his, but I told him he sells THE BLUE KRATOM. He was happy to hear that I used that discription. If I had the money still, he'd still get some occasional business. I tried at least 15 vendors. I dont know who the QZ Guy is that they vuy from but they are sourcing from a great source. I have spoken off-record wolith Mike and Dana a little bit-they're good people. Not mysterious faceless vendors mention vendors who  selll phenibut and Tianeptine because those are legal highs that money can be  made off of regardless of safety of these products. LFK is also safe based on the amount and variety I have taken from them. If they were full of contaminants, I'd know by now. Mood And Mind was the only stronger vendor, also expensive as hell, but I don't think they still sell. (if reddit is to.be believed) I also wanna rant that the cemdors listed on Reddit are such a TINY fraction. Go look up.Canopy and people raving about Red Hulu Kapuas. These people are shilling or never tried better stuff. It is a strain I'd never even buy again in spite of liking some Canopy items a little. I see gow that vendor sells so cheaply (by pretending not to be a vendor-ok it is pragmatic, and it allows me to stock up if my State is the Next Rhode Island/Next Alabama. So I shouldn't complain, but I wanna share these little pet peeves about Kratom and Reddit because I see no one echoing what I notice (Vendor list for Oct XX IS guaranteed to be DELIBERATELY Excluding vendors. You know what? I am a shill LifeForce is garbage. Overhyped due to social media. I hate when they sell out so yeah they SUCK. Soviet censorship is GOOD. Maybe some vendkrs dont want or need the attention cuz the wronfg people come to Reddit to see what's up with obtaining controversial legal substances. I dunno
But as for why a Vendor Like Carpo is not listed(he does the favor of reselling a vendor's product who isn't taking new customers. This alone is special) And he says its the best he has tried and I believe the Hippie cuz I have an almost identical condition as him. It hurts! Type "carpo719 sciatica" into youtube to listen to him screaming if not crying. I've been there.  Ok I went on a huge tangent but the devoted readers will get my personal experience, in part. If I made a subreddit on this stuff, I'd be called names like Affiliate, Shill,Biased, Etc. Plus I'm testing my ability to write while I have the motivation to write. Two different things that I struggle with. For the record there are plenty of vendors I still have not tried. And may never, because I hate gambling with quality. Impartial reviews are few and far between, and hard to distinguish from the shilly ones. Back to my original point: R/quittingkratom is pure B.S. if one leaves the psychological component of dependence out, and yes psychologocal dependence is a powerful drive. It keeps people persuing lots of non-drug things daily. The r/quittingkratom subreddit is sook bad that they went after someone just for suggesting the potential of Agmatine Sulfate. In quitting kratom. Sounds like hardline N.A Steppers to me. If they all smoke cigarettes daily, there's your answer. Flr the record I'm totally unaware of what was discussed above your response. I can't recall offhand. Ok this concludes the written portion of my exam.One dafrt, typos uncorrected. Thanks for chiming in.
