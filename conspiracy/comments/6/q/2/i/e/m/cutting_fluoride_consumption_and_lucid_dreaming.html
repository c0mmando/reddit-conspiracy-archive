    <div class="md"><p>Increased occurrence of dreams for sure, at least since around early April.  Increased occurrence of lucidity while dreaming isn&#39;t really there though.  Had a super vivid dream this week in an Assyria that looked like NE US woodlands where I realized I was dreaming but woke up seconds later.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no pro at lucid dreaming by any means btw.  I&#39;ve had a few and many close calls, but it&#39;s hard as shit to stay in the dream once you realize you&#39;re dreaming...</p>

<p>I can legit make myself open my eyes once I realize I&#39;m dreaming. And once there open I&#39;m awake.</p>

<p>In the real world if I see a video game character plummeting towards the ground at high speeds I get that feeling in my gut where you pass the peak of the hill on a roller-coaster. But the feeling is greater, choking.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Been using reverse osmosis filter for awhile, and it doesn&#39;t seem to affect.</p>

<p>Something that very significantly affects it, though, are nicotine levels, and sugar.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve quit smoking a few times over the years.  Whenever I smoke heavily, I can&#39;t remember shit for dreams.  But when I&#39;m withdrawing, the dreams get very vivid.  If I&#39;m quitting, then put on a patch before sleep, then they <em>really</em> kick into overdrive.  Hands down most vivd dreams I&#39;ve ever had.  I&#39;ve never been fully lucid, but sorta half aware.  I could manipulate some stuff, but not really in full control.  In one, I could rewind time to a point, but still couldn&#39;t overcome the fate that kept happening anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also experimented with sugar binges right before sleep.  Not as a habit, of course :). It works sometimes, but not as reliable as nicotine patches.</p>

<p>Not sure if it&#39;s anything you cared about, but it seemed related.  And since I&#39;m not sleeping well these days... well, there you go.</p>

<p>I often have very bizarre and vivid dreams. A few weeks back I had a full inceptionesque dream within a dream within a dream. The final part of the dream was waking up and telling my gf about the dream within a dream only to wake up and realise that was also a dream.</p>

<p>I nearly always have train stations in my dreams too and have NO idea why (I always catch the train I&#39;m aiming for as well)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I completely cut out fluoride and only eat organic food, which has helped a lot with lucid dreams and vivid dreams. But I also keep a dream journal which helps me as well. If you write down your dreams you will start to remember every single dream you have, which then makes you more likely to become aware while dreaming </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wouldn&#39;t count as a lucid dream, or maybe it would but years ago when  I was about 16/17 my mates where inhaling butane gas to get high. So as dumb I was I tried it but something very strange happened. It was like I was seeing the future. I stood in front of my mate who was sober. We were huge martial art fans and we always pretended to punch each other or kick and see if we could block it. He started throwing punches in quick succession but I my mind I knew what was going to happen before it did and I blocked every single one of them. I was an experience I&#39;ve never forgotten. I&#39;ve asked him numerous times if it was real or did I imagine it but he said it did happen and he was trying his best to hit me but couldn&#39;t. After the recent CIA remote viewing documents I&#39;m starting to think this is what happened. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had times were I&#39;m laying sleeping in my room but I can see the entire room clear as day in my mind. I see everything in perfect detail. It honestly like my eyes are open. It hasn&#39;t happened in a few months.</p>
