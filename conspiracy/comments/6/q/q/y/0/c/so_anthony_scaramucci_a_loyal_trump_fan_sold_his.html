       for starters, AS actually was at one point critical of Trump...AS is nothing but a roach looking for his next crumb...written allover the guys face...plus the whole "off the record" moment with the journalist was a termination worthy moment. My dad who is a Trump supporter was disgusted by his behavior...so to be fair, good riddance to AS...Why are you so upset?

       what are you even getting at? seriously. Are you anti-Trump shill or what? AS once called Trump a "hack"...The guy is an opportunist..don't confuse that with "loyalty"...AS deserved to be fired...what do you not get about that? The guy stuck his foot in his mouth and was a train wreck from the beginning.

       He sold his company, divorced his wife, abandoned his newborn baby, all for Trump, and Trump threw him out like a sack of dog shit.

       That is how Trump treats Loyal supporters. He would treat you the same way. You are too brainwashed to realize it. Stop drinking all the MAGA Cock Cream. You cant think straight anymore.

       I am sorry but are you a bot? Can someone report this account as a bot account? You keep repeating yourself while ignoring the points we are making that he deserved to be fired...AS stuck his foot in his mouth. What do you not get about that? For starters I could give one shit about Trump...glad he won...and I hope to see some conservatives agenda pushed...but I have no loyalty to Trump.

       Trump knew he was a nutcase. Why did he put him in the position in the first place? It is because nobody that is capable wants the job, and Scaramuche somehow convinced Trump that he could do the job. How come the MSM doesn't attack the seven Jews in Trump's administration that worked for Goldman Sachs? How come they get a "free-pass", while the press crucifies the Gentiles in Trump's administration? This is an intelligent question that demands an answer.

       welp. we got ourselves a bitter anti-trumper here...how original. Regardless if he dodged Vietnam (everyone was dodging that f'ing war including my father who is a bad ass/patriot) he was raised in a military environment...it's what he relates to...that's the point I was making.

       Trump told Kelly to fire him.

      <p>
       Scaramucci was hired last week. Kelly came in today. He cannot fire people without getting Trumps permission, otherwise why doesnt Kelly fire Ivanka Trump for NEPOTISM? She does not belong there at all. Why doesnt Kelly fire her? Oh wait, Trump is only Loyal to his Family, not to his loyal supporters. He uses them up and spits them out like garbage, just like he did to Scaramucci. Now Scaramucci is jobless and homeless and his marriage is screwed, all thanks to Trump.

       Do you seriously believe Mooch is financially screwed over this?  If so, that's hilarious. I think he played a role in whatever the fuck is going on and has probably been paid rather well to do so. Not to mention he was wealthy beforehand anyway.

       WH Anon called this last week... said his hiring was a planted situation and that he would resign/be removed shortly after his appointment, so this is not completely out of left field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the game plan was to stoke a big fire, find the leakers, and then get Scaramucci out before the media/deep state could mount a counter-attack. Now the new WH com director knows who to remove, and the media/DS dont' have anybody to attack anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the guy didn't get the shit beat out of him in terms of life experience, but we don't know what the real game that is being played right now is. Also, the guy did enough with his leaks and language to be removed as it is. He was a loose cannon (i believe on purpose too). Now he gets a nice compensation package and he can try to win his family back (assuming the divorce was completely organic and not forced by threats or dangers)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, for any of us to suppose that we know what is happening behind the curtains is foolish. We don't know who knows what or who agreed to what. We dont' know if this was all planned or if this is happening on the fly. We only look like ignorant fools by trying to pretend we have all this stuff figured out.... gotta keep an open mind towards all the different ends.
