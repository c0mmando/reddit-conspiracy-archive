<p>He sold his company, divorced his wife, abandoned his newborn baby, all for Trump, and Trump threw him out like a sack of dog shit.</p>

<p>That is how Trump treats Loyal supporters. He would treat you the same way. You are too brainwashed to realize it. Stop drinking all the MAGA Cock Cream. You cant think straight anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump knew he was a nutcase. Why did he put him in the position in the first place? It is because nobody that is capable wants the job, and Scaramuche somehow convinced Trump that he could do the job. How come the MSM doesn&#39;t attack the seven Jews in Trump&#39;s administration that worked for Goldman Sachs? How come they get a &quot;free-pass&quot;, while the press crucifies the Gentiles in Trump&#39;s administration? This is an intelligent question that demands an answer.</p>

He uses them up and spits them out like garbage, just like he did to Scaramucci. Now Scaramucci is jobless and homeless and his marriage is screwed, all thanks to Trump.</p>

<p>Seems like the game plan was to stoke a big fire, find the leakers, and then get Scaramucci out before the media/deep state could mount a counter-attack. Now the new WH com director knows who to remove, and the media/DS dont&#39; have anybody to attack anymore. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the guy didn&#39;t get the shit beat out of him in terms of life experience, but we don&#39;t know what the real game that is being played right now is. Also, the guy did enough with his leaks and language to be removed as it is. He was a loose cannon (i believe on purpose too). Now he gets a nice compensation package and he can try to win his family back (assuming the divorce was completely organic and not forced by threats or dangers)...</p>

<p>Basically, for any of us to suppose that we know what is happening behind the curtains is foolish. We don&#39;t know who knows what or who agreed to what. We dont&#39; know if this was all planned or if this is happening on the fly. We only look like ignorant fools by trying to pretend we have all this stuff figured out.... gotta keep an open mind towards all the different ends.</p>
