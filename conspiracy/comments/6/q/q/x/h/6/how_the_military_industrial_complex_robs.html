        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">126</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-07-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I did 3 years in the Army and saw this first hand. At first, I thought the scam only involved the retailers but now I realize that the US Army was in on the scam. The people getting robbed are the US taxpayers. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The military has a &quot;lowest bid&quot; policy meaning whenever they need something (IE grenades), they throw the bid out there and whoever bids the lowest wins the contract. </p></li>
<li><p>The military retailers basically split up the many different products so that one company handles certain items, another company handles other items, ect.. This way, they aren&#39;t really competing with each other. </p></li>
<li><p>When the military retailers make a bid, they bid very, very high to maximize profits. The profits are so insanely high that it was clear to everyone that a scam was being pulled in the military. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sample items:</p>

<p>A piece of steel that is a mechanism to unscrew something in the breech was $330. This mechanism looked like it should cost $13. </p>

<p>A piece of rubber (3 inches x 3 inches) that fits in between 2 metal pieces costs $400 when it should cost about $20.</p>

<p>A gas mask costs about $1200 when it should cost about $180. </p>

<p>A &quot;laser tag&quot; style system on tanks cost $95,000 per tank. These mechanisms should cost no more than $3600. </p>

<p>Tank computers cost $150,000 each. Each M1A2 tank uses about 5 computers that always melt down in the heat so each tank has about 2 replaced per month. That&#39;s $300,000 per tank, per month. </p>

<p>There are an endless amount of items in the military and each one is overpriced like this... This is one major reason why our military is so expensive to run. The expenses are killing us but they pretend that these expenses are necessary by creating fake wars. </p>

<p>This is how they basically rob the tax payers blind using the military industrial complex. They charge way over what they should be charging. They decided to keep an endless war going so that they can keep charging and charging and charging until the US falls apart financially. </p>

<p>This is an insanely profitable venture and its a perfect example of misery for profit. These soldiers are fooled into thinking they are protecting the country when in reality, the rulers decide to go to war to make sick profits. </p>

<p>Also, the military uses soldiers to run most service jobs. Why don&#39;t they use soldiers to build their own weapons? Soldiers are very cheap considering the amount of work they put out. Why is there profit in war? The government should be producing its own weapons and gear instead of hiring private companies to build them. The private companies are essentially like the Federal Reserve in that they are not needed but they are used to make a handful of people a whole lot of money on behalf of the 99% who pay taxes. The whole thing is a scam to transfer money from the masses and consolidate it in the hands of the few which guarantees a slow death for the entire country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it seems like a joke, but when it&#39;s an aircraft toilet (so it&#39;s not just something you get from home depot) and is manufactured on an as needed basis due to low demand, 700 bucks for a toilet seat is actually understandable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it is not understandable. injection moulding like 20 cents worth of plastic is not a $700 job.</p>

<p>If you were arguing about the cost of the jet engines or something I might even give it to you, but there is no way an aircraft needs a special toilet seat. Unless you can explain why peoples butts are a different shape in the air? Does it go under much more stress than normal toilet seats? </p>

<p><a href="http://dnipogo.org/labyrinth/">http://dnipogo.org/labyrinth/</a></p>

<p>The Pentagon Labyrinth: Ten Short Essays to Help You Through It aims to help both newcomers and seasoned observers learn how to grapple with the problems of national defense.  Intended for readers who are frustrated with the superficial nature of the debate on national security, this handbook takes advantage of the insights of ten unique professionals, each with decades of experience in the armed services, the Pentagon bureaucracy, Congress, the intelligence community, military history, journalism and other disciplines.  The short but provocative essays will help you to:</p>

<pre><code>identify the decay – moral, mental and physical – in America’s defenses,
understand the various “tribes” that run bureaucratic life in the Pentagon,
appreciate what too many defense journalists are not doing, but should,
conduct first rate national security oversight instead of second rate theater,
separate careerists from ethical professionals in senior military and civilian ranks,
learn to critique strategies, distinguishing the useful from the agenda-driven,
recognize the pervasive influence of money in defense decision-making,
unravel the budget games the Pentagon and Congress love to play,
understand how to sort good weapons from bad – and avoid high cost failures, and
reform the failed defense procurement system without changing a single law.
</code></pre>

<p>The handbook ends with lists of contacts, readings and Web sites carefully selected to facilitate further understanding of the above, and more.</p>
