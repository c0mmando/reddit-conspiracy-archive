       The Blumenthal family are a German Nobility located in Brandenburg-Prussia which has been under the districts of the House of Hohenzollern. More modern members of the Blumenthal family included Nazis, an MI6 agent and businessmen in the UK. Ike Bloom was a Jewish mobster from Chicago and associate of Jim Colosimo the founder of the Chicago Outfit and this is stated in an old Chicago newspaper. Ike Bloom turned a German bar into a nightclub and was involved with bootlegging and prostitution. Kid Cann who was born as Isadore Blumenfeld and was a Jewish gangster and associate of Mayer Lansky and worked with the Chicago Mob and Genovese Crime family. Michael Bloomberg was former mayor of New York City and he is billionaire worth over 49 billion that ran New York and enabled corruption just like Rudy Giuliani. Michael Bloomberg is basically the hidden head of the German princely House of Blumenthal. Richard Blumenthal is a US Senator in Connecticut and another member of the German princely Blumenthal family and an enabler of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italian and Jewish mafia have infiltrated the government of New York City and they prop up political front men who protect them like Bloomberg and Giuliani. The Five Families are not so much families as they are business enterprises owned by the Italian Nobility which can be replaced and reorganized. Murder Inc. reorganized themselves and went into politics and business and they enable the still existing Italian Mafia. The politician Debbi Schultz married Steven Schultz and she resigned from the DNC for political corruption. Dutch Schultz was a Jewish gangster from New York. Erwin Schulz was a German Nazi SS member and the name Schultz means a mayor or leader. The royal and noble families have infiltrated the US government and use federal agencies to go after their rival's mafia or clean out their own criminal organizations when they get too out of control. Many associates of the mafia are never named or identified either. There are layers to the mafia. The lower levels that get their hands dirty are the types that get the attention and labeled as gangsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Austrian Nobility are in league with the Italian Nobility and the Austrians run a lot of the Jewish Mafia factions which work with the Italian Mafia. The Schonburg Nobility was controlling Alex Birns who was a top Jewish Mafia boss that worked with the Italian Cleveland Crime Family or Licavoli Crime Family.  Alex Birns took the nickname "Shondor" Birns to honor the Schonburg family which he was serving. Current members of the Schonburg criminal nobility include Prince Rudolf von Schoenburg-Glauchau, Count Alexander von Schonburg-Glauchau, Count Carl Alban Graf von Schonburg-Glauchau and Prince Alexander von Schonburg-Hartenstein. The word Shon has a Romanian meaning of moon. Many Eastern Holy Roman nobilities used the crescent moon on their coat of arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wiccans worship the moon and the Jewish and Italian mafias practice various forms of witchcraft including advanced deception, chemical poisoning, illusions, distractions as a defense for their criminality. Satanic witches make sacrifices during the moon phases and many female associates of crime families are satanic witches. Many families in the Polish Nobility have crescent moons on their coat of arms and the Eastern European mafias like the Russian Mob are ancestors of these former clans and noble families. Meyer Suchowlansk was renamed Lansky from the region of Belarus and he was another top Jewish gangster in the United States. Monk Eastman was also a well known Jewish gangster. The German word for east is ost. The Clan Ostoja were Hungarian-Polish Nobility that used the crescent moon on their coat of arms. Most of these Jewish gangsters are not even ancestors of Judah or Israel. Many criminals overtly use religion as their shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rosenberg family are a Jewish Bohemian nobility that merged a branch with the Orsini family of Rome creating the Orsini-Rosenberg family of Austria. Zeev Rosenstein is a top Israeli Mafia boss and serves these families. Zeev Rosenstein was arrested for distribution of ecstasy and caught with 700,000 tablets. Rosenstein was supplying ecstasy to the Gambino Crime family. Frank Rosenthal was a Jewish gangster also serving the Rosenberg family and he was involved with casinos and fixing sporting events. He was an associate of the Chicago Mafia and the movie Casino was based on him. Harry Stromberg was a Jewish gangster who changed his name to Harry Rosen to honor the Rosenberg family and he worked with Arnold Rothstein. Arnold Rothstein who is considered a founder of the Jewish Mafia was also serving the Orsini and Rosenberg families.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Orsini family once ruled in L'Aquila and built the Rocca Orsini. The name Rothstein originates in Rottweil Germany and this city was in contract with L'Aquila Italy. Many Jews moved to L'Aquila from Rottweil. Stein and Rocca both mean rock. Name associations and connections occur both naturally and artificially and this is used for establishing their orders, ties, and revealing who they serve to those that are part of the larger criminal network. Scott W. Rothstein was involved with a 1.2 billion Ponzi scheme a few years back and he became an informant which lead to the arrest of Gambino associate Roberto Settineri. Scott Rothstein also had deep ties with Morocco where the Abergil crime family are dominant. Members of the Orsini and Rosenberg criminal nobilities include Prince Domenico Napoleone Orsini, Prince Alois Konstantin zu Loewenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, Prince Dominik of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg and others.

       The German and Austrian nobility have large amounts of concealed wealth in private Swiss bank accounts. The Habsburg, Rothschild, and Austria-Este families are all involved in banking. Many of the Eastern Holy Roman nobility are involved in politics and government as well as corporations. The Zionists are court factors serving their royal courts. The German and Austrian nobility helped to put the Nazis into power and in many cases were Nazis themselves. These same families used Jewish court factors to handle their finances. Benjamin de Rothschild is an Austrian Baron living in Switzerland working as a banker and his family were involved in purchasing land in Palestine and were prominent Zionists. The Rothschild family come from the region the House of Hesse ruled. The Swiss Rothschild bank uses the Hesse lion for its logo today.

       The Schwarzenberg family is an Austrian and Bohemian nobility serving the House of Habsburg and they are involved with military, politics, and the Roman Catholic Church. On their coat of arms there is a raven pecking at a decapitated head. Prince Karel Schwarzenberg is the current head of this family and is a member of the Czech parliament and knight of the Habsburg's Order of the Golden Fleece. Prince Karel supports the idea that denying communist crimes is a criminal offense. That itself sounds a lot like fascism and communism. In fact it was in Austria where families like the Schwarzenberg's ruled over where the Nazis originated. Adolf Hitler was an Austrian. Gustave Schwarzenegger was an Austrian Nazi and the father of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an unofficial relative of the Schwarzenberg family and that is why he has been allowed to become a famous and wealthy actor and politician. The Nazis SS used the Skull and Bones symbol. Arnold Schwarzenegger can be seen on the cover up Time Magazine wearing a Skull and Bones belt buckle. Stephen Schwarzman is an American investor worth over 10 billion, is CEO and co-founder of Blackstone Group and a member of Yale's Skull and Bones secret society. Stephen Schwarzman is also the head of Donald Trump's economic advisory council.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros whose original last name was Schwartz is worth over 25 billion and he is from Budapest Hungary where the Habsburg and Schwarzenberg families governed. George Soros founded the Open Society Institute which is involved in funding radical political groups as a means to destabilize societies while pretending to represent civil liberties. Dieter Schwarz is a German billionaire worth over 20 billion and runs a retail monopoly called Schwarz Gruppe. Bernard Schwartz is a billionaire financier who was CEO of Loral Space &amp; Communications which merged with Orion Network Systems which was ran by Kevin Patrick Power and he was married to Karen Akers the daughter of Prince Heinnick Orth-Pallavicini of the noble Austrian House of Pallavicini. Loral Skynet was a subsidiary of Loral Space &amp; Communications. Skynet is also the name of an artificial intelligence that takes over the world in the movie Terminator which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. George Soros (Schwartz) Dieter Schwarz, Bernard Schwartz and Stephen Schwarzman are all Court Factors handling the finances and interests for the House of Schwarzenberg. Arnold Schwarzenegger is really a Prince of the Schwarzenberg family and the Duke of California. The Schwarzenberg family serves the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg as Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Habsburg family serve the Black Nobility of Italy as Knights of the Order of Malta.

       I want to emphasize that the Austrian and German nobility are secondary to the top families of the Black Nobility of Italy. They are propped up like the rooftop of Rome's empire. They are second in command.

       I'm interested in how you came to all these findings. You must have read a shit ton of history but also got some of this information from not so mainstream sources. Care to explain how you came to some of these conclusions? (Not asking for sources, but an explanation in your own words). Thanks OP!

       Question is answered in the post although your question is mostly false itself. The Jewish Mafia do not exist anymore and evolved into politics and business and more white collar crime that assists the Italian Mafia. The news media do not popularize the Italian Mafia. Hollywood glorifies the Italian Mafia and when in context include the Jewish Mafia. For instance in the movie Casino Sam Rothstein is a Jewish gangster running a casino and enabling associates of the Chicago faction to launder money through.

       A "block of text" and "wall of text" are the non stop responses these "people" have towards my information every time.

       The term shill derives from the former and recent Austrian currency called the schilling. The German and Austrian nobility have large amounts of wealth or control over billionaires and pay people to defend them or promote their agendas. That is why they are called shills.

       The Schwarzenberg family is an Austrian and Bohemian nobility serving the House of Habsburg and they are involved with military, politics, and the Roman Catholic Church. On their coat of arms there is a raven pecking at a decapitated head. Prince Karel Schwarzenberg is the current head of this family and is a member of the Czech parliament and knight of the Habsburg's Order of the Golden Fleece. Prince Karel supports the idea that denying communist crimes is a criminal offense. That itself sounds a lot like fascism and communism. In fact it was in Austria where families like the Schwarzenberg's ruled over where the Nazis originated. Adolf Hitler was an Austrian. Gustave Schwarzenegger was an Austrian Nazi and the father of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an unofficial relative of the Schwarzenberg family and that is why he has been allowed to become a famous and wealthy actor and politician. The Nazis SS used the Skull and Bones symbol. Arnold Schwarzenegger can be seen on the cover up Time Magazine wearing a Skull and Bones belt buckle. Stephen Schwarzman is an American investor worth over 10 billion, is CEO and co-founder of Blackstone Group and a member of Yale's Skull and Bones secret society. Stephen Schwarzman is also the head of Donald Trump's economic advisory council.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros whose original last name was Schwartz is worth over 25 billion and he is from Budapest Hungary where the Habsburg and Schwarzenberg families governed. George Soros founded the Open Society Institute which is involved in funding radical political groups as a means to destabilize societies while pretending to represent civil liberties. Dieter Schwarz is a German billionaire worth over 20 billion and runs a retail monopoly called Schwarz Gruppe. Bernard Schwartz is a billionaire financier who was CEO of Loral Space &amp; Communications which merged with Orion Network Systems which was ran by Kevin Patrick Power and he was married to Karen Akers the daughter of Prince Heinnick Orth-Pallavicini of the noble Austrian House of Pallavicini. Loral Skynet was a subsidiary of Loral Space &amp; Communications. Skynet is also the name of an artificial intelligence that takes over the world in the movie Terminator which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. George Soros (Schwartz) Dieter Schwarz, Bernard Schwartz and Stephen Schwarzman are all Court Factors handling the finances and interests for the House of Schwarzenberg. Arnold Schwarzenegger is really a Prince of the Schwarzenberg family and the Duke of California. The Schwarzenberg family serves the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg as Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Habsburg family serve the Black Nobility of Italy as Knights of the Order of Malta.
