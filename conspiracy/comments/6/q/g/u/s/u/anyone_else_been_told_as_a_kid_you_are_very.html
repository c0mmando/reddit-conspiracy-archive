        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was a kid, it was very typical for me to get called intelligent a lot by teachers and the likes. I was pretty insecure so it felt good and made me want to prove myself, so at least in the early years I was pretty &quot;good at school&quot;. </p>

<p>I do remember very vividly also, that I always felt like they basically told this to every kid to make the kid feel good about itself. I told this to a few other people a few times over the course of the years but no one seemed particularly interested in that theory. </p>

<p>Now, the worst I suspected as a kid was that those people wanted to ingratiate themselves with me (like my mother basically) so that I would like them.</p>

<p>But now I&#39;ve read the idea a few times that intelligence can or is pretty much used as a measure of obedience. And that made it kinda &quot;click&quot; a little and that nagging feeling made sense now ... and it&#39;s true, it DID make me obedient and overly eager to prove myself to the &quot;adults&quot;. I was like a sponge for their ideas and I would often follow them so eagerly that even they themselves would sometimes find it silly.</p>

<p>Which is kind of funny, because in the recent years I have (at least in my want-to-be persona) developed into quite the opposite, calling bullshit on pretty much anything. Guess I&#39;m overcompensating after so many years of having nothing but bullshit as the source of my self-esteem. I still find it rather painful to speak up for myself in public, as I guess my child self is still identified with that praise of being intelligent. On one hand I hate that stupid attachment, on the other hand I do enjoy it and don&#39;t want to let that pride go.</p>

<p>Anyway, thought I&#39;d share. Anyone in the same boat?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the majority of teachers want their students to succeed in the same system they were raised in. From our cultural perspective, achievement in school is an inherently good thing that will lead to a productive life. The problem seems to be that our shared cultural vantage point is breaking down with modernity. Forgive them, move past it, and work on improving yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, man.  Not at all.  I was an under achiever.  Always getting in trouble.  I didn&#39;t give a fuck when I was little.  I was always told I needed to try harder etc.  But as an adult it&#39;s the complete opposite.  When I graduated from nursing school, I was 3rd in my class of about 40, and I was only 3rd because I got a full time job half way thru.   People always tell me im.smart now, or that I&#39;m just the smartest person they know or whatever.  It took me a long time to realise the value of intelligence.  However, as an adult I don&#39;t believe intelligence is a measure of obedience.  If you are smart enough to make that connection,  you are smart enough to buck the yoke of slavery.</p>

<p>At least considering the possibility that you might be the one in the wrong puts you head and shoulders above many others in terms of general wisdom and self-awareness. There are plenty of book smart people who are idiots, and there are some people who may not know lots of facts and figures but are full of wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that intelligence is a measure of obedience is not an idea that came from the parents of &quot;profoundly gifted&quot; children. That concept is just laughable to anyone who has raised a high-IQ child.</p>

<p>I could see material success being a measure of conformity - there&#39;s plenty of average-intelligence strivers and high-achievers out there to prove that point. Intelligent people are less willing (or able) to &quot;play the game.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the other hand, if you have just the right amount of above average intelligence, (probably like me), you just are very good at &quot;grasping&quot; the indoctrinated belief systems.</p>

<p>Maybe the measure is only relevant in combination with confidence. Confident + intelligent = disobedient. But intelligent + insecure = extremely obedient, as intellect is used to gain acknowledgement, so there&#39;s a large part of self-motivation in there too. Dumber kids aren&#39;t able to gain acknowledgement that way, so they are more likely to deal with their insecurities while the smarter ones then start to identify with their ability to earn acknowledgement by grasping the systems of indoctrination and following them very precisely</p>

<p>Profoundly gifted (and I hate that term, it&#39;s just the one that&#39;s commonly used) people tend to second-guess themselves into paralysis. Perfectionism keeps them stymied. Plus, when you&#39;re good at almost everything and interested in a wide variety of things, it&#39;s difficult to pick a path and commit. Not exactly a recipe for success.</p>

<p>Not that I consider myself &#39;profoundly gifted,&#39; but the rest of your post could easily describe my early life. There is a way forward, but most of us are also conditioned to reject it out of hand. Again, a product of the desire to please and appear smart instead of looking inward to that monster anxiety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting topic.  Back in third grade, 1958 for me, I did extra well on the dreaded IQ test.  Kids that did that were put in a study group, of 150,000, that the school councilors used for research.  At no time did any teacher tell any of those kids they were extra intelligent or gifted.  My teachers only said i could do better if I wanted to.  I&#39;m guessing the information learned from that study group has been put to use for the purpose of &#39;people management&#39; by whoever has access to the results of the study.  My top scores back then were in abstract logic, and schools don&#39;t use that as a teaching tool anymore.  I saw the manipulation of the researchers and didn&#39;t play their game.  That opened my eyes to seeing possible conspiracies by the powers that be, and still do. </p>

<p>Intelligence is less important than ambition when success is considered. If you don&#39;t give a rats ass then it will show.  If you crave to be filthy rich you might just find a way to get there, at any cost.  Today, thanks to the learned information from that research, it is easier to trick people into being obedient. I expect that was their true goal.  As far as my doing extra well in adult life, I&#39;ve been able to hold my own at work and stay employed while our jobs vanished.  I&#39;m not well paid but I&#39;m still on the job, so that counts for something.  My life long hobby has been building/researching loudspeakers and it was my second job in my basement.  I shared what I learned in a sub called r/loudspeakers.  I expect many hundreds of great sounding speakers are built every month, out of a few thousand views per month, and that&#39;s more rewarding/ambitious than I ever expected it would or could be.  The manipulators are still trying to find perfect child control and I wonder what kind of school experiences the young people who are called &#39;snowflakes&#39; had while they were in public school.  Like I said the learned information was put to use, and I don&#39;t like the idea that I was used by the system to refine their practice.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, did they reveal your IQ number to you? I&#39;m not asking you for a number, I&#39;m wondering about the policy. That&#39;s been a super big no-no at least since the early 1980s when working with gifted kids. I just wonder when and how that particular convention arose. </p>

<p>Really interesting info about the study you were in - thank you for sharing. I&#39;ve often wondered if the gifted and talented programs in the US public schools are simply a way of tagging and monitoring the very intelligent sector of the population, possibly for discontent or insurrection. Or, for scooping up those in about the third standard deviation (IQ 130-145) for work in the &quot;intelligence&quot; sector of the government.</p>

<p>They&#39;re getting a whole lot of positive reinforcement for marginally decent behavior/outcomes. I went to an honor&#39;s assembly for my kid last year, and half - I&#39;m not exaggerating - of the graduating class had basic honors, A&#39;s and B&#39;s. Out of 200 kids, there were 40 with distinguished honors. Now, how the exact fuck does that work statistically? And if everyone&#39;s honorable, how do the colleges distinguish between who makes the cut for admission and scholarships? </p>

<p>I am left to believe the educational system isn&#39;t really there for its expressed purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this makes sense, I was in special ed classes as a kid for &#39;behavioral problems&#39; because I couldn&#39;t get along with the system, or other sheep children.</p>

<p>I was very advanced, even taught myself to read pre-kindergarten, my mom didn&#39;t even know I possessed like an 8th grade reading level before kindergarten started. taught myself, from signs, magazines, video games, etc.</p>

<p>I already decided on my own religious standpoints then, too. although I changed a lot as I grew older.</p>

<p>I got out of special ed by politically fighting the school system, and scoring in the to 99th percentile or higher on all state exams. I taught myself 3 years of math in only 2 months, which I was not allowed to take in special ed because they could afford books to keep up with me in a class of retarded monkeys.</p>

<p>they tried to ditch me in special ed because I am the most dangerous personality type to the system. if I didn&#39;t make my entire life based around politically fighting them, id never have been allowed to get a real diploma or go to college.</p>

<p>they tried to destroy me first,</p>

<p>then they tried to integrate me when they realized what I was. Years later, even now that I am not allowed to join the military or get clearance because of my past, they wanted me in the army/air force or anything real bad.</p>

<p>I scored in the 90th percentile on the asvab -- and I fucked up the middle math section and ONLY ANSWERED LIKE 4 QUESTIONS!!!!</p>

<p>so I got pretty much 100% on everything else lol from engineering and the first math section. the thing was, I didn&#39;t listen and got caught up on one problem like they warn you not to -- I didn&#39;t care, it was time off class to me lol.</p>

<p>they still message me on facebook, call the house. ask me to take it again, etc.</p>

<p>I could have had any job I wanted. Couldve been a soldier for the evil empire all the way at the top in intelligence or scientific development and theyd have paid for everything.</p>

<p>I cant work for them, and wouldn&#39;t want to. id sooner join the armies of their ideological opponents than them, unfortunately. it was a hard stance Ive taken my whole life</p>

I was even retested with a different test and they got the same result.  However, back then a score of 200 meant that the person knew twice as much as an average person their age.  Today scores of over 400 are not that uncommon.  They did convert the IQ tests over to the percentile tests and I was tested again and got a score of 99.9 in abstract and 98 in language.  It is my personal belief that Bob Dylan  has a language score of 99.9 and an abstract of 98.  Thats why his songwriting conveys stories so well.  He understands the things around him well enough and has off the charts ways of telling the stories.</p>

<p>It used to be (1850-1970) that on average the US population was 1.5% gifted.  Then in the 80&#39;s that number jumped to about 10%, without corresponding justifications.  Now their numbers have no real credibility at all.</p>

<p>The US education system has been subverted to please the powers that be and reduce competition for existing corporations and government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The jump in the 80s probably had to do with redefining &quot;giftedness&quot; for funding purposes in the public schools. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <em>much</em> variation in the actual intelligence of the population over the course of a couple centuries. It&#39;s just about defining the terms. That said, when I was in school there were five of us in the gifted program in my grade, nowadays there are 20-some in the program in my daughter&#39;s grade, same district 30 years later. Class size and demographics haven&#39;t changed enough to explain the difference.</p>

<p>Aside: have you seen the conspiracy theory regarding Dylan being a CIA construct? It&#39;s an oldie but a goodie. :) Joni Mitchell&#39;s rant when he won the Nobel lent credence to the theory imo. I wouldn&#39;t argue his verbal propensity, &lt;puts on tinfoil&gt; if it&#39;s really him writing his lyrics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find the old Life and Look magazine interviews from 66 &amp; 67 or there abouts.  He didn&#39;t dare write his songs the way he talked, nobody would be able to understand him.  Even with my high language aptitude I had a hard time keeping up with him, but they were great.  CIA?  Maybe after his motorcycle crash, but not at first.  Joni was always jealous of his writing skills, he ran circles around her, and she is good.  Leave it to talented entertainers to rant like the best of them.  Dylan earned his Nobel.  His songs from 64-67 are his best. Turn the treble down a bit, the harmonica gets to you after a while.  No one will do a &#39;Dylan A-Z&#39; when he is gone. </p>

<p>I think todays young people are the most undereducated smart people alive.  They learn logic from computers and the Internet itself, just from using them.  Many can take a new digital device with crap instructions and get them working in short order.  The older generation mostly misinterprets them because they are not on the same page with those kids at all.  The powers that be are doing all they can to hold them back, according to their own understanding, and it won&#39;t work.      </p>

<p>No argument there. It is fascinating being the &quot;bridge generation,&quot; getting to watch the evolving differences between analog and digital natives. The digital natives are savvy to the power constructs by and large, I think. I&#39;m hopeful in that respect, anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was always told I was intelligent but it was clear that I didn&#39;t give a shit about school. I was rebellious and it was probably frustrating for teachers that i could have been a good student. I do remember being praised specifically for critical thinking too. </p>

<p>Maybe youre just smart. This concern you feel that people just wanted you to be obedient could stem from your feeling that you were too eager to please those in places of authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel intelligent and was always told that, yet I know I really didn&#39;t apply myself. I did the basics needed to get through high school and found myself stuck because i was on the lower end of a 3 point GPA and couldn&#39;t pay for college. I joined the military and became a Nuclear Machinist Mate, and I have to say I was pretty fucking good at understanding mechanical systems and could store a ton of useless knowledge that helped piece together more complicated systems or maintenance items. I left after my 6 years only 2 years ago now to use my hard won G.I bill to pay for college. I have made the deans list every semester 5 in a row without trying, even work 20+ hours a week and had a baby during one of them and it really isn&#39;t too difficult. I find the &quot;education&quot; system disgusting, i&#39;m 27 in college and feel like I&#39;m surrounded by idiots. I have to listen to people complain about tests or HW, or difficulty level of anything, when they have little to nothing to worry about outside of school. It&#39;s astounding to me that a bunch of children will get a terrible grade, then complain en masse and hold the teacher basically ransom with the evaluations, and to prevent them from failing they grade easier and dumb down exams as the semester wears on. All the better for me, I normally jump from a B+ A-, to an easy sold A. I only have been realizing how stupid my dream of having a 4 year degree and my masters is when I&#39;m surrounded by idiots and have little to no respect for the students around me. Sorry for the long rant. TlDr : I may have been smart, did bad in school, joined military, did well as a nuclear mechanic, finally went to college, been pwning college(it&#39;s easy), hate college, would like to work with hands and be left alone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was a way to control me, I think it was a thing my parents and teachers told me to make me succeed more, as in if I&#39;m told I&#39;m smart, why should I let my less intelligent peers do better. I think they were trying to breed competition.</p>
