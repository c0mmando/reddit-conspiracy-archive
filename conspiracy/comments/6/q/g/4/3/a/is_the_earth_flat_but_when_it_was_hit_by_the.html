    <div class="md"><p>Because the helicopter while sitting on the ground is rotating (with the earth) at 1000mph, and upon take off the helicopter STILL has the inertia of 1000mph with absolutely nothing counteracting that inertia, and if anything IS acting against that inertia (wind resistance, air pressure, what have you) it&#39;s likely to be negligible up against 1000mph of inertia. At the same time, that momentum cannot just simply disappear all by itself with nothing acting against it because that&#39;s just not how physics works, so it just follows the rotation of the planet until some force is capable of acting against it which is highly unlikely to happen.</p>

The purpose of trimming is to free the pilot from having to exert a constant pressure on the controls. This is often used to maintain straight and level flight, however trimming can also be used at any phase of flight - for example to maintain a constant rate of climb or descent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since you cant Ill explain modern autopilot. </p>

<p>You get to the desired altitude and set autopilot which bases its height on the air density, because the atmosphere curves to accommodate the planet autopilot does all the necessary trim adjustments to stay at that altitude. </p>

<p>You can manually adjust the trim but you may need to make small adjustments if you are flying over several hours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yes, but that&#39;s only in a relative sense. It&#39;s like a snail crawling on the floor of a speeding train; in one way, the snail is moving as fast as a speeding train and in another it&#39;s moving at a snail&#39;s pace. That&#39;s part of the basis of relativity.</p>

<p>However, these speeds specifically that you mention aren&#39;t going to have much affect on a helicopter because we (even the hovering helicopter) are anchored to the planet by gravity, due to the astronomical difference in weight between the planet and everything covering the surface or atmosphere of the planet, including the helicopter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m responding to your comment that claimed that people who believe the earth is a sphere do it with conviction without then actually &quot;knowing&quot;, you even used the argument that unless we went into low earth orbit we couldn&#39;t really know.</p>

<p>I said that people could know because there is experiments we can individually do to prove to ourselves that the earth is a sphere. </p>

<p>So if all education about the earth being a sphere disappeared for 20 years (using your poor analogy to explain my analogy), people can still do simple experiments utilising the sun, time, and visual proof to educate themselves. </p>

<p>Get it yet? You can find it out yourself....thats what makes FE so ridiculous. It&#39;s not that people are convinced because they believe TPTB, it&#39;s because simple scienve proves it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, a little blatant with your shill accusation, aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>My point was that there <em>must</em> be an intelligent argument in favor of flat earth, or people wouldn&#39;t be entertaining the idea. You&#39;re ignoring the FACT that anyone can counter argue any of your &quot;proofs&quot; to the point where IT IN NO WAY PROVES FLAT EARTH THEORY, but it still makes your &quot;proofs&quot; less credible. </p>

<p>My main point is that people who argue against flat earth, like people who argue for it, aren&#39;t open for interpretation. They&#39;ve made up their minds, and will not be moved. That&#39;s not how the scientific method works, friend. Every time you put your foot down with assumed knowledge, I&#39;ll be there asking for more sources, and for your personal experimentation on the matter, just as I would do to FE buffoons if there weren&#39;t so many bigots trying to shout over each other for the right to taste FE theorist blood.</p>

<p>There are simple SCIENCE experiments you can do that prove the earth is a spherical shape. </p>

<p>People who argue for a spherical earth are open for interpretation, however they have accepted the experiments which prove the earth is spherical. </p>

<p>How is this me accusing you of being a shill? </p>

<p>Out of curiosity, do you know the simple experiments you can do to prove to yourself the earth is a sphere?</p>

<p>Dude, you are arguing for the sake of arguing and I&#39;m sorry but your logic is flawed. I understand you are suggesting that we must always question everything, what I&#39;m saying is questioning is grrat, until you do an experiment and prove it to yourself.

<p>I haven&#39;t provided evidence because I wasn&#39;t asked to. I think you should reread this thread. I haven&#39;t &#39;literally&#39; quoted you at all and you never asked me for evidence.</p>

<p>Your initial statements didn&#39;t ask for experimentation, they stated that FE and spherical earthers argue but can never truly know unless they go into low earth orbit. I explained there are experiments which individuals can do which still prove earth is a sphere. Not once have you asked for these experiments nor evidence. </p>

<p>Also, nowhere did I say you are being paid. You said, &quot;I&#39;m not being paid to school you&quot;. I replied if you were, your employer would want there money back. In short, you were being arrogant and I replied in kind.</p>

<p>Chill out mate, you seem high strung. Earth is a sphere in my mind, I was interested in FE and then checked the experiments for myself and realised it&#39;s a bogus conspiracy theory. I hope others do the same. However, others don&#39;t need you jumping down peoples throats because they casually mention to you that there are ways to prove it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can think whatever you like, but typically &quot;theory&quot; isn&#39;t treated the same as a fact. Let your personal beliefs go where the evidence takes you. Also, consider the sources of your evidence, especially in 2017 (1984) when information is subject to editions at the click of a mouse. I have to imagine that there&#39;s more information on the microscopic world than there is about the cosmos, though it all sort of amounts to the same. The difference is that we don&#39;t need to build a craft and expend a tremendous amount of energy to get to the microscopic world. </p>
