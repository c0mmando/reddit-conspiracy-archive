        Eugenics: A Forced Prophecy
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Brave New World is mentioned often in conspiracy forums and for good reason. It seems to be predictive of our current and future society, and nearly every aspect of the book can be cited in some way to reflect modern concerns. When I really started to think more deeply, however, I realized that maybe Brave New World was not predictive, but rather, it was more of an agenda – a
       <em>
        forced prophecy
       </em>
       , something they want to happen and will make happen. When it does happen, we will look to the famous words to gain some insight, but will it be too late to change anything? The text is not really predictive, after all, if it is ultimately a part of the agenda, the desensitization, and the normalization of its ideas and ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aldous Huxley, the author of Brave New World, was not just some random guy on the street who wrote a hugely compelling masterpiece; he was part of the prominent Huxley family, who was a foundational part of the Royal Society. The Royal Society, is the oldest scientific academy in existence:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://royalsociety.org/about-us/">
        https://royalsociety.org/about-us/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is linked to conspiracies itself, and while the intention of my post is not to delve into these conspiracies, some accuse this society of having a sort of “scientific dictatorship”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/tag/royal-society/">
        http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/tag/royal-society/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy-related or not, Huxley’s family clearly had (and has) huge impact on thought and literature, and upon deeper digging, I learned about Aldous’s brother, Julian Huxley, who happened to be a eugenicist. From Wikipedia, just to make sure we are all on the same page:
      </p>
      <p>
       Eugenics (/juːˈdʒɛnɪks/; from Greek εὐγενής eugenes "well-born" from εὖ eu, "good, well" and γένος genos, "race, stock, kin") is a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of a group of individuals. The exact definition of eugenics has been a matter of debate since the term was coined.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366572/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366572/
       </a>
       ,
      </p>
      <p>
       “During the 1930s Huxley took a public stance as an avowed “scientific humanist”, by which he meant that his ethical ideas had a basis in evolutionary theory.36 As President of the Social and Political Education League, his lectures were published by the Rationalist Press Association. He linked his evolutionary ethics to the social agenda of eugenics: it meant approval for family allowances to encourage professional middle classes to have children of (hopefully) good eugenic quality, and the elimination of mental defect by reproductive controls.37 He explained that eugenicists should avoid a “holocaust” of the unfit by segregating mental defectives to prevent their reproduction.38 The economic and social system had to be altered to advance the reproduction of “the most successful stocks” particularly of the professional classes.39 Huxley advocated the ideas of eugenics as a sacred ideal and of “racial hope”, so that religion would advance his ideals of social evolution.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It clicked for me that the eugenics in Brave New World is absolutely connected to Julian’s ideas about eugenics. Clearly, Julian is pro-eugenics, and he envisioned a better world with a system of selective breeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, many people I come across on Reddit are in complete favor of eugenics to an extent. People are stupid, miserable, and even evil, they say. Shouldn’t we limit who has children? Shouldn’t we have control over that for a better society?
      </p>
      <p>
       As always, the global elite have an amazing way of twisting reality, and I’d like to show you how. This post is going to dive deeper into the topic of eugenics, and as always, I feel we are being deceived and tricked into a societal movement toward a brave eugenic world..
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Twisting Reality
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever hear of the term “carbon footprint?” There are tons of articles about how YOU, the common citizen, need to reduce your carbon footprint by driving less for example. Sure, it is good to do what we can collectively to help the planet, but even if everybody did do those things, what really has the biggest impact on carbon emissions? Industries, not the common folk:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://blog.ucsusa.org/aaron-huertas/dear-humans-industry-is-causing-global-warming-not-your-activities-697">
        http://blog.ucsusa.org/aaron-huertas/dear-humans-industry-is-causing-global-warming-not-your-activities-697
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you believe global warming is real is the beside the point. The point is that ‘they’ want you to believe that you are responsible for the all the environmental problems in the world, when in reality, there is a select group of billionaires who control and own everything and could change everything, if they really wanted to. Let’s not forget that 8 people,
       <em>
        8 people
       </em>
       , have as much wealth as half of the world:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50">
        https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, nobody can deny that there is absolutely a 1% (or even less than that) that basically controls everything that happens, but this is not the point of this post either.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar way, the 1% want you to believe that most people are not that smart or that great, and they are the cause for all the problems in this world. They want you to believe, that you, the common citizen, are the bad guy, and you are the reason the world is terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality, there are sociological structures in place that make life pretty terrible, and they are there to keep your life pretty terrible. For example, the structure of class ensures that we will likely die in the class we we are born in. There is a myth of mobility in the United States, also known as the “American Dream”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/03/the-mobility-myth">
        http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/03/the-mobility-myth
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to believe that if you do not end up wealthy, then it is your fault. You simply are not working hard enough! It is not them that are the problem, it is you, and that is how they twist reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Note: By the way, I completely acknowledge that this is a debate itself, and I am not necessarily against the foundations of this country. I believe that there are structures in place that the founders of our nation could not predict (banks, corporations, etc.), and this could go into a million other posts. I also understand there are lazy people out there that truly do not work, and that there are many who put themselves in the position that they are in…
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that most are not aware of these structures, and they feel that the 1% have good intentions for the majority – they are not in it for themselves, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        People and Potential
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       With this myth (that the 1% are truly looking out for us), they look at society and they see just how terrible people are – why are they so poor and why are they so stupid? It cannot be the class system, or the education system, or anything like that – it is the people themselves. They think eugenics would be a great way to simply control who is born – those of certain and preferable genes would make for the best society, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this the teacher in me, but I believe this is completely false. I believe all beings begin with potential, and while genes do contribute, there are systems in place that determine whether or not somebody will be successful, smart, etc. There is study after study on how your social class will ultimately determine your success:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/social-class-determines-childs-success-934240.html">
        http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/social-class-determines-childs-success-934240.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I do understand that genes have an effect and do shape us, but ultimately, our environment is most important. 
If our environment (the structures in place) was changed, our world would be a better place, and people would be better overall. Of course, there would always be exceptions, but quite simply, the majority of people thrive in good environments.
While there are many studies on this, you might want to read on the “rat park” study:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The study concludes that drugs themselves do not necessarily cause addiction, but the environment is more of an important factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way, the problems of our world are not necessarily caused by some people being inherently stupid or lazy, but rather, environment has a huge impact on what actually happens to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my classroom, I have tremendous success, and I work in an extremely impoverished area, where my students have some of the worst lives you can ever imagine. Yet, somehow I have the highest test scores in my district? How? It is not by luck or random chance, as many teachers who I work with believe. I set up my classroom environment in a way where I can get everybody to grow and succeed. That does not mean that everybody has the same level of potential and growth, but it means that every body has the potential to grow. And this is backed up by real research and it is called growth mindset:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mindsetscholarsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/What-We-Know-About-Growth-Mindset.pdf">
        http://mindsetscholarsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/What-We-Know-About-Growth-Mindset.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I am using “growth mindset” for my thematic incentives and classroom practices this year because it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now before people start arguing with me in the comments, I do understand there are exceptions to every rule, and again, there probably are really some inherently shitty people. However, I am a firm believer that every human being on this planet has the potential to be good and to grow, but I believe this potential is limited by systems in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, how does this tie to eugenics? Eugenics basically says that people are the problem, and we need to get rid of dispose of certain types of people. I believe this is inherently flawed, but not surprisingly, many buy into this belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Push Toward Eugenics
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe it or not, I think we are being conditioned toward a future society that actively uses eugenics, but before this happens, they have to convince us that eugenics is a good thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, abortion is becoming more and more glorified. Whatever your belief about abortion (feel free to ask about mine), it is being framed as empowerment for women:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/victory-abortion-rights-empowered-polish-women">
        https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/victory-abortion-rights-empowered-polish-women
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if abortion is not technically defined as eugenics, it certainly is linked to eugenic practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, they are trying to normalize the practice of “selecting” genes of babies. Genetic engineering is now allowing people to select the gender and eye color of their children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a19313/genetic-engineering-allow-parents-select-gender-eye-color-children/">
        http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a19313/genetic-engineering-allow-parents-select-gender-eye-color-children/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, there is a promotion of a child-free lifestyle that is having more and more influence. While this may not be eugenics technically, it pushes people toward the belief that breeding simply is not necessary:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html">
        http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s not forget that more and more people are choosing not to get married or have long-term relationships or families:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://theconversation.com/why-are-fewer-people-getting-married-60301">
        http://theconversation.com/why-are-fewer-people-getting-married-60301
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if people do want to have children, we have environmental influences impacting men and women and their fertility. Did you see the article on the decline of men’s sperm count?:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/sperm-counts-declining-study/index.html">
        http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/sperm-counts-declining-study/index.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       1 in 6 couples will face infertility, and this article was written in 2013:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-couples-infertility-idUSBRE90A13Y20130111">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/us-couples-infertility-idUSBRE90A13Y20130111
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only does there seem to be a social promotion of having less children, but perhaps there is a darker, more sinister forced eugenics happening now. Whatever you believe, though, remember that according to the Georgia Guidestones ‘they’ want to keep our population under 500 million people, and with a current population of 7.5 billion, that is a whole lot of people they are going to have to get rid of:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be a mixture of environmental, psychological, and social influences that seem to be telling us that most people really do not need to have children.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Gender Mania
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all of those influences, there is a move toward the acceptance of gender neutrality. I write much about the breakdown of gender roles, but since this is not the purpose of this post, I want to get to the point. Not only have views of gender been turned upside down in the past few decades, but now there seems to be a push toward androgyny and gender neutrality:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.parents.com/parenting/gender-neutral-parenting/">
        http://www.parents.com/parenting/gender-neutral-parenting/
       </a>
       Well what is the root of “neutrality” – neuter (sterilize) – just a fun connection 😊
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, while I have many views on why they are twisting the gender roles, I am starting to believe that this move toward transgenderism, gender neutrality, and androgyny is to get us used to a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  If it more difficult to have children. For example, certain hormones can cause sterilization in transgendered people (who are undergoing hormone treatment).
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  With the breakdown of gender roles, there will be less unions between men and women and more unions between men and men, women and women, and so on. While this may not be an exceptional number, it will certainly decrease children born the “traditional” way.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  The more non-traditional relationships there are, the more likely people will have to seek non-traditional fertility practices. Did you know test tube babies are on the rise world wide?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.livescience.com/5460-test-tube-babies-rise-worldwide.html">
        https://www.livescience.com/5460-test-tube-babies-rise-worldwide.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This will also normalize and desensitize us to these practices (and it already is).

       4)  Ultimately, and this is really a little more far-fetched, this gender neutral push could also be a push toward a transhumanism agenda, to get us more used to “adrogynous” or “robotic” beings. By the way, I wrote more about my ideas on immortality and transhumanism here if you are interested:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that I feel there is a connection to the current push toward transgenderism and gender neutrality, and it is tied with eugenics. While it may NOT be the only reason for this push, it is certainly an interesting connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the destruction of gender roles correlates to the destruction of traditional families, and I write about that a lot. You can find more information on my views here:

       <strong>
        Brave New World
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       While this may not be happening tomorrow (though in some ways it is), I predict that we will be hearing more about eugenics as they continue to advance in genetic engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       This NY times article states:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Is this sort of “liberal eugenics,” in which the agents of reproductive selection are parents rather than the state, entirely different from the eugenics of Fisher’s era, which forced sterilization on unwilling men and women? Like so many of our debates about reproductive ethics, that question hinges on what one thinks about the moral status of the fetus.
From a rigorously pro-choice perspective, the in utero phase is a space in human development where disease and disability can be eradicated, and our impulse toward perfection given ever-freer rein, without necessarily doing any violence to human dignity and human rights.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/opinion/sunday/douthat-eugenics-past-and-future.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/opinion/sunday/douthat-eugenics-past-and-future.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many will argue that eugenics would ultimately help eradicate diseases and benefit our world, and I am not dismissing that point in entirely. However, I would like to quote this portion from Brave New World:
      </p>
      <p>
       “But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin.'
      </p>
      <p>
       'In fact,' said Mustapha Mond, 'you're claiming the right to be unhappy.'
      </p>
      <p>
       'All right then,' said the Savage defiantly, 'I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.'
      </p>
      <p>
       'Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.' There was a long silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       'I claim them all,' said the Savage at last."
      </p>
      <p>
       If we try to eradicate suffering altogether, are we really just eradicating freedom? In order for us to have freedom, doesn’t there need to be a certain amount of suffering? Freedom requires sacrifice ultimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, isn’t eugenics really just another form of conditioning, a way to keep us all under control? Huxley talks more about conditioning here:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. When there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended - there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren't any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving anyone too much. There's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears - that's what soma is.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In Brave New World, eugenics was used through invitro practices – does that really seem that far off to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Brave New World was predictive or
       <em>
        forced prophecy
       </em>
       as I mentioned earlier, eugenics is not some far-off idea currently. It is something that could really happen in our foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to end with a more emotional point, an appeal to pathos 😊. I read a lot on Reddit about how the mentally retarded, specifically children with down syndrome and similar problems, are a strain on our society. Trust me, I do understand how difficult it must be to raise a child with down syndrome or other disabilities, and I am not discounting that.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, over the past year, I have grown close with a student with down syndrome at my school. At the school dance, she asked me to dance with her, and she was radiating with joy and happiness. Perhaps she does not have the same intellectual ability that I have, but we connected on a different, emotional level. For an hour, she danced and showed me her love and joy. For the first time, I saw her as more than her down syndrome. I saw her as human.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, eugenics would be a way to convince people that there are some people who do not have this ‘human’ element  - they are just not worthy of existing at all. And I disagree with that. I feel every human has  potential, and while we all may have different types of potential, it does not make any individual  human any less valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gets decide who should have the right to exist or live? Should it be some government institution? The 1%, who certainly have our best interests at heart?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, what makes us human? Maybe I am wrong about transhumanism. Maybe this is really a movement toward sub-humanism, a society where we are less than human...
      </p>
      <p>
       It took me two hours to write this (and this is one of my favorite that I have written!), and I really look forward to hearing your thoughts.

       Some of the downvotes will come about because a lot of people
       <em>
        detest
       </em>
       reading: it requires too much thought, too much time, and not enough of the endorphin-releasing instant stimulation they have become accustomed to. There is nothing you can do about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the downvotes will be due to people not liking the feeling they get when they arrive at your conclusion. They are not here for the truth, they are here for good feelings. Believe it or not, they get better feelings (affirmation, confirmation) from reading doom-porn on zerohedge than they do from reading logical prose like your OP.

       tl;dr just relax, don't worry about the downvotes.

       Do you feel society may also coddle imperfection too much? Perhaps it has stopped natural selection so to speak, by allowing people to live and thrive that may not have without technology and medical advancements?

      <p>
       I agree with virtually everything you said, buy I'm curious and try to counter things even when I identify with them.  Bravo on more well thought out and organized writing. Its funny how people tend to think Huxley just had incredible maybe even prophetic foresight, when it may be that he and his people actually set the wheels he wrote about in motion.

       I've thought much about some of this as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Huxleys were extremely connected elites and Julian was British intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking into Eugenics you'll quickly realize that Nazi or no, this was the paradigm of the day, completely accepted science, among most of the wealthy. The mouth breathing poor and defective are holding us all back and we must fix them! Father governs children. With that in mind you can see how all this could be justified. Humans are broken and must be fixed, hard decisions must be made, and the wealthy who have proven themselves superior must be the ones to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now looking at contemporary society you can see shadows of it everywhere on all sides of the political spectrum. Right wing nationalists frothing at the mouth about their racial and national purity, while the "left" wing liberals ponder with their genetically superior intellects how people could be so stupid, suggesting intelligence tests for voting. (heard that on NPR within the last 4 years!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the intro to the film Idiocracy. Many of my peers believe that movie to be a prescient documentary, only stupid people are breeding, they must be fixed before the vile stupids take over the world!!
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's all bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darwin's interpretation of his own work was informed by prevailing economic theory at the time. Economic theory that justified the genocides perpetrated by oligarchs as the natural sublime order of the universe, the 'strong' conquering the 'weak'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But old Darwin's finches didn't actually show 'survival of the fittest'. What they showed was more survival of the freaks. Evolution has no goal, it is haphazard, and 'adaptation' is a bit of a misnomer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your goal is to make a hotbed for evolution than your objective should be to make the genome as diverse as possible and let the chips fall where they may. Extreme genetic specialization is a great way to wipe out a species as it becomes less and less able to adapt to radical environmental changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that things assumed to be entirely biological at the start of the eugenics movement have proven to be less and less so over time. As you noted, environment has a massive impact, and it's role in cognitive development gets more weighty the more research we do. All of our 'IQ' testing has proven to have huge cultural bias, and I think assuming intelligence itself to be a quantitative thing was a mistake in the first place. I know a guy who was taking apart and rebuilding engines before he was eight years old but he can't do algebra and he'll never read for leisure, where does that leave his 'IQ' ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting that we survive as a group, we are not solitary hunters. Well maybe the lizard folk running this shit are lol, but most of us aren't
      </p>
      <p>
       An intersting article I read some time ago:
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-help-evolution-cooperation/">
        https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-help-evolution-cooperation/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Species that cooperate the most effectively can adapt to much harsher environments and cooperation has likely played a larger role in evolution than any individual exceptionalism has.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on abortion, reproductive health and bodily autonomy are important and I think planned parenthood does some good things, but how have we allowed ourselves to live in a world where reproducing is seen as irresponsible? If there is a point to all this isn't that it? To be fruitful and multiply? And if you look into Margaret Sanger and planned parenthoods history you'll notice the first one was in Harlem. Sanger was more concerned about preserving 'genetic hygiene' by keeping black people from reproducing than she was about women's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, good post. This is a huge topic and don't feel bad if it gets lost in all the silly noise here.  If you're on this sub this topic is one that you can use to connect a huge swath of conspiracy theories until you start going mad. To the point where I now find myself questioning the entire history of the last century, it's feeling more and more like the Nazis were the boots on the ground for a larger invisible empire of elites, looting the wealth of Europe to fund a larger project. And a quick glance at the fortune 500? War profiteers, eugenicists, nazi sympathizers and actual fucking nazis, it's like a whos who list. Still running things.

        Darwin's interpretation of his own work was informed by prevailing economic theory at the time. Economic theory that justified the genocides perpetrated by oligarchs as the natural sublime order of the universe, the 'strong' conquering the 'weak'.
       </p>
       <p>
        But old Darwin's finches didn't actually show 'survival of the fittest'. What they showed was more survival of the freaks. Evolution has no goal, it is haphazard, and 'adaptation' is a bit of a misnomer.
       </p>
       <p>
        If your goal is to make a hotbed for evolution than your objective should be to make the genome as diverse as possible and let the chips fall where they may. Extreme genetic specialization is a great way to wipe out a species as it becomes less and less able to adapt to radical environmental changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should also be noted that things assumed to be entirely biological at the start of the eugenics movement have proven to be less and less so over time. As you noted, environment has a massive impact, and it's role in cognitive development gets more weighty the more research we do. All of our 'IQ' testing has proven to have huge cultural bias, and I think assuming intelligence itself to be a quantitative thing was a mistake in the first place. I know a guy who was taking apart and rebuilding engines before he was eight years old but he can't do algebra and he'll never read for leisure, where does that leave his 'IQ' ?

       Another great point. I forgot to mention social darwinism in my post!

        An intersting article I read some time ago:
        <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-help-evolution-cooperation/">

       </p>
       <p>
        Species that cooperate the most effectively can adapt to much harsher environments and cooperation has likely played a larger role in evolution than any individual exceptionalism has.

        And on abortion, reproductive health and bodily autonomy are important and I think planned parenthood does some good things, but how have we allowed ourselves to live in a world where reproducing is seen as irresponsible? If there is a point to all this isn't that it? To be fruitful and multiply? And if you look into Margaret Sanger and planned parenthoods history you'll notice the first one was in Harlem. Sanger was more concerned about preserving 'genetic hygiene' by keeping black people from reproducing than she was about women's rights.

       I have felt like that! It really is all interconnected, though it seems to be disconnected at first.

       An individual's carbon footprint takes into account all of their activities and what impact those h ave throughout the carbon chain,  therefore it also takes into account the industrial mechanisms which are required for us to live our lives the way we do.  This is why you can look up the carbon footprint of specific consumer products as well.

        In a similar way, the 1% want you to believe that most people are not that smart or that great, and they are the cause for all the problems in this world. They want you to believe, that you, the common citizen, are the bad guy, and you are the reason the world is terrible.

       This seems like a point that completely contradicts what is going on in successful and progressive social democracies in Europe.  Coincidentally these are also the places that rank highest on quality of life indexes.  I'm not sure where the idea that the 1% wants people in these countries to believe they are the "bad guy" comes from,  in reality it's the exact opposite.

        On top of all of those influences, there is a move toward the acceptance of gender neutrality. I write much about the breakdown of gender roles, but since this is not the purpose of this post, I want to get to the point. Not only have views of gender been turned upside down in the past few decades, but now there seems to be a push toward androgyny and gender neutrality.

       Again, completely untrue in progressive social  democracies.

      <blockquote>

        The point is that I feel there is a connection to the current push toward transgenderism and gender neutrality, and it is tied with eugenics. While it may NOT be the only reason for this push, it is certainly an interesting connection.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm really confused about this point as well ... where are people "pushing" transgenderism???

       Overall, I also see a huge issue referencing only one of Huxley's works, especially when he has works which have completely opposite conclusions and messages.

       Again, this doesn't even seem close to be what is taking place across the vast majority of the developed world ... but I agree, if it were happening it would be terrifying.

       I thought this was an excellent post! I like what you have here and it fits in with declining fertility, which is across the board in western civilization. It's chemicals in the water (also women taking BC pills and excreting them in to the water supply), our food with GMO's, and the heavy metals/chemicals in vaccines. But it all boils down to control: with less people, you can control us better. The last year has brought me to my knees with faith in God...
