Taking into consideration that basically all of them were Freemasons and  possibly proponents of a globalist philosophy, is it possible the whole revolutionary war was a false flag event to establish America as a secret colony of the black nobility in UK, used to accomplish the globalist/Zionist agenda??? Throwing this out there for open discussion....</p>

Christopher Columbus uncle was a Templar, and it&#39;s theorized that the Templars came to North America far earlier than Columbus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. A lot of what we &quot;know&quot; about our history is a complete fraud and fabrication. One example of this was the whole &quot;Taxation without representation&quot;. It doesn&#39;t make one bit of sense, because at the time, it would take ~6+ weeks (round trip) to travel from the US to England. </p>

<p>James Corbett had a great presentation about how the Revolutionary was a false flag, which lead to the Treaty of Paris 1783, which basically made the US into a quasi clandestine Crown Corporation (ie we never truly won our freedom).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a deep rabbit hole, but once you see it, you cannot unsee it.</p>

<p>All great search terms that will take you to information about John Dee&#39;s involvement with the whole endeavor.</p>

<p>Of particular interest to me is his position as a nautical advisor to the Muscovy Company.</p>

<p>This company was the first to establish trade with what we now know as Russia.</p>

<p>Of particular interest to me was their interest in the knowledge possessed by the Russian Orthodoxy. Can&#39;t find the specific link right now..but it&#39;s about meeting Ivan the Terrible..and other nice gems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do any sort of reading and you&#39;ll find they were actual revolutionaries. You might ask why were they Freemasons? Well how else were they going carry out the revolution without infiltrating the enemy&#39;s institutions.</p>

<p>You should also know that freemasons would intentionally avoid killing each other on the battlefield.</p>

<p>As to the globalist/zionist agenda thing... The UK back then was globalist and zionist and still is today... so not sure what you mean by that. House of Windsor and the House of Malborough (Churchill&#39;s) began as and still are true pieces of shit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re actually curious about the true intention of the revolution and not just shit-posting for fun, read <a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754"><em>How The Nation Was Won</em></a>. It offers many primary sources and accurate information (I fact-checked all of it)</p>

<p>And if you want to know what happened to America and why it&#39;s so shitty nowadays, read pretty much any of Jonathan Swift&#39;s nonfiction works, I like &quot;The Conduct of The Allies,&quot; and definitely read &quot;<a href="https://archive.org/details/presentattemptto00lcmors">The Present Attempt to Dissolve the American Union, a British Aristocratic Plot</a>&quot; by Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph and morse code, and &quot;<a href="https://archive.org/details/foreignconspiracy00mors">Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States</a>&quot;. To get a full summary of what has ruined America read &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Treason-America-Aaron-Averell-Harriman/dp/0933488327">Treason In America, From Aaron Burr To Averell Harriman</a>&quot;</p>

<p>But in general all you need to know is, the revolution was a psyop against the banking oligarchy (had the British convinced it was just a false-flag against America, but then initiated a genuine revolution) and that same oligarchy infiltrated America&#39;s institutions and now controls us. </p>

<p>It&#39;s barely even changed really. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough was probably the greatest enemy of America&#39;s principals during the 1700&#39;s and, generations later, Winston Churchill pretty much completed his task in destroying them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/SlipperySkeet said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and, generations later, Winston Churchill pretty much completed his task in destroying them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Read this (a recent, 5 star review article of the 5 star book that came out in 2013):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/hidden-history-the-secret-origins-of-the-first-world-war/5600090">Hidden History: The Secret Origins of the First World War</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In demolishing the many shibboleths surrounding the origins of the ‘Great War’ (including ‘German responsibility’, ‘British peace efforts‘, ‘Belgian neutrality’ and the ‘inevitability’ of the war), Docherty and Macgregor point the finger at what they argue is the real source of the conflict: a more or less secret cabal of British imperialists whose entire political existence for a decade and a half was dedicated to the fashioning of a European war in aid of destroying the British Empire’s newly emerging commercial, industrial and military competitor, Germany.</p>

<p>In short, far from “sleepwalking into a global tragedy, the unsuspecting world”, Docherty and Macgregor contend, “was ambushed by a secret cabal of warmongers” originating not in Berlin, but “in London”.</p>

<p>And, too, the legendary Churchill, liberally inflated with his own bombast and well lubricated with Rothschild money, would rise to take his anointed place amongst the war-hungry secret elect.</p>

<p>That such a tiny, elite group of individuals, completely beyond democratic control, could determine the fate – and deaths – of millions should shock us. It should, but it doesn’t really. It doesn’t because we see the same phenomenon occurring now, repeatedly, before our very eyes.</p>

<p>Good question. The fact you would even ask this questions shows you are smarter and more capable than 90% of this sub. I suspect you already know the answer to your question is, &#39;no&#39;.
