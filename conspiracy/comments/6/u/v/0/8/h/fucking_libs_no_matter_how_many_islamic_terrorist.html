<p>I took a walk to get to it that was much longer than it needed to be but also winded it&#39;s way through the thousands of bikers who came to protest the event I was coming to attend. I even had pleasant conversations with a few of them. At the march that followed the speeches the diehard nastiest protesters who encircled us far out numbered our pro 9/11 truth marchers. What a ceremony. </p>

I agree that it&#39;s ignorant to ascribe an agreed upon set of beliefs and wants to a large group of people based on the actions or beliefs of a small group of idiots. You did a great job of doing this by saying &quot;libs&quot; all do something.

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me annoyed, because the media is fueling divisions by refusing to report or discuss anything with any depth or complexity. Personally when I saw the Charlottesville crash photos, my first response was that it was caused by fear or panic, because I tend to attribute things to human failings before deciding on murder. The trial may find it was certainly murder, but I assumed it was normal to hold off on judgement at least until a trial. But now, I either need to condemn the driver automatically, or risk being painted as a Nazi sympathizer, which frankly is absurd to the point of being laughable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be swept away when the forums for debate are manipulated, but I take comfort in the fact there there are millions of democrats across America who find the msm behavior and trial by media to be as alarming as I do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is clear and obvious war mongering. I keep wondering why more people are not accusing them of a war crime. I think what they are doing is a very clear international war crime and they need to be called out on it. </p>

<p>First step, don&#39;t watch. Second step complain about it. We need to build public support for the idea that what they are doing is a very clear war crime. Don&#39;t ask how they are getting away with it, that is obvious. The more important thing to point out is that it is fully illegal under international law. </p>

<p>They obviously think they will never be indicted and sent to the Hague, maybe they need to be reminded that it is a lot more politically possible than they think it is. Those people are living in a glass house bubble. We can do a lot of damage to them by just throwing a few stones. They are being well paid to lie us into more wars.

<p>The &quot;white&quot; in &quot;white supremacy&quot; and the &quot;black&quot; in &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; refer to?:
a)skin-color
b)eye-color
c)hair-color

    <div class="md"><p>As a political organizer with a very long track record of real honest to God success with encouraging groups to form for political action [Tea Party, Occupy, IdleNoMore, + others] I was very happy to see the BlackLivesMatter group self organize. It felt like a big success to me in my intended public education program. They were &#39;getting it&#39;, I was thrilled. </p>

<p>What really surprised me was the angry and racist response to BLM, ESPECIALLY from the police. The anti-black prejudice expressed by the BlueLivesMatter group really shocked me. What race is blue? Aliens? Well, I guess I&#39;d have to say it must be the self chosen color of dominance, authority and supremacy. It is the &quot;Blue Man&quot; referred to in the Native American religious prophesy story in &quot;Black Elk Speaks.&quot; </p>

<p>Black Elk had a vision of a woman who leads the people in a great struggle to defeat the Blue Man, which I think is the idea of fascist military supremacy. It is a very serious problem. It is killing our planet. </p>

<p>Who would have thought the big solutions could be discovered by researching Native American religion? That was totally unexpected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting observation. Did you also discuss the contrast between the assertions of supremacy versus lives matter? </p>

<p>If you take out the color part of it, then it becomes a universal question of banking policy, economic destruction, ecological destruction, slavery, sex dominance, poisoning the water, poisoning the air, child rape, mass murder, Gaza, etc. War in general. Is there supremacy or do lives matter? </p>

<p>It is amazing how so many issues can be boiled down to that one question. Is there supremacy or do lives matter? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to, however that notion failed.  To be clear, I believe all lives matter (all, meaning everyone (even police lives - yes, police can be corrupt, but so can everyone)).</p>

<p>I specifically stated that all lives matter, because I believe all lives matter, and if &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; wanted to fight for everyone/all, they should use &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; (or &quot;Everyone Matters&quot;), but apparently that makes me the racist.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t worth arguing about, as that poster was putting words in my mouth (saying that I&#39;m saying &quot;All Lives Matter out of spite&quot;, which I didn&#39;t say nor imply, heh), throwing out insults/name-calling, wouldn&#39;t answer simple questions, and falsely accusing.</p>

<p>That is a shit tier talking point.</p>

<p>No where does black lives matter implies other &quot;lives&quot; don&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a fucking rallying cry against police abuse on black Americans. Clearly black lives don&#39;t matter because you would rather stroke your ego arguing all lives matter than to actually change something.</p>

<p>So tell me how black lives matter is racist.</p>

<p>People like you are to stuck on the &quot;black&quot; part to realize black lives matter is carrying you on their fucking backs. Who else is protesting police brutality??? </p>

<p>Why was all lives only muttered after blacks rallied behind black lives matter after being shown that black lives clearly don&#39;t matter???</p>

<p>Why does all lives and blue lives matter go hand in hand???</p>

<p>What is a &quot;police life&quot; police is a job not a life. Therefore it&#39;s stupid to say all lives matter then say even police????</p>

<p>I think at least some of them are straight up Russians. Their efforts to help Trump didn&#39;t stop when he was elected. They still have unmet goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But fuck the laws that she broke right?  Screw the fact that the FBI director described her crimes, in some detail, on national TV and then said &quot;buuut she didn&#39;t <em>mean</em> to do it so get out of jail free card.&quot;  Right?  </p>

<p>Yeah, who gives a shit about national security laws that were blatantly violated by the SoS.  Who gives a shit that after getting a congressional subpoena she absolutely demolished any trace of the worst of the evidence.  &quot;Oooh those?  Those were just wedding and yoga emails, silly.  Wipe?  Like with a cloth?&quot;</p>

<p>But her emails...  blow me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing no... </p>

<p>Yes she was careless and incompetent but according to the law she did not do anything wrong. </p>

<p>Trump talks about rule of law. I bet he wracks up more charges than John Gotti. Let&#39;s see how he feels about laws when his secrets are brought to light. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a preview of what Mueller has been doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each different president sits at the helm of an army of online trolls who work in the CIA, FBI and in the military. That is a growth industry. The CIA especially likes to shape public opinion, this is one of their methods. </p>

<p>Your tax dollars are also paying for this. Imagine what it would be like if Hillary was our leader and they were doing her bidding. At least Trump is disorganized. </p>
