    <div class="md"><p>Fake sweeteners are so effectively astroturfed I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s real anymore. There is a piece we are missing. Like fluoridation. I spent most of my life as a chemist studying drinking water sources. Fluoridation was the most retarded conspiracy to me...until I found out that it was a toxic waste byproduct of making shit like fertilizer. Then it clicked, they needed a way to dispose of all that hazardous waste. So what I&#39;m getting at is what problem did artificial sweeteners solve for the bad guys? They were making plenty of money on other leas fake sweeteners, what drove the need for the adoption of saccharin? I used to use a shit ton of saccharin for making nickel plating flexible...But that consumes the stuff.</p>

<p>Do you know what I&#39;m getting at? Anyone have any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t address HFCS, by far and away the largest consumed sweetener. And that number would need to be adjusted for subsidization. Sugar is expensive to farm, HFCS is not. I find it highly suspicious it doesn&#39;t have its own category here. </p>

<p>Being honest i dont know a whole lot about HFCS as i&#39;m in one of the countries that dont use it much. The quote below should probably qualify that it doesnt include imports.</p>

<p>The countries where no HFCS at all is used include India, Ireland, Sweden, Austria, Uruguay, and Lithuania. France, China, Australia, and the UK all use less than one pound per capita.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems unlikely that they directly fool brain chemistry.  There are, however, basically tastebuds in the gut that are there to tell when you recently consumed a lot of sugar.  It&#39;s part of what feeds into your insulin response.  Studies haven&#39;t been really conclusive as to whether the artificial sweeteners trigger this response.  Common sense dictates that they should, but drinking a ton of diet coke doesn&#39;t cause sudden horrible hypoglycemia either.  It probably has an effect that is somewhat subtle.  That would explain things like the studies that showed higher fat deposition when consuming aspartame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my thought on artificial sweeteners and factory-hydrogenated fat. They work like a drug. They make folks think that they have satiated their biological need for sugar and fat, but their body doesn&#39;t recognize the chemicals and needs <em>more and more</em>, and the person is willing to pay a fortune for it. </p>

<p>And the imitation crap is cheap to manufacture. Every time someone buys a &quot;diet&quot; coke or &quot;fat/sugar-free box of cookies, the manufacturer just tripled their profit. Real fat and real sugar is costly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the fluoridation stuff was dumb as well and then I realized that, no, it&#39;s very very real. You&#39;re right about it as a waste byproduct, but there&#39;s also evidence that it bio-accumulates in the pineal gland inhibiting function, which is extremely convenient if you spend time studying the actual established history and the lore, that may or may not be completely accurate, about what the pineal does in humans.</p>

<p>The pineal is also capable of producing actual straight up DMT along with several other majorly active psychodelic substances, so one starts to wonder whether it&#39;s just an strange coincidence that the water is doped with a substance that seems to block the functioning of a structure associated with one of the most potent psychodelic compounds known or whether there&#39;s even more to the story than simply disposing of a waste product at taxpayer&#39;s expense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the documentation behind Operation Northwoods is a pretty big wake-up call.  The heads of our armed forces had signed off on killing thousands of American civilians to start a war with Cuba.  If not for the president at the time, it would have happened.  Luckily for them, a lone nut quickly assassinated that president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of a couple of examples. But if you&#39;re going to use x was true (or kinda true), therefore y is true (or could be), then reconsider. That&#39;s bad thinking and conspiracy theories cover such a wide spectrum e.g. Russia&#39;s doping program doesn&#39;t mean geocentrism is any more likely to be true.</p>

<p>most outlandish</p>

<p>MKUltra is pretty outlandish</p>

<p>But for real, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident">Dugway Sheep Incident</a> is a pretty good example of Government indifference. Imagine if people had been in the area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Dugway sheep incident, also known as the Skull Valley sheep kill, was a 1968 sheep kill that has been connected to United States Army chemical and biological warfare programs at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Six thousand sheep were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of chemical weapons for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and <strong>first made public in 1998, was called the &quot;first documented admission&quot; from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They waited 30 years to say &quot;yeah those sheep died because we sprayed a huge area of Utah with VX from planes and shit&quot;</p>

<p>Dugway itself is a huge shitshow, I think it&#39;s more interesting than Area 51 personally</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since its founding in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included <strong>aerial nerve agent testing</strong>. According to reports from New Scientist, <strong>Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious anthrax of a type used in the making of vaccines, as late as 1998</strong>, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one that got my colleagues&#39; attention was when I predicted early on that Kerry would win the 2004 primary because he was Skull &amp; Bones - when he was still a long shot. And of course as it turned out, Kerry&#39;s chief competition was knocked out by MSM overplaying the Dean Scream.</p>

<p>But sadly that&#39;s not something that can be used these days because no one remembers primary poll results from that long ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, that only the ones that have little to no impact after reveal will come to light. The ones that would fuck over entire industries and wipe out trillions of market capitalisation will stay as long hidden as ppl don&#39;t know about them. Sadly, I cant talk about more details due to the brisance of the information itself.  </p>

<p>Just a tip. Reddit is great for discussion and stuff. But the best information is usually present on the shittiest-looking websites, regarding the design/code.</p>
