    <div class="md"><p>I felt like this when the Podesta leaks dropped. I was with a group combing through the emails in an effort to find and post the incriminating shit, and it was such dissonance to look up from my computer, turn on the news, and hear.... crickets. Or Russians. I thought, &quot;is anyone listening? Why am I bothering with this at all when nobody cares?&quot; </p>

<p>The fact that she lost--substantially--illustrated that the public definitely isn&#39;t duped as much as I thought we were. </p>

<p>The other thing I look to for consensus is the comments section of the NYT and other papers. Though some outlets have outright banned comments because people were doing the equivalent of hurling tomatoes at the author (often well-deserved) others still reflect that the public isn&#39;t stupid and they&#39;re waking up in larger numbers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is exactly what&#39;s happening, at least when it comes to the &quot;ideological&quot; clashes. The vocal minority and the passive sheeps in addition to bots make it even easier to control on the internet.</p>

<p>The belief in something makes it real and it self perpetuates itself in groups. You can&#39;t shatter someone&#39;s believe system that easily which makes it also terribly hard to fight this issue individually.</p>
