        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I should explain fully but I&#39;m not really ready. This is the best I can do right now. This is super long as it is and I have shed many painful tears. Please be considerate. Oh and theres strong language and adult themes.</p>

<p>I was accused of heinous crimes on the Facebook platform, then stalked online and off, after what I think was drug-induced interrogation. The horrors I witnessed on the clear net I can never forget, both on fb and on other parts that were jacked to show up. Like the video I recall of a a kid and daughter smoking weed. That was hacked on Madonna&#39;s fb feed. Fuck you Madonna if you&#39;re approving this for kids. And I don&#39;t care if I die. I&#39;m saying it.</p>

<p>Madonna - bitch I&#39;m Madonna (the shit she pulls...)</p>

<p>Let me get you up to speed with what reddit already knows.</p>

<p>My search results were fucked with, badly.
Webcams are hacked, as well as microphones, and we all authorize it. My mother was a hoarder.</p>

<p>I got ads for storage mart.
I would say something, voicing literally, about a topic and then it would come up online.</p>

<p>My router was and probably still is hacked. Removed all services and only when I spoke did the lights flicker. The internet is more than trolls, its interrogation tactics are insane.</p>

<p>I was told details of my house that others shouldn&#39;t know unless they were in my house, like items on my floor (rat poison, which I learned a lot of crazy stuff about thanks to whomever was on the other end of the computer screen.. That alone was psychopathic)</p>

<p>I would do something and the worst possible mirroring of my actions came out from cherry picked news articles. For example I went to my car in my underwear in the middle of the night to get something. Ballet happens twice a week across the street. That was the day &quot;kez&quot; from star trek was reported as exposing herself to kids. I was accused of being a pedophile. That&#39;s not derivation. First I was accused, then this event happened.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg with the help of the government experimented on me, like has been done with so many others. All of social media does this. But it was done to shock and to terrorize me because I threatened to expose tjem for who they really are. A darknet king(or queen. Fuck it I&#39;ll nevermbe as rich as ciccone so what do I care) What other possibility could it be? Or maybe because the government needed someone to long-term interrogate and oppress. Unless the fb platform colluded with informants and so-called golden snitches (Toronto media, see the FBI article on reddit of a schizo 23 yr old arrested that&#39;s topping this subreddit for more details) to commute other&#39;s sentences (the real likely reason that guy was set up to take the fall, just like I was being set up) while foisting blame on me. But of the things I know, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s likely.could be half a dozen reasons and they all are plausible.</p>

<p>I met people that had no reason to get angry at me, and I was already stressed. You did this on purpose. I know you and your people can hijack conversations, I read the news. You zuckerberg incited insanity.</p>

<p>No one asked why I was upset and if I told them, the very thought of 1984 being realized simply made them deny it, which is frustrating. Because you were right Mark... Or csis.. Who would believe me?</p>

<p>I did nothing but care for people and want the best for them. Social media destroyed my life instead of helping it. Mark can blame hackers, but I know he allowed this. People broke terms of service and when I complained, I was told &quot;well you can just block them&quot;... Well Mark, maybe you should just block the Nazi&#39;s and the haters like your service told me I should do when I got spammed porn, and hijacked both feeds and in private message. No mark, I don&#39;t want to see naked 500 lb chicks bending over. No I don&#39;t want to see naked starving Ethiopian crotch. No, I don&#39;t want to see clowns. But maybe you should stop being such a whiner. Right? Stupid f***s is the term you used, right??</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry Mark. Its too late. You can&#39;t blame others for what happens on your platform. You know the filth you&#39;re involved in and you know how badly you wanted to blame my self destruction on myself. But I was innocent. You know Leviticus. You owe me Mark, and government, more than you believe you do. And you owe the world the truth. And now for your overbearing domination and your carrot dangling of illicit behavior, they&#39;re coming for your soul. Or are you part of pizzagate? Oh we all know you are, we all know that your alice in wonderland picturebook says the things that are too horrifying to print. When a celeb post comes up and says she likes pizza.... What does it mean...?? Cheese pizza, child porn, a term I never heard before you came along. And when I saw that picture of a child being face fucked on the clearnet, and smoking weed,  and all of that other stuff? You cant hide forever behind pictures of steganographic pictures of cats. Yes I know about your database. You tried to pay me off with the release data of celebrity posts that would be released at a future date. You made me feel dirty. I didn&#39;t deserve that innocence being taken away. Wikileaks shows how easy it is to hide control of a PC. I scanned my computer and found nothing. Bit wikileaks exonerated me claims. Maybe that bit word wasnt a coincidence. I didn&#39;t need the bitcoin either. You tried to pay me off. (Harper - white lies. Dirty money can&#39;t accept/set you free. Pour it all away!) I can&#39;t take dirty money mark. Governent. I needed real money, in hand. And if it was all part of an investigation into crimes? Fine. But I shouldn&#39;t have been told on your platform that &quot;we dont care what you go to jail for as long as you go to jail.&quot; I wasn&#39;t the dick face fucking a kid. I&#39;m sorry if you have an unsolved case.</p>

<p>Your idea of guaranteed minimum income future is too late, and the chaos you fostered lies on your head alone. Karma&#39;s a bitch Mark. You hurt me and I don&#39;t forgive you, I can&#39;t forgive you, and I&#39;m still debating whether I can forgive my own government. May your family forgive the shame that you will soon see. Oh wait, I forgot. Your family funded every war since napoleon.  I loved you like a brother. I trusted you. Now I no longer know how to love. It&#39;s all just meaningless. So to quote Flagpole Sitta (the paranoia song, remember?... I member...) I got nerves and then they had to commit me. You told them all I was crazy. But I wasn&#39;t. And I never received an apology nor remuneration for the torment you put me through, for the times you tried to evaluate me. This heinous contravention of justice is why I don&#39;t want to be a law abiding citizen any more. Because nobody else does! I got accused of arson! And I had already been in a fire. And the snitch across the street from me starts lighting off firecrackers after ALL of my trauma. But I think what hurts the most, is that I couldn&#39;t even talk to counsellors about it. I had to block it out. It didn&#39;t help that they accused me of unwanted advances. More false allegations! You never quit! And so when thast Muslim man takes a hostage in a salon in Toronto and begs the police to stop hounding him??? I believe him. Because you did it to me. </p>

<p>You ruin lives, and you never make it up to those you hurt. You&#39;re a bad example.</p>

<p>I was...... As Jesus said, I was least of these, in a kingdom of righteousness that I no longer believe in... Well you killed him again Mark. To the extent that you did it to these little ones, you did it to me. So please don&#39;t stop the hate speech. I no longer believe you&#39;re serious. You tried to incite badness and then you stifle free speech.</p>

<p>One last thing. I&#39;ve learned a lot about chemistry lately. Was that youtoo? Because I see the truth of the videos. Theyre threats and instructionals wrapped in innocent seeming videos. Or is that merely a product of your wife&#39;s upbringing? Only you know what I mean. But you know what I mean. So stifle free speech zuckerberg. Its already destroyed Europe, what&#39;s a little more in the region below a middle class shopping all-in-one box store south of a major highway? comfortable quiet burb with a shoppers drug mart within feet of that cozy, quiet little place. Actually, I envy that place; no traffic, beautiful upscale houses.. Too rich for my blood. And family. I think thats what hirts the most is what you did to my home life in yoir dogged pursuit. ...</p>

<p>I felt the evil in my region Mark, and CSIS. That&#39;s why when I heard ariana got bombed and was from Ottawa, I wasn&#39;t surprised. But dont blame me. I&#39;m just another casualty on the steppes. You&#39;ve already stepped on plenty of toes. I&#39;m not the villain, and you hurt me, and I don&#39;t love it. Or maybe you&#39;re a casualty of the wolf pack. What the fuck do I know??? But it doesn&#39;t explain all those &quot;cat&quot; stego pictures now does it??</p>

<p>And I just wish for the damage that was done to be reversed, and for there to be justice. But there is none..... Is there? And I keep hoping, but certainly not praying, that there will be. After what I experienced.... I know God, yhvh, must be dead. Or dead inside... </p>

<p>Thanks for listening to my passionate monologue, my rant. And if you don&#39;t understand it, realize its regional and that others actually will, and do. And I&#39;ll probably will only get a handful of replies and a lot of disbelief... But haters gonna hate, (baby) <em>shudders</em>. That moment was not cool. I can&#39;t even say it.</p>

<p>And before anyone asks.. I don&#39;t need medication, I need everyone to be decent human beings and not the scum of the earth. Religion ruined my life too. I was kicked out without formally being kicked out. They lost their hospitality and accommodating and gentle spirit I once knew. They didnt try to ask &quot;whats wrong?&quot; And once again... Down voted to oblivion. Seems this entire world is designed to stifle. Well, thank you Fritz&#39;s son for the book. I&#39;ll keep your kindness in mind, you know... The kindness you could afford to dole out from community funds, of course.......</p>

<p>One was of swedish house mafia, a woman toiching herself, blurred, with the caption &#39;she needs some attention&quot;</p>

<p>I can show you the article about how so-called hackers take the blame for posting porn on social media to offend Muslims. I was christian. Now I&#39;m nothing. What I need is for people to believe this persecution is real and its not fair. I shouldnt have people posting big black ass getting fucked on my timeline. Don&#39;t you agree?

    <div class="md"><p>This was three years ago and he let that shit go until now. Now that it blows up in his face.</p>

<p>I was let in on Hollywood, given VIP treatment. But I didn&#39;t care about treatment I cared about the shit going wrong. Why... Why was there state troopers deep in Canadian territory and it not be on the news in spring of 2014? Why did I see a bus full of sectist Luddites? Or the woman that abused her kid in a Walmart locked bathroom? Or the woman that liked to step on cockroaches in Costco? Just one. Or the guy that treated his Asian (mail order?) Girlfriend like property? This is not a canada I can be proud of. And I&#39;m not on fb I just got sick of the pseudo caring thast bastard has gotten from the media. He didn&#39;t man that australian asshole from spamming me. Was wikileaks right? Is australian atlassian to blame and nobody gives a shit?? No. Nobody cares. So really in my opinion why should I? Seriously, I&#39;m not even taken seriously enough to get upvotes on this, even though all of this snit has been documented and i&#39;m just collating and compiling it into some semblance of order. Because I shouldn&#39;t have had some barely teen in an elevator alone tell me &quot;I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going&quot; or a blonde kid that starts crying the second I look at her while I&#39;m already pulling out of a parking space and it looks like she&#39;s alone (but she&#39;s not). That breaks my heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck it got deleted. Was accused of starting a fire, then another therapist basically accused me of inappropriateness. Didn&#39;t start a fire didn&#39;t act inappropriate, the fire part was proven an accident. Unprofessional. There was more to this but I dont remember it now. Feeds were fucked up and it kept re-shocking and reoffending me, so I couldnt capture all of them. Its like youre on this street and you witness a murder - you freeze, like... Is this really happening? So this whole banning Nazis thing zuck is doing... Good luck zuck, youre on your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped believing in god when prayers did nothing. If even the representation of god is supposed to be goodness, then god is dead.</p>

<p>I had a Stefano packer a decade ago. I know theyre still used. Theyre. Being used in public forums. That&#39;s why images have bloated file sizes. And I know about video packers. The bitrate lowers and the info is shoved into the stream. Its not just theory. AMD you&#39;d think child porn would be bad enough... But they&#39;re hiding more than cp in those pictures. One guy got caught and his defense was he was following a conspiracy. He was correct. In fact imagine hiding cp inside of a simple high res image. You&#39;d stop there wouldn&#39;t you? But what if its a container within a container? Stego on top of stego? Its happening. State secrets, and more. I know because I did it when I was young to hide porn from my mom. Not cp, just regular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My suggestion is that you just quit all social media, and don&#39;t look back.</p>

<p>Almost six years without fb, or g+, or instagram or snapchat or anything at all, for me. Yeah I still use reddit, but you just have to switch accounts every few months, and it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>You can just throw away your router, your computer, or sell them. Basically, you need to just not participate in the things they are using.</p>

<p>I hope you find peace.</p>
