       I think it mostly has to do with the increasingly conservative voice in conspiracy circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some conspiracies don't have any evidence and rely on faith. Those who are Christian may be more open to them.

       This meme that Christianity commands blind faith has no connection to the Bible or the early church.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity explicitly commands critical thinking about any religious claims that someone makes (1 Thessalonians 5:21), and it encourages each person to critically examine what their leaders are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the corrupted Catholic Church literally burned people at the stake for owning a Bible. They didn't want the real teachings to get out, so they could keep charging indulgences.

       I grew up in an evangelical church in the south and that shit is easily as corrupted and toxic as the Catholic Church.

       Yes, I hear your frustration. I have seen it. Yet, God remains The Most beautiful Most High, worthy of our lives. There are better ones out there than others. And I wonder if we are being challenged to be the change we want to see.  Remain in the vine and know you are not alone, esp He is with us always. Try another church and see if you can find more faithful hearts. Gather a few likeminded and be a church to each other. Frankly, I think this may be happening a lot.  Grace and peace to you.

       Rationalist Pagan, here. Sorry to have proven you wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the name of my conviction is confusing as all hell, I can define it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Rationalist Pagan is somebody who has taken the core ideologies of a favored sect of Paganism and does not see their "deities" as  such, but more of paradigms of being, self, and thought. We embrace both sides of the faith argument. Faith fuels us, Logic and Reason guides us.
      </p>
      <p>
       To us, Magick is nothing more than sciences that have not been discovered to have a repeatable, consistent mode of operation. a standard model of physics that goes beyond physics and yet follows what we know. Metaphysics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any sufficiently advanced understanding, technology, or science might as well be Magick to the common person.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day, the people of Earth will bridge this gap and find a way, a means, to break the veil of shadows keeping us from this lost science, and shit you see in the movies might happen. Won't be in my lifetime, sure as hell ain't gonna be yours. But it's going to happen one day.
      </p>
      <p>
       and when the veil breaks for good and the other side of "reality" as we know it is laid bare for everybody to see, the world is going to change. for good or bad, i do not know, but it is going to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       what many people keep forgetting is that ultimately, all paths are a way to God, whatever you may call it or disavow, we
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       meet our makers one day, and everybody who kept vehemently denying the ultimate truth that our existence is too perfectly chanced, too goldilocks'd, for the human race to be a fucking accident and we ain't alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       mark my words.

       sorry for ranting.

       Show me a faith or religion that is motivated to falsify its own ideas, who celebrates  and  progresses  by being proven wrong ....and then maybe we can start to  equate science with faith.

       Not that I disagree with you in general you paint an idealised picture here which unfortunately is not the reality. Science is also ruled by politics, dogma/careers and economics which it should not.

       I suppose thats true as in any society but also science mostly transcends politics, creed, careers,etc... that is Gravity will  always measure as predicted or squares will always have 4 corners in spacetime regardless of politics creed country

       When a red bull is sacrificed at the Dome of the Rock, Armageddon will begin, apparently. I don't believe it but I'm sure plenty of people do. Religious texts are all very easy to read whatever your belief is into, so I think that helps a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the tendency for conspiracy theorists to find comfort in a general overlying Plan - it's hard to accept that sometimes bad things just happen, so if it's God or the Jews or the Rothschilds or the Aryans hatching some secret plot, it's easier to digest. Nevermind that something like 9/11 would require a huge number of people to pull off and the American government is barely functioning at this point and leaking like a sieve.

       At the end of the rabbit hole if you've searched long enough you get to the real conspiracy, which is of a spiritual nature. I'm sure most books have been infiltrated in some way but there were safeguards in place to avoid that, like scribes and Kings having to replicate the scriptures with exact duplication of the rest of the copies. The bottom line is God is real and this current power structure we have want people to not believe in him, you need to ask why.

       but what god? I tend to lean towards the eastern concept of god. That is, we're god playing a game with itself. The joke is that we try to achieve a higher state of consciousness, when all that will lead to is us getting bored with enlightenment and deciding to play another game where we allow our identity to break away into independent parts the conflict with each other.

       I think there is something real in the power of karma, and reap what you so etc.. there are many things possible but what we're dealing with is a big obstacle as people are not even of the belief of anything bigger than this material existence.

       I don't know. I lean pretty heavily in the direction of objective materialism but I've always had a belief in the the supernatural or spiritual. I just can't believe in the goofy cosmic father figure of Christianity. It doesn't make sense unless you view it as an archetype of a large cosmic consciousness.

       I am god. As are you. We're god looking at each other through the lens of subjectivity. When we die we will revert to the greater consciousness and it will become us once again. We will have this conversation an infinite number of times. Until the end of time.

       Your experience in meditation is valid, but you took it much further into very specific, concrete claims about things like our eternal state, consciousness, and the like. How do you specifically verify each of those claims beyond reasonable doubt?

       I can't. I wasn't trying to. I don't even know if I truly believe it. But it's a cool idea. I come upon it in my dreams all the time. Sinking or floating into different layers of the omniverse. Being different people and living infinite lives.

       Look into some of the shit we do. You have to graspse to something. This is a fuck up world, with utterly evil people. Truly sick, and demonic people. You go down enough rabbit holes, so gravitate towards this. There has to be a higher power, and people revert back to what "they know". Christianity.  It helps at night.
      </p>

       I'm an ex-Roman Catholic, and to this day I still catch myself, before I drift off to bed speaking prayers. I catch myself, because Catholicism, is a problem. But, I'm used to it. Kind of like a nice bowl of chili on a fall/winter evening.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is darkness in the world. And we revert, to what we know and are comfortable with. I'm spiritual, but I till catch myself, and still say a "hail mary". I acknowledge what I'm doing and why, and mainly it's about vibration, and getting away from thoughts....
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion, will always be a huge part of this... Anyways, my two cents...

       I used to be catholic but I haven't said prayers in ages. I stopped when I realized they weren't doing anything. Now I try to create mental constructs. Even if they don't help the external world, they help me in a way.

       Maybe because when you read about some solid conspiracy theory like the one regarding the Rothschilds for instance, and in the end there's some kind of "they are worshipers of Satan, the Anti-Christ is rising bla bla bla" you're left wondering if it isn't all bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO religion is put in the middle of some conspiracy theories to discredit them. I mean, I wouldn't believe a conspiracy theory that cites the Lord of the Rings, same goes for mythologies like Christianity.

       Sure, I just wouldn't be surprised if they do it on purpose to discredit conspiracy theories. It's perfectly possible to discuss something without putting your personal religious beliefs into it, but it seems most conspiracy theorists ignore that.

       Well I didn't mean to generalize, jews are not the problem, zionism is. We've been warned way too many times in history for it to be just a coincidence that this group of people happen to have the most powerful lobby in the congress of the most powerful and imperialistic nation on Earth, and also own Hollywood and a lot of other stuff.

       I think it has to do with the fact that there is a lot of evidence of satanic worship among the elite.  You can think that this is some sort of doctrine to excuse their actions but that assumes a conscience.   The powerful would not partake in this if there was nothing really to it. There is power drawn from the sacrifice of innocence which is the base of these rituals. The purity we are born with has an non quantifiable aspect that has a potential we rarely unlock, evil feeds on the destruction of this innocence. Once Satan becomes more than a boogy man it is easier become open to the idea of God. When you see the world as one under dominion of evil, and love being in direct opposition Christianity can make more sense.

       When conspiracies involve rich powerful child eating secret societies sacrificing people to ancient gods it draws a lot of people who have some religious background to say well that makes sense because you know the devil and all that. Other people who might be skeptical but not hard core atheist or antitheist to say well maybe there might be something to this whole thing after all. Also there are conspiracies like ancient advanced human civilization like the Shakespeare equation or the secrets of the great pyramids that lead others to the conclusion that there is something bigger than us or it's all part of a plan. I come from a Christian background though I am just another heretic lost once Christian so I see all this stuff and see it's all connected, all of it. Everything everyone is doing of their own free will is happening exactly like it was supposed to happen. Prophecy is self fulfilling the path we take to avoid our destiny is the road we often meet it on.

       When countries are set up and religion is the basis for the functionality of that country a party is formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When another frame of thinking comes along after struggles have subsided and they want to change the country in ways to expand to other countries, a different ideal is created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy thinkers want freedom from control.  The starter seeks to control and part of that control is a coordinated attack on religion in order to destabilize any validity left in our current culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overwhelming evidence of this prompts conspiracy thinkers to look at what is being hidden and it ultimately is leading to a new understanding of old religions and ancient civilizations that comes to the conclusion that God has been covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are coming to this conclusion even past their own atheism through their research and discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why it seems like Christianity is behind it.   Christianity is the first religion that hacks the secret mystery schools information and turns it back into a grassroots movement based on finding personal spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus came around and re-corrected the path of Christianity as they tried to evolve it into a controlled hierarchy. He was the first to come to the realizations of this world outside of the secret agenda of Babylon that has alway held the reigns of this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The history leads us all to this discussion. It's not that everyone is a Christian, it's that everyone sees the effort to kill god.

       This is what got me to stop looking into these conspiracy theories. As soon as the words "christ" or "jesus" come out of the person's mouth, I just stop listening. Usually what comes after that is a bunch of repent bull shit, so the illuminati doesn't take you to hell.

       I used to be catholic but I haven't said prayers in ages. I stopped when I realized they weren't doing anything. Now I try to create mental constructs. Even if they don't help the external world, they help me in a way.
