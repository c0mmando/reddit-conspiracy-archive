       How could different races have different abilities for intelligence when they have the exact same brain size, matter, and brain-body size ratio?
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligence is complicated, but it's correlated with an ability to create new synapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       What scientific evidence is there that the gene for race has any bearing on this factor?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simply not possible to remove environmental factors to study this, and until we can, there's no way to state what you have and have any evidence to support it.

       If The Bell Curve (the non-peer reviewed and poorly sourced study and book) solely gave tests and measured the results you'd have a point. The Bell Curve "tested and measured" only Americans, half of the book provides socioeconomic recommendations to government policy makers and they determined that there is a cognitive elite who are our betters. They proposed IQ tests should be used in hiring to get the best workers. All of this based on a theory...

       Based on this study, why have there been so many protests and examples of civil unrest in several of the countries with the highest IQs (South Korea, Italy, Hong Kong)? I don't recall their issues bring anything other than socioeconomic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If IQ tests were really the best employment screens, then the few employers who hire based on IQ would have a big competitive advantage.  They would survive and grow, their flexible competitors would copy them and be able to compete, and their rigid competitors would shrink and fail. That's how markets work. Example: Abercrombie and Fitch require IQ tests (Wonderlick) for their executives, but they are closing stores and projected to go bankrupt.

       You point me towards the most developed parts of the world, as though they are a failure of IQ driven development? They are shining beacons of intelligence. They are descending in Marxism, as it's being instituted all around the world.

        I didn't say they were the best, I said I merely agreed with the idea. I think creativity and intelligence are just two different things, and I think creativity is what's needed in marketing. So, perhaps they should hire a little differently. However, I think all employers should be able to hire whoever they please, for whatever reasons they please.

       I actually think we share a lot of similar ideas and libertarian leanings. I just think there is more to societies than Marxism and IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point in those high IQ nation's, according to the study you sourced, is that they have had civil unrest that existed without a created Marxist conflict. All three are examples of countries who left Marxist ideologies quite a while ago and embraced a more capitalistic view than they historically ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't inteding to say you believe that IQ is the best indicator for hiring or success, it was what was proposed by The Bell Curve's authors. I agree there's more than IQ, like creativity as you stated, but that's been my whole point (more to society and even struggle than just IQ and Marxism).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be interesting to study a nation that was pure capitalism. It's unfortunate that it has never existed, as a study of it would probably confirm one of our assumptions.

       Yes and I believe they manipulate the whole world. I disagree that this is solely driven by Marxist "coups" and I definitely don't think TPTB are Marxists. I see them as greedy plutocrats. I think there are also other factors that develop social classes and conflict than just economics, which is outside of Marx's theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one believes the Bell Curve philosophy of a cognitive elite, with IQ determining success and ultimately social control (this is the premise of the 2nd half of the book), you basically are submitting to the international bankers, 1%, elite, secret societies, TPTB, etc... by saying they are our betters and deserve control. Yuck...
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole argument here is that our world can't be summed up solely by 2 theories. I think it's more complicated than that. If you disagree, I'd love to hear it.

       Can you provide good reading material on that? I know there are some questionable arguments in The Bell Curve, but I haven't really seen any good studies that would refute the idea that ethnic groups have evolved neurological differences over time, which in some cases can cause a difference in intelligence.

       I think the most significant issue is the idea of IQ in the first place. I don't believe that there's an agreed upon definition of intelligence, let alone how to effecticely measure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neurological differences, if they exist racially, can/could be measured via instrumentation and one could potentially map genes to see the passing of that neurological trait. I haven't read about that being conducyed. Even if that did exist, those who believe a genetic trait(s) controls cognition of races, influences their ability to intellectually compete with other races, and to be successful (whatever that means) and dictate our ideas on social welfare (all provided in the bell curve) are being way too simple.

       It's been over 20 years since I had to take any sociology courses, but I see a lot of conflict theory (I believe that is where critical theory branched  I out of) in our shared conspiracies; such as: military-industrial complex, elites exercising control in secret, drug war as you mentioned, etc...

       I agree that a significant tenet of Marxism is to create class conflict when it doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only argument with your overall premise is that there are also class conflicts not created by Marxists or racial IQs. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been French Revolutions, serf/peasant uprisings, vandals sacking Rome, etc...

       It's funny you mention the French Revolution. It was perpetrated by the very same group of people responsible for Marxist theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of Marxism is to distort and pervert capitalism until the point of failure. At which point the proletariat "rise up" (as if a boner), destroy capitalism, and absorb the wealth of the bourgeois, becoming a socialist system, and then ultimately communist. Marxism is an incredibly convenient theory to believe when you're literally the bourgeois, and it allows you to justify both the creation,  use, of negative sciences, which as far as I'm concerned, emerged from the Enlightenment Movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marxism is the science of sowing the seeds of discontent between the classes. What better way to do that than to trumpet racism, and start the Drug War,
       <strong>
        and to do your part as a politician to be greedy
       </strong>
       . Just look at the way the media bait us along, and do everything in their power to divide us. Look at the policies our government institutes and supports which inflame our division. Our system is inherently Marxist, and has been since its inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it could be summed up, it would be: Through chaos, assimilation. Through assimilation, perfect harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
       'They' must make it seem as though the Drug War is merely a capitalist endeavor, but let us examine the very pillars of capitalism:
      </p>
      <p>
       private property, which allows people to own tangible assets such as land and houses and intangible assets such as stocks and bonds;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         self-interest, through which people act in pursuit of their own good, without regard for sociopolitical pressure. Nonetheless, these uncoordinated individuals end up benefiting society as if, in the words of Smith’s 1776 Wealth of Nations, they were guided by an invisible hand;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         competition, through firms’ freedom to enter and exit markets, maximizes social welfare, that is, the joint welfare of both producers and consumers;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a market mechanism that determines prices in a decentralized manner through interactions between buyers and sellers—prices, in return, allocate resources, which naturally seek the highest reward, not only for goods and services but for wages as well;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         freedom to choose with respect to consumption, production, and investment—dissatisfied customers can buy different products, investors can pursue more lucrative ventures, workers can leave their jobs for better pay; and
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         limited role of government, to protect the rights of private citizens and maintain an orderly environment that facilitates proper functioning of markets.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       No where in there does it say to be as greedy as you possibly can. Nor does it say, the point of capitalism is to amass wealth.
       <strong>
        Capitalism is the redistribution of wealth according to your abilities.
       </strong>
       It can only operate under the guidelines it has been given or not been given.

       Come on, man, Do you really think the Drug War had the Greater Good in mind? Yes, then why do they still pursue it in the face of absolutely impossible odds when it's been thoroughly proven to be counterproductive?
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that people experiment with drugs in the first place because they're illegal. The government knew this BEFORE they instituted drug policy. We as humans, are always looking for the forbidden fruit, especially when it makes us feel like we have independence of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portugal decriminalized personal use amounts of ALL drugs in 2001, and they now enjoy a MAJORITY reduction in overall use statistics.

       If you are asking me, my answer is definitely no it has nothing to do with the greater good. The war on drugs, is a perfect example of creating class conflict and a simple method for imprisoning/controlling countercultures.
