      <p>
       In 2013, when Obama passed our defense budget, they snuck in the
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736/text">
        Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what does this do? Well here is the TL;DR
      </p>
      <p>
       It allows materials produced by the Board of Broadcasting Governance and The State Department to be released in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The BBG and State Department used to be one entity, United States Information Agency. What was the purpose of the USIA? Public diplomacy. Sounds good, yeah? Howaboutno.jpg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public diplomacy is the communication with and
       <strong>
        dissemination of propaganda
       </strong>
       to foreign public to establish a dialogue
       <strong>
        designed
       </strong>
       to inform and
       <strong>
        influence.
       </strong>
       (except this is now also allowed within US Borders)
      </p>
      <p>
       This means our news and media outlets are free to spread propaganda in America, which was made illegal after WW2... due to the 'Big Lie'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that do not know, the 'Big Lie' is a propaganda technique used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi's. What is it? Well simple, a Big Ass Lie.... coined by Adolf himself. Look what he did to Germany with the Big Lie and how he rallied everyone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The use of a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."
       </p>
       <p>
        in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.
— Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, vol. I, ch. X
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The principle is sometimes translated and abbreviated as the pithy saying: "Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So where are we at now? Feels &gt; Facts. Astroturfing. Every news outlet blasting us with the same shit till we puke. Don't forget facebook/twitter and the like control their news and the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the media shoved "Trump is a racist fascist xenophobic rapist pedo" for about a month, didn't work to well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media shoved "RUSSIA" down our throats for like 4 months... nothing happened, didn't stick. They tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is now shoving "nazi nazi nazi white nationalist" down our throats.... lets see how long it lasts before it just disappears, like the other two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking for proof about the above always resulted in downvotes, angry responses and hostility.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6ulp2d/fans_outside_barclays_center_protesting_demand/dltvhz2/">
        Check it out
       </a>
       See, I can provide proof of things, why can't anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every outlet just blasts this stuff without actual proof, just twisting words and omitting information. Ala propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just what I remember and still experience, especially on here. Just asking for proof. If it wasn't a lie and it was true, why not put it out there?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Now, this could also tie into other conspiracies as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews run the media/government? If that conspiracy were true, then the story from Hitler about the origin of the Big Lie could also be true, or the Jewish people running the country are taking what Hitler did and using it themselves.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hitler claimed the technique was used by "the Jews" to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist and antisemitic political leader in the Weimar Republic.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So if this is true, this could link many conspiracies into one big ass one.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Oh and if you are wondering how this conspiracy came up, well, look at the blatantly 'blue' media,
       <strong>
        almost
       </strong>
       every news station leans left except fox...
      </p>
      <p>
       So what? Well, the BBG...
      </p>
      <p>
       Current CEO is a pro in broadcasting. Very useful for spreading propaganda.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        he is credited with guiding the company to become a leading developer of unique content across various media platforms including television, digital, mobile and publishing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most recently, Lansing was President and Chief Executive Officer of Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM), a marketing association comprised of 90 of the top U.S. and Canadian cable companies and television programmers. There, Lansing oversaw the development of business strategies and marketing initiatives that position cable television companies for continued growth as they compete with emerging digital content platforms.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The BBG CEO is appointed by the president... as is all 8 members of the board, the 9th is the Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       All 8 members of the board were appointed by Obama in 2013 and 2014, all following the signing of the NDAA which allowed propaganda.

       Karen Kornbluh - Democrat - A senior adviser to Barack Obama from the beginning of his Senate tenure throughout his 2008 presidential campaign, she has been called "Obama's brain". Senior Fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

      <p>
       Jeff Shell - CEO of Universal Pictures, answers to his boss, Steve Burke CEO of Comcast Xfinity.

      <p>
       Michael Kempner -  founder, President, and CEO of MWWPR, a public relations firm headquartered in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Kempner is also known for his political contributions and fundraising for the Democratic Party. Fourth largest PR firm in the country AND scum as fuck -
       <strong>
        In 2012, MWWPR received media attention for a campaign on behalf of Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, a former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division charged with forcible sodomy and sexual misconduct. The firm launched a website with publicly available documents in favor of Sinclair to discredit the prosecutor and accuser. MWWPR nominated itself for a Platinum PR Award in the crisis management category for this work

       John Crocker - Honestly, rather upstanding appointment, life long career diplomat, except one thing... In December 2013, he voiced his opinion that America should quietly work with the Syrian government, despite its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, as a lesser of the evils.

       Dr. Leon Aron - has a B.A. from Moscow State Pedagogical Institute, an M.A in media sociology, and a Ph.D. in political sociology from Columbia University. He left Russia on the late 70's and doesn't like Putin. I mean, I don't either, but we can see how this might be conflicting. Right? His work has been on "Liberal" medias, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy, The Weekly Standard, and CNN......................... but the most
       <strong>
        interesting thing is this
       </strong>
       -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don’t expect a new détente between Russia and the West
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Interesting, he said this July 27th 2016. Lo and behold, our media has been making everything anti-russia and all about russia. What a coincidence. Detente means, by the way, an ease in hostility. Strange how someone on the board of an approved propaganda company
       <strong>
        knows
       </strong>
       there wont be an ease in hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last - Kenneth Weinstein - CEO of Hudson Institute which is a think tank that has a little history in taking money from companies, well one that we know of, Monstano. NBD yeah? Well Hudson Institute was attacking organic farming even though it only accounted for 1% of food sales. Mr. Weinstein dodged a question as to whether the donations to his think tank should be disclosed or not.

       Well, that is what I got, I was really high, this was fun to do and interesting to think about while watching Defenders.

       All of the legislation which OP has linked was introduced by Republicans, voted for by Republicans and (mostly) voted against by Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is time that people stop and think whether they support policies or parties. It looks like a lot of people here are unwilling to acknowledge that this shit legislation came from "their team".

       No it's no the same shit, that's just a lame excuse to explain a sides wrong doing. This isn't the only case either, for instance the Isreal Anti Boycott Law. Check out the Senate and House bill cosigners. Its majority Republicans with a couple democrats.

       Some biased articles like to call it Bi-partisan and there was even an upvoted post here in conspiracy making fun off that Elizabeth Warren coming out against it was a "token effort by the left and not it'll pass". Yeah it's going to pass, but not because of the left.

       The Democrats could vote against it knowing that it would pass anyway. If the Democrats were in power would have been reversed. It's how these things work.

       or
       <em>

       It's pretty clear that there is a divide in the media supporting and opposing Trump and it falls along the same political lines that the media has been on for decades.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you honestly think that anyone can look at the media knowing that it's full of legal propaganda and think that Trump is behind it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That depends which media you are referring to. The conservative media? Of course. The liberal media? Of course not.

       That's complete, obvious bullshit and you know it. OP's article is filled with smearing liberals, and not a single comment about republicans EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THEIR LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even you are only just coming here to defend Republicans which is why you won't even say a thing about the fact that this law was introduced by Republicans and voted for by Republicans. Can you say that this is a Republican law?

       Just one thing - laws are passed in order to retroactively legalize what they are already doing.  It's usually a process that occurs over multiple administrations, ie. a Democrat will legalize what the former Republican did, or vice-versa.  That way, 80% of everyone who votes for one or the other can't complain because their guy either did it or legalized it.

       The worst form of propaganda is to use sockpuppet accounts online to manufacture an opinion as being popular. Face to face it is impossible to have such reach since one person can only really speak with one at a time. But online each propagandist can manage thousands of names, completely fabricate a narrative while it looks like people are having a discussion. This is all too obvious on reddit.

       Still, I think that would raise the effort bar for both humans and bots. If a user kept saying the same or similar thing over and over, you could easily filter him out of the discussion. If the stops shitposting, that's even better.

       Not to mention, signing into law an act that allows the govt. to indefinitely detain Americans without due process. Can you imagine if Trump did this? Mainstream media's heads would explode. Somehow that got glazed over if I remember correctly.

       Yeah, I got sucked into that and ended up serving towards the end of the war and deployed to Iraq. Upon coming back, I woke up to the truth and got out. We were all lied to, but in a way we were all apart of that. America was alot different back then. The consciousness was different. More religious I think.

       No.  I was a very vocal opponent of attacking Iraq, and could not believe the rush to a seeming consensus to attack a country based on obvious lies.  For pointing this out, I was called every name in the book.

       Everyone was not gung ho for the needless war... it only seems that way because there were so few voices of reason who saw what would happen.  I'm sorry not enough was done to keep you and others like you from having to go through that.

       It was my choice so I cannot blame anyone but myself but I wouldnt change it either. It opened my eyes to alot of things in the world, and after the fact I learned how connected we really are vs "us- and them". In the end I came out stronger and a better person but had to endure a ton of karma I made for myself and had to distinguish myself as an individual apart from my past ties in the military. Hopefully with more voices of truth we can expose what is really going on and make a better place for future generations.

       Whenever I read stuff like we see from the OP I always wish they would balance it out. Instead of just providing examples meant to tarnish Democrats, I wish that OP's would balance it out with a few republican examples of media control, stuff like FOX News, and Jeff Bezos with the Washington Post and Amazon, and to be intellectually honest and point out that instead of "hurr durrr Muh Obama did it", that to point out that the bill was introduced and passed by a Republican congress.
      </p>

       I hate seeing all this shit in the sub that panders to one side of The Divided or the other. All these posts do is showcase that the OP needs to evolve out of their intellectually trapped partisan mindset(s).

       They have an agenda. That's why they don't balance it or tell the complete truth. They're pushing an agenda. Their agenda isn't to educate, it's to spread propaganda and misinformation disguised as education.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are: REPUBLICANS created PATRIOT ACT and the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       surveillance state. They are
       <em>
        continually
       </em>
       trying to expand the scope of federal power to arrest w/o trial, spy on citizens and drown you in propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats are signing on to these bills and providing the republicans with support. They're complicit but they're not the ones plunging the knife into your chest.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should BOTH be outlawed. Both these parties have had their chance to pursue the interests of the American people and they've both failed
       <em>
        miserably
       </em>

       This is why it's important to me that people know the truth because both parties are not the same. Republicans are trying to remove your health care. Republicans are removing environmental protection. Republicans are fucking up education. Republicans are taking away net neutrality. Republicans are allowing ISPs to sell your data. Republicans are the ones who allow the bullshit goverment propaganda.

       OP's statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Those that do not know, the 'Big Lie' is a propaganda technique used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi's. What is it? Well simple, a Big Ass Lie.... coined by Adolf himself."
      </p>
      <p>
       That actually was a new phrase applied by Josef Goebbels to Edward Bernay's work in the United States for the American Chamber of Commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Josef Goebbels was a fan/follower of Bernay's work in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernays was Sigmund Freud's nephew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernays dictated American propaganda for over 4 decades from an entire floor of a New York highrise. He wrote the first definitive book on it called Propaganda &amp; renamed it "Public Relations" which was the big start in the United States in the softening of words to describe harsh tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the curious the Adam Curtis documentary called The Century of Self is available in multiple parts via Youtube. It is an eye opener to the uninitiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats how they shutdown the socialist uprising after the Great Depression &amp; that's how they did it this last presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       They clamped down mass media so most people never saw the huge lines of people queued up for miles in the rain, sleet &amp; snow to see Sanders speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Trump copied Sanders stump speech almost verbatim &amp; added the Wall shit to distinguish himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never in history has the mass corporate media allowed a candidate to speak on the air for so many hours week after week.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all to divert attention away from the socialist drawing huge crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people never will know that happened unless they stumbled across the huge crowd videos on Youtube.

       A conspiracy theory that absolves Trump from any personal failings (despite them being numerous and obvious), sweeps any talk of Russia under the rug (despite evidence released and confirmed by the Trump camp itself), and promotes your friendly local neo-nazi group (and then blames Jews for everything in the same breath).

       No.  I was a very vocal opponent of attacking Iraq, and could not believe the rush to a seeming consensus to attack a country based on obvious lies.  For pointing this out, I was called every name in the book.

       Everyone was not gung ho for the needless war... it only seems that way because there were so few voices of reason who saw what would happen.  I'm sorry not enough was done to keep you and others like you from having to go through that.
