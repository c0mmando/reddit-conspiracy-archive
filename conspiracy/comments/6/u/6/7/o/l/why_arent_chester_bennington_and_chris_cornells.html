    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;d like to hear more but you can&#39;t really mention it outside of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t Chester or Chris a founder of an organization for missing or exploited children?</p>

<p>They were also close friends; one being the godparents of the others&#39; kids. </p>

<p>On top of that neither of them gave any sign of suicide; Chris was mid tour iirc and tweeted mere hours before his &#39;intentional&#39; suicide. Chester had 6 young children and also seemed very positive over Twitter.</p>

<p>Their relationship, the timing of their deaths; their pasts (abused as children?) and side work all give some pretty circumstantial evidence they knew something.</p>

<p>I feel the info was passed along and they paid the price. We all know here Hollywood are some dirty fucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of anti-depression medications list suicide as a possible side effect. This is pretty fucked up but also it is warned as a possibility so people can&#39;t sue if someone commits suicide. I honestly think she is right and this wasn&#39;t of his character to do but drugs (prescription and non) can make you feel a lot of things. If anything maybe this should be something we look at drug lobbyist to do more testing and research into what is prescribed to people and not just pushed for money.</p>

<p>I personally suffer from depression but I&#39;m afraid of anything that could lead to suicidal thought or further depression. Addicts are known to especially suspect for the adverse effects of these drugs but when you are rich and famous I would bet doctors would push them on you because they have worked wonders for other patients. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ant speak about chris, but Chester has been plagued with depression and anxiety for years. It wasn&#39;t entirely out of character. Despite the new album/ concerts in the works people point at that and say well it can&#39;t have been suicide then. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works and isn&#39;t evidence. People get make plans and get depressed to the point of suicide all the time unfortunately. It makes it harder to give these people help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;She opened a message from an unfamiliar address. &quot;I&#39;m very happy for you and Chester,&quot; it read. Then, as if to taunt Talinda, there was a link to a Web site run by Chester&#39;s ex-wife, Samantha.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;n April 6, the Benningtons heard from an old friend who had received a similarly cryptic email, this one from the address <a href="mailto:informant_for_u@yahoo.com">informant_for_u@yahoo.com</a>. The friend had dated Talinda years before, and the email he received made all sorts of dark inferences based on that fact. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Friends began emailing Talinda and referring to messages they had received from her — messages that she had never sent. When they forwarded the emails to her, she saw that they came from a Yahoo account she hadn&#39;t used in months.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strange emails from (fan?) sources have been received. They seem to know a lot of information.&quot; Somebody was pretending to be Chester&#39;s current wife to get contact info for his ex.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe his ex? At the very least the stalker wanted it to <em>appear</em> that way, unless his ex really is that fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems really strange that someone would be depressed when they&#39;re at the height of stardom and success with loving families. Chris was on tour. Chester was about to tour and had plans with his bandmates the day of his death. Do suicidal people make plans? It doesn&#39;t fit the profile of a suicidal person. Only parallel that can be drawn is Kurt Cobain and his suicide looked staged af and the suicide note seemed re-fashioned and forged. Honestly, I think all 3 are dead because of money. They were whacked because of how much they&#39;d be worth after their music gets memorialized. Add Jimi Hendrix to the list. The music is worth more after they die, to certain people. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Truly suicidal people might make future plans if only to keep people from asking them too many questions. Drastic or sudden changes are suspicious to friends and family. They might still find pleasure in things like performing or their family, but that pleasure isn&#39;t enough for some people to keep living. Their burden becomes so onerous it outweighs everything else. With some obvious exceptions, most people that are suicidal are in an irrational state of mind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s completely possible their deaths were not suicides and the truth has something to do with money or child trafficking, I&#39;m not trying to kill any conversation. I guess I wanted to emphasize that people who are losing the battle against their personal demons may be looking at the world and their life in a seriously distorted manner.</p>
