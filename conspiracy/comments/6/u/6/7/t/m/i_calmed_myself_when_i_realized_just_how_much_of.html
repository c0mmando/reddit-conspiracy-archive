       Recently I've been a little anxious and trying really hard to focus on my daily tasks. But I was able to calm myself when I realized I was nervous because of the sheer amount of toxicity that is present in society. All the media brainwashing, the people following the MSM like zombies, the toxic in the food, the corrupt politics, almost everything is there to harm us in a way. When I realized that and stopped thinking about it and focusing on my task I was able to regain my focus. My advice is to do the same, keep in mind how TPTB try to harm us but don't let it screw you over focus on what you can do about it!

       I know this is a side issue, but I've found that food digests better and I feel healthier in general when I cook it myself. I don't know what they put in packaged foods but pretty much all of it seems to have chemicals in it.

       I'm slowly learning to be self sufficient with the local fruits and veggies I can grows testing different parts of my yard to see what I can grow. The more we can become self sufficient the healthier and better for we can be!
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an article somewhere talking about a country that is all self sufficient in that someone grow veggies while some grow fruits etc and they would all trade and if I recall the economy was nice.

       Don't take my word for it. But totally agree that anything in stores nowadays is poison!

       its actually pretty funny if you look at the ingredients of some of that stuff, you pick up some macaroni cheese and you'd expect the ingredients list to say, macaroni, cheese and maybe a couple other things.

       What you get is a list of crap as long as your arm with words about 6 syllables long.
      </p>
      <p>
       People bring their kids up on this stuff aswell, everyday eating reheated chemicals. Not to mention heating up stuff in a plastic container which is the quickest way to get crap from plastic to leech into your 'food'.

       Actually a fair amount of it is from chemicals in the packaging that leach into the food over time. BPA / BPB, for example, are present in many packaging products, and leach into fatty foods easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are preservatives (do you really want to eat "sodium benzoate"?), and fillers (the wood shavings you mentioned).

       Agreed.

      <p>
       I used to eat as clean as possible. Fresh veggies grown locally, meat from a butcher nearby, very limited canned or processed food at all. I felt great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now since moving out, I do eat more processed foods and my vegetables/meat come from 'bags' in the frozen section. I can tell a noticeable difference.

       Hit the nail on the head right there.  There's some times when you're like "Wow Zack Snyder, you really made a bit of art right there" and then there are other times when you're like "Holy shit Zack Snyder, you really screwed the pooch there."

       The state of things is very sad.  Distressing.  The country is sincerely ill in many respects and it's hard to see where the light will come from, at times.

       I recently felt the same way, really depressing thinking about what the world has became, then thinking of how little I have done and my shitty future prospects even when I finish university. Everything seems to be horrible, there SJWs who won't shut up and are complaining about everything, and now Nazis are appearing again and the right is becomeing more apparent and violent. The government is watching at all times and Trump is president which by itself is pretty scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I thought about my past and how it is amazing that I even have gotten as far as I have gotten, I made it to university and haven't failed yet, and have freinds, which was discouraged by my family, only thing I don't have is a job which isn't so bad. And no point worrying about trump or the right and left extremists becuase what can I do about them anyways. Government spying, well not much I can do about that but at least there is some ways to become more anonymous.

       The human mind is just beginning to adapt to the " information overload " that the Internet has bestowed upon us just a few years ago, relatively speaking. Over time our intellegence will evolve and as a result the collective conscious will also evolve, as it has for hundreds of thousands of years.

       Agreed. We need to turn it back into a tool of reference and learning. Too many of us Millennials immediately got our phones and used them as propaganda weapons against each other. It's sick and I'm guilty of it. We need to teach the younger generation to be different.

       Well, that's not the scary thing. Pop culture is just harmful to everyone, but it only influences the idiot majority, hence pop culture. But that idiot majority is putty in an engineer's hands. Yet, would you blame the engineer for better or worse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idiots are just idiots and always will be. You can try to wake them up, but it's just grabbing snowballs from an avalanche. And, even if you do wake them up, convert them to "your side" you are left managing a bunch of useful idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this on a smaller scale in business. Go to a business owner, or manager, preferably of a small business. You will find that the biggest complaint they have is trying to micromanage the decisions of their employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, someone hires employee, employee has an issue, employee consults manager/owner whomever, even about small details. Manager/owner supplies answer. This happens over and over and the employee never becomes a competent problem solver of his own, he's basically just a constant customer of the manager/owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that is the key, it's teaching people how to think critically and independently, and THEN teaching them how to use their skills in a way that benefits [something].
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe, and will be called an alt-righter/conservative/republican/neo-nazi/hillbilly for saying this, that the answer lies in the rearing of children, teaching them, allowing them to fail, to try, support them but let them suffer the agony of failure until they figure out how to be powerful and capable adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have is the exact opposite of those things, PARTICULARLY in the left. Let your boys wear tutus, let your children instruct you on how to raise them, involve the state, defer responsibility until it falls in the lap of government. Force others to exist within this nanny state (because everyone knows that pop culture knows better what is good for you, your family, kids, and everyone's education [indoctrination]).
      </p>
      <p>
       And so, what we're left with is a horde within society bereft of reason, soul/spirit, intellect and competence. Eternal children raising children, existing in fear, looking for an authority, but claiming to be anti authority. Meanwhile the structure of tradition erodes, like infrastructure, like tumors on the heart, decaying everything from within as the facade fades lifeless and crumbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are nothing in the face of an able-bodied citizenry armed with competence and knowledge. Unfortunately, today, we shun both.

       It's not true that it only affects the idiot majority. It's force is like the waves, repetitive, incessant and omnipresent. All will be weathered. Some stones erode faster than others but all will succumb.

       The actual/supposed news media lost their effectiveness decades ago trying to use their product to push a narrative. Pop culture for years who presented their opinion in their product are now considered sources of news, opinions are now news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pop culture became the source of news for many because the actual "news" people and companies put out the sos. People want news but not necessarily all the facts or information. Thus the sound byte and celebrity opinion.
