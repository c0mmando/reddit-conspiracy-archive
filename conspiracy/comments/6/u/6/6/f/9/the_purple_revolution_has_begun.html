<p>The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/family-friends-gather-memorial-service-woman-killed-charlottesville/story?id=49225864">Purple Revolution</a> has now begun. The Charlottesville victim&#39;s favorite color is apparently purple, and everyone at her funeral was wearing purple. This has been the suspected US color revolution since Hillary gave her concession speech wearing purple. Purple is the color when you merge the Blue Democrat and Red Republican colors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the past week, the big change that I&#39;ve noticed is that people are just dying to throw away their freedom of speech. IE, up until last week, I knew a handful of people who used the idea of &quot;hate speech&quot; to censor opinions. As of today, nearly everyone I know is embracing the idea wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Obviously, that&#39;s a slippery slope. If people decide that &quot;hate speech&quot; must be censored, that gives enormous power to those who get to define the term. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The psyop is working, then. First you convince people it&#39;s hate speech and not protected by the 1st amendment. Then hate speech gets considered violence even though it&#39;s not physical. Once someone is &quot;violent&quot; just for speaking their mind, people will justify attacking them with physical violence.</p>

<p>This is what Antifa is doing, they&#39;re just trying to push more people to think that way on both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it is that exposure is their worst enemy but they are between a rock and a hard place. They can&#39;t really hide anymore. Btw, Hillary herself was saying that she has no idea how to instill trust between government and people anymore in the 2016 election. Without trust, they are fucked and weakened. In that weakened state, we have white hats rising over them. </p>

<p>Basically they are at a point where they are making Hail Mary passes but damn near anything they do equates to them digging their own grave. Even this August 12 false flag forced a microscope on Soros and Antifa.</p>

<p>I knew the cabal was through in 2016. Once mass exposure happens, it forces them into desperate actions, which exposes them even more. Nobody likes the big bad wolf and exposure/unmasking is why Hillary was reduced to tears in the 2016 election. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s the point. TPTB want a &quot;right wing gun nut&quot; to start shooting &quot;revolutionaries&quot; so that instead of a few hundred extremists, you have a few million moderates taking sides against each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be interested to know what other ppl. think upon watching the full memorial service.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoqhV48Avg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAoqhV48Avg</a>  Every speech seems laden with stories of Heather as a &#39;fighter for justice&#39;, &#39;passionate&#39;, &#39;spirited&#39;, &#39;speaking out against authority&#39;, and someone who &#39;fought against her brother when he had more &#39;privilege&#39; than her&#39;, &#39;someone who fought against hate&#39;.  That was the tone of virtually every speech.</p>

<p>I did not see any tears.  I did not hear what appeared to be authentic memories of childhood from a multifaceted person, but instead a continuous harping on a theme; a virtual banging on a political drum: &quot;she fought against X&#39;. </p>

<p>Please someone tell me where I&#39;m wrong.   I want to be wrong on this one.</p>

<p>So, I am combing through the PBS broadcast of the funeral/memorial service at the moment.</p>

<p>Researching up ANY names that come up.  </p>

<p>First up, Rev. Dr. Alvin Edwards.  I looked him up.  His website comes up as being associated with an organization called Ministering to Ministers.</p>

<p>Now this may be an entirely legit organization, who knows?</p>

<p>However,  one small detail has already caught my attention: The Director of Administration, Catherine Ralcewicz, is listed as working for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Autists?    A little help?   Needs more research.  Please help if you have the time right now.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought of that too. Prince believed when the judgement came the sky would be full of blood, the red mingling with the blue of the sky to make it purple. &#39;The sky was all purple there were people running everywhere&#39; (1999) and of course, Purple Rain. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t overly comforting. Especially not since Prince died not long ago, and they just released a deluxe edition of Purple Rain. 
With songs like The Dance Electric added in. Check the lyrics of that one out. It tells us we&#39;re living in Babylon and that our world is falling... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s already too late and you&#39;re kidding yourself if you don&#39;t already realize it. The new style of warfare on the West and its cultures is to slowly sneak the invasion force in first and then when it reaches critical, the population will snap along divided lines. </p>

<p>You think people from muslim countries care about Western culture? They just want the free stuff that comes with it. You think Africans and Asians care? They are all forming enclaves and sticking to their conservative values while white people turn liberal turncoat and destroy themselves. Some are against it. And both sides will be funded just as before by the elites of this world to create the war they need to profit off of you and me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s to late. Once a nation becomes a minority in itself, the society and economy crash. This has been the case since Rome. America is about to fall. America becomes more and more unsustainable every day. It becomes more culturally divided day by day. This goes for Europe, Canada, Australia and all Western states. They are being passively invaded.</p>

<p>People in the West don;t want war anymore. So the people in charge are bringing the war to them.</p>

<p>Get ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, European multiculturalism did exist. But the US was a unified nationalist country because Europeans shared ties and struggles and religion and values.</p>

<p>Other groups outside Europe are mostly barbarians with old law and are criminally inclined by European standards.</p>

<p>European nations are lowering their standards to indulge other cultures that are not compatible with Western society. The US was a melting pot, a place where everyone conformed to the values of the US. Today it&#39;s turning into what Canada is. Multicultural enclaves with faultlines that will eventually snap.</p>

<p>The globalists want multiculturalism. They fund it. They fund the left against reason. Conservative values are important to all peoples and cultures. That&#39;s why the immigrants incoming are mostly conservative. Only their conservative values are barbaric in many cases and only contribute to the enclaves that make up multiculturalism. And the hatreds every group feels toward the other.</p>

<p>European countries caste out barbarism and moved towards modernism. And they did this while the rest of the world was inbreeding and becoming more and more unintelligent and physically inferior. Europeans tried to be better than this but today they are being forced to intermingle with these old-world barbarians. Most of Africa, the middle-East and S.Asia is inbred and has followed old religious practices of first cousin marriages for 1400+ years and it gets worse with each generation.</p>

<p>How are these people supposed to exist along-side modern, progressive populations? They can&#39;t even adjust to our education systems because they have IQs 15-40 points lower than Europeans. All they bring is birth defects, mental disorders and mental retardation.</p>

<p>And much of the black population comes from long lines of inbreeders even though white people mixed with them, they are still stained. This is why they have been on welfare for over 70 years. Their reparations have been paid in the hundreds of billions and possible into the trillions. This is why they need special programs to integrate. They aren&#39;t capable of building advanced civilizations. They Arabs used them as slaves. And when Muhammad sanctioned inbreeding, the Arabs went too.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how it is possible to sustain a model of multiculturalism. They need to exist in their own communities because they are murdering and raping at an alarming rate and all they know is immediate impulse and they are too easy to maneuver by large think tanks and special interests against the rest of the population.</p>

<p>The globalists want a dumber population with less unity and less voting power. And they are making it happen through immigration and leftist causes.</p>

<p>You are the one playing into the globalists hands. Not I.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was very possible. It wasn&#39;t until WW1 that the European nations were mixed with each other. Hitler tried to reunify the German states. That&#39;s why he chose the targets he did. They isolated and were abusing Germans in Western Czechoslovakia, and Northern Poland. He was simply trying to under Versailles and the new globalist borders that were designed for the specific reason to create tension and a second WW and to end nationalism across Europe. Which was also a goal of communism.</p>

<p>It might be difficult to restore today, but it&#39;s worth a shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t have to go full on &quot;kill darkie&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not. We need to do what America was going to do in the first place. Restore Africans to their homelands. They obviously want to go because they segregate themselves every chance they get. They are asking for their freedom. It would cost less in taxes to pay their way home and give them some startup money than to keep footing the bill for affirmative action.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t respect and appreciate what you have until you build something for yourself. They are crying out for help. They want. They need. Let&#39;s give them something they can appreciate. Let&#39;s give them something to think about. Because if they think their lives in Africa are going to be better than in a nation that freed them from slavery and paid their way for almost a century they got another thing coming.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with this on economic grounds, assuming it&#39;s voluntary. But there&#39;s 150 million minorities in the US. You&#39;re not going to be able to move half the country to Africa. Are you going to try to move Asians back to Asia? Arabs? Iranians? They don&#39;t want to go back.</p>

<p>If you put a program like this in place you&#39;ll change the population from 15% black to 10% black and from 55% white to 60% white. Would you notice if the country was 5% more white?</p>

<p>It took WW2 to move a few million Jews to Palestine (and that didn&#39;t go well). You&#39;re talking about 2 orders of magnitude more than that.</p>

<p>Come up with a logistics plan, then you have an actionable idea. In the meantime, I would focus on loving your neighbor instead of dreaming of deporting them (unless they&#39;re actually illegal, then deport them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The African population of the US is 13%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you going to try to move Asians back to Asia? Arabs? Iranians?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are they knocking down public property and rioting for no reason? If they want to conform to their hosts and leave their baggage in the old world, then they are fine. People who have no interest in evolving and come to the West with the goal of repeating their mistakes don&#39;t deserve the opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you notice if the country was 5% more white?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. I won&#39;t link you to all the stats but the black population of the US is responsible for half of homelessness, 70-90% of murder and they dominate every other single crime state according to the FBI&#39;s website. They also make up a massively disproportional amount of welfare and foodstamp claims.</p>

<p>They are a colossal burden to the working class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It took WW2 to move a few million Jews to Palestine (and that didn&#39;t go well)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It went fine. The Havaara Agreement made it so. They even got to keep their bank accounts and possessions. And the Palestinian jewish population reflects the movement. They celebrated it with a Swastika-Star of David currency. Hitler wasn&#39;t the problem. It was the Soviet Union pushing millions of refugees into Germany and Poland and it was the Allies who refused to take any on a very simple plan. To create chaos in the East so that a war could be achieved under the guise of human rights violations. Even though the camps Hitler set up for them were mini towns with money and activities and contact with the outside as according to the International Red Cross and records kept by IBM.</p>

<p>What was Hitler to do? What the West does now and integrate what were mostly criminals and gypsies and those who would disrupt society? That&#39;s what communism and globalism does. Fascism is a political ideology designed to be accountable to the people. And do what&#39;s best for the people. This shouldn&#39;t be standard. They should be returned. And he had no choice but to house these people.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re referring to the death tolls at the end of the war, then you can look no further than the warmongering of Churchill and the US who destroyed the supply of medicine and food to those camps on purpose through day-and-night bombings of all Germany cities and infrastructure in unnecessary fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would focus on loving your neighbor </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do love my neighbour. My neighbours are white Europeans. I do my best to educate them and make sure they are informed. Any overseas immigrants are only here to feed off of my ancestors hard labour and to set up religious and community centres that don&#39;t welcome white people. They form enclaves when they arrive or join existing ones. These people are a passive invasion force created by globalists who are setting up their side of the chess board. They don&#39;t deserve respect as they could not succeed in their native lands, and they don&#39;t deserve my love as they are not part of my community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmm-hmm ... I&#39;m from former Yugoslavia and we had zero guns available before 1990&#39;s , and it didn&#39;t seem to stop us from raging bloody civil wars for years. </p>

<p>Civil war never starts from some &#39;people&#39; raging with guns. </p>

<p>Even then it was a series of  well orchestrated incidents that served to infuriate people and militarize them against each other. Weapons were distributed accordingly, some people got rich on that. Laughing at us stupid cunts.</p>

<p>Separation and hate was greatly sponsored by &#39;outside factors&#39;. Media was biased. Slowly moving towards division and hate. Peace propagating voices were muffled in the media. In a matter of one year, things escalated beyond reasonable control. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Sadly, things happening in US are looking somewhat like this. </p>

<p>If 3 of 4 major incidents happen , that instigate great divide between people , if you heard someone/party/origanisation is starting to distribute weapons, if it starts to feel so hot that real people start having protests for peace, then you&#39;ll know shit has hit the fan.</p>

<p>Unfortunately</p>

<p>This is the answer. Ignore the provocateurs and don&#39;t allow them to escalate violence. Protest by redpilling your friends and family and strangers on the internet, not by rioting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think they&#39;re going to attempt a coup to get people to show up, if the current divide and conquer doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused by this... The orange revolution in the Ukraine was when the communist party overthrew the authoritarians.</p>

<p>Communists and neo-nazis literally hate each other. Whey would the neo-nazis back a communist revolution?</p>

And that the base is known by us to have strategic geopolitical importance and that denying Russia that base would have massive implications in Russia&#39;s ability to project influence?

Considering we backed the far-right over there and they were making it very uncomfortable for Russians to live in those areas with the laws they were passing. 
McCain, Vicki Nuland, Admiral Pyatt, none of those ringing any bells from that time period?<br/>
So I wouldn&#39;t say Russia &quot;invaded&quot;, I would say the Russians living in those areas simply &quot;stood up&quot;.  But you can call it whatever you want, I really don&#39;t give a fuck.  Another dumbass partisan american who&#39;s education seems to be lacking.  Shocker</p>

<p>Hmm a lot of purple type references as well this past year. Hillary post election, prince death, this week prince got his own Pantone color named after him(its purple for purple rain). Purple is becoming more &#39;pushed&#39; it seems.</p>

<p>My conspiracy/prediction. The next election will have some celeb nominee(zucker? Rock?) and they will run as independent. A new &#39;purple&#39; party. There push will be that both sides have become toxic and they are uniting ideas from both sides. Like the ultimate progressive party. </p>

<p>Makes me wonder if tptb allowing trump to win the presidency and essentially represent the right, and the semmingly self imploding Dems(liberal media/fake news/corruption stories in the news/no core message) wasn&#39;t the plan all along.</p>

<p>See all those identical, orange flags? Someone paid for all those. Click Assange&#39;s tweet linked in OP, someone paid for those Ukrainian neo-Nazis and US neo-Nazis to have tiki torches. Someone is paying to start a Color Revolution in the US.</p>

<p>Purple has been speculated to be the color of the US color revolution. It&#39;s what Hillary wore in her concession speech. It&#39;s the historical color of the elite. And now it&#39;s the color to represent the &quot;punch a Nazi&quot; team, because it was the favorite color of the girl who gut run over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t mean they are funded by the same people. Paramilitary protest tactics are pretty universal and well established. That&#39;s like saying black block are funded by the same people as the arab spring. Of course, they were... but that&#39;s different saying Assange is making that connection here. Not that he hasn&#39;t, just that he didn&#39;t do so publicly. Not that that isn&#39;t specifically what he was implying. just that he didn&#39;t specifically say what you said he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re racists, for sure. I highly doubt most of them want National Socialism and positive relations with the Muslim world, like Hitler. The Vanguard America seem to align more with Italian Mussolini fascism, so maybe they actually have a more nuanced view.</p>

<p>They all suck. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not defending them. What I&#39;m saying is that a few provocateurs found a few useful idiot racists in order to cause violence, and they succeeded. Those provocateurs aren&#39;t actually trying to setup a Nazi government, they want to cause violence so that someone else can &quot;fix the violence&quot; by implementing something else.</p>

<p>Cause a problem, then swoop in with a solution. The media can no longer control the narrative because of social media. So you get a few racists to spark some violence, then you say we need to censor hate speech to avoid violence, people think that sounds logical, now every website removes comments and reddit and Facebook get censored to remove viewpoints they don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Milo Yiannopoulos just shared this on Facebook:
<a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/08/light-skinned-poc-spaces/">https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/08/light-skinned-poc-spaces/</a></p>

<p>With the following comment:
&quot;Do you want to know where it ends? Light-skinned Black people are now on the list of acceptable targets.&quot;</p>

<p>Which really got me thinking about this post. When I was in high school I read a book which thoroughly dealt with issues of race, and I remember very vividly that there was one character - a light-skinned black woman - who was ostracized and discriminated against, treated poorly, because she was a lighter-skinned black woman - even by other black people. There was a sort of view that they were mixed race, white and black together, and this was frowned upon. It created infighting within the black community, and actually seemed to be a kind of racism within a single racial group. I remember reading it and thinking - why does any of this matter. We are all people. </p>

<p>Anyway, that book was Alice Walker&#39;s The Color Purple. And when I think about how the US is today...so mass mind controlled, so media mad, so ignorant of history, so racially divided and in a sort of political correctness neuroses... the Soros/deep state funded fake rallies and protests and clashes. This out of hand organized violence to write headlines and whip people into a frenzy with fake news, largely around issues of race and, now, gender... with mass amounts of sexual abuse happening, child trafficking, organ harvesting... and so many people are denying that stuff, burying their heads in the sand, buying into the dogmas being rammed at them, allowing themselves to be triggered - a mind control term, people. It&#39;s just astonishing. And the fact that it seems to be that the American color revolution is purple, it&#39;s funny that The Color Purple so heavily deals with racial issues, given that&#39;s the very thing being used against the populace to stimulate the purple revolution. </p>
