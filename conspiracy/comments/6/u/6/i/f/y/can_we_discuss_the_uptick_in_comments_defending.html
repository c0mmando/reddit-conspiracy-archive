       Fair warning:  I am a liberal and I am for the statues being removed in Charlottesville and in other places where the citizenry is for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed an uptick in defense of white nationalism in this sub and frankly, it scares me.  We all should know about the role of the internet in radicalizing people into things like ISIS, and I am legitimately concerned that the same thing is happening with the alt right and white nationalism groups.  Antifa is as well, I can't deny that, but I don't see much about 'bash the fash' here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can be done about this?  Is this a legit movement and am I seeing a conspiracy where there isn't one?  If so, why?

       I specifically said that Antifa had their issues too, but that I was asking specifically about white nationalism here because I see white nationalism posts here and not antifa posts.  Do you have more information about the anifa in this sub, as you are a mod?  If so, please share in your own post, Id like to read it.

       How many white nationalist posts have you seen? There's one that I know of today, specifically white pride. I found it to be relatively insightful and carefully worded. There are lots of racial issues floating around. This doesn't necessarily mean everyone's view point is evil, ignorant, or wrong. Our culture patronizes non-whites for no damn reason, creating a double standard when it comes to issues of race. In reality, racial lines have been blurred for a while now and genetics isn't as important as environment. White privilege means nothing to an overweight 16 year old raising a kid by her self in a trailer out in rural West Virginia somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, people should feel free to express themselves. Good ideas float to the top.

       I feel like I've seen quite a bit.  Keep in mind that my concern is with white nationalists infiltrating this sub, and that's why I'm concerned.  I've seen some with the people who are feeling that white history is important to keep in parks, and yet will not feel the same about Black History Month.  I've seen it in those who are dismissing people counter demonstrating against white nationalist ralles and by saying that they all must be shills.  I agree that people must be able to express themselves, hence why I made this post.

       My concern is that you may be jumping to conclusions. I'm not exactly sure what a white nationalist is, but I'm imagining its a very bad person. I haven't seen that much blatant racism on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . This place is much different than /pol/ or voat. That could also have something to do with the moderation.

       Even if there's an influx of racism on here, its only the CIA trying to discredit our propaganda battleground.

       It could definitely be me seeing it because I am a liberal and I feel like I'm pretty well able to see racism.  At least how I view it, from my own self determination of my own biased feelings.  Still, I have concerns over physical_removal having so many people in it, and the discussions on t_d and elsewhere that seem awful judgey about people of different cultures or racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, CIA, if you are paying people to be liberal shills like I've been accused of, I am totally down with being paid.  Just saying.

       Sure. Let me hit you up tomorrow. Take care. Approx how old are you? This will help me see where you are coming from. If you are seeking the truth even when it makes you uncomfortable - then I totally understand. Things have changed dramatically with regard for the 'side' I used to identify with. I can explain.

       I was the same as you and worse - more like these antifa people in my opinions about racists. But I found that zealots accomplish nothing but making matters worse and learned it's better to win people to your cause than push them in a corner. But either way - I am an artist/musician and my first and main concern over every other issue is free speech. The Left as I knew it and identified as being a part of is dead. They've become worse than the Old Right.

       If a guy hadn't driven his fucking car into her she wouldn't be dead. I get that the escalation falls on the protesters and the counter protesters but I am not going to blame anyone for Heyer's death except the person who was directly responsible.

       care to go into more detail with those mental gymnastics? iirc, she was a member of IWW and was marching to justice park (where they were permitted to counter protest). the only mentions i saw on antifa were how they worked together to form a barrier around the clergy.

       I think this subreddit is partially set up and maintained by far right advocates.  I have been called shill before because they did not like what I say.  They want to make the US isolationists and incite racial tensions.  The far right is being used in a major way.  Russia has a strategy that they have employed to do so.  This used to appear as a free thought platform but it is not as much if it really ever was.  Now they will brigade anyone who disagrees and call them shills.  Free thought was lost in the process because they have their leader.

       Here's the shitty thing though.   I had a thought earlier today that a big part of seeing conspiracies involves setting pure rationalism to the side and accepting the idea that if one thing means another, such and such must be true.  It requires creativity in thought, but it also means that a group who are avle to set aside rationality to consider something new might also be the most fertile ground to plant your ideas.

       Fair enough. If you're worried about the state of the world i wouldn't listen to media they cherrypick and exaggerate. Rather go to tour neighbors; see how theyre doing. Get to know your local community and the guy next door. Its kinda crazy how all the Nazi's and racism largely disappear when you unplug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those statues have a place in history even as a warning of what not to become. If we don't listen to history we repeat it. I mean shit my state still celebrates Victory day (ie victory over japan) on the outside it may seem racist like we're celebrating the death of the Japanese but it serves as a memorial of great sacrifice and the horrors of war.

       I live in small town Nebraska, to give context.  My neighbors all voted for Trump.  I have had children show up to my house in actual blackface (as football players) two out of the two years I have lived in my house.  I know many Trump supporters that I like and genuinely respect as human beings.  And I have talked to many of them.  All that I have talked to have expressed regret over the trans ban and are legitimately disgusted by what happened in Charlottesville.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people that I talk to about how I feel that the $15 minimum wage is stupid but that late term abortion is important for medical reasons.  We are able to talk about issues and come to a consensus because, well, we're grown ass adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most of them are sick of being construed as conservative and white nationalist.  They might care about immigration, but they don't care about civil rights statues and they don't like that those people are considered the Right.

       I never said generations don't exist. I pointed out that none of us can trace (with actual documentation rather than word of mouth) our own ancestry back more than a handful of generations. I then pointed out that most people today believe we go back hundreds of generations. There is a blatant disconnect going on, and the logical conclusion is both shocking and yet blatantly obvious.

       Oh yesss, I get a detailed response finally!  Btw, have you heard about the Icelandic familial records?  Or the Scandinavian ones?  They're super old, but they're trustworthy enough, given the fact that people could do record keeping over long winters,  that we've been able to make incredible discoveries over genetic changes to offspring based off of whether their progenitors were born in famine or not.  It's amazing shit.

       What on earth are you talking about? Do you know the difference between primary source evidence and secondary/tertiary sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary sources go back a couple hundred years, tops. Most people don't know what these terms/concepts mean, but those who do, their pupils will be dilating right now. The conclusion is obvious.

       I was a history major and by no means was trying to attack you but instead wanted you to expand on what your view point was but yeah, I know the difference between primary and secondary.  I mentioned Iceland to ask what you though of it, I'm guessing you feel that it's bs?

       I have not seen any primary source evidence from Iceland that goes back more than a couple hundred years. If you can refute this, please do, you will be helping me. But please do not give me secondary or tertiary sources, which are of no more use in ascertaining

       Because it's stupid? As is your logic. Just like how the "citizenry" was
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       slavery. Just because the majority wants it, doesn't mean it's right. But even in this case, a dozen thugs tearing down statues doesn't represent the majority. I guarantee you a majority of Charlottesville citizens would not be in favor of tearing history down.

       Because he is for the statues being taken down despite no evidence showing that the citizenry wants it. He is clearly for the Charlottesville and Baltimore statues being taken down, even though a majority doesn't want them taken down. And sorry I'm kind of tipsy

       She, actually.  And I'm tipsy as well, to be honest.   The reason I said 'if the citizenry wants it' refers to the democratic republic we have in which we vote people in.  And when those people vote to remove something, I take that as the citizenry making their voices heard.  Though there are times in which the vote doesn't work, such as with issues with electoral fuckery, there's still a general hope I have in the system that the people's voices are heard.

       Fair enough. If a majority wants them removed, go for it. Although I wish they would be preserved in a museum, not stomped on. But if you want to get a few kicks in to take out your anger, go for it. My question is where was all of this anger years ago, before Soros made this a mainstream topic. Why now? Can't people see that this is all orchestrated.

       The anger was there, it was just simmering.  Thirteen years ago, I was a bi teenager getting the shit kicked out of her for having a girlfriend.  The hate was there but so was a lot of understanding and people telling me to wait because it would get better.  So I waited.  And it did get better.  And as an adult, I'm able to speak up for the scared kid that I was and to try and make life better for kids that feel as weird and shitty as she did.

       There is a point, yeah.  And we have to come to terms with it.  I think we can, as a nation, find a point.  In one hundred years, people may have an issue with Jefferson especially.  I guess I'm an optimist and that I have faith that we'll deal with it when we come to it, as a whole.  Which is why it is crucial that we ensure that the electoral college is kept fair.

       The use of hypotheticals is a valid form of argument, but I guess I'll spell it out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confederate monuments glorify a nation that was created with the primary purpose of preserving the enslavement of blacks.  Most of these monuments were erected during a time of racial oppression, and served as a message to blacks that those in power were hostile to them.  Their continued existence emboldens white supremacists, who take them as evidence that their views are widespread and hence justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the hypothetical of a Hitler monument in Germany, because the existence of such a thing, even to the dumbest individual, would obviously be seen as a message to Jews that they are second-class citizens.  Nazi Germany is a symbol of the oppression of Jews.  The Confederacy is a symbol of the oppression of blacks.

       Many blacks will feel more accepted and empowered.  White supremacy will be repudiated and white supremacists will see that their views are unpopular.  There will be fewer symbols for white supremacists to rally around.

       History books that don't mention the suffering of the slaves that suffered under and were owned by traitors are not given when one goes to the statue.  Hence why they are being moved to museums where the context can be expanded and more history is made easily available!  Great, right?!

       Nope, why is it "wrong" in the eyes of some when whites look out for their best interests, yet it's a great thing when other races do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Black lives matter has called for a number of segregated areas, and not a peep was heard. If whites do it, "omg!!! Evil Nazis!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with whites advocating policies they feel is in their best interest, especially when other races do it as well without an ounce of condemnation.

       To me, Nationalists are those who are tied to a nation in particular and in their group having control of it and being the only ones in it.  So Black, White, Yellow, whatever nationalists are bad.  My grandpa didn't like my now husband because he was Czech and my Grandpa still has nationalistic beliefs that immigrants aren't welcome.

       I consider myself a nationalist (I also happen to be white but don't consider it important to my identity) and disagree with this. It's not entirely wrong in that I believe only citizens (you could consider that my "group," but I believe you were implying something more racial) should have control of their countries but I don't want to end immigration. The immigration policy should be one that benefits the citizens that are here, by taking immigrants with skills in critical locations who can do things the current citizens can't meet the demand of.

       If you're a citizen, you're an equal. If you're a tourist, you're a guest. If you're living here illegally, you have to go back.

       My issue with nationalism in terms of immigration is that it is very, very hard for people to approve people in a way that is truly unbiased, given our natural proclivities to classism and racism.  Humans are shit at not letting those biases slip into our daily lives, we just are.  So with immigration... how do we judge?  We have to take a hard look into our biases when we do so.  We also need to have expanded green card programs so people can come here to work more easily and go back home.  if we tighten up on this like we are, we're just pretending like people don't stay beyond their green card and we penalize those people who can't go hope but cant stay here by not allowing them to report crimes out of fear of being illegal.  I'm a liberal, dude.  But I also have rational feelings about immigration.

       I'm interested in continuing this conversation, if you are. The interpretation I have of what you believe would lead to more overall happiness:pain (my personal goal) for a couple generations, but would have a greater pain:happiness ratio after that.

       Sure, why not?  To pick up on your post before, my big issue with the points thing is that it seems deeply classist.  It favors professionals with money and specifically, the money to have and keep documentation.  My ancestors came to this country with nothing.  It seems fair to allow the same for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your question here.  My big problem with it is that in a perfect world where the outcome is guaranteed, I'd absolutely pick pain for some then happiness for everyone else.  But, and this is a pretty big but, in the real world, the outcome is never guaranteed.  It's like how I feel about the death penalty.  If we could know 100% that every person put to death was guilty and that they had been tried completely fairly, I would consider the ability for our government to put people to death.  But we can't know for sure if someone is actually guilty and has been tried fairly.  As such, I'd way rather have life imprisonment with a chance of being cleared than the more permanent 'solution' of death.

       Yes it is classist but I don't believe that's inherently a bad thing. Until you could elaborate on the effects on the citizens of the country this argument means nothing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your second point, are you comparing the death penalty to any policy a country can take that is supposed to prioritize the long-term over the short term?

       Someone brought the Hebrew Israelites to my attention earlier, who are basically a hate group against whites and Jews. They make up 0.06% of the US population. Significantly more... but still almost nothing.

       It's not like there's just Nazis running willy nilly all over the country. I've seen more denouncing of racism in the last couple days than ever before... or as one redditor (whose post I can't find at the moment) put it: "I'm more afraid of being a labeled a nazi than I am of actually ever meeting a nazi."

       People who refer to themselves as the KKK are few.  Which is good.  However, I'm not as concerned by those who call themselves KKK as those who parrot their beliefs without realizing what they are saying or that its even racist.  Its like how there are very few pure communists because it's hard to be a full on communist, but the ideas of communism are dispersed through society.

       What do you think about the ties between culture and race?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would admit that all cultures are different for myriad of ways, aesthetics being architecture, fashion etc, religion, politics, customs, interactions, greetings, how we think about gender, and also thousands of years of biologically divergent evolution because of different climates etc. I think that culture on a global scale is divisible at its smallest by nations, and then by continents. Peoples who share the same continents or at least large areas of several countries have similar characteristics. One of the most similar characteristics is race--Africa majority black, asia majority yellow, europe majority white and the americas more of a mix now because of colonisation. And every region has it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is do you think race has an effect on how we have created culture?

       Likewise, bruh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ties between culture and race are incredibly fucking complex, especially in the US.  We have such an integrated culture, like it or not, that we all have to accept things from other cultures in our lives.  For instance, my city in Nebraska has a large Vietnamese community imbedded in to our city that a ton of people here have eaten pho but have never tried Laotian or Cambodian cuisine.  We've eaten Southeast Asian food, but only of a certain culture.  We have a narrow viewpoint of Southeast Asia, and it's from what contact we've had.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Vietnamese restaurants and stores here are still called the 'Chinese' stores.  That's because those stores are Asian and the signs have asiatic language on them so those of us not used to the difference assume that they're the most common kind of asian person in our mind, aka Chinese.  We assume that because of the color of their skin and their look, and make assumptions based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not an issue lone to my city.  It's an issue with people.  We're great at judging those who 'are different' but we're terrible at seeing how we treat those people differently.  It's a person thing and that's why it's important to recognize those biases and work through them.

       People have forgotten the fundamental truths of modern society. It's not OK to erase the past, we must confront it blemishes and all. We also decided that civilised countries let abhorrent people express their views without the threat of violence. The rally that happened in Charlottesville has been massively magnified by an adversarial media that wants us to forget these pillars of civilisation and attack each other. Don't fall for it!

       My problem is that I can't say anything defending free speech without being labeled a Nazi sympathizer. Whatever happened to "I don't agree with what they say, but I'll defend their rights to say it"? I'm more worried about them using this to further restrict free speech.

       My take on it is when it's explicit. Saying that you would like to see someone dead is not the same thing as asking for the murder. Also it's why we have courts with judges. When a mob gets out of hand there's a trial later and people who have calm heads can decide if the line was crossed.

       Alright.  One of the things that I'm struggling with is with the 'Blood and Soil' issue and also with white nationalists standing outside of a synagogue and specifically yelling to people with swastika flags, 'That's a synagogue'.  To me, that does seem like incitement towards hate.  What are your thoughts on that?

       Yelling at a church is harmless. Throwing things at it or other overt acts is another matter. To me anyone standing in the street yelling at a building is the idiot. But then again what did Luther do? He nailed his manifesto to the church door and started a religious revolution. Contrary opinions need to be allowed. Otherwise they turn to bombs and fires.

       That makes sense, but it all comes to a point.  If some feels physically endangered, that's when shit crosses over to being incitement.  Of course, it has to cross over to a lot of people to really count, not just one or two.

       No. It is not defined by how you feel. I cannot control the feelings of others. Incitement is persuading others to do physical harm to others.

       Speech just has to be speech, but I see where you're going. Anyone obviously angry and holding a shitty flag and chanting racist stuff and maybe a weapon or two is very scary, and a large group of people protesting with their faces covered holding baseball bats is also scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they're violating laws though if their not calling for a direct crime to be committed, or harming a person or property.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do however, think that for the police force to stand down and allow the two groups to clash, is very wrong. So, illegal, no? High potentiality to be illegal? Yes.

       It's the "every action has an equal and opposite reaction" rule.   If the left would have stayed home no one would know or care about these fucknuts protesting tearing down a statue.  But instead they catapaulted this into the limelight, and i hate to say it but most people are going to secretly side with anyone but these sandy-vagina liberal pussies.

      <p>
       ISIS likes to take down statues too. They shouldn't be taken down. At first people start with the controversial figures because those come down easy. Then their opposition targets other statues (like the right targetting the lenin (or is it stalin?) Statue in Washington. Then you have someone defacing the Lincoln Monument in dc.

       Once you start that snowball rolling it becomes a tit for tat.

       Because I am a Nazi, most of us here are Nazis, Reddit was founded by Aaron
Schwartz who was a card carrying Nazi and we have been here on the Internet for
decades, plotting our Master Plan for the Rise of the 4th Reich in Weimerica!

       We massively outnumber you, we have more guns that all of you combined, both
the Military and the Police are loyal to us and not you, and you don't even
realize our Vast Right Wing Nazi Conspiracy exists because it only became safe
for us to reveal ourselves after our recent Beer Hall Putsch Victory in
Charlottesville. Very soon the Stars Will Be Right and the way will be prepared
for the 12th Imam, the Madhi Hitler2, to unveil himself before the World.

       Because it's stupid? As is your logic. Just like how the "citizenry" was
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       slavery. Just because the majority wants it, doesn't mean it's right. But even in this case, a dozen thugs tearing down statues doesn't represent the majority. I guarantee you a majority of Charlottesville citizens would not be in favor of tearing history down.

       When did the ACLU say that?
       <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-statement-charlottesville-violence-and-demonstrations">
        This is the only official statement I've seen from them on this matter

       and it doesn't say the ACLU agrees with Trump on both sides causing violence. I'm also looking at more recent news stories and can't find anything along what you're pointing out.

       id like to see a nation wide census, obviously anonymous (so people dont vote out of fear of being shamed), on whether to take down the statues or not. Then we'll know if the citizenry is for it.
