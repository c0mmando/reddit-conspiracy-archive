    <div class="md"><p>I mean, like I wrote elsewhere in this thread, he&#39;s very powerful; he&#39;s a billionaire who seeks to exert his influence politically. That makes him powerful. I appreciate his donations to the marijuana legalization movement, about $4 million a year. </p>

<p>I think the truth is no one should have that kind of influence. The funny thing about this bizarre Soros conspiracy obsession is that Soros is very much an open book. He&#39;s written books about his ideas, and he&#39;s very public about what he does. It&#39;s easy to learn about him; punch his name into YouTube or google. I don&#39;t like him besides his support for weed legalization, but I think he&#39;s better than some of the billionaires, such as the Koch brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, the answer is no, no such evidence exists; Alex Jones has popularized this bullshit by repeating it a lot and knowing his audience doesn&#39;t look anything up. George Soros isn&#39;t funding mass protests all over the place. Soros *does give a lot of money to marijuana legalization, about $4 million a year. That I like about him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a political centrist who supports Democrats but doesn&#39;t like Bernie Sanders-type progressives (such as me). Soros is a billionaire and I totally agree with Sanders on this: No one should have the power that billionaires do. And Soros is one of the ones who tries to wield that power, for sure. He&#39;s a big player in the world, no doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up the role of the Open Society Foundation. This Soros-created think tank funds propaganda against a country&#39;s government, which is then used to create instability required to overthrow its leader. This overthrow is done in tandem with military grounds and world leaders, often who are close to Soros. Dig deep into color revolutions and the blueprint becomes clear. </p>

<p>Once the overthrow is complete, Soros profits spectacularly because he places many financial bets banking on the coup. </p>

<p>As for him being a grand puppet master of the leftist agenda, hell, look at the plan he and Podesta worked out in the Wikileaks drop. Soros gives his thinktank &quot;Center for American Progress&quot; a metric ton of cash to &quot;promote a progressive agenda&quot; which really trickles down into things like Antifa, BLM, and SEIU-backed activities. It&#39;s a complex spider web of many nonprofits that all work hand-in-hand. So, just because you pull up one controversial nonprofit and Soros&#39; face isn&#39;t on the board of directors, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not involved--it&#39;s like a corporation with many subsidiaries. The people at the top always have a few layers between themselves for plausible deniability, but in the end it&#39;s their doing. This to me is evident based on Soros&#39;s overseas activities which are a little more blatant. After all, Soros only gets a financial payout when the govt&#39;s overthrown. </p>

I can tell you that the <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/European_Atlantic_Group">European Atlantic Group</a> is one such organization that sits around and plots to take over the world. But there are so many groups, all working in lockstep. Honestly, a big problem is that evil looks pretty boring. No different than a board of directors planning next quarter&#39;s market share and profit. Only a handful of people have to do the dirty work day in, day out, and that&#39;s the hardened criminals to which they outsource. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think the Koch brothers or Gates are comparable to Soros, you&#39;re a moron incapable of critical thought. </p>

<p>He&#39;s an international opportunist, banking on the faults and falls of political factions and nations, insidiously funding groups forcing bad ideology irrespective of the national ethos, ethics, laws, and well-being of nations. In short, he is attempting to self-imposed his ideology upon nations with no concern for how it could affect them. Of course, it doesn&#39;t matter if your pushing destructive political beliefs that are veiled as progressive movements, especially when you are shorting markets, betting against nations you are harming, like when he &quot;broke the bank of England&quot;. </p>

<p>An example of the destructive ideology he&#39;s funding groups to perpetuate is the hastening of immigration despite the lack of assimilation, which creates rape epidemics, oppressive impositions, bigotry, terrorist attacks, internal blowback, and the general erosion of a nation. This is so evident in Europe that you&#39;d have to be blind not to see it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you mentioned Gates. He&#39;s no saint but even he has recognized this problem and that Europe could collapse because of it. The pushing of unhinged immigration is only the start, though. He pushes all kinds of insidious things and this is known and accepted, it is no secret. There might not always be direct evidence, but there&#39;s a reason Hungary, Russia, and Israel condemns him, a reason he&#39;s hated in America and other nations. </p>

<p>You know how Hillary Clinton got involved in Haiti under the guise of helping them recover, when all she really did is help her buddies get lucrative contracts? Taking advantage of that disaster is pretty evil. Well, Soros isn&#39;t merely taking advantage of disasters, he&#39;s trying to create them. </p>

<p>Read his books and look into him further. Look at who does and doesn&#39;t support him. You&#39;d have to be blind not to realize he really is as bad as he&#39;s made out to be. Of course, not everything said about him is true, but overall, people are right to distrust him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You <em>do</em> realize how George Soros makes his money, right?</p>

<p>He destabilizes nations and then bets against their currency. He made a billion dollars in a day betting against the British pound years ago.</p>

<p>But George got wise after that. Instead of <em>guessing</em> that a nation might go through trouble and shorting their currency, you can <em>make</em> them undergo turbulence . . . in which case you make your own success.</p>

<p>Soros has been tied in to the CIA, where he partners up to destabilize nations they want to take down. He infiltrates them with his NGO&#39;s and starts to sow the seeds of discord. After which . . . chaos, collapse. In the case of his &quot;color revolutions,&quot; political upheaval.</p>

<p>The dude does this for a living.</p>

<p>He follows a very well-documented gameplan in each country in which he operates.</p>

<p>And guess what? Racial and ethnic division is one of his tactics.</p>

<p>Which is why he funded and created Black Lives Matters and paid fake agitators a salary to masquerade as &quot;morally-motivated activists&quot;.</p>

<p>The riots in Ferguson were synthetic.</p>

<p>Just as all George Soros events are. He literally buses actors in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why he&#39;s banned from a dozen countries and there are standing arrest orders for him in places like Russia, Hungary, Israel, etc.</p>

<p>Unless . . . as you&#39;re suggesting . . .</p>

<p>George got a bad rap.</p>

<p>And people are against him for no reason.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just misunderstood, is he?</p>

<p>Just a random, caring billionaire (like any other billionaire)?</p>

<p>Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p>But don&#39;t fret. You provide the occasion for much amusement. This thread has never had such an open George Soros apologist before.</p>

<p>You totally don&#39;t seem like a shill at all!</p>

<p>(Seriously!)</p>

<p>Posters on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are all typically just like you: George Soros-lovers. We make excuses for Stalin, Pol Pot.</p>

<p>Just all sweet, misunderstood guys.</p>

<p>To quote you: &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot;</p>

<p>(You seem so reasonable. So levelheaded and adult.)</p>

<p>We are chastened. Believe us!</p>

<p>We&#39;ll never question the motives of the guy who makes his money off of collapsing currencies again.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just like (what did you say?) any other billionaire.</p>

<p>(Poor, misunderstood guy!)</p>

<p><strong>George (Shwartz) Soros</strong> <strong>AKA Chancellor Palpatine</strong></p>

<p><strong>Born</strong>: August 12, 1930 (age 86), Budapest, Hungary</p>

<p><strong>Net worth</strong>: 24.9 billion USD (2016) Forbes</p>

<p><strong>Spouse</strong>: Tamiko Bolton (m. 2013), Susan Weber Soros (m. 1983–2005), Annaliese Witschak (m. 1960–1983)</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong>: Alexander Soros, Jonathan Soros, Andrea Soros, Robert Soros, Gregory Soros</p>

<p><strong>Organizations founded</strong>: Open Society Foundations and More</p>

<p><sup>The above information is easily available through Wikipedia.</sup></p>

<hr/>

<p>George Soros is literally on of the <em>worst human beings to ever live. EVER</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>George Soros turns in HIS OWN MOTHER AND FATHER to the Nazis</strong></p>

<p>Hungary, 1944...</p>

<p>George Shwartz, his real last name, was born during the year 1930. He started his life right before the Nazi occupation of Hungary. </p>

<p>George’s father, Theodore, attempted to change his families last name in order to avoid complications with Nazi Germany but ultimately, it was too late. By the time Theodore tried to change his families last name, the Nazis invaded.</p>

<p>In order to survive, George collaborated with the Nazis. </p>

<p>George first worked for the Judenrat. The Judenrat was a council set up by the Nazis. Their main job was to delegate Jewish volunteers to give up the position of Jewish refugees so the Nazis could round up any escapees. <em>This</em> is what George Soros did.</p>

<p>George helped confiscate property from Jewish refugees. Among the Jewish refugees that he turned in and were found was his father. He assisted his mother in committing suicide during the Nazi occupation and commended her for joining the &quot;Hemlock Society&quot;.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>In Tivadar Soros memoir titled Masquerade, he writes his memories of escaping from the Nazis who were looking for refugees. The Nazis had been tipped off to hundreds of locations of refugees by Judenrat and George Soros, who was aware of what his father was doing and his location and movement. George, on many accounts, admitted to what he had done - giving away positions that is. Tivadar Soros narrowly escapes a Nazi group searching for Jews which the Judenrat tipped them off about, which George Soros was a member of. </p>

<p><sup>The above information can be found from the <em>20 December 1998 broadcast of 60 Minutes</em></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemlock_Society">1. Hemlock Society</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Open Society Foundation</strong></p>

<p>George is the lead operator of the OSF. The OSF, or Open Society Foundations, financially support civil society groups around the world, with a stated aim of advancing justice, education, public health and independent media<sup>1,2</sup>.</p>

<p>As you all know, the BLM group is a &quot;civil&quot; group aimed at advancing &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;independent media&quot;, etc. The OSF <strong>funds organizations like BLM which have the characteristics of a terrorist organization</strong>. OSF is dangerous and has funded many other rebellious groups. Rebellious not for good, but to cause harm and trouble. </p>

<p>EVERY SINGLE ORGANIZATION backed by OSF is a liberal/leftist/progressive/democratic organization. </p>

<p>George Soros and the Open Society Foundation back a group called <strong>American Friends Service Committee</strong>. Sounds like a good organization, right? <strong>WRONG</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The American Friends Service Committee views the United States as the principal cause of human suffering around the world. As such, it favors America&#39;s unilateral disarmament, the dissolution of American borders, amnesty for illegal aliens, the abolition of the death penalty, and the repeal of the Patriot Act.</strong><sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Seriously George Soros? And seriously Obama? How could you even associate yourself with this man?! YOU&#39;RE THE PRESIDENT AND YOU ACCEPT THE BACKING FROM A MAN WHO VIEWS AMERICA AS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF SUFFERING AROUND THE WORLD? DISGUSTING. </p>

<p>Another <strong>very interesting</strong> tidbit of information is, the OSF funds an organization called &quot;Color of Change&quot;. Who are they? Color of Change is a progressive nonprofit civil rights advocacy organization in the United States. It was formed in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in order to use online resources to strengthen the political voice of African Americans.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Color of Change is an outspoken supporter of the BLM....</p>

<hr/>

<p>BLM &lt;-- Colors of Change &lt;-- OSF &lt;--- SOROS</p>

<p>Why do I mention all of this?</p>

<p><strong>BECAUSE GEORGE SOROS STRATEGICALLY COLLAPSES ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO MOVE IN AND REBUILD/TAKE THEM OVER.</strong></p>

<p>Soros was <em>DIRECTLY</em> involved with the economic collapse of the Thailand and Malaysia collapse in the 1997, as well as The &quot;Revolution of Roses&quot; (often translated into English as The Rose Revolution) in Georgian. This was a change of power in Georgia during November 2003. Lastly, September 16, 1992, Black Wednesday, Soros&#39;s fund sold short more than US$10 billion worth of pounds, profiting from the Bank of England&#39;s collapse. </p>

<p>These are only 4 examples of how he collapsed economies and this is what is attempting to do to ours, using both economic strategies and social strategies such as the BLM movement. </p>

<p>Take Obamacare for example. It is currently aiding in the collapse of the U.S Economy<sup>1</sup>. This is proven with statistics, numbers and analytics. If you don&#39;t believe it, there are <strong>hundreds</strong> of articles on Google that will show you. Want to know the kicker? <strong>George Soros &quot;...HELPED WRITE OBAMACARE&quot;</strong><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s behind all of these terrible economic choices and acts put into place by the current Democratic Party.</p>

<hr/></li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, which I don&#39;t know if any of you know, according to his 13-F report to the SEC, George Soros <strong>owns 341,000 shares of Facebook</strong><sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>You tell me why he would own that many shares. I mean, it isn&#39;t like he sponsors terrorist groups, socialist and democratic views and aligns himself with censoring, but I don&#39;t need to go on...</p>

<p>People, this is a dangerous man attempting to take down America!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post I responded to says: &quot;George helped confiscate property from Jewish refugees. Among the Jewish refugees that he turned in and were found was his father. He assisted his mother in committing suicide during the Nazi occupation and commended her for joining the &#39;Hemlock Society&#39;.1&quot;<br/>
The Hemlock Society is an organization, founding in 1980, that promotes the right to assisted suicide. I&#39;m confused how she could have died in the Nazi Occupation and be a member of an organization founded nearly 40 years later.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong Soros has an immoral cutthroat business history and his claim to fame is screwing over the English tax payers to land him a huge pay day. But the claims that get thrown are mostly nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty.  It began by tethering himself to the Nazi regime during the war.  This was the elite that avoided Nuremberg.  Then he was funded to begin the Quantum Fund and he fucked countries all over the world by manipulating their currency.  This, in turn, funded his bullshit projects through the Open Society.  Have a look at Ukraine, Hungary, etc. There is an outstanding warrant for his arrest in France, and his programs have been banned from Hungary, Russia, and calls to ban in like 10 other countries.  There are leaked emails that share much more.  </p>

<p>In my country he throws millions of dollars (tru the Ford and Open Society foundations) on NGOs related to this. For example, the Insituto de Tecnologia e Sociedade, that was a main player in the project of controlling and censorship of the internet in Brazil, the Midia Ninja (alternative media site with pro-riot narrative) and a lot of other social movements that intend to &quot;change the society&quot;.</p>

<p>He is really one of the puppet masters responsible for this shit show that became our world.</p>
