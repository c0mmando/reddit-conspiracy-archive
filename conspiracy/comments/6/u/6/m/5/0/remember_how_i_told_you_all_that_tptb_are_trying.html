<p>We used to be simply known as those &quot;weirdos&quot; who think the government is out to get us. Now people are associating us with the nazis and white supremacists. </p>

<p>This racism thing is being used to tarnish anti-state types by association. You bet your ass they can, will, and have staged events and protests to build this up.</p>

<p>Also, the shills on here will pose as rednecks and white supremacists defending trump and the protests, to give the illusion that we are all racist idiots. That ties in with the anti Jewish rhetoric commonly seen on this sub, and the outsiders view us as &quot;bad guys&quot;.</p>

<p>What can we do to help our image? Because we are NOT racist people lmao..</p>

<p>This is a joke. The New World Order is trying to stir up as much tension as they can  between us. Don&#39;t fall for it. Everyone I encounter, seems to be jolly as hell. Holding the door open for people, saying please and thank you. You look out your window and shit...everything is fine ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>Remember, before the elite pull the rug out from underneath us, The NWO will need to first get us fighting with each other. Pit us against each other over minuscule issues of race and religion. </p>

<p>This way, we won&#39;t be able to FOCUS on the TRUE cause of our misfortune; The elite who have stolen our destiny from us.</p>

<p>Corporations and money took over folks. It&#39;s all an artificial habitat we live in. </p>

<p>Let this shit just slide past you and keep your focus.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re on Facebook, and your timeline is drowned in stupid racist bickering rhetoric, be a man and step in. Raise your statement, let people know this is all just a big fucking script. I do the same thing. The more people we reach, the better chance we have to defeat these people </p>

<p>I give the benefit of the doubt even when I see suspect posters. Because its not a conversation between just you and a shill but all the lurkers too; arguably a larger audience. So if we present our arguments well and calmly we look good. They will still get buried and downvoted but people will read; and that&#39;s the victory. They present themselves as idiots and only idiots follow their heuristics.</p>

I don&#39;t think they&#39;re trying to turn people into neonazis but there&#39;s alot of alt right crossover for sure. Partisanship has become embedded into the program in obvious and subtle ways, as well as a good deal of neocon rhetoric in a somewhat raw form (foreign hordes, evil scheming leftists trying to destroy the country, etc).

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know much about Israeli political parties but I assume Lukid and Netanyahu are flawless in the eyes of Breitbart, and the left in Israel is in favor of Palestinian emancipation, so when they&#39;re pro-Israel, I think it&#39;s more like pro-right wing Israel. What Infowars has done is take the general Islam fear-mongering of Fox News after 9/11 and amplified it, adding in all progressive ideas, while denouncing the establishment...which ends up not computing in my view. It&#39;s a weird conceptual move they share with Bannon&#39;s/Mercer&#39;s Breitbart and that goes largely unnoticed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought this for a while.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is they have tied Alex Jones in with the alt-right.  </p>

<p>I came up with this exact theory on my own.  Jones&#39; job is to conflate conspiracy theory with the alt-right.  Jones is a Trump supporter too which is interesting.  </p>

<p>So imagine there is some kind of crackdown on the Right as a backlash against Rightwing terrorism.  Well now any questioning of the government can be tied in with it, because that&#39;s what conspiracy theory is.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed another thing since Charlottesville.  A lot of people on the Left seem to be perfectly okay with limiting certain kinds of speech, which could also be tied into any backlash against the alt-right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AJ is not a shill.  Just a crazy texan with a radio show.  The reason why they are heavily attacking him so hard, is cuz infowars is getting bigger and bigger and they are scared. alex and roger stone really fucked the clintons over in the past election.  They made some very high up enemies.  Your proof that hes a plant, is that you learned it, from where?  A youtube video?  LOL.  The only reason I will go out of my way to defend alex is that they are saying his speech is &quot;hate speech&quot; and he should be arrested for being alt right and they blame him every time an event happens.  They&#39;ll say &quot;the murderer was a fan of infowars&quot;.  guilt by association.  Then the dominos all fall, they shut anything conspiracy-wise down. If you cant see that is what will happen, look closer.  Just like TRUMP, alex jones is not &quot;in on it&quot; but rather being setup and used.  HUGE difference.  Trump and Jones and the conservative right is only guilty of doing their thing and telling the truth.</p>

<p>In my every day &quot;day to day life&quot; I encounter ZERO racist or sexist people.</p>

<p>They are playing this up WAY more than you think dude. Nobody is that big of a jackass.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase....there may be some jackasses out there, but stop giving them attention for fucks sake. </p>

<p>You stoke the embers of the racism fire by talking about them. Most people are good wholesome normal people dude. Don&#39;t give me that shit, there is no way there are a bunch of closet racists living among us around every corner. Sounds like you&#39;re falling for the hysteria they are pushing dude...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know why you encounter zero racists or sexist people?They need a herd to have balls.
On their own they are too scared to spew their rethoric.
Why do you think this &quot;new wave&quot; of racism is so damn massive online?
They gather online and form their bonds until they are enough to take the fight into the real world.</p>

<p>Most importantly, racism has gone corporate.It grew it&#39;s hair out and switched the combat boots to a suit.
It&#39;s not about screaming about those &quot;damn porch monkeys&quot; anymore.
It&#39;s the dude at work that jokes about &quot;gangsters&quot;,it&#39;s the suburban dad who calls the HOA because blacks are using the community pool,it&#39;s the &quot;I&#39;m not racist but..&quot; people.</p>

<p>Of course you still have the bottom of the barrell guys.But they are mostly shunned by their &quot;comrades&quot; because they undermine their tactics.
Today they operate with &quot;facts&quot; and try to make you &quot;think for yourself&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t believe what &quot;&quot;they&quot;&quot; tell you&quot;.</p>

<p>Just take germany as an example.
Some ~25 years ago,they tried to burn refugees in their homes with molotovs and proclaimed &quot;Deutschland den deutschen&quot;.
Now they run around in suits,talking about rapefugees,welfare tourists,monuments of shame and the likes.Trying to hide racism behind their concern for poor people,the elderly, women etc.
And to a certain extent it works.It works on people who feel left alone with their troubles.All of a sudden they have something to blame their misfortune on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmmm I&#39;m from Canada and this conversation between youse two got me interested. I&#39;ve been debating this question myself but couldn&#39;t come up with an answer but it seems even Americans are having a hard time coming to terms to what&#39;s what.</p>

<p>My opinion is that there are enough people with these beliefs simply because of the big size of the the population even though you don&#39;t get to see them outside. However they probably only make a small portion of the population. Again this is just my speculation and not based on statistics.</p>

<p>You actually also probably do see them but they act normal not to be social outcasts as they aren&#39;t in groups so we can&#39;t spot them when they blend in with the public. The only question is that what extent they exist. Is it one person a month you come across? Is it even less frequent?</p>

<p>I do totally agree that TPTB are trying to blow this out of proportion and stir things up. I can see this being a dangerous and slippery slope though if they manage to trigger enough &quot;dormant&quot; people who may actually hold these beliefs but haven&#39;t acted out on them since there was no unison and vacuums being created to be filled before. Do you think there aren&#39;t enough crazy folks to jump on board and that it will mostly be bots? Hopefully you are right and we don&#39;t get to see out southern neighbors all kill themselves. </p>

<p>Anyways I do agree with the post that conspiracists are being labeled. I&#39;ve been everything from a Russian to a Nazi just because I call out CNNs ridiculous lies and deep state narratives.</p>

<p>One other thing.  Regarding the Rothschilds ruling the world, I&#39;m not 100% of that anymore (I did believe that with certainty a little while ago).  As a user on here <a href="/u/AhuwahZeus">/u/AhuwahZeus</a> has pointed out, there may be a group known as the Black Nobility that the Rothchilds report to (Rothschilds may be second in command), as far as human-controlled groups (of course satan/anti-christ sit atop whichever human-controlled groups are at the top).</p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m aware of this theory but for me the dots haven&#39;t been connected between Rothschild and Catholic anything. I know at one point a Rothschild was the papal treasure guardian, but that doesn&#39;t do much to explain stuff like Syria, Iran, Israel, international banking etc. I also like the whole Babylonian cult idea, but again I&#39;m left with Rothschild as the only verifiable head of the pyramid, even if I&#39;m only putting a name on the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>To me, this actually verifies the Babylonian cult/Black Nobility/Vatican-Pope-false-prophet of the Beast System, in addition to the Rothschilds being the &quot;public&quot; secret group (and to an extent the &quot;royalty&quot; of England), for the rest of the top to hide behind until they rule publicly as the NWO.</p>

<p>I agree. And it is pretty &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; to say these things, putting these kind of statements more on the political &quot;left&quot; side. Left acknowledges the class struggle (capital hoarders vs those-who-need-to-work-to-pay-for-their-livelihood).</p>

<p>And this is exactly why I think &quot;we&quot; are being manipulatively portrayed as (or pushed towards) the &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;trumpies&quot;. Simply because we would be extremely dangerous if &quot;we&quot; (and those who see us) understood how left wing we actually are. We are the 99%, we resist being exploited, we unite and overthrow the misleaders.</p>

<p>But left wing is a term very much hijacked by propaganda (stemming from the cold-war). Especially in the US. Left wing is not merely the &quot;commies&quot;, but also: libertarian socialists, market socialists, stirner-defined egoists, syndicalists, and the many other types of anarchists. These groups all have in common that they want to abolish &quot;capital hoarding&quot; (and the ruling class: those who have hoarded the most), and put something more fair in place. It&#39;s a movement with quite a history, lots of ideas have been thoroughly discussed, some even tried in practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This!  These are all leftist ideals.  We could even solve the above problems and still allow some form of individualistic market-based system (&quot;right-wing economics&quot;), or even individual state/county rights so they can keep their regional traditional social laws (&quot;right-wing social stances&quot; which the social-left often hates).   To me those barely matter, so long as the foundational problem of an unfair economic system is addressed.  It would be great to one day have a political sphere that has the privilege of fighting over what flavor of social and economic stances it should allow - but at the moment all those discussions are rendered moot by the massive control of the ruling class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll repeat my comment on several places, as I feel it could serve some good on this subject:</p>

<p>Mmm-hmm ... I&#39;m from former Yugoslavia and we had zero guns available before 1990&#39;s , and it didn&#39;t seem to stop us from raging bloody civil wars for years.</p>

<p>Civil war never starts from some &#39;people&#39; raging with guns.</p>

<p>Even then it was a series of well orchestrated incidents that served to infuriate people and militarize them against each other. Weapons were distributed accordingly, some people got rich on that. Laughing at us stupid cunts.</p>

<p>Separation and hate was greatly sponsored by &#39;outside factors&#39;. Media was biased. Slowly moving towards division and hate. Peace propagating voices were muffled in the media. In a matter of one year, things escalated beyond reasonable control. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Sadly, things happening in US are looking somewhat like this.</p>

<p>If 3 of 4 major incidents happen , that instigate great divide between people , if you heard someone/party/origanisation is starting to distribute weapons, if it starts to feel so hot that real people start having protests for peace and reason, then you&#39;ll know shit has hit the fan.</p>

<p>In my memory, it takes about a year and a half to get from &#39;these people are furious for the right reasons&#39; to &#39;why the fuck is everybody shooting everybody&#39;.</p>

<p>I hope nothing of this happens. I wouldn&#39;t wish a civil war at my worst enemy. A lot of innocent people get hurt.</p>

<p>Smart people learn from their mistakes, stupid people repeat them, and geniuses learn from both of them.</p>

<p>Be geniuses , USA!</p>

<p>PS. In retrospective, Yugoslavia had a civil war so the rich could get richer, a lot of state owned companies could have been sold to rich for silly little money, and some kind of (4th strongest army in Europe at the time) millitary dissolution and making smaller , weaker countries instead.</p>

<p>Of course, that received one tenth the backlash.  Obviously because those events couldn&#39;t be exploited for political points against Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with this, Trump supporters aren&#39;t kkk or nazis, sure some are, but they are a really small minority. And people including me are not defending what nazism or kkk stand for, but we are defending the first amendment, and we are tired of antifa showing up everytime a  conservetive is gonna hold a speak with violent intent. Not just against nazis. Didn&#39;t Churchill say something like &quot;when facism arrives it will disguise themselfs as anti facism&quot;. The media/democrats have had a real problem condemning the lefts violence. I think this is more like the media is trying to paint the picture where coservatives, nazis, Trump and kkk are holding hands which isn&#39;t true at all. Remember that Trump supporters don&#39;t care what the msm says. They&#39;ve lost the power over them so now they are making them look like nazis. If you defend your amendments nazism, communism or any other tyranny can&#39;t touch you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the issue is that Trump himself might fit right in the classic r/conspiracy mindset. He questions anthropogenic climate change, vaccines, etc. </p>

<p>Then you have the leftist controlled media who are trying to add all these things to their made up word, &quot;alt right&quot;. From what I gather &quot;alt right&quot; means first and foremost &quot;racist white people&quot;. Well why not just call them that? Because it&#39;s more than that. It&#39;s also supposed to be implicitly describing &quot;racist white Trump supporters&quot;. </p>

<p>After they establish this, they pretty much take any view they don&#39;t like (usually something real conspiracy theorists think about, like vaccines) and call it an &quot;alt right&quot; viewpoint. So now, when you question anthropogenic climate change you&#39;re holding &quot;alt right&quot; views and thus you&#39;re automatically a white racist Trump supporter.</p>

<p>Funny how that works huh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP, Love and acceptance can overcome. Outside my window and in my interactions with people, I also see overwhelming community behavior.</p>

<p>as a side note to some negative replies I have seen, I have lurked this sub for years, I never witnessed anything remotely racist get upvoted and promoted by the commenting user base. not until this last election cycle when pretty much the whole of reddit(the only mass visited open forum I visit on the internet(i limit my exposure intentionally)) seemed to be littered with &#39;this side or that side&#39; types of narratives that engulfed much more than what politician someone liked. 
The only pro trump posts that were upvoted were at a time when, I believe, many of us wanted to believe that trump would do as he promised and make efforts to counter the widespread corruption, which has not happened. Much of what I have seen upvoted since then has not seemed organic to me. It seems more like the work of whatever group is brigading the other large subs with similar narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking on this sub for awhile and I have a couple of questions and observations. I believe in conspiracies because I&#39;m looking for truth. I know we&#39;re being lied to and manipulated by our government.  Things happen today that are so crazy that they defy explanation. The only way they make sense is to buy into a conspiracy that explains the why and how. Nothing on the national political scene &quot;just happens&quot;. There are reasons.  There are 4 or 5 factions that are trying to control society. NWO, George Soros, Rothschild, etc, etc. But what I find interesting is the divisions in the conspiracy community. Even if you believe in a conspiracy, it&#39;s still hard to get to the absolute truth of the who and why behind things.
And I also think that sometimes a conspiracy is started and used to manipulate and influence certain factions or the way people think about certain things. So it&#39;s very hard to get to the truth and it becomes kind of a belief or blind faith that becomes your truth.  </p>

<p>So my questions are:
Who is behind Trump and why would they put such a seemingly unqualified person in place? What is the end game here? Is he there 
to bring about turmoil and unrest? He certainly will not be beneficial in any way to our country. Also, is the constant day to day shit storm at the White House a product of his incompetence and disagreeing factions within the White House or is it being brought about to create enough problems for him to where he is impeached, quits, or is taken out by other means? </p>

<p>I know some of these questions may come across as naive,  but please understand where I&#39;m coming from. I&#39;m only looking for the truth!  </p>
