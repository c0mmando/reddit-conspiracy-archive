       I can only validate one of the many accusations against him, the contempt of court charges. That is sufficient though. He disobeyed a court order, and he does not deny this. Prison is the only suitable outcome. Pardoning him would be asinine.

       Thanks. He treated his prisoners like shit. They're not there to be humiliated. Half off of prisoners should be released, but not people like Joe Arpaio (corrupt politicians who abuse their power). Those are EXACTLY the ones that need long hard sentences.

       Probably getting him out of legal trouble, but more importantly a publicity piece about illegal immigration. That guy was the face of anti-illegal immigration and stronger enforcement of it. Would make Trump look good because of Trump's wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for stronger borders, but his actions towards that are canceled out by all the negative shit he's done (ie. furthering police state, militarization of police, war on drugs, etc etc).

       He was ordered to stop racial profiling, and refused. He was convicted of criminal contempt of court. He hasn't been sentenced yet, but he faces about six months in jail max.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a pardon is pretty unlikely. Look at the outrage Trump is facing right now, and ask yourself what's going to happen if he pardons a guy who was convicted for illegally racially profiling people.

       Probably because he was convicted for ignoring the court of law he was duty bound to obey. Most people don't think police should have total authority to ignore the courts and bust whoever they feel like.

       Sheriffs are bound by the authority of the courts. That's
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of the Constitution, which establishes a judicial branch in Article III. Consequently, violating the court order made him liable for criminal contempt of court.

       You should read the Constitution sometime. Article III is a thing. And US federal courts common law courts.

       Every assertion in there is wrong. 
* The UCC has nothing to do with "the law of the sea." It's a uniform commercial code for harmonizing rules about leases and such. You can
       <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc">
        read it yourself
       </a>
       and look for anything having to do with maritime law or special UCC courts. (You won't, I know, but what the hell, I might as well point it out.) 
* The Organic Act has nothing to do with maritime law or the UCC; the UCC was written about a hundred years after the Organic Act.
* Statutes and codes are laws. Check the books--as in, read a book about law sometime. It's more accurate than making stuff up as you go along.
* I have never been a member of any private or for-profit bar. (As I know I've tried to explain to you before, and you could learn for yourself if you read more, there's lots of bar associations, not just one.)

* "A Federal court monitor was appointed to oversee his office's operations because of complaints of racial profiling. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed suit against him for unlawful discriminatory police conduct."
* "Arpaio was a defendant in a decade-long racial-profiling case in which a federal court issued an injunction barring him from conducting further "immigration round-ups" that targeted Hispanics. A federal court subsequently found that after the order was issued, Arpaio's office continued to detain "persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed." In 2016, Arpaio was held in civil contempt of court, and the following year, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for "willfully" violating the order"
