    <div class="md"><p>You can think properly or something. A rally contained mamy types of people. Some if them were very bad and called nazis.  One of the nazis drove his car into a crowd of people.  The aftermath now is the media saying ALL of those people...no exceptions...were all nazis.  Now if you point out that there were other groups there....you&#39;re a nazi sympathizer now.  Are you learning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, to be clear, most people weren&#39;t Nazi terrorists, but still attended a rally with the intention of uniting &#39;the right&#39;, which by definition and attendance included Nazis. Thereby giving a clear message that while not necessarily condoning, also not condemning them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but to even harbour an indifference to white supremacists is bad enough for me and should not be excused or normalised in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go to comic con because you want to see some cosplay and trailers for marvel movies does that mean you identify with the lifestyle of any neckbeards with horrible BO that show up? No. Especially if that is your first time attending such an event. I remember the first time I went to a con I was totally blindsided by how nasty some of the people were--you could just smell them from 20 feet away (not to judge them too much).</p>

<p>My take on what happened is that there were some actual racists and then there were some trolls and there were some people who believed in a reasonable right-based movement protesting against anti-right etc. The rally was called &quot;unite the right&quot; not &quot;bring back slavery&quot; or some other actual racist shit. It makes absolute sense that most of the people there had good intentions.</p>

<p>From there multiple things might have happened. You have the counter protesters being aggressive and trying to get a reaction so in return i&#39;m sure a few of these trolls and racists (and probably some cointelpro) fought back and said some actual racist and alarming things to get under the counter protesters skin like, &quot;You think we&#39;re racist, fine, SIEG HEIL!!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of people left after this point and I&#39;m also sure others came in because they were attracted by the tension and racism and wanted to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Not that I condone any of this at all. I think it&#39;s all ridiculous and the actions of the more hateful on both sides are helping to contribute to more hatred and racial tensions for no reason. But my point is to argue against the idea that just attending a unite the right rally means you are indifferent to racism because racists might be there. The equivalence is that there are also racists on the other side, black supremacists and anti-whites but some people joined the counter protest for the reasonable aim of wanting to argue against racism as they saw it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points, but to use your own analogy; if I go to a comic con I know at least 50% of the attendees are gonna be a bit grimy. I also know I&#39;m gonna share a lot in common with them. </p>

<p>Now if said comic con is also arranged by a grimy neck beard, I know what kind of event I&#39;m attending.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m taking sides and I&#39;m happy to actually get a well presented opposing side. I&#39;m trying to learn through raising points and having counterpoints raised against me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it&#39;s fair to see it that way but from my perspective I meant it a different way. In my personal experience I don&#39;t expect to find a lot in common with the people there and in reality that is true. There are so many people there with different interests and I was personally surprised by the fact that people could actually show up to a public space and not realize they are creating a solid BO wall that is attacking people they walk past. I had never experienced that in real life before so there was no reason for me to expect it even if I expected some nerds.</p>

<p>For a &quot;unite the right&quot; rally, I&#39;m not sure exactly what was promoted and I am not someone who identifies with the right, but trying to put myself in those shoes I don&#39;t think I would expect actual racists to be there in any major force. The rally was supposed to be for conservative views, not for being cartoonish nazis. I haven&#39;t looked too much into everything that was said but I personally haven&#39;t seen anything actually racist said there either, just people saying trollish nazi shit to annoy the counter protesters. Things that I don&#39;t think can fairly be used to reflect the purpose of the rally or the actual views of the attendees at large.</p>

<p>My problem with all of this is how does it even make sense to you to take a side? If you support the counter protesters and act like they were in the right it only makes things worse. One side is seeing this event and being made to believe the left was being aggressive and going out of their way to create violence while the right was exercising their legal right to be doofuses and were being antagonized. The other side is seeing this event and being made to believe that the counter protesters had a noble cause and the protesters are all nazi sympathizers who were there to promote racism so it&#39;s okay to antagonize them and create violence.</p>

<p>If your goal is anti racism, supporting what either side did actually accomplishes the opposite. Because by making it a racist event and saying one side was worse, anyone who leans one way or the other will feel that these emotions are necessary to fight the other side which is apparently bad. People&#39;s stances on this sort of thing are far more inherently polarizing than what reality demands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an illustration. Smelly/weird neckbeard nerds are to comic con as nazis are to a right wing rally. My point was that you might go to a comic con knowing there could be some nerds there but especially if it is your first time going to one you dont expect the possibility that there are some real &quot;lurkers&quot; there. And even if you did, that isn&#39;t the point of the con or why you went there and it doesnt mean you identify with those people or think their lifestyle or beliefs are good.</p>

<p>By comparison a person going to a unite the right rally doesn&#39;t necessarily believe there will be open racism there as that is not the point of the rally and they would likely not be prepared for the existence of people like that. I know I wouldn&#39;t. It isn&#39;t their fault and doesn&#39;t reflect on them if some actual racists showed up.</p>

<p>The &quot;unite the right&quot; hate rally wasn&#39;t meant as a nazi or racist rally as far as I know. Right wing doesn&#39;t mean they are nazi or racist. What actual racist message were they supporting anyway? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were starving you would. And I think that is very apt in this comparison because what other outlet do these protesters have in a world where any rally they might have to speak about their beliefs they have counter protesters there trying to shut down the event and antagonize them? In a world where the internet, media, and public space are dominated by opposing ideologies? Very little.</p>

<p>That is an example for why the cornering of free speech and ability to hold differing opinions without being shunned is so dangerous. Good people who have reasonable beliefs that go against the norm are forced into groups with other people who have undesirable beliefs and intentions because they have no other outlet. There are a lot of young adults seeing all the thought-conditioning in the world today and they rightfully disagree with that but the only places that will accept them even though they did nothing wrong are the people who will do wrong. </p>

<p>In the end this is actually STRENGTHENING hate groups by pushing non-hateful people to their side when, if you just tried to understand and listen to them this wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find your blind apologetics to right wing racism appalling. You obviously don&#39;t talk to many conservatives, read comments in the blaze, breitbart, go to 4 Chan, read YouTube comments, go to r/uncensorednews, and look at why so many reddit posts comment sections are locked that involve black people acting unruly(your hand must really be in the sand to be as oblivious to right wing white supremacists). There is an exponentially growing segment of conservative whites who believe in some grand conspiracy to oppress white people. The whole movement against political correctness involves and revolves around racist and xenophobic white people who think they are being unfairly demonized when they say racist shit whenever they see videos of blacks acting uncivilized or when they try to characterize and demonize all Arab refugees as rapist terrorists trying  to destroy white America. I haven&#39;t been to r/uncensorednews(a conservative sub)  since they banned me for pointing out how they are promoting racism through blatant falsehoods and propaganda by showing a huge image of a battered white girl ON THE SIDEBAR, asking &quot;who was responsible for Apartheid&quot;. FYI apartheid ended in the 90&#39;s so that image only exists as propaganda to get people to hate blacks especially white people. If you don&#39;t support blatant racism and if you think your anti government right wing &quot;side&quot; isn&#39;t racist then you have to speak out when you see blatant racist propaganda that is flooding right wing communities. Even Trump is promoting racist info graphics communicating completely false statistics designed to cause whites to hate blacks(I can post a link to this if you are not aware of this).  Since you are in this sub I am sure you are not oblivious to growing right wing anti jew sentiment and propaganda that is propagated in this sub on a daily basis as well. So don&#39;t act like you aren&#39;t exposed to anti jew (((nazi)))  sentiment on a daily basis. </p>

<p>One of the very first posts from the OP&#39;s account is &quot;why do socialists like diversity and multiculturalism&quot;... and here you are here you are jerking him off and agreeing with him that right wing racism is a construct of the media and not a growing problem that YOU must deal with but probably won&#39;t because you are actively belittling the very real threat to the heart of the American right. </p>

<p>The authorities and those involved with giving the police the order to protect and de-escalate failed. They failed their duty to protect the rights and the livelihood of every single person that chose to protest or counter protest peacefully and without violence.  Not only did they fail, they failed with a GLARING example of what could happen, barely over a month before they allowed it to happen. It&#39;s sick.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what this topic is about though so I&#39;d say that seagull is the big-gun account here. Pardon if that&#39;s who you were referring to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the identitarians you are referring to, right? They believe in peaceful ethnic cleansing. They&#39;re not technically white supremacists or Neo-Nazis, they&#39;re much closer to Eugenicists that value ethnic superiority over genetic. Ultimately what it comes down to is preserving a traditional, distinctly European culture. They believe ethnicity is the key to that preservation, which is not only racist, but also irrational. Someone with your ethnicity can promote non-traditional values and culture in contrast to the tradition that <em>belongs</em> to that ethnicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you attend an event alongside Neo-Nazi&#39;s, you share at least some of their beliefs. Same goes for any other group. Thing is, it&#39;s hard to find a redeemable belief of neo-Nazi&#39;s that would justify associating with them. If you identfy with ANTIFA, you condone violent suppression of free speech and 1st amendment rights because that is part of the group&#39;s core values. BLM is hard to pin down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing people post similar thought.  I see a lot of &quot;If I went to a protest to then discover there were Nazis there I would leave&quot; and I think this is reaaaaaally dumb.  The existence and proximity of &quot;Nazis&quot; should in no way sway your core beliefs.  If someone else whom you disagree with on one thing agrees with you on another, it does not detract from the belief you both hold true.  I mean shit, Hitler loved roads.  Does that mean I should disavow roads?  Nope.</p>

<p>What is really happening right now is they are making a giant push to try to associate Trump with Nazis because it is almost universally accepted that Nazis represent the most deplorable evil that humans are capable of.  They don&#39;t really want Trump to &quot;disavow&quot; Nazis (which he has done repeatedly, the media just ignored it), what they really want is Trump&#39;s supporters to disavow Trump.  The problem with their tactics is that it is only effecting raging Liberals, Trump&#39;s base has seen these same exact tactics used against him for going on two years.  They just laugh at the mental gymnastics, move further out of the shadow of the medias influence and carry on MAGAing.  I can&#39;t understand why the media keeps using the same transparent tactics because I have trouble believing they are actually that stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it is.  What you are observing in the political landscape was designed, down to the very smallest nuance, by people either trying to support or destroy one or the other political parties.  Everything that is in the public mind concerning politics was put there by these people.  You are not some especially observant person who has discovered that party politics is divisive, that idea was placed there as a pressure valve for one or the other side to use when things heat up.  The entire political spectrum, every single idea that gains traction, every &quot;resistance&quot; movement, it is all fabricated by people from one party or the other in an attempt to control you.

Well now its considered a nazi rally and anyons there is a nazi. Thats just the average joes thinking and the media&#39;s manipulation.  Everyons forgets the statue and uniting and focuses on the saluting and chanting. I wouldnt be surprised if the entire thing was a set up from the beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I believe racism is still very much alive, but it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve made progress. The media wants to put a spotlight on any race issue because they know it will blow up and cause us to divide so we&#39;re easier to control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying and appreciate the point regarding the polar political thought. However it does actually help prove my point. Dividing us through educated dichotomy makes us more easily manipulated.  I don&#39;t believe for a second that we are born with left or right views. We have been indoctrinated over time into establishing a belief structure around these two options. For example, I used to joke that Dems were drowned in the well at birth in my household. It wasn&#39;t until well into adulthood that my eyes were opened and I formulated a belief structure outside the dichotomy. This division results in citizenry infighting over issues that don&#39;t matter compared to subjugation. Since this sub is dedicated (IMO) to helping people remove the proverbial wool over their eyes, whether View points are &quot;left or right&quot; results in more diversion from the issues that matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, it&#39;s not just a simple 0 or 1, A or B thing. It&#39;s a spectrum and people fall along different points of that spectrum. Our current two-party/electoral system focuses and filters that spectrum into an A or B choice. But in reality, people have varying beliefs that don&#39;t align with a simple division like we currently have. But you will never get rid of the division completely... people are going to disagree on issues. To insist on a utopia where everyone agrees and are united politically is a frightening premise.</p>

<p>Around 37 minutes in, they arrive at the second park where a heavily-armed group of Antifa is holding a counter-protest by permit. Two large white men approach draped in flags. The camera zooms in on all the Antifa firearms, then turns away until around minute 39, when the scuffle breaks out as one Antifa pepper-sprays the white men then several more come in throwing blows. After the skirmish, BuzzFeed follows the two men away where you can see one man&#39;s eye is seriously injured and the other is bleeding from a head wound.</p>

Everyone who supports free speech, is trying to align themselves with people who say questionable things, and are therefore Nazis, racists, and out to kill women for kicks.<br/>
Am I doing it right? Be careful how you respond. Free speech is evil, and makes you a Naqzi. Cut and paste something from an approved source instead of using your own words. One&#39;s own words are Nazi toxic. Only Nazis express themselves freely.</p>

The ACLU hates all Jews and Blacks and Mexicans and are calling for them to be raped and killed, in modern parlance. They literally went out of their way to defend their right to express themselves in our courts, as if they are supportive of all their messages. It seems to be all their fault, forcing everyone to endure free speech and assembly.<br/>
The ACLU fought to openly embrace Nazi ideology, in the logic of redditors, here today. Without them, none of this would have happened. The ACLU literally killed that person, by urging the group to go forward with their rally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you made a seriously off base comparison that deserves no attention.<br/>
Everyone who is not a leftie shall be known as Nazi Racist KKK, from now on.<br/>
As an anarchist who dismisses the right and left, I am consatntly accused of being right wing, by pretty much every leftie on reddit.<br/>
99% of redditors think <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> is an all white hate group, exactly like the Nazis, and in lock step with the KKK.<br/>
When I posted about it the other day there, many black members of the group expressed deep puzzlement at that one. No one at <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> had any idea what the hell the rest of reddit is thinking, saying mind bogglingly ignorant things like that. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/6tcfr6/rmensrights_is_once_again_being_equated_with_hard/">https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/6tcfr6/rmensrights_is_once_again_being_equated_with_hard/</a><br/>
And the rest of reddit will sail along, calling <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> an extreme white power hate group of Trump voting misogynist terrorists, urging each other to rape all women, in a complete disconnect with reality.<br/>
Just like the new game of grouping everyone who isn&#39;t left wing, together as a unified group of racist sadists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you are saying swastikas can be worn in a fun edgelord type way, and it&#39;s cool?<br/>
Your absurd myth debunked:<br/>
&#39;&#39;The swastika armband, safety pins, and torn shirts originated in NYC, but quickly made their way to London. An employee of Sex named Alan Jones was beaten up in Notting Hill for wearing a swastika armband. Still, punks were largely undeterred. When explaining why she wore the Nazi symbol, Siouxsie Sioux explained, &quot;It was an anti-mums and dads thing. We hated older people always harping on about Hitler, &#39;We showed him,&#39; and that smug pride. It was a way of watching someone like that go completely red-faced.&quot; &#39;&#39;<br/>
<a href="http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/29-things-you-didnt-know-about-punk-style/swastika-armband">http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/29-things-you-didnt-know-about-punk-style/swastika-armband</a><br/>
Why were the NYC punks wearing them? You gave the copycat bandwagon poser reasons from UK imitators.<br/>
&#39;&#39;The use of the swastika in punk imagery has several roots. Perhaps
the first people to be defined as punks who used the swastika were a
band who hailed from Cleveland, Ohio, called The Electric Eels.
These wackos are credited with having released one of the first ever
punk singles called &quot;Agitated&quot;/&#39;Cyclotron&#39; in May, 1975, although the
actual songs never made it onto an official release till 1979
(Rough Trade seven-inch, RT008).
As early as 1974, The Electric Eels were causing outrage by wearing
White Power T-shirts and putting swastikas on their posters. They
described themselves as art terrorists and nihilists, intent on
upsetting as many people as possible. Another of their tricks, for
example, was causing fights in bars by pretending to be gay tee hee.
Of course these were preceded by Ron Asheton of the Stooges
fixation with SS uniforms.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<a href="http://punkrocker.org.uk/punkscene/swastica.html">http://punkrocker.org.uk/punkscene/swastica.html</a><br/>
So whenever Iggy Pop comes on, and you enjoy it, you are dancing to the beat of known Nazi associates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my perspective that glosses over how prevalent the skinhead scene was in the late 80s early 90s in the south. The barriers to entry were high for a lot of people, mainly in the form of violence. Punk rock was not a monolithic force for good. And the dead kennedys didnt speak for all. </p>

<p>I am adding onto a post below but what i think finally got the skinheads outta the music scene was just slowly vibing them away. If you are a 1 dimensional gang in a sea of colorful outcasts you are the boring institution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then don&#39;t unite the Right. If you don&#39;t want to associate yourself with the neo-Nazis, then don&#39;t fucking associate yourself with the Neo-Nazis. Tell them to hit the bricks because they&#39;re making the reasonable members of the Right look like they condone this behavior. Just because they wear the same team color as you does not mean that you have to defend their actions to the death. Doing so does not help your cause at all. All they are doing is dragging you down with them. You are not bringing them up with you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more or less liberal in the traditional sense, but I am not going to go to a left wing rally and put on a pussy hat and support the insanity of the third wave feminists and people obsessed with pronouns. I don&#39;t support their cause and I don&#39;t want to associate with them, even though our shirts are the same color.</p>

<p>You have to be adults and have some god damn common sense. Nobody is coming out of this looking good. Everyone looks like a fool. It&#39;s on you, not them. <em>You</em> be the one to make it clear that you don&#39;t condone the neo-Nazis and yelling FAGGOT at people, even though you support the Right. Prove the media wrong instead of proving them right.</p>
