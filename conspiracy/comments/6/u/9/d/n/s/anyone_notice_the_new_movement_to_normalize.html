       Ever notice how any time a parent wants to get help for their child who started head banging and not speaking after a vaccine, they are labeled as terrible people for "not embracing their non-neurotypical" child. I've seen it on Reddit the most. And the old tired argument of "I'd rather have an autistic kid than a dead one!". Uhhh no, I'd take a week long case of measles over lifelong severe autism any time! I must be a horrible person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, in Iceland, they have eliminated Downs syndrome. How wonderful! The downs syndrome community, which have some of the nicest sweetest people on the planet and they're all getting eliminated from an entire country. And I'm sure it's not sending a very good message to the current people alive with disabilities. But nooooo that's all great "because science!"

       I just find the double standard interesting.

       I'm glad more people are picking up on this, despite Autism having worse outcomes than Downs Syndrome...
      </p>
      <p>
       Official propaganda on Downs Syndrome =  Kill them in the womb, it's cruel for them to be born and bad for society to have to pay for them.  You are a bad parent if you don't kill your unborn Downs Syndrome child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Official Propaganda on Autism = It's great, good fun, people with Autism like having Autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's going on here?  Yes, you worked it out, the pharmaceutical industry knows that one day the truth will come out about vaccines causing Autism (it already has come out because the media have been intimidated not to go near it).  So this is the pharmaceutical Plan B, when the truth does come out they will say "We were doing those kids a favor by giving them Autism, their families should be grateful, no need to send us to jail for crimes against humanity".  So the industry uses it's tentacles to spread their propaganda into the media, which the media repeats as they're all in bed together.

       Could you elaborate or provide a source? My understanding, albeit limited, is that there are very high functioning autistic people on the spectrum, you may not even know they have it. I would imagine their outcomes are much better than those with Downs Syndrome. I have seen very severe cases of Autism and I imagine that is probably comparable or sometimes worse than Downs.

       Severe autism is a condition that usually requires the person to be taken care of completely for their entire life. Unable to communicate, usually unable to provide self care and many of them are violent due to their senses being either dull or very heightened (they might hear things average people can't, but they might not be able to smell or taste--which leads to frustration and violence) Autistic individuals do not have a chromosomal condition and their risk for disease and health problems unrelated to autism is the same as the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with Down's generally are able to care for themselves, communicate and may be able to hold a job. Because they have a chromosomal issue, they generally have low IQ and they are very susceptible to heart issues and dementia with a life span of about 40 years old. Down's is MUCH more manageable condition compared to severe autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that high functioning autism is also no "walk in the park" either. My brother who is an adult, has it and is extremely intelligent, yet he has issues making friends, driving, and is susceptible to being manipulated by scams etc. He lives at home with my parents and always will.

       Thanks, that changes my perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can totally see how outcomes for autistic people are worse than those with Downs, especially due to the social isolation factor. Speculation on my part: having issues being social and making friends while also being intelligent would probably lead a lot of internal turmoil trying to grapple with why you don't "fit".

       Same as why we celebrate homosexuality which is mostly caused by the hormones in the contraceptive pill having a powerful effect on the unborn male.  We are trained to celebrate it as a Plan B in case the truth ever comes out.

       Applying the human concept of sexuality to animals is asinine to begin with. I've read studies referencing the observation of homosexual tendencies in animals, animals raping other animals and necrophilia. It's all bullshit, animals do not have reason and logic the way humans do. It's not to say they do not feel, but simply they do not feel the same way.

       There are studies that show that intrauterine estrogen levels may affect sexuality. I'm just venturing here, so bear with me. If a women is taking hormonal contraceptive it could affect her intrauterine estrogen levels. This could happen if she cycled off of the pill in order to purposefully become pregnant or got pregnant while on contraceptives. Also, some of the contraceptives like the Depo-Provera shot last for like 6 months, but it's not outlandish to think that a women's hormones are still imbalance when she can become pregnant again.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for pre-contraceptive homosexuality, I'm sure there are many factors that could affect people's brain chemistry in regards to sexuality, whether it be genetic, intrauterine, and/or even nurture.

       Netflix just came out with a show about autism called Atypical.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has the most ham-fisted pound-you-over-the-head exposition I've ever seen.  Meaning, yeah it does kind of seem more like a show that is telling people about autism, instead of just being a show about an autistic kid.

       The current rate of autism is about 1 in 45 or so. I wonder what the pro vaxx crowd will say when the rate of autism inevitably reaches 1 in 10 after being 1 in 10,000 years ago. In before its just better screening.

       I can't speak for the "crowd" since I'm only one person, but I can tell you that if the rate of autism reaches 1 in 10, I will be very convinced that something environmental is the primary cause. Could it be vaccines? Sure. But it could also be a variety of factors because a lot has changed in the last century besides the introduction of vaccines. I sometimes wonder what the long-term effects might be of all the preservatives and processed foods that everyone has been ingesting for decades, for example.

       I understand where you're coming from, but I think of it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the pollutants/chemicals/preservatives floating around that so many people are exposed to right now, how many of them are being physically injected into our bodies, flowing through the circulatory/immune system, and as we know know, physically reaching the brain (through the recently discovered direct vascular connection between brain and immune system?)
      </p>
      <p>
       And why is it affecting the youngest of our population in ever-increasing numbers?

       No, actually, my thought is that it's probably the vaccines.  It's more likely to be the stuff we're shooting directly into our bodies, than the stuff that doesn't breach that inside/outside barrier (or it does, but to a lesser extent).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also welcome the study.  I think at some point it's going to be inevitable for it, if the CDC wants to convince the growing numbers of parents putting the brakes on their children's vaccines, of their safety.

       Just in the last 2 months, my family has watched 3 movies in which they were definitely trying to normalize autism. Normalize it? Hell, they were trying to sell it as a kinda cool thing to have. The recurring themes were "autistic people can understand things we don't, autistic people have abilities we don't, autistic people can recognize patterns we don't, autistic people are better at this than we are ..."

       I honestly can't tell you the names of these piece of shit movies; my family watches them while I work around the house and catch snippets of the brainwashing. One of em was a horror in which the autistic kid could see spirits that no one else could.

       I am deeply disturbed by this obvious programming direction.

       Autism rates rising? Don't worry, it's cool! Like radiation used to be! Remember how cool shit happened in the cartoons when someone got exposed to radiation? Well, same thing now, but ... with autism!

       Or, maybe programme makers know alot of people experience this reality of autistic children and know it's a market. Tv just shows what you know to you so you keep watching. Autism is fashionable. Go with that.

       Parent of autistic kid here. I'm not sure about people being ostracized for wanting to help their autistic kids, at least I never have been. To me, "embracing" my autistic kid means accepting that he'll never be like the neurotypical kids. That doesn't mean he can't be good or great at things in his own way. But I've seen plenty of parents who
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       embrace their AU child that way. There are caregivers who will break their kid's little spirit trying to fit them into the neurotypical-kid mold. Some caregivers break worse than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see normalization the same way you do I think. Anytime someone has a disability, especially one that affects your behavior, you're automatically labeled in a group consciousness as "not fitting in." My son is still too young to reach the real bullying age, and he's in a special ed class anyway, but if he were to be bullied, he'd never understand it. It makes it worse imo. I don't see normalizing autism as a way to get people to prefer autism over any outcome (that's the job of pro-vaxxers), but more as a means to get people to stop kicking the autistic kids simply because they're autistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with the double standard when it comes to downs. both downs and autism generate some of the sweetest, most loving human beings on this planet. They're both, however, life sentences of struggle in their own ways. Why does only one struggle deserve to be eliminated?

       Totally agree with you and I have no problem with autism acceptance in itself. I just think some people are using it to maker antivaxxers look like bad people. I'm glad you  personally haven't dealt with people being mean to you about trying to help your kid. It's all over reddit though.

       Full disclosure: I'm pro-vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Validity of the belief aside, try to keep in mind that these people who strongly believe that people who fail to vaccinate their children are actively endangering innocent children's lives - maybe even their own children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people want to view themselves as nice people, and therefore need to repress many aggressive impulses throughout the day. If they logon to Reddit and see somebody questioning the safety of vaccines, they now feel free to unload a bunch of verbal abuse onto this person. They get to blow off steam and feel like a good person because they've picked a target who deserves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind that they're still acting like an asshole while doing nothing to help persuade antivaxxers to change their stance. Because nobody is going to listen to someone who is implying or flat-out stating that they're stupid and evil.

       The number of Aspergers folks who will get on and attempt to tear into anti-vax parents for not loving or accepting their autistic children "enough". Or that whole "you'd rather have a dead child than an autistic child."
      </p>
      <p>
       So many of them, higher-functioning, claiming to represent the "face" of autism.  Not seeming to understand they DON'T represent ALL the faces of autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still uncomfortable with the AMA's/DSM people to drop the designation of "Aspergers" and instead use "autistic" for everyone.  Because of this... Because so many people out there assume that, under this umbrella, all autistic kids are merely "quirky" or "eccentric."  They don't get the whole spectrum of autism.

       Down syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person has one too many chromosomes, meaning you can take cell from a fetus and determine wheter it has down syndrome.

      <p>
       Autism is a neurological...quirk which is diagnosed through psychological observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can determine wheter a fetus is going to become a baby with down syndrome, and kill it to prevent a life of suffering. You can't psychologically diagnose a fetus however.

       Eh? What double standard?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some points:
      </p>
      <p>
       The linking of autism to MMR jabs is weak, at best. A lot of shitty parents looking for someone/thing to blame for their shitty parenting is more likely.  Autism is never lauded as being a positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iceland eradicating downs from the genepool is astounding! Downs is a genetic dysfunction. Getting rid of it is great. Just because downs people are sweet doesn't make me want a downs kid, and I'm sure most parents would agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point you make is a false equivalency. One is about embracing your own childs difference or disability, while the other is making sure no parent is forced to embrace a sick child who cannot be cured.

       There are degrees of autism. Many doctors are happy tp diagnose on the scale as they can medicate and forget. We live in an age where we try to medicate children into behaving properly, and a lot of that stems from people having kids who don't know shit about the world they live in, never mind bringing up well adjusted individuals with a full range of social manners and mechanisms for coping in an incedibly complicated world.

       Kind of a rant. Could go on. It's a topic i feel strongly on. A lot of people like to pass the buck rather than accept they made mistakes.

       They have this "ideal" man stereotype.

       Move 1 mark above or below it on any parameter and you will be diagnosed with X now.

       Worst part is people actually take pride in the labels and almost want their kids to be "special".

       If you think vaccines cause autism- you probably eat McDonalds, Subway, &amp; microwavable for dinners 20 times a week.

       Enjoy your Big Mac tonight, while people who don't have measles (nor the threat of any other vaccinatable disease) enjoy a salad.  Blame 3 shots you got @ 3 y/o, rather than your selected lifestyle of personal, leisurely poison and abuse of human biology... :)

       Can I ask how you came to that conclusion? The few anti-vaxxers I know IRL tend to be healthy eaters suspicious of GMO/fast food/processed stuff.

       I cant offer any evidence, or relevant science for that matter haha.  My best answer to that would be- I value a real conspiracy.
&amp;nbsp;
When something so lackluster comes about, I can sorta see right through it.  Like all the paper trails, appointments, doctors offices, certifications, studies of the diseases being dealt with, record keeping of patients &amp; payments, etc that is necessary to get these vaccines.  If you wanted to subliminally give a kid autism, wouldn't you just give em the shot behind closed doors?  I guess that's an aspect of a conspiracy, though...
&amp;nbsp;
I think time could be better spent looking into other things... like why are there microwaves in every single household?  Is that form of radiation really ok?  I mean they only became a household appliance in the 1960s.  There are so many weird things like that I just cant shake...
&amp;nbsp;
I think I'm just interested in other things!

       I work with a guy who has weaponized autism and they don't seem like fun people.  generally makes everything very awkward and about them.   now I have to go to some special training so we know how to work with them better.  i'll be calling in sick that day.

       For one thing, you can't eliminate autism in that way so you have to deal with it.

       Down's Syndrome kids are indeed some of the nicest, sweetest kids.  I love them.  However, would I rather have a nice DS kid, or a kid that's an occasional jerk but that
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       have DS?  I think almost everyone would prefer the latter, honestly.  Just saying.

       Also, there's no breakthrough in medical science happening in Iceland. Downs syndrome occurs randomly and you can't prevent it from happening to a fetus. All you can do to eliminate people with Downs syndrome is abort them. They're not eliminating Down's syndrome, they're just killing everyone who has it.

       Or, maybe programme makers know alot of people experience this reality of autistic children and know it's a market. Tv just shows what you know to you so you keep watching. Autism is fashionable. Go with that.
