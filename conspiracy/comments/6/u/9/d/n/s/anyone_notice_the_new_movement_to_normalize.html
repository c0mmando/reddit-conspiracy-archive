    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad more people are picking up on this, despite Autism having worse outcomes than Downs Syndrome...</p>

<p>Official propaganda on Downs Syndrome =  Kill them in the womb, it&#39;s cruel for them to be born and bad for society to have to pay for them.  You are a bad parent if you don&#39;t kill your unborn Downs Syndrome child.</p>

<p>Official Propaganda on Autism = It&#39;s great, good fun, people with Autism like having Autism.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s going on here?  Yes, you worked it out, the pharmaceutical industry knows that one day the truth will come out about vaccines causing Autism (it already has come out because the media have been intimidated not to go near it).  So this is the pharmaceutical Plan B, when the truth does come out they will say &quot;We were doing those kids a favor by giving them Autism, their families should be grateful, no need to send us to jail for crimes against humanity&quot;.  So the industry uses it&#39;s tentacles to spread their propaganda into the media, which the media repeats as they&#39;re all in bed together.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Could you elaborate or provide a source? My understanding, albeit limited, is that there are very high functioning autistic people on the spectrum, you may not even know they have it. I would imagine their outcomes are much better than those with Downs Syndrome. I have seen very severe cases of Autism and I imagine that is probably comparable or sometimes worse than Downs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Severe autism is a condition that usually requires the person to be taken care of completely for their entire life. Unable to communicate, usually unable to provide self care and many of them are violent due to their senses being either dull or very heightened (they might hear things average people can&#39;t, but they might not be able to smell or taste--which leads to frustration and violence) Autistic individuals do not have a chromosomal condition and their risk for disease and health problems unrelated to autism is the same as the average person. </p>

<p>People with Down&#39;s generally are able to care for themselves, communicate and may be able to hold a job. Because they have a chromosomal issue, they generally have low IQ and they are very susceptible to heart issues and dementia with a life span of about 40 years old. Down&#39;s is MUCH more manageable condition compared to severe autism. </p>

<p>Let me stress that high functioning autism is also no &quot;walk in the park&quot; either. My brother who is an adult, has it and is extremely intelligent, yet he has issues making friends, driving, and is susceptible to being manipulated by scams etc. He lives at home with my parents and always will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that changes my perspective.</p>

<p>I can totally see how outcomes for autistic people are worse than those with Downs, especially due to the social isolation factor. Speculation on my part: having issues being social and making friends while also being intelligent would probably lead a lot of internal turmoil trying to grapple with why you don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not speaking for <a href="/u/lucycohen">/u/lucycohen</a></p>

<p>There are studies that show that intrauterine estrogen levels may affect sexuality. I&#39;m just venturing here, so bear with me. If a women is taking hormonal contraceptive it could affect her intrauterine estrogen levels. This could happen if she cycled off of the pill in order to purposefully become pregnant or got pregnant while on contraceptives. Also, some of the contraceptives like the Depo-Provera shot last for like 6 months, but it&#39;s not outlandish to think that a women&#39;s hormones are still imbalance when she can become pregnant again.</p>

<p>As for pre-contraceptive homosexuality, I&#39;m sure there are many factors that could affect people&#39;s brain chemistry in regards to sexuality, whether it be genetic, intrauterine, and/or even nurture.</p>

<p>Of all the pollutants/chemicals/preservatives floating around that so many people are exposed to right now, how many of them are being physically injected into our bodies, flowing through the circulatory/immune system, and as we know know, physically reaching the brain (through the recently discovered direct vascular connection between brain and immune system?)</p>

<p>And why is it affecting the youngest of our population in ever-increasing numbers?  </p>

<p>To me this is a logic thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually, my thought is that it&#39;s probably the vaccines.  It&#39;s more likely to be the stuff we&#39;re shooting directly into our bodies, than the stuff that doesn&#39;t breach that inside/outside barrier (or it does, but to a lesser extent).  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also welcome the study.  I think at some point it&#39;s going to be inevitable for it, if the CDC wants to convince the growing numbers of parents putting the brakes on their children&#39;s vaccines, of their safety.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just in the last 2 months, my family has watched 3 movies in which they were definitely trying to normalize autism. Normalize it? Hell, they were trying to sell it as a kinda cool thing to have. The recurring themes were &quot;autistic people can understand things we don&#39;t, autistic people have abilities we don&#39;t, autistic people can recognize patterns we don&#39;t, autistic people are better at this than we are ...&quot;</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t tell you the names of these piece of shit movies; my family watches them while I work around the house and catch snippets of the brainwashing. One of em was a horror in which the autistic kid could see spirits that no one else could.</p>

<p>I am deeply disturbed by this obvious programming direction. </p>

<p>Autism rates rising? Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s cool! Like radiation used to be! Remember how cool shit happened in the cartoons when someone got exposed to radiation? Well, same thing now, but ... with autism!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parent of autistic kid here. I&#39;m not sure about people being ostracized for wanting to help their autistic kids, at least I never have been. To me, &quot;embracing&quot; my autistic kid means accepting that he&#39;ll never be like the neurotypical kids. That doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t be good or great at things in his own way. But I&#39;ve seen plenty of parents who <em>can&#39;t</em> embrace their AU child that way. There are caregivers who will break their kid&#39;s little spirit trying to fit them into the neurotypical-kid mold. Some caregivers break worse than that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see normalization the same way you do I think. Anytime someone has a disability, especially one that affects your behavior, you&#39;re automatically labeled in a group consciousness as &quot;not fitting in.&quot; My son is still too young to reach the real bullying age, and he&#39;s in a special ed class anyway, but if he were to be bullied, he&#39;d never understand it. It makes it worse imo. I don&#39;t see normalizing autism as a way to get people to prefer autism over any outcome (that&#39;s the job of pro-vaxxers), but more as a means to get people to stop kicking the autistic kids simply because they&#39;re autistic. </p>

<p>I do agree with the double standard when it comes to downs. both downs and autism generate some of the sweetest, most loving human beings on this planet. They&#39;re both, however, life sentences of struggle in their own ways. Why does only one struggle deserve to be eliminated?</p>

<p>Most people want to view themselves as nice people, and therefore need to repress many aggressive impulses throughout the day. If they logon to Reddit and see somebody questioning the safety of vaccines, they now feel free to unload a bunch of verbal abuse onto this person.

<p>Some points:</p>

<p>The linking of autism to MMR jabs is weak, at best. A lot of shitty parents looking for someone/thing to blame for their shitty parenting is more likely.  Autism is never lauded as being a positive.</p>

<p>Iceland eradicating downs from the genepool is astounding! Downs is a genetic dysfunction. Getting rid of it is great. Just because downs people are sweet doesn&#39;t make me want a downs kid, and I&#39;m sure most parents would agree.</p>

<p>The point you make is a false equivalency. One is about embracing your own childs difference or disability, while the other is making sure no parent is forced to embrace a sick child who cannot be cured.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve probably been doing this your whole life, meaning your parents fed you chemicals that could have preserved a full grown dinosaur corpse- flesh and bone, since you were 3 months.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Enjoy your Big Mac tonight, while people who don&#39;t have measles (nor the threat of any other vaccinatable disease) enjoy a salad.  Blame 3 shots you got @ 3 y/o, rather than your selected lifestyle of personal, leisurely poison and abuse of human biology... :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant offer any evidence, or relevant science for that matter haha.  My best answer to that would be- I value a real conspiracy.
&amp;nbsp;
When something so lackluster comes about, I can sorta see right through it.  Like all the paper trails, appointments, doctors offices, certifications, studies of the diseases being dealt with, record keeping of patients &amp; payments, etc that is necessary to get these vaccines.  If you wanted to subliminally give a kid autism, wouldn&#39;t you just give em the shot behind closed doors?  I guess that&#39;s an aspect of a conspiracy, though...
&amp;nbsp;
I think time could be better spent looking into other things... like why are there microwaves in every single household?  Is that form of radiation really ok?  I mean they only became a household appliance in the 1960s.  There are so many weird things like that I just cant shake...
&amp;nbsp;
I think I&#39;m just interested in other things!</p>

All you can do to eliminate people with Downs syndrome is abort them. They&#39;re not eliminating Down&#39;s syndrome, they&#39;re just killing everyone who has it.</p>
