       Some of the greatest minds in physics have known that the Universe is not a purely mechanistic, materialist, reductionist phenomena.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”
       </p>
       <p>
        "Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of the Universe"
       </p>
       <p>
        "The total number of minds in the Universe is one"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ― Erwin Schrödinger
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobel prize 1933, enormously advanced quantum physics
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -- Max Planck
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Birthed Quantum Mechanics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -- Werner Heisenberg
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobel prize 1932, enormously advanced quantum physics
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -- John Archibald Wheeler
      </p>
      <p>
       Coined "black hole" to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in the 20th century, and coined the terms "quantum foam", "neutron moderator", "wormhole" and "it from bit".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Metaphysical has been science’s designation for all weightless phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long suspected — like it or not — life is but a dream."
       </p>

      <p>
       Second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983, architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -- Albert Einstein
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobel Prize in Physics 1921
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”
       </p>

      <p>
       -- James Maxwell
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most profound physicists of all time. Greatly advanced understanding of electromagnetic fields
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.

       -- Paul Dirac
      </p>

       He talks about lucid dreaming and what it's like - then applies that analogy to life and calls it lucid living.

       Lucid dreaming seems so important to the sciences of consciousness, but no one seems to care that it exists at all. Most people scoff when I attempt to explain it.

       You're definitely on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know or want to make assumptions about your experiences and whether or not you've done this already, so this may as well just be for anyone else reading this. But next time you lucid dream, try seeing past the dream reality you're creating. If you let it break away, you can enter the divine space behind the veil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The break through, transdimensional experience doesn't have to be solely induced by potent psychedelic compounds like DMT. It's an endemic process of human consciousness imo/e, and lucid dreaming makes it very accessible.

       Lucid dreaming starts with simple questioning and awareness. "Why isn't that light switch working?" "Is this the same text I was just reading before?" "How many fingers do I have?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a habit of checking your surroundings and you'll start to realize when you're in a dream.

       Entering hyperspace through only your dreams is a phenomenal experience, and it can easily lead to the realizations of one-ness outlined in some of the quotes above

       .  Their sidebar has some great info.

      <p>
       To add to your suggestions, I found it helpful to also repeat "Tonight I'm going to take control of my dreams" over and over as I'm falling asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems difficult to me is to apply lucid dreaming to "real" or "awake" life.  But Tim Freke says it's entirely possible and he talks about it in his vids.  Great stuff.

       You always dream when sleeping, you're just not recalling them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a bit of effort and persistence to recall them, but if you make a regular attempt to remember them right when you wake up, the amount you're able to recall will dramatically increase

       Albeit it beautiful, the physical universe only represents a fraction of what this all is. And, according to mathematical models by Einstein, information and thereby consciousness, is contained in and shared by energy. If that's true this physical universe is beautiful but only a backdrop for this reality.

       If the opinion of scientists are something of value then it is a pretty heavy indictment of theism. Scientists are polled as one of the most non theist groups you will find.  As we become even more knowledgeable in science and philosophy, this becomes even more true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of those quotes are pretty,  and it should be noted they all lived in a culture that was over 90% theist. It should also be noted that those brilliant people have never come up with a half way reasonable argument for theism.

       They're not describing theism. "God" and "consciousness" are synonymous terms that describe the oneness of the universe. Matter arose from consciousness (the base code of the universe) but while that might imply consciousness as the "creator" that's not to say it came first or anything, but emerged simultaneously. Each need the other to exist relative to anything else. It might make a great deal more of sense if you use physics terms to redefine your idea of God rather than using the concept of God to explain physics.

       There's no way you read that post in that short a time. And it completely does address consciousness. Here's the link to the post directly

       You're right. My bad, I was misremembering the post from the subreddit that had the particular bit of info, so sorry about that. But I've found it. Or at least a part.

       There's some subsections 3/4 of the way down relevant. One is "fibbonaci/sacred geometry" and the one following is "consciousness", though it's relatively short.
       <br/>
       I suppose my concept of consciousness had been pieced together by lots and lots of little bits of information over time that fit together to form what I think I understand today. I want to note that where, in the consciousness subsection, it says "a magical property of the brain" I wouldn't use the word "magical", but instead "quantum". And also if you bear with me for a little bit I have some posts or comments I've written myself which I believe help describe the concept. I'll stick some links in edits when I find them.

       How reliable do you suppose the entire edifice of science is considering it's virtually all based on determining the so-called "reality of nature" without ever even having so much as a clue about the "nature of reality" itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do physical events have physical causes or is it merely a belief that they do which inclines us to see and pick-out from what is actually an ongoing sequence of events some whose proximity to others simply leads us to believe that they caused what seemingly followed them? From any genuine quantum perspective ALL physicality and physical events are "effects" whose genuine cause lies elsewhere and beyond the three dimensions those "physical effects" all occur in.

       Everything that was said here coincides nicely with "Conversations with God", a trilogy I read a while back. I don't agree with everything in those books, but I have taken most of it to heart. They have certainly changed my perspective on life. I highly recommend checking them out.

       I'm getting caught up in this. Raised catholic and hated being forced into it. I've strayed a long time but it's possible that God or the oneness or the spirit is the answer and it's been there the whole time. I'm ready to dissolve being sepa rate and join back into the spirit. Why I'm stuck in the world is beyond me but I know if I have a choice I'd stay quiet and obedient if I ever return.

       Experiencing existence in our current, 3 dimensional and physical reality isn't a bad thing. We still experience existence and consciousness, even if it's just a fraction and confused understanding of what existence has to offer. Embrace it and look on with bright eyes full of hope and wonderment towards what awaits us.

       That's a dumb fuck thing to say. If ants with the ganglion the size of a pin can organize into complex social networks then the human brain can give rise to consciousness and self realization. It's not too small you're just too fucking stupid.

       This is the Truth. Reposted from another comment....
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The truth is....The bible is somewhat true. God created Adam and Eve in the garden of eden. Adam and Eve were given the power to will into existense anything they needed. Lucifer saw gods experiment and said "What good is it if they have no knowledge of what they are doing? They have no free will to truly create the world around them. This is more like watching fish in a fish tank" So lucifer went down to talk to Adam and said "Hey buddy did you know you can create literally anything you need simply by thinking about it?". Adam did not understand. Lucifer said "I can show you how your power really works but it comes with free will. And free will comes with the poetential for abuse." Adam agreed and suddenly the world around him was transformed from a simple sandbox to an overwhelming amount of complexity! Like teaching a 4 year old 2 +2 and then suddenly telling him hes been doing calculus all along and the equaion actually looks like y(2x4+y)dydx=(1−4xy2)x2! Free will gave Adam and eve the ability to change all aspects of the world around them but it also made them awaken to the complexity of the world god had created! Suddenly it wasn't so easy to will an apple tree into existense, instead adam was frustrated and wondered how he could create something so complex!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Being that adam and eve were the only 2 humans the power was strong between the two of them. They were still able to get what they needed for the most part but life went from being a breeze to being a struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with free will came the ability to procreate which is where we doomed ourselves. You see the more we make copies of ourselves the weaker the power gets. The power of will gets spread out amongst the whole population and is often muddied by conflicting wants and desires.
Collectivism and group think help regain the power of will but it is getting weaker by the day as the population grows.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The power of will is confirmed in the movie "The Secret" where it was confirmed the the illuminati have had knowledge of this power for hundreds of years and have been using it for just as longs.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you want something bad enough and focus and use the techniques from the movie "The Secret" you will get what you want but it is much more difficult then it was back in the day due to poulation growth.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        We are literally creating the world around us and have full control of our destiny but we lack the ability to fathom the complexities of our power to properly harness it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This basic explanation also explains why elites are war mongers. The elites and illuminati use the secret to gain money and power but after a while the power diminishes as population grows so the elites manufacture wars to kill off millions and the slate is wiped clean. The secret power of will regains strength and the elites rake in cash hand over fist after wars.
Why do you think people turn to religion? Any and all religion? They gain a cohesive collective belief in religion and first hand they witness the power of will through their collective beliefs and thought. This is exactly why the elites favor one religion but also attempt to destroy all other religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracies about the elites sacrificing babies and worshiping lucifer?? All true. The elites worship lucifer because lucifer gave man free will. the elites sacrifice children because they can feel the power of will grow through experiencing the fresh souls death first hand. It is important for them to fully believe in the power of the secret because they need their collective will to gain money and power.

       It's funny in a way. Science pours unimaginable effort into figuring out the most fundamental structure of reality. But shies away from anything to do with consciousness itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet it's only because of conscious self-awareness that we can perceive or care to investigate the universe we live in. We study the nature of a universe that gave rise to conscious self awareness. But we barely think about the relationship between the two.

       Even the most learned mind may encounter something that cannot be explained, and when this happens, they may resort to grand statements like this.   It looks better to say 'It cannot be known' instead of 'I don't know.'

       The english language just fails at some point. They're not going to be using the word 'god' in the same way. To the extent that there's still more to know, sure 'god' exists. We are so obviously going to be incapable of comprehending such an entity that it's largely immaterial.

       Down to science as far down as possible though! Plus anything that isn't nihilism has its appeal of course.

       You're definitely on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know or want to make assumptions about your experiences and whether or not you've done this already, so this may as well just be for anyone else reading this. But next time you lucid dream, try seeing past the dream reality you're creating. If you let it break away, you can enter the divine space behind the veil.
      </p>

       The break through, transdimensional experience doesn't have to be solely induced by potent psychedelic compounds like DMT. It's an endemic process of human consciousness imo/e, and lucid dreaming makes it very accessible.

       Yeah - I agree.  Consciousness and it's nature is something I've been exploring for the last few years and wow...it's a wild ride. :)
