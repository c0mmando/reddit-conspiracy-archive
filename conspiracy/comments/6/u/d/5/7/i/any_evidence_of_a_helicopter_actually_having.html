       All I can find pictures of are smoke, flames, pyrotechnics. Haven't seen any pictures of wreckage or anything resembling a helicopter crash though it was said to have been in a residential neighborhood.

       I believe in the possibility of false flags. I don't believe that every single bad thing that happens in the world is a false flag like some folks here do. Like this guy above who posted the tmz video of the crash site. He is 8/10 sure that it is fake. WTF is he talking about!? Looks like a helicopter with a full tank of gas crashed and burning to me. The person filming even points out the shredded trees where the chopper came through. What would even be the point of faking some helicopter crash where two cops died? To snatch your guns? Give me a break.

       No. I think it crashed because of an accident. Cars crash, helicopters crash, accidents happen. I see zero evidence of anything fishy going on. Sometimes helicopters crash. I'm sure the FAA is investigating it. It might take a minute for them to figure out why it crashed. I'll wait for the report before I just start believing in some completely unfounded, wild speculation.

       the helicopte rcrash was supposed to be the sad accident connected to a staged protest, but the moron that drove the car actually killed that girl, so plan A was scrapped, plan B which was salvage what could be, and hide all evidence of staging.
      </p>
      <p>
       the photo of the black dude levitating in the air behind the car and the two or three peeps up in the air with feet up high is photoshop, and made before the event, the videos do not show any of those people in the street or near the car.

       A very good question I think a lot of us are asking, especially because it kept being reported it was connected to the the people getting run over, (roping the two trooper deaths into the whole body count) but yet there hasn't been any additional information released as far as I've seen. 
If Indeed this was an orchestrated event, common sense makes me think whoever was involved in it has had plenty of practice and skill pulling off things like this before.

       I certainly never heard that it was "brought down" by anyone. The reason that it crashed has not been disclosed because the FAA is probably still investigating it. It will most likely be some form of operator error. The only reason it was mentioned in the same sentence as the other violence is that the whole reason it was in the air in the first place was to watch the protesters. It's not like anyone said it was shot down with an RPG or something. This whole thing is potato-grade dumb.

       Unless I missed something and demonstrators brought some sort of anti-aircraft ordinance, I'm at a loss there too. Probably banking on people hearing the soundbites and blaming it on the driver of the challenger. I almost think it would've raised less eyebrows among like minded folk if they didn't even report the crash, plenty of "training exercises gone wrong" happen all the time (more often than not military) and most people read it, believe it, and don't think anything else about it.

       I will try to find the article. but on the night it happened I read about it on r/news. The article I read had a sentence that seemed out of place to me. The article claimed that "neighbors saw the helicopter flying low, then land in the woods."  An continues the article as if the crash happened but never explaining why.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the second sentence to stand out to me that day. As earlier I had read an article where it said police were beating each other with batons. hahaha..if only they would malfunction that way.

       Prove? Maybe nothing, or maybe it was a honesty being reported during the chaos. I found it strange that an article about a helo crash reports the neighbors saw it land in the woods. It stuck out to me, but I went back to work an forgot until I saw this post an it reminded me of what I read.

       Think about that.  What are chances of a helicopter just randomly malfuncating and two cops get killed in the crash.   Couple that with it happened exactly when this car attack occurred.  I do wonder if they were gonna have some alt right cop killing nazi story on standy by?

       I personally know that those cops died. That is not a conspiracy. I know a good friend of the wife of the pilot. Someone who would not lie about this and is suffering though a tragedy.

       I literally know for a fact that those cops died. How they died I have no clue but the official story.  But I know that they are dead. Not joking.

       Did anyone doubt those people really died? Op's implication seems to be that no helicopter may have actually crashed, not that those people didn't die.

       Kind of reminds me of the camo man who was apprehended running into the woods near Sandy Hook. Just kind of a bizarre detail on the periphery of a false flag event that makes us say "wtf?" and could indicate there was a change of plans or something went awry, or could just be a total distraction to obfuscate the chain of events that they know we will be analyzing.

       So, you have black smoke and a helicopter in the sky, but no helicopter crashing? BTW, this comment is 4 days old... How did you even come across it?
