       Let me start off by saying that I'm just a small town kid. I've never been to LA, New York, Chicago, etc. So I don't have a crystal clear world view. But I know that racism has never (in my life) been nearly as much of an issue as it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it so much of an issue right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans are being manipulated. Everyday you look at the news and there's another story about how racist America is. America wasn't racist until media outlets started insisting that it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes beyond just racism. It includes sexism, religion, sexual orientation, gender variation, political opinions, every issue that divides us into two teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every news program is "The Two Minutes Hate." Each station has their own Goldstein. Turns out, Goldstein isn't real. He's never been real. He never will be real. He's a manufactured enemy of the people. But as long as he keeps popping up on the screen, for 2 minutes every day, nobody can undeniably prove that he is a fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.

       A great example of a lie that people believe because they've heard it repeated!
      </p>
      <p>
       The confederate states were so inured to the evil of slavery that they openly admitted, in great detail, that they were seceding in order to preserve it. Specifically, because they thought Lincoln and the northern states were going to end it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       South Carolina:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Texas:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Civil War was about slavery. The Confederacy admitted it, you can too.

       Racism isn't something that just popped up. Obama was scorned because he was black. Trump's campaign used the overtly racist southern strategy to beat hillbot. Trump's rhetoric emboldened these morons. They think he's on their side and from my view, he is.

       Not really. I just don't buy the dominant narrative. It's funny, but people here complain about msm this and that, yet they eat up what the trump admin says and does. There's literally posts and users asking why you can't have white pride or say white power when you can have black pride. The absurdity of this sub is immeasurable

        Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is calling Donald Trump's electoral victory "one of the most exciting nights of my life."

       I'm not denying that white supremacists are supportive of trump. I'm mostly referring to the events of the past week, but I think it's a big musical choreographed to make you feel and act a certain way about things.

       The best way to figure out the reasons is to analyze the actors making this happen. We could probably get a good glimpse of it by analyzing the forums of advertisement. Why did

       To some people, sure.  What's fascinating about all these events is seeing just how many people can't think for themselves, and the consequence of that - how many people don't know what values they should stand for.  The scale of it is off the hook.  IMO, this is the result of the inculcation of hierarchical thinking.  Quite telling.

        Hierarchical thinking?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yeah the programming of people since birth into ceding personal choices to others (I call them "Heroes").  acceptance of hierarchy, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       hierarchy as a general design is really shitty at modelling problem domains and organizing things.  it suffers from some very basic problems that will never go away, that are inherent to the design.  for instance, the nodes in a hierarchy, being human, all fail the same expected modalities (coercion, being wrong, having limited scale, having narrow domain knowledge, single point of failure, etc.).  hierarchical systems tends to also mutate/manage themselves in the same shitty ways.   for instance, they tend to create barriers to entry into positions of hierarchy that are unattainable to everyone else but a select few.  they devolve into priesthoods.  the incentives of entitlement devolve into unaccountability.  there's just a whole bunch of repeatably observable patterns associated with how hierarchy, in general, behaves.  and on top of all of that, the actual data structure of hierarchy is really really bad at adding complexity.  there are quite real limits to how you can use this pattern to model a domain.  software and db guys see this all the time when they use tech that follows this design principle.  it's a fucking well known problem.  basically it's a Bad Design and should be avoided as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       the design pattern that does work to do the same functions that hierarchy attempts to do is the narrative/phi/decorator type pattern.  appending information in a sequential format that further clarifies the thing being modelled.  that's why most of human knowledge is held in books.  books use this design pattern.  it's the best way of modelling domains that we have as humans.  and this pattern applies as well to how systems of governance can work.  so the fact that we eschew a better design for a shittier design is really really problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       and we're indoctrinated into this thinking pattern from birth basically.  it's quite a bad layer to inject so early on.

       Are you saying that the Jim Crowe era never died? There is 100% a difference between then and now. I'm not saying that there was a time when nobody had a racist thought, but to say racism never subsided just isn't accurate

       We're polarizing. Let's try to meet back in the middle somewhere.

       I was saying before, I think racism has subsided, things we're getting better, until recently. I don't think it has ever died, but it definitely wasn't what it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked out your link, and so what I think is that racism still plays a role in people's perception. Referencing law enforcement and student discipline.

      <p>
       I don't think there is an institutional conspiracy to keep minorities poor. I think it's a sustaining loop. Minorities don't get the best jobs, they have less money, they go to poorer schools for poorer education, which leads to worse jobs. Not because corporations simply won't hire minorities or because good schools won't enroll them.

       Fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to travel to gain a broader perspective. If you haven't, try making a concerted effort to talk to some black people about their experiences. Face to face is best, but social media is better than nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's dangerous to come to conclusions based on a limited perspective. The normal human instinct is to defend our statements and beliefs, even if contradictory evidence arises--staking out a strong position therefore makes it difficult to objectively evaluate evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously feel that you have a limited perspective on the world, as it was the first thing you told us. The best thing you could do with your time and energy is changing that. Instead of making speeches about how the world is, why not go learn more about how the world is? Ask more questions than you give answers.

       On the one hand, I agree with you that their goal is to divide and conquer. At the same time, are you saying that the Nazi/White Supremacist March wasn't real? Are you saying that the woman wasn't murdered? Because those events are very real. And it's good that the news makes us aware of this cancer eating away at our democracy.

       Why do you think racism wasn't an issue in America when you admit you have a limited worldview? I also grew up in a small town and I still saw racism. Mostly crap like saying our football team didn't have a chance against the bigger schools cause they had more black athletes.

       I say I have a limited worldview because I'm not insinuating that I know everything and racism is totally nonexistent. I'm saying that up until this point I haven't heard a lot about it, I think a lot of people would agree with me on that. But that doesn't make it not exist. And just because I can't prove it doesn't exist doesn't mean it does exist. We're not dealing with absolutes, but I'm saying that right now it is escalating more than it has ever been in my experience.

       I guess the question is, is the media reporting it because it's happening more or is it happening more because the media is reporting it?

       I think currently it's a bit of a media fad after the horrible car attack incident. Bad news gets more viewers. I predict it will be less prevalent in the media as soon as the next bad event happens for them to talk about.

       Why do so many people who believe in real freedom think that we collectively have to do away with racism.  I should be allowed to hate anyone for any reason I so choose and everyone else should be able to do the same.  The only time it becomes crossing any line whatsoever is when I act on that.  actions are the only think that can infringe on someone elses rights.

       I think "those morons" are another Goldstein. Why would anyone publicly endorse someone they want to do well through the voice of hatred? It's another division tactic. And its working.

       If you've been paying attention, they are pushing the racism agenda. But I'm not saying we haven't or currently dealing with racism. If people actually watch MSM, the will begin to think they way they are being told to think...

       Are you saying that the Jim Crowe era never died? There is 100% a difference between then and now. I'm not saying that there was a time when nobody had a racist thought, but to say racism never subsided just isn't accurate
