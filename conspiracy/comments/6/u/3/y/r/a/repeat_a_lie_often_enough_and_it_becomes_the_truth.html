I&#39;ve never been to LA, New York, Chicago, etc. So I don&#39;t have a crystal clear world view. But I know that racism has never (in my life) been nearly as much of an issue as it is today.</p>

<p>So why is it so much of an issue right now? </p>

<p>Americans are being manipulated. Everyday you look at the news and there&#39;s another story about how racist America is. America wasn&#39;t racist until media outlets started insisting that it was. </p>

<p>It goes beyond just racism. It includes sexism, religion, sexual orientation, gender variation, political opinions, every issue that divides us into two teams.</p>

<p>Every news program is &quot;The Two Minutes Hate.&quot; Each station has their own Goldstein. Turns out, Goldstein isn&#39;t real. He&#39;s never been real. He never will be real. He&#39;s a manufactured enemy of the people. But as long as he keeps popping up on the screen, for 2 minutes every day, nobody can undeniably prove that he is a fake.</p>

<p>Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A great example of a lie that people believe because they&#39;ve heard it repeated!</p>

<p>The confederate states were so inured to the evil of slavery that they openly admitted, in great detail, that they were seceding in order to preserve it. Specifically, because they thought Lincoln and the northern states were going to end it.</p>

<p>Mississippi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>South Carolina:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Texas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Civil War was about slavery. The Confederacy admitted it, you can too.</p>

<p>To some people, sure.  What&#39;s fascinating about all these events is seeing just how many people can&#39;t think for themselves, and the consequence of that - how many people don&#39;t know what values they should stand for.  The scale of it is off the hook.  IMO, this is the result of the inculcation of hierarchical thinking.  Quite telling.</p>

<p>Hierarchical thinking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah the programming of people since birth into ceding personal choices to others (I call them &quot;Heroes&quot;).  acceptance of hierarchy, basically.  </p>

<p>hierarchy as a general design is really shitty at modelling problem domains and organizing things.  it suffers from some very basic problems that will never go away, that are inherent to the design.  for instance, the nodes in a hierarchy, being human, all fail the same expected modalities (coercion, being wrong, having limited scale, having narrow domain knowledge, single point of failure, etc.).  hierarchical systems tends to also mutate/manage themselves in the same shitty ways.   for instance, they tend to create barriers to entry into positions of hierarchy that are unattainable to everyone else but a select few.  they devolve into priesthoods.  the incentives of entitlement devolve into unaccountability.  there&#39;s just a whole bunch of repeatably observable patterns associated with how hierarchy, in general, behaves.  and on top of all of that, the actual data structure of hierarchy is really really bad at adding complexity.  there are quite real limits to how you can use this pattern to model a domain.  software and db guys see this all the time when they use tech that follows this design principle.  it&#39;s a fucking well known problem.  basically it&#39;s a Bad Design and should be avoided as much as possible.  </p>

<p>the design pattern that does work to do the same functions that hierarchy attempts to do is the narrative/phi/decorator type pattern.  appending information in a sequential format that further clarifies the thing being modelled.  that&#39;s why most of human knowledge is held in books.  books use this design pattern.  it&#39;s the best way of modelling domains that we have as humans.  and this pattern applies as well to how systems of governance can work.  so the fact that we eschew a better design for a shittier design is really really problematic.</p>

<p>and we&#39;re indoctrinated into this thinking pattern from birth basically.  it&#39;s quite a bad layer to inject so early on.</p>

<p>When you start your post by pointing out that you have a limited perspective, great--that&#39;s self-awareness. But you forgot the limitations on that perspective almost immediately.</p>

<p>Why do you think racism isn&#39;t a thing in America anymore? Especially when white nationalists openly assemble and chant Nazi slogans? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some information that challenges your perspective: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/02/civil-rights-act-anniversary-racism-charts_n_5521104.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/02/civil-rights-act-anniversary-racism-charts_n_5521104.html</a></p>

<p>Even if the rally hadn&#39;t happened, it would still be counterfactual to claim that racism was ever not a part of the American experience. Take a look at the link I sent for some quick examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re polarizing. Let&#39;s try to meet back in the middle somewhere. </p>

<p>I was saying before, I think racism has subsided, things we&#39;re getting better, until recently. I don&#39;t think it has ever died, but it definitely wasn&#39;t what it used to be.</p>

<p>I checked out your link, and so what I think is that racism still plays a role in people&#39;s perception. Referencing law enforcement and student discipline.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an institutional conspiracy to keep minorities poor. I think it&#39;s a sustaining loop. Minorities don&#39;t get the best jobs, they have less money, they go to poorer schools for poorer education, which leads to worse jobs. Not because corporations simply won&#39;t hire minorities or because good schools won&#39;t enroll them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to travel to gain a broader perspective. If you haven&#39;t, try making a concerted effort to talk to some black people about their experiences. Face to face is best, but social media is better than nothing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dangerous to come to conclusions based on a limited perspective. The normal human instinct is to defend our statements and beliefs, even if contradictory evidence arises--staking out a strong position therefore makes it difficult to objectively evaluate evidence.</p>

<p>You obviously feel that you have a limited perspective on the world, as it was the first thing you told us. The best thing you could do with your time and energy is changing that. Instead of making speeches about how the world is, why not go learn more about how the world is? Ask more questions than you give answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the one hand, I agree with you that their goal is to divide and conquer. At the same time, are you saying that the Nazi/White Supremacist March wasn&#39;t real?

    <div class="md"><p>I say I have a limited worldview because I&#39;m not insinuating that I know everything and racism is totally nonexistent. I&#39;m saying that up until this point I haven&#39;t heard a lot about it, I think a lot of people would agree with me on that. But that doesn&#39;t make it not exist. And just because I can&#39;t prove it doesn&#39;t exist doesn&#39;t mean it does exist. We&#39;re not dealing with absolutes, but I&#39;m saying that right now it is escalating more than it has ever been in my experience. </p>

<p>I guess the question is, is the media reporting it because it&#39;s happening more or is it happening more because the media is reporting it? </p>
