        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can have black pride, latino pride, gay pride, and more. But why is white pride taboo?</p>

<p>Do white people have no accomplishments to be proud of? How about this website? How about electricity? How about the internet? How about the microsoft computer you are using? Or the apple one? Just some minor examples. Complaining about the systems created by white people on systems created by white people seems somewhat misguided.</p>

<p>Why are Caucasians labeled with things like &quot;white privilege?&quot;</p>

<p>Do other races not have specific privileges? </p>

<p>Having &quot;black pride&quot; or &quot;gay pride&quot; will only exist in a world where we are not equal. For if we are truly equal, black pride and gay pride would be the same as white pride, and they either would all be taboo or none of them would be.</p>

<p>Accepting &quot;black pride&quot; or &quot;gay pride&quot; but not &quot;white pride&quot; as a rational way of thought, is to perpetuate inequality itself.</p>

<p>White people have lots to be proud of, and telling them they can&#39;t because of &quot;systematic oppression&quot; is a victim mentality that does nothing to progress the group of people who feel that way.</p>

<p>When white people share culture it&#39;s okay, when they borrow others it&#39;s called appropriation. Isn&#39;t the point of having a strong and positive culture to share it with other people? </p>

<p>The same people who demand countries like Sweden or Germany give up their borders, resources, and culture, have very little interest in assimilating into their society. Have you ever noticed how even in major cities tribalism still exists? What is the point of moving from China to America or Canada to not assimilate with the current society and instead create Chinatown etc?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not the several dozen Caucasian cultures that all differ greatly, that have a weak cultural identity they are trying to protect by not sharing it?</p>

<p>Give me one good reason white people shouldn&#39;t be proud. And if you name slavery or history from over 2000 years ago, I&#39;ll gladly share all of the miserable things other cultures have done over the course of time.</p>

<p>Try making an argument in the present. In 2017.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As in which company?</p>

<p>&quot;Media&quot; companies are definitely the fore front of propaganda, however not the source or the real motivated players.</p>

<p>A typical oil company move is to spend a few million on some &quot;green&quot; research, and then spend 100 million on PR blitzing that work.  Then usually dumping the project.  Is this the media shaping opinion, or the oil company?</p>

<p>Information dissemination (media) is largely a conduit fed and directed by the Wealth and Corporate interests.  This is exactly the reason for which all the previously independent media companies (ABC, CBS, etc) have been purchased by large Corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not contesting that propaganda (brainwashing isn&#39;t a thing any more than lie detectors) is a thing.  I&#39;m trying to expand your perception of what the source and motivation of the propaganda.   Movies and TV entertainment are not as influential as you make out -- or do you subscribe to the notion that FPS video games are the reason for mass school shootings?  Media related to information dissemination - aka news, that is the propaganda medium which shapes our public discourse.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of Jewish people in America.  They do not &quot;control the media&quot; despite owning some media corporations.</p>

<p>Correlation not Causation.  Because some news media are owned by Jewish people does not mean that all the media outlets which are anti-fascist/anti-racist/etc are Jewish owned:  It means that those medium&#39;s are not bigots, regardless of the religious affiliation of the owners.</p>

<p>The projection of blame for current problems being the result of Jewish people&#39;s controlling some (small) number of corporations (whether news or not) is a scapegoat for people to avoid confronting reality.   The reality that Corporation and Wealth (vast majority of which is White European controlled) have downtrodden the middle-class/working-class/etc for the sake of their greed based profits.</p>

<p>TV stations receive scripts they have to read verbatim, not even the same networks get the exact same script. Someone is controlling the message and the viewpoint of the audience... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, no brainwashing as you are using is not a thing.</p>

<p>Secondly, yes subliminal messaging is possible in a syncrhonous medium as TV, it is not a thing either.  I guess on this one I&#39;m always looking for evidence so if you have it I&#39;d watch.  But, then, in the past 40 years of this idea bouncing around tinfoil hats it is still there.</p>

<p>Third, yes, TV is scripted.  In fact the even Reality TV is scripted!!  Can you believe that?!</p>

<p>You know who is controlling the message and the viewpoint?  The corporations and the wealth which own those TV stations, newspapers or internet websites.   For instance, bet you don&#39;t know who owns Brietbart, and since when.  What about ZeroHedge? </p>

<p>As for that patent thingy ... Have you looked into any TEMPEST patents?  Or maybe some Stuxnet patents?  Not going to find much, champ.  Maybe because if you&#39;re being controlled by a secret cabal, with nefarious plans of domination and elite tech they won&#39;t be flashing it in your face?  What that means is even if what you are saying is correct it wouldn&#39;t be accurate:   <em>because then they wouldn&#39;t be the unknown, secret cabal anymore would they?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also agree with you there. Where the problem arises is with most people getting all their news from the internet. It&#39;s a subtle, long-term play that won&#39;t reap it&#39;s crop for another generation. Large online media will keep pushing regardless. Where you don&#39;t see anti-male rhetoric, you&#39;ll see anti-white in some form or another. I don&#39;t think the solution is to ignore it and trust in society, unfortunately. This stuff is translating to the real world and dismissing it has the side effect of validating it.</p>

Just saying &quot;lolz its just the internet nerds having drama&quot; is not a terribly insightful or true statement. I think you&#39;re in the right mindset.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s funny... I don&#39;t break down my bigots by who or why they target. Being Irish I have always identified with the struggles of minorities. I never saw racism as being about colour, it&#39;s about finding any excuse to hate. Irish people are white but it didn&#39;t stop all sorts of mad &quot;phrenelogical studies&quot;, etc. being used to justify seeing us as subhuman. Primarily using skin colour is an oversimplification and like most divides that are driven, won&#39;t help us get to the bottom of jack shit.</p>

<p>Nice loaded comment though, great insinuation ploy. It must suck; looking for demons everywhere. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to post on this issue without a freaking disclaimer explaining my background and beliefs. You&#39;d probably just seize that as &quot;I&#39;m not a racist, but...&quot;, so I can&#39;t win, can I? As a child I was held at an airport for terror checks, too. Would you like to talk about that?</p>

But the one thing that sewed all of us together was our Christian identity. That is what is under attack. That&#39;s why the marriage and nuclear family is being destroyed.</p>

<p>When you realize it&#39;s a spiritual war, not a race war or an economic war, it&#39;s much easier to see what the sides are. Feminism, Marxism, post modernism, Freudian psychoanalysis, all intellectual inventions created to destroy Christian institutions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asking if someone would add the insult of directly calling you a racist and bigot is a victimhood statement.</p>

<p>I think I am safe in presuming your race--please let me know if you are a Filipino person supremely concerned about white people not being able to say &quot;white pride&quot; without being looked at askance.</p>

<p>Your argument about &quot;why is white pride more offensive than black pride?&quot; would make perfect logical sense without the context of history. But we have the context of history, despite your argument that we need something recent to justify this. I&#39;m white. My parents were on the wrong side of the Civil Rights movement and school integration. Is that recent enough?</p>

<p>Honestly, I feel bad for people who have nothing to be proud of besides their race, but I certainly understand it more for people of races who were legislated against based on their race than for white folks who felt it was discriminatory when they couldn&#39;t do that anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when it has been mostly denied you since the foundation of the country, I kinda get the overcorrection.</p>

<p>I live somewhere where I am a minority race, and while it is only a fraction of what other races have experienced in the U.S., you feel yourself stick out when you don&#39;t look like the people in a mile radius of you. You also feel an innate pull to the random people in your neighborhood who do look like you, because it feels like they might have a shared experience based on their same race in your location. It takes effort to get over the easy bias race affords, especially coupled with the legal history of our country.</p>

<p>The Unite the Right Rally was advertised as a chance to confront Antifa, BLM et al. The organizers were not there to demonstrate peacefully any more than the antifa were there to peacefully confront them. This was a planned battle for everyone who brought a stick or shield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been struck for your beliefs? Do you attend white power branded events? </p>

<p>I do not advocate punching literal neo-nazis, or whatever form of bigot is on display, to be clear. Al long as there just talking. On the flip side, IMO, it&#39;s better to not make them into  maytyrs, and simply show scorn and disapproval at beliefs that need violence towards others to be accomplished. Self segregate all you fucking want, homeboys. Just don&#39;t force it on others, like anything else. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re proud of your heritage, good for you. Yelling about won&#39;t be replaced is the fear of impotency, and I&#39;ll engage in a stereotype here and assume that most actual racist swine has inferiority complexes, and likely engages in repetive behaviors that enforce these ideas. Actual cucked little dicked morons who hate blacks till fantasy football day at the rap concert. Sorry that&#39;s a divergence, but I&#39;LL NEVER understand why racists engage in the cultures they supposedly hate, if they&#39;re not trying to better themselves. Maybe this is just an Ohio thing, but it was like that in parts of Nj, Nc and KY. Memphis and philly, however, felt different. There was some racial tension, but it wasn&#39;t the same. They felt like places where everyone had one culture. On the other side, minorities will always feel singled out and vulnerable, unable to just be nondescript, and forced to deal with constant cultural awkwardness. </p>

<p>One of my buddy&#39;s once told me the story of when he first met his wife&#39;s parents. She didn&#39;t tell them he was black, and they just happened to make fried chicken. He fucking loves fried chicken, not because he&#39;s black, but because it&#39;s awful for you and delectable and awesome. The mom was so embarrassed, she blurted out &quot;she didn&#39;t warn me you were black, I wasn&#39;t being racist.&quot; Then tried to take the chicken away and order pizza. He did not want to be rude, but he wanted the damm homemade chicken, so he just told her that it was actually genetically impossible for a black man to turn down fried chicken made by white ladies. She then told him HE was being racist, even though he was just trying to kid. She never made them fried chicken again, either. For the record, he said it was kinda dry anyhow, but the casserole was good. This was one of the odder tales he told me, most, however, were just depressing. </p>

<p>All kinds of people are snowflakes, it&#39;s just about different shit.</p>

I probably wouldn&#39;t think the gays and blacks were morons if I wasn&#39;t exposed to their entitlement ideology every time I looked at the news. From what I see of these people they want me to have to care about them and what happened to their ancestors over 100 years ago. And the gays seem to think that they should be able to shove their lifestyle down my throat and be accepted into any community and be given equal treatment by people who don&#39;t like them or what they stand for. If you want to be accepted as an equal keep your opinions to your self and be productive or go somewhere that your people already have ruined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there is no white culture or pride per say. There is German, Irish, British, Romanian pride, or pride from all of these cultures. Black people have this as well, with Ethiopian, Ghanan, and sudanese pride. The difference is white prIde and black pride. When someone asks a white person their heritage, most people will start naming cultures that their ancestors were a part of. Now ask a black person their heritage when they had nothing but generations of people living in slavery. Through all that time, they lost their culture and heritage because it was taken. Black pride and culture grew from not having a culture or heritage and from identifying with other black people not because they were all from Africa but because of the color of their skin. White people didn&#39;t go through this, thus &quot;White Pride and culture&quot; is disrespectful to all those who were in slavery.</p>

<p>At least this is how I see it. </p>

<p>I agree &quot;white people&quot; and &quot;black people&quot; are both generalizations that are far too broad. People should be proud of individualism, local culture, their hometown, etc.</p>

<p>Many people struggle with cultural identity. The only part I disagree with is that it&#39;s only black people. Human beings of all ethnicity have been displaced and continue to be displaced to this day. How will the people being affected now feel in 50-100 years generationally? Has anything even changed or are we just going around in a circle?</p>

<p>Many Caucasian cultures have been enslaved, some for upwards of 500 years by arab people. European countries should allow middle eastern refugees to freely cross their border though, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I would say Black Pride is a little different because of the fact that yes, while Black people weren&#39;t the only ones enslaved throughout history, but its one of the times that their entire history culture and heritage was wiped from these peoples lineage. Yes, people of all ethnicity&#39;s are being displaced to this day, but they still follow their own culture and fight for it. Over generations that fight to remember celebrate heritage was lost and a new culture of black people was born.</p>

<p>Also, Slavery in the United States was like 99% black people from different countries. A lot of slavery that happened elsewhere, Greece, Italy, and many other people had slaves from different countries but treated slaves as slaves no matter what the color of your skin was. In the United States all the slaves were black, which creates a clear division line that if your black your a slave and if your Not Black your better than a slave.</p>

<p>Slavery in the United States created black culture not just slavery in general</p>

<p>I think the whole point of OP&#39;s comment was, and please correct me if I am wrong and I am paraphrasing, &quot;Black people weren&#39;t the only ones enslaved. Based of just that, why black pride still ok? (Then drew a comparison to arabs). Will people who are in slavery today be effected the same 50-100 years from now?&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe something like this will happen again due to globalization. Slavery happened in a time where getting from one place to another was very difficult and so was communication. Which led to culture and heritage loss. It&#39;s very hard to do that with the internet which can connect people of the same culture from all parts of the globe. </p>

<p>Here it is. If you go attend a rally to support your cause and people are chanting faggot, jew, or any other nazi bullshit you are a piece of shit period. And the more I see people standing up for that sort of rhetoric in this sub the more I know the place needs to set forward some better guidelines. It&#39;s that simple.

    <div class="md"><p>People online, in the past, were more open-minded, nerdy outcasts.</p>

<p>Now that it&#39;s mainstream, there is a new generation of gullible kids consuming bigotry online, unable to decipher real from fake, right from wrong, and imagining that there are many like-minded folk which makes them even more stubborn. </p>

<p>Kids also want to be cool and fit in so they go along with jokes. The joking eventually becomes an inescapable mindset.</p>

<p>The latest election certainly legitimized bigotry, as people gained the confidence to be more open about it. When they express their, seemingly, logical opinion about race, for example, due to the purposeful exclusion of any context, it confuses kids into thinking &quot;Hey, you&#39;re right! Why is ______ that way?&quot; and you get these sorts of threads popping up. They are rightly confused because a bigot didn&#39;t include all the facts when they gave OP their dumbass opinion.</p>

<p>The council said the privacy curtain was installed following significant community demand, and not just from Muslim women.</p>

<p>The area is also used by physiotherapy patients, disabled swimmers and the elderly. The council said women of all ages and backgrounds attend the women-only swimming lessons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazis and KKK are shitbags, but what about ANTIFA, BLM and their open, blatant bigotry directed towards white people, especially straight white men? 
You know, stuff like the <a href="https://mob.indymedia.org.uk/images/2015/03/519913.png">SMASH THE WHITE MAN MARCH</a>
 I attended a lot of protests in the 90&#39;s and 2000&#39;s. I marched against the KKK. I marched against police shootings black people and police brutality long before BLM existed. I marched against discrimination against women, blacks, LGBTQ+. I vehemently RAILED against any and all forms of racism and sexism, confronting people on the street if I heard or saw them acting in a racist/sexist manner toward ANYONE.</p>

<p>I am also railing against the far left&#39;s program of systemic racial attacks on people of European heritage and their culture. Shit like the SMASH THE WHITE MAN rally is no less racist than a fucking KKK rally. </p>

<p>I attempted to attend a BLM march in my city last year. I was violently confronted by over a dozen people, both individuals and groups telling me I wasn&#39;t welcome, I was a devil, &quot;go home faggot cracker.&quot; I was told that my &quot;time is coming,&quot; and soon all of us &quot;whites&quot; are going to be taken out, &quot;dragged out into the street and shot,&quot; etc, and much more. I was fucking appalled, to say the least. I tried having a civil discussion with a number of black people, but only one old man was interested, and his tone was decidedly anti white, going on about &quot;you people&quot; this and that (implying whites). The general mood was tense and felt very close to violence, much the same as KKK rallies I had protested. 
I was actually physically attacked, an older black man came out of nowhere and smashed an ice cream cone against my head with enough force to knock me down. I went and told a nearby cop, who was black, and he laughed and said I looked like I was alright. The guy who attacked me was walking away and I pointed him out to the cop, but he refused to do anything about it and continued flirting with a young girl in a miniskirt. </p>

<p>Needless to say I&#39;ll NEVER attend another BLM rally. They are a hate group, as are ANTIFA. </p>

<p>What people need to realize is that the establishment are using these groups on either side, BLM, ANTIFA on the left, and the ALT-RIGHT groups on the right, to manipulate people into hating one another. These groups are all infiltrated and run by individuals with an agenda to drive the people of this country towards a civil war. </p>

<p>Trying to rail against one side is futile, if the other side is ignored. You can&#39;t attack NAZIs and KKK while allowing ANTIFA and BLM to continue to preach hate everywhere they go. BLM and ANTIFA are actually pushing many young white men into these ALT-RIGHT groups by their never-ending mantra of &quot;DESTROY THE PATRIARCHY, DESTROY ALL STRAIGHT WHITE MALES.&quot; These groups are what actually got Trump elected. Why would any self-respecting straight white man have anything to do with the left at this point? Where do they go? Well, the far left is pushing them further and further right, while these ALT-RIGHT groups and their agents provocateur indoctrinate these kids into NAZI ideology. Both sides are now feeding the other, they are all fanning the flames of hate. </p>

<p>Not at all.  You should be ashamed.  And people of the same race should be ashamed to be the same color as you.  Ashamed for mocking people, who have had bonded into a group because of a shared experience.  Stripped of their names, language and culture they decided to go by &quot;Black&quot; instead of the previously picked names that seemed to always start with a &quot;N&quot;.   I would have gone with &quot;Fremen&quot;, but nobody asked.  Why do you want to give them a hard time about by trying to justify the idea you have that there is a need for &quot;white pride&quot;?</p>

<p>Be proud of what you&#39;ve done, not what you look like.  Anything else should just be for fun, because it ain&#39;t worth nothing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But why is white pride taboo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the term &quot;white pride&quot; was coined by white supremacists and &quot;black pride&quot; is replacement term for African Americans which brings them together.</p>

<p>The reason why &quot;black pride&quot; isn&#39;t considered to be racists is the context. African American can&#39;t trace back their heritage. They don&#39;t know where they come from (besides the continent). They don&#39;t know if their ancestors lived in Nigeria, the Congo or Namibia before they were enslaved and ship to the US. Their identity, culture and heritage was stripped and beaten out of them. They were nothing more than a good for sale. The only thing that they have in common is their color of skin. That was the only thing what was defining them. So a new identity was born. A black identity, a black culture and black pride as replacement for their lost heritage.</p>

<p>That is different for Caucasian American. They didn&#39;t lose their heritage. I can trace my family back to German and Irish settlers and my family is still part of German and Irish culture. And that&#39;s what you can celebrate. You can be pride of your German/British/Italian/Irish/Dutch/... culture and heritage. He can celebrate Tesla for being a Serbian and thus part of Serbian culture, but his inventions weren&#39;t due to the fact that he was white. Same goes for Newton. Celebrate that he was British. Lumping them together to celebrate them under &quot;white pride&quot; would be an injustice to Serbian or British culture, since they are both vastly different (as for other European cultures). White American didn&#39;t have to find a replacement for their culture, they never lost it.</p>

<p>With using the term &quot;white pride&quot; you&#39;re reducing the inventions and accomplishments of Europeans to the color of their skin. You take something away from them, their British/Serbian/Austrian/German/French/Spanish/Italian... part. With using the term &quot;black pride&quot; you give something back. You give African American an identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;gay pride&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same can be said about gays. Coming out as gay was a big nono. Your family disavowed you and you were thrown out. People were murdered for being gay. So gay people search for a replacement of a culture which rejected them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed how even in major cities tribalism still exists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It exists, but if you lived in cities like New York and London, you would see that these tribal border within cities are diminishing day by day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the point of moving from China to America or Canada to not assimilate with the current society and instead create Chinatown etc?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To find a better life for your children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the OP, but this is a good comment about context. Racial issues are certainly the most touchy in political discourse right now, and for the foreseeable future. Personally, I think many misconceptions about the sameness between races are responsible for what we&#39;re seeing. Radical egalitarianism was a mistake. The US needs to come to terms with some uncomfortable truths regarding our supposed departure from tribalism. Wishful thinking and ideological kool-aid is not the solution to every animals deterministic aspects. Humans are animals competing for resources. It just so happens that European nations have ignored this at great peril currently. We are going to see a reversal and I hope western leaders have a better solution than history. </p>

<p>Absolutely not. I couldn&#39;t imagine if I had to grow up homosexual. I&#39;m not sure I would have survived, tbh (my step father is super homophobic). </p>

<p>But whites are ostracized in other ways. There&#39;s many things we can&#39;t say, or do, that other races can. We can&#39;t have all white schools, or all white clubs. Affirmative action has made us, in some ways, ostracized from jobs just because of our skin color. White boys are doing increasingly worse in school. They also experience much higher suicide rates. I believe, though I could be incorrect here, white men also hold many of the most dangerous jobs and thus are responsible for most workplace deaths. </p>

<p>The problem with arguments like these is, while they are typically factually correct, they play on the belief that oppression and unfairness is a zero-sum game. If one group has a rough go of it, that must mean the other group doesn&#39;t. That belief, while prevalent, is just not based in reality. </p>

<p>You see it all the time with the hardest of core BLM supporters -- white tears, white fragility, etc. You also see it all the time with feminism (same phrases, just replace white with male). There&#39;s this belief that, because they feel oppressed, you cannot feel that way. That there&#39;s only so much to go around, and since someone other themselves have to be responsible for them it must be someone else.. and that someone else can&#39;t even speak of their own problems. </p>

<p>The reality is, the majority of white people are middle class and lower. Asians out earn us by a fair bit. They are also much better educated. They also come from more complete, and more stable, homes. Yet nobody accuses them of being the oppressors/the ones with privilege. In fact, I believe there&#39;s a square on the oppression pyramid for Asians. &lt;&lt; That was a bit of a rant, apologies, lol. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve now lost track of my thought, FML. </p>

<p>My overall point is, though, that most people in this world have a bad go of it. Some have it worse, or different, no doubt.. but very few people are leading cushy lives. Even most of the rich don&#39;t live cushy lives. Someone has to work all those hours to earn all that money, after all. It&#39;s only the top of the top 1% who <em>truly</em> live cushy lives. </p>

<p>All that said, you should absolutely be proud of who you are. Nobody should feel ashamed for being born a certain way.. that goes for Blacks, Gays, Whites, Asians, etc.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t either. I was merely pointing out one example where whites are <em>hurt</em> as well. If there&#39;s value to blacks to having a &quot;blacks only&quot; club then it&#39;s not a stretch to believe there&#39;s value to whites to having a &quot;whites only&quot; club. </p>

<p>Me, personally, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s value to either. But some do and society, as a whole, thinks there&#39;s value to one and not the other. It&#39;s an inequality that exists, that either doesn&#39;t get recognized or gets hand waved away. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you major example, at least in my opinion. How about <a href="https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7964">black only courses</a> in college? Would it be socially acceptable to have a college course only white people could attend? </p>

<p>Of course not. But are we also going to pretend that non-whites are the only ones who have a problem in America? Are we going to pretend that non-whites are the only ones discriminated against?
 Because that&#39;s what society is currently doing. </p>

<p>The sad thing is, it&#39;s that attitude that gave rise to Trump and gave rise to shit like Charlottesville. Nobody likes being dismissed or, worse, vilified because of their skin color. And, like it or not, it&#39;s currently socially acceptable to do that to white people. </p>

<p>Just to clarify the case from that article, it was about a single college success course at one college. The idea is that black students were dropping out at an unusually high rate, so maybe a somewhat customized version would help boost graduation rates for black students. Having a white only college success class just wouldn&#39;t make sense, since white students don&#39;t have a significantly lower graduation rate than the norm.</p>

<p>First, this was just one example.. there&#39;s more. Let&#39;s not forget Black students at Evergeen tried to force all white people to leave for a day. It was sort of a big deal, and society (as a whole) sided with the black students... at least the society we see online. </p>

<p>Second, I actually think the idea is a good one. I think it should be expanded. Boys, and especially white boys, are doing worse and worse in school. Their grades are falling, as are their graduation rates. Why can&#39;t they have their own class to help them out? Do you believe society would approve of it? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be like having a special class for non-veterans, just because there&#39;s a course for veterans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, to me it&#39;s really simple: If it&#39;s okay to have a class where you say &quot;Only people from group X can join&quot; then it needs to be okay to have a class where you say &quot;People from group X cannot join&quot;. If you don&#39;t, we don&#39;t live in an equal society. </p>

<p>Equality can&#39;t play favorites, regardless of past history.We either commit to equality, or we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Probably not. And I would criticize anyone who supports a black-only classroom. Like I said, people gave their lives fighting for civil rights in America and a segregated classroom is a giant step backwards. </p>

<p>With that said, the school no longer offers that course nor any course that&#39;s only allowed for specific races to join. So your biggest example... isn&#39;t really an example at all IMHO. </p>

<p>OK but let&#39;s actually examine this closer. I asked for some examples of what you meant by whites being discriminated against and your &#39;major&#39; example was a community college briefly offering black students the option to have a class with other black students - which the college stopped doing - and you&#39;re trying to compare that to decades of major civil rights violations. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t in good faith see how you can even draw an equivalence between the two. They&#39;re not even remotely in the same ballpark. </p>

<p>My biggest example wasn&#39;t that specific class. More the idea that this is becoming common in colleges. Evergreen&#39;s &quot;day without white people&quot; was a thing that happened, that was forced on to white people. More and more universities are offering &quot;safe spaces&quot; for non-whites and/or non-men. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a big example to me because this is our education system. This is what&#39;s supposed to be grooming our future leaders. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I actually answered your &quot;grip&quot; above. This one example wasn&#39;t, specifically, the biggest one. It was more the idea that our education system was doing this.</p>

<p>Second, I guess I don&#39;t understand how people can&#39;t see that it&#39;s become hip to hate on white people.. that society is accepting of that. Just go to twitter and read the reactions to what happened in Charlottesville. A good amount of it was &quot;This is why all white people need to be killed&quot;. Again, change white with any other race and our society would have EXPLODED. </p>

<p>Second, you can&#39;t have true equality while also saying different races (and genders, for that matter) get to live by different rules. That&#39;s called separate but equal, and it&#39;s not an idea I&#39;d ever get behind. </p>

<p><strong>They&#39;re really not.</strong> It&#39;s just the right&#39;s newest baseless bogeyman, and honestly one of the most egregiously disgusting.</p>

<p>Those on the right know that the more educated one is, the more likely they are to lean liberal. So they&#39;ve gone to war against education in general, and college in particular. It&#39;s obvious, and it&#39;s glaring, and it needs to be stamped out now. None of this stuff you think is going on on college campuses is actually happening in any meaningful way, but that doesn&#39;t stop places like T_D <strong>absolutely railing</strong> against higher education.</p>

<p>I lurk there often enough to see the constant provocateurs wailing about &quot;indoctrination centers&quot;, and how they&#39;re all going to do their damnedest to make sure their kids don&#39;t go to college to get brainwashed by liberals. The right has literally gone to war against people trying to educate themselves, and it&#39;s fed by exactly the same propaganda you&#39;ve fallen victim to. </p>

<p>I do want you to know, I&#39;m not blaming you for it, and I&#39;m not trying to belittle you at all by talking about how you fell for such things. I totally understand how easy is it to buy into a narrative about something you don&#39;t have the requisite experience with, specifically when it&#39;s pushed so ferociously by news sources that you usually trust, that usually confirm your predisposed biases. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t expect you to believe me, some random guy on the internet that could be a LARPing shill for all you know. But it is important that you at least come away from this realizing that the stories you&#39;re being fed by hyper-partisan sources <strong>just might</strong> not be true, and it&#39;s possible it&#39;s being done to serve someone else&#39;s interests. </p>

<p>I think vilifying people for hurting your feelings is stupid. Microaggression freely admit that they&#39;re not on purpose, but yet are labeled an aggression anyways. And seeing as what&#39;s called a microagression (saying the most qualified person should get the job, for instance), they&#39;re a fucking joke.

<p>Total nonsense.</p>

<p><strong>Total nonsense</strong>. Just like I said, you fell for propaganda from an extremely biased source that is misrepresenting the truth to push a narrative. FIRE is a garbage organization that not only purposefully misrepresents just about every undertaking they&#39;ve ever pursued, but are also part of the exact bullshit-peddlers on the right who are seeking to destroy higher education. </p>

<p>I mean seriously, you linked to their site where they talk about &quot;free speech zones&quot;, which they make to be the bastions of first amendment rights on campuses, <strong>where the reality is they&#39;re just common areas where solicitation is allowed</strong>. This is so every Tom, Dick and Harry can&#39;t be handing out pamphlets at the door to every building, proffering everything from tutoring services, to commercial sales, to that creepy guy down the hall trying to get everyone to join his anime meetup. What FIRE does is a joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think vilifying people for hurting your feelings is stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think it&#39;s stupid for someone to let you know when you&#39;ve said something insulting, even if you didn&#39;t know it was insulting? Have you honestly never told anyone that something they&#39;ve said has bothered you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And seeing as what&#39;s called a microagression (saying the most qualified person should get the job, for instance)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a microaggression at all. This is the problem, where you&#39;re being fed a line of bullshit to the point we can&#39;t have a productive conversation. You don&#39;t even know what a microaggression really is, but you&#39;ve been programmed to have a strong, visceral reaction to it anyway. This is purposefully being done to cause exactly such a reaction. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t understand why you have such an aversion to people wanting to learn how to not offend those who are different from themselves. </p>

<p>C&#39;mon now, I&#39;ve literally gone line by line, and source by source to show the disconnect between the narrative you&#39;re pushing, and the reality of the situation. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That Universities are bastions of free speech-quashing, first amendment opponents who engage in thought control. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you actually prove their free speech zones study as false?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no study to prove false. There is only their assertions that a number of universities have such things (questionable), and that these are the only areas where free speech is allowed (patently false). How exactly would you like me to prove them false? Would you like to go on a tour of colleges together, to see that you won&#39;t be arrested for speaking your mind outside of these zones? Because if you experienced any of this first hand, you would realize what total load of bullshit it is. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve told me what your experiences are. And I can tell from your blatant mischaracterization of the classes you&#39;ve professed to go to, that you have no actual experience with them. It&#39;s the same as if one were to tell Buzz Aldrin that the moon was made from cheese, he would know they&#39;re full of shit because he actually experienced it. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m just bad at making my point when I&#39;m typing in a hurry between lines of code. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my point -- white people are <em>also</em> discriminated against. It may not have as much historical context, but it absolutely is happening. Non-white groups/classes/etc are just one example of that. I find the class/uni one to be most problematic because that&#39;s where our future leaders are groomed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also happening all over social media and in the news. It&#39;s usually phrased as &quot;white men&quot;, which makes it harder to google and is really the perfect virtue signal :P </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/racist-racism-racially-white-ethnic-minorities">This article</a> claims racism against whites just isn&#39;t important enough to focus on.  </p>

<p>Again, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/11/video-games-too-white-too-male-women-ethnic-diversity">The Guardian</a> claiming that something being &quot;too white, and too male&quot; is a problem. Nothing would ever, seriously, be accused of being &quot;too black&quot; or &quot;too female&quot; and still end up being socially acceptable.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-video-game-industry-is-too-white-straight-and-male-for-its-own-good">The Daily Beast</a> claiming video games are too white, and too male, for &quot;their own good&quot;. Whatever the fuck that means.  </p>

<p><a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/8-things-white-people-race/">Everyday Feminism</a> believes that white people can&#39;t experience racism. </p>

<p>I specifically picked outlets that my liberal/progressive friends link to, speak highly of, and apparently respect. I could have linked to a lot more, but I&#39;m not sure that would be fair. </p>

<p>None of these articles generated controversy. None of them sparked outrage. In fact, a <a href="http://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/view/249">whole term</a> was created to describe white people who ask why it&#39;s okay to scapegoat them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier for an immigrant to make money and thus be successful if he/she stick to his/her community. The immigrant has instantly access to a vast network of people. The more successful you are, the better your children will fare.</p>

<p>Language is also a big barrier. If you move to a country and you don&#39;t speak the native language, you will have a hard time. So immigrants will stick together. That doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t want to integrate. It&#39;s just easier for them.</p>

<p>You can do both. Find out where your roots are. Go in both directions, Native and European.</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting. Do you have a source for this? I&#39;m not doubting you, because it makes complete sense, I just want to read about it.. I find this stuff interesting. </p>

<p>I suspect that&#39;s true for some, or maybe even most. However, there are some that just flatly refuse to integrate. In fact, Linda Sarsour has been advocating for Muslims to <em>resist</em> integration into western society. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right. However, as has been discussed, I can&#39;t really go European. If I say I&#39;m proud to be a European, people are just going to hear I&#39;m proud to be white and then accuse me of being a Nazi :P </p>

<p>So, in reality, in terms of society I really do only have one option and that&#39;s to only be proud of half of who I am. Society won&#39;t accept me being proud of my other half. </p>

<p>And I find that fact kinda sad. </p>

<p>That&#39;s one of the disadvantages of immigrant enclaves within societies. They don&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>If you say you&#39;re proud to be European most will ask from which part in Europe you&#39;re from. Nowadays it shouldn&#39;t be hard to find out where your roots in Europe are.</p>

<p>European culture isn&#39;t really a thing. A Spanish person is vastly different from a Russian person, culturally seen. By claiming being proud the be European, people get confused and search for answers which can lead sometimes to accusations. Happens with other ethnic people, but not to a degree as with white people.</p>

<p>She said &quot;our priority is not to assimilate&quot;. That can mean different things. Some people will interpret it as &quot;resist any integration&quot; and some will interpret it as &quot;Muslims living in a Western country should follow Islamic rules as far as possible&quot;. One person hears something nefarious and one person would just equate it with the words of a Christian pastor which preaches to reject consumerism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m proud to be a white, Christian, Italian man!&quot;</p>

<p>Go to Africa and nobody will tell you that they are a &quot;proud black, Christian, Nigerian man&quot;. They will tell you that they are a &quot;proud Christian and Nigerian man&quot;.</p>

<p>Most African American in the US don&#39;t have the luxury to tell you their heritage. They can&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m proud to be a black, Christian, ...&quot; ... what? So they build a new identity around being black, because that was the only thing they have left after slavery. So in the US you have Caucasian telling &quot;I&#39;m  proud to be a Italian Christian&quot; and African American telling &quot;I&#39;m proud to be a Black Christian&quot;.</p>

<p>That dude in Dallas which killed five police officers was not a member of BLM. Also some of the cops where Hispanic or Black (Zamarippa in Dallas orJackson on Baton Rouge). They were not killed because of their skin color. They were killed because they were cops.</p>

<p>&quot;Black pride&quot; was never about being superior, &quot;White pride&quot; is. White people are creating this double standard. Go to the next white supremacists rally and try to argue with them that using phrases like &quot;white pride&quot; will divide the country.</p>

<p>Glorifying traitors to the Union doesn&#39;t help. I just quote General Robert E. Lee:</p>

<p>&quot;As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated; my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; &amp; of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour. All I think that can now be done, is to aid our noble &amp; generous women in their efforts to protect the graves &amp; mark the last resting places of those who have fallen, &amp; wait for better times.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an opinion.</p>

<p>Who cares anymore? &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; was a smear term coined by the CIA. But we can take that back for ourselves and wear it proudly. Black slavery was done by white people&#39;s ancestors, not current white people.</p>

<p>It is time to let go of certain stigmas. Time to change.</p>

<p>White people get to have pride. That&#39;s the bottom line. No feeling remorse for slavery. No feeling bad for &quot;white privilege&quot;. White supremacy will fade to the background when all white people have &quot;white pride&quot;.</p>

<p>Slavery was abolished with the help of, get this, white people. I&#39;m proud of that. Slavery was around long before the USA, but there were some white people in the USA who recognized the need to put an end to it in the USA. You don&#39;t have to lose your heritage to have racial pride or identity.</p>

In Europe a german and italian speak different languages and have different accents and celebrate different holidays. In US we have a southern accent and a non southern accent (for the most part) and Christmas is a national holiday that you can talk to anyone about. US is a giant unified ball of culture and people all across the country do the same shit, christmas, birthdays, football, baseball, first car, all very shared cultural ideas in the US.

    <div class="md"><p>What a load of crap. Are you trying to say that negro slaves were the only slaves in history, and that they and their descendents are the only ones who lost their roots?</p>

<p>Slavery was enormous throughout the history of the Khmer empire in southeast Asia, (the largest pre-industrial city in the world), that I know of, and across many parts of the ancient world throughout history.</p>

<p>Slavery is in the Jewish Bible, (The Old Testament), and in the Koran.</p>

<p>The Arabs were not only shipping slaves out of Africa for a thousand years, but they were raiding the northern Mediterranean coastline and carting off European women and children as slaves too.</p>

<p>Just Google some history and stop playing the victim mentality. Most people have had some nasty shit in their ancestry, not only black people. There&#39;s no excuse for acting precious hurt and entitled.</p>

<p>Google white slavery, European slavery, slavery in europe, ottoman slavery, Istanbul slavery, etc.</p>

<p>The Ottoman penetration into Europe in the 1350s and their capture of Constantinople later in 1453 opened new floodgates for slave-trade from the European front. In their last attempt to overrun Europe in 1683, the Ottoman army, although defeated, returned from the Gates of Vienna with 80,000 captives.874 An immense number of slaves flowed from the Crimea, the Balkans and the steppes of West Asia to Islamic markets. BD Davis laments that the ‘‘Tartars and other Black Sea peoples had sold millions of Ukrainians, Georgians, Circassians, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Slavs and Turks,’’ which received little notice.875 Crimean Tatars enslaved and sold some 1,750,000 Ukrainians, Poles and Russian between 1468 and 1694. 876 According to another estimate, between 1450 and 1700, the Crimean Tatars exported some 10,000 slaves, including some Circassians, annually—that is, some 2,500,000 slaves in all, to the Ottoman Empire.877 The Tatar slave-raiding Khans returned with 18,000 slaves from Poland (1463), 100,000 from Lvov (1498), 60,000 from South Russia (1515), 50,000–100,000 from Galicia (1516), during the ‘harvesting of the steppe.’ Numbers from Moscow (1521), 800,000 were taken and from Valynia (1676), 400,000 were taken. 800,000 from Moscow (1521), 200,000 from South Russia (1555), 100,000 from Moscow (1571), 50,000 from Poland (1612), 60,000 from South Russia (1646), 100,000 from Poland (1648), 300,000 from Ukraine (1654), 400,000 from Valynia (1676) and thousands from Poland (1694). Besides these major catches, they made countless more Jihad raids during the same period, which yielded a few to tens of thousands of slaves.878 These figures of enslavement must be considered in the context that the population of the Tatar Khanate was only about 400,000 at the time. (1463-1694) while sources are incomplete, conservative tabulation of the slave raids against the Eastern European population indicate that at least 7 Million European people-men, women, children were enslaved by Muslims.</p>

<p>Sources suggest that in the few years between 1436-1442, some 500,000 people were seized in the Balkans. Many of the captives died in forced marches towards Anatolia (Turkey). Contemporary chronicles note that the Ottomans reduced masses of the inhabitants of Greece, Romania, and the Balkans to slavery eg from Moree (1460)-70,000 and Transylvania (1438) - 60,000-70,000 and 300,000-600,000 from Hungary and 10,000 from Mytilene/Mitilini on Lesbos island (1462) (Bulgaru p 567) and so it continued.</p>

<p>Barbary Slavery
Ohio State University history Professor Robert Davis describes the White Slave Trade as minimized by most modern historians in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800 (Palgrave Macmillan). Davis estimates that 1 million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans were enslaved in North Africa, from the beginning of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th, by slave traders from Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli alone (these numbers do not include the European people which were enslaved by Morocco and by other raiders and traders of the Mediterranean Sea coast), 16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul&#39;s additional slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700. The markets declined after the loss of the Barbary Wars and finally ended in the 1830s, when the region was conquered by France.</p>

<p>In 1544, the island of Ischia off Naples was ransacked, taking 4,000 inhabitants prisoners, while some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari Island off the north coast of Sicily were enslaved.870 Turgut Reis, a Turkish pirate chief, ransacked the coastal settlements of Granada (Spain) in 1663 and carried away 4,000 people as slaves. </p>

<p>The barbaric slave-raiding activities of the Muslim pirates had a telling effect on Europe. France, England, and Spain lost thousands of ships, devastating to their sea-borne trade. Long stretches of the coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants until the nineteenth century. The finishing industry was virtually devastated.</p>

<p>Paul Baepler’s White Slaves, African Masters: An Anthology of American Barbary Captivity Narratives lists a collection of essays by nine American captives held in North Africa. According to his book, there were more than 20,000 white Christian slaves by 1620 in Algiers alone; their number swelled to more than 30,000 men and 2,000 women by the 1630s. There were a minimum of 25,000 white slaves at any time in Sultan Moulay Ismail’s palace, records Ahmed ez-Zayyani; Algiers maintained a population of 25,000 white slaves between 1550 and 1730, and their numbers could double at certain times. During the same period, Tunis and Tripoli each maintained a white slave population of about 7,500. The Barbary pirates enslaved some 5,000 Europeans annually over a period of nearly three centuries.

    <div class="md"><p>If you can&#39;t see the connection even when it&#39;s spelt out for you then I will give you a clue. </p>

<p>In the 20th and 21st century, do the surviving victims of the 1995 Bosnian genocide whine and complain and use the terrible times they suffered at the hands of the Serbs, the starvation, the rapes, the beatings, the daily murders, to justify self-pity or special treatment?</p>

<p>Between one and two million Khmer were murdered by the genocidal socialist Totalitarian Pol Pot between 1975 and 1979. The population tortured and enslaved in his attempt to enforce a Maoist style of Communism. </p>

<p>Do the surviving &quot;enemies of the state&quot;
use that as an excuse for choosing to behave atrociously and seeking special treatment?</p>

<p>In just 4 years between 1958 and 1962  at least 45 million people were worked, starved, or beaten to death in Mao&#39;s Great Leap Forward - enslaving the peasant population in an attempt to make his brand of communism as productive as western economies.</p>

<p>Did the surviving peasants act up and demand special treatment? </p>

<p>No. If they did, they would conveniently disappear into the prisons for profits system.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the clue:</p>

<p>It&#39;s only because they already have it so good in the societies we have built in the last 100 years, that they are accepted, and feted with affirmative acion and extra attention.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t throw gays off tall buildings. We don&#39;t stone them to death. People with black skin have the same legal rights as people with yellow skin or pink skin. Sure, there are racists in every society, African, Asian, European. But most people try to be fair.</p>

<p>Our societies have made, and are continuing to make progress towards equality.</p>

<p>Are gay groups doing anything to help their unfortunate gay brothers, sisters, and all the other 70 odd genders trapped in persecuting countries? I haven&#39;t seen it. They&#39;re to busy poncing on about themselves.</p>

<p>Black people in the USA and here appear to be so busy nurturing their grievances they are poisoning themselves with resentment and bitterness. It would be nice to see more of them follow the examples of the good people among them instead of following the worst examples.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it exists but it would be nice to maybe start some kind of a brotherhood movement to offer help and guidance for their enslaved, and persecuted brothers in Africa, particularly in the Muslim countries and in inter-tribal conflict zones.</p>

<p>We already have many NGO&#39;S like UN, MSN, Amnesty, Red Cross, etc, but it would be nice to see some solidarity.</p>

<p>The last two centuries <em>are</em> relevant to the 20th and 21st centuries in the context of this conversation. Slaves from the Ottoman Empire aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re concerned about a culture of victimhood, you have to understand it before you try to change it. You can&#39;t just tell every black person in America that they&#39;re wrong to feel like second-class citizens and expect the ones in dire circumstances to magically teleport out of them.</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what you say because I agree that the terminology &quot;black pride&quot; or &quot;gay pride&quot; clearly came about from being opressed and needing to show strength. But I think in today&#39;s world there is a double standard.</p>

<p>Yeah, but this technology wasn&#39;t available when African American built their new identity after they were freed. They have now a new culture, a new identity, including black pride. That&#39;s also why it&#39;s not a double standard. Go to Africa and ask if someone is pride to be black. They won&#39;t give a fuck. They will be pride to be Nigerian or from a specific tribe. Black pride is an American thing.</p>

<p>Yeah, because contrary to the term &quot;white pride, you don&#39;t have Asian supremacists marching around in the US chanting &quot;Asia pride&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that there is some extremist white supremacists does not mean that there can&#39;t be average white people who believe they can have pride in being white. The biggest white supremacist gathering which took months to plan couldn&#39;t get more than 300 people to come in Virginia. Some of those assholes were even from Canada as shown on Vice news.</p>

<p>Just like the fact that there is 200,000 black Hebrew israelites in the US with thousands of them who are deemed black supremacists by the Southern Poverty Law Center...that doesn&#39;t take away from the average African American who believes in black pride.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s your average black supremacist screaming that white people are scum and black people are the chosen people in the middle of Time Square. The news will neverrrrr report that though:

When I was a kid my dad loved black art and was friends with all these artists and every Sunday we would go hangout at the weekly street fair with pretty much only black people. These guys would be there with a couple big guns (may have been fake, hopefully they were) and this guy would just go off on the PA system calling out white people, he would always point at us, calling for &quot;death to the white man&quot; and it scared the living shit out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this opinion, and to add something... It&#39;s a very poor generalization to believe that accomplishments by people based on the only fact of race, would disregard local culture, education system, incoming and purchasing power given by the economy, opportunities and support you find in such country, cultural spaces that contributed to the achievements and so forth. </p>

<p>So in my opinion that will to disregard all other aspects, and to generalize the success as race considering the cultural differences between white countries (sometimes even states) can transcend into an implicit statement that whites or Caucasians are biologically superior so those accomplishments belong to the race, not the country or the culture, but people from any race can fall for the same and find any excuses to justify the point, because they&#39;d be looking for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was an excellent response and the first I&#39;ve seen that is logical, sensical, and well written. Thank you for it! However, to OP&#39;s point it is a racist double standard. For example, I know I&#39;m Swedish, Norwegian, and Native American on my moms side. On my fathers side, he was adopted so I really have no idea other than he&#39;s white. For half of my genealogy, it&#39;s really no different than a black slave descendant living in the US. My mothers family never identified with any of their nationalities and we never celebrated any of that ancestral culture. I&#39;m an American and happen to be white (but I tan well!); that is my identity. So for me, without identifying myself with any of my mothers ancestral nationalities your succinct response doesn&#39;t hold water. In addition, I know many black people that have smatterings of many other ancestral cultures in their genealogy as well, so I don&#39;t feel your argument applies well there either, or at least not any different than in my case. As a side note, the recent derogatory racial label of white nationalist is disturbing. When I first heard it, I identified with that. I love my country and I&#39;m white...wrong!!  I was disgusted to see what Googles definition was. Not me! </p>

<p>That was the choice of your mother&#39;s family. They could have celebrated their culture, but they did not. A choice African American don&#39;t have.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I does hold water. You are able to celebrate your Swedish, Norwegian and Native American heritage. You just don&#39;t do it. There are plenty of African American which also don&#39;t choose to celebrate &quot;black pride&quot; or &quot;black identity&quot;. But if they want to celebrate their heritage, they can&#39;t fall back like you to specific ones. They are limited to the new black identity African American build after they were freed from being slaves.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>White nationalist = Nationalist which wants a country only for Whites. That&#39;s the definition. If you just want a country for Americans, free of immigrants and a America First policy, regardless of skin color, you&#39;re a nationalist (not a white or black nationalist).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can not ignore history when talking about race in America.</p>

<p>European&#39;s spent 500 years treating Black Americans&#39; as sub-human.  That treatment has subsided in the past few decades, but has not disappeared:  witness the hundreds rallying for racism in VA and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Black American&#39;s have had their culture ripped from them and bullshit narratives of subservience forced onto them.  This is why in the 1980&#39;s Jesse Jackson created the term African American:  He wanted to provide a cultural context to black people who didn&#39;t know anything about their heritage.</p>

<p>This is the exact same thing as Irish American&#39;s going back to Dublin to &quot;reconnect&quot; with their families etc.  Or any other cultural rememberance of their family heritage.</p>

<p>The profound difference is those white cultures didn&#39;t have to re-learn anything because it was never stolen from them via enslavement, rape, lynching, imprisonment or torture.</p>

<p>So, original sin. As in, it is impossible for white Americans to ever be absolved of the stain of slavery.</p>

<p>Seems very peculiar coming from a guy citing &quot;historical context.&quot; The historical context for slavery is that virtually every society practiced it at some point.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay here&#39;s the thing, a large amount of blacks in America have no way of knowing where their ancestors came from before they were brought to America, you don&#39;t see a lot of nationality pride groups among black communities because a lot of them don&#39;t know exactly what nationality they should be celebrating. So for a group of people whose family history can&#39;t be tracked any further then slavery, they rally around a common thread that unites them and that is being black..... and for the most part black pride is about standing up against racism and hatred. They were and to some extent still are treated as second class citizens, so they stand together to demand change..... and none of the groups we see today like BLM are revolutionary either and these groups today could be argued as relatively tame compared to the days of Malcom X and black panthers who were advocating the use of violence to achieve their goals. </p>

<p>A good example of the difference, is the acceptance of other racial groups into their &quot;racial pride&quot; groups, one welcomes anyone willing to fight for their cause and the other only allows a very particular racial group. If you look at a BLM protest or black-pride gatherings there is always plenty of non-black participants who are fighting right along side of them demanding equality for all. Look back at the civil rights movement of the 1950-60&#39;s there were plenty of white people who were also part of the black pride or civil rights movement, and at times could be credited for bringing nation wide attention to issues that most Americans (even a few presidents) really wanted to ignore, I.e  Andrew Goodman and the freedom summer activist..... hell even the <em>evil socialist</em> Bernie Sanders was arrested for protesting segregation laws. This is not true the other way around in any comparable fashion, white pride groups pushing the idea of white supremacy aren&#39;t exactly welcoming to anyone of color, and would even kill other white people who participated in the civil rights movement or fought for for racial equality. </p>

<p>White pride is bullshit and completely different than black pride, my recommendation is if you&#39;re not a racist and legitimately want to be proud about being white without being called a racist, join a nationality or heritage club/group, I have never seen anyone get upset about someone having Irish pride, Italian pride, British pride, Swedish pride, polish pride etc etc.. because those are not about racial superiority like white pride, they are celebrating an actual nationality, whose only goals are persevering and celebrating actual cultural and heritage traditions. White pride celebrates this false idea of being superior to other races simply because they&#39;re white, and even advocate genocide on basically every other race...... (except asians oddly, well they may hate asians also but they&#39;re not high priority at the moment....)</p>

<p>Maybe if they&#39;re wasn&#39;t a long history of racist and bigots trying to disguise their hatred by calling it &quot;white pride&quot; it would be different today,  but they did, and that&#39;s the world we live in...... </p>

<p>There is a new America but not everyone likes than anymore than they like the old America that killed off the native population etc.    So in identity politics,  the loudest most offensive whites want to make America White Again as a fantasy ideal.    Thats what comes up in White Pride.    So,  the rest of the whites have to duck and suck up to everything that hates whites,  and there is a lot that hates whites.    There are social justice warriors of various identies that want to reshape America in ways that are not necessarily attractive to others,  but they can still unify against the old white stereotypes and what they stood for.    Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best are being dismantled,  like it or not.    Whites better learn to like rap music.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t take that statement too literally.   But yeah,  as cultures take on people from outside,  tastes change,  people mix,  things change,   some of what you like goes away,  some of the new stuff you don&#39;t like.   Your kids turn out differently than you did.   The extended family goes away,  the nuclear or single parent family takes over,  need I go on?</p>

<p>People everywhere sometimes get violent when their world changes more than they like,  especially from &quot;outside&quot; influences.    If their ideology or religion reinforces their anger,  justifies violence, all the better.</p>

<p>Feeling pride for yourself our your group is a survival mechanism. Think about it. If your an outsider and if the majority of people/prevailing sentemement of the time is you are worth less, why would you accept it? Why not do everything you can to band together show yourselves and the majority that your more than they say you are? Take pride.</p>

<p>However expressing pride for your European ethnicity is perfectly fine. Our particular brand of civilization catapulted mankind technologically and socially through the scientific method and distinctly European political and economic philosophy. That&#39;s a wonderful thing to take pride in. Of course Western empire is guilty of atrocities, but all civilizations are. That&#39;s not a justification, but it certainly is a movement away from condemnation.</p>

When the average person thinks of &quot;Black Pride&quot;, they think of people like MLK or Malcom X, both who history has looked favorably on. When you think of &quot;White Pride&quot;, you think of Hitler, Nazism, and the &quot;Aryian Master Race&quot;, all of which are despised by the common people.

There&#39;s nothing wrong with Irish Pride, or Polish Pride, or Italian Pride, etc, because those are actual places with long backgrounds and histories.  Generic white pride, on the other hand, is celebrating something much more modern, without a unifying principle (like location or even heritage) other than justification for discrimination and mistreatment of native and black people.  Black is different, because slavery means that modern African-Americans generally can&#39;t trace their heritage back to specific places pre-America.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the real reason &quot;White People&quot; aren&#39;t allowed to express pride?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you being oppressed because of your skin color, or because of your socio-economic status? </p>

<p>Why would you even be butthurt that you can&#39;t express &quot;white pride&quot; unless your a fucking racist. &quot;White pride&quot; comes from one particular strand of thinking that at it&#39;s root and core is fucking racist. </p>

<p>How about having some human pride, or pride in the brotherhood of man, or species pride, or even good ole American pride. Naw, you just want to be a resentful little shit, bitching about how it isn&#39;t fair that your race pride will never be taken seriously, and how it will never be considered anything other than racist. Whiteness didn&#39;t make many white people great. Their success and genius had and has nothing to do with them being white, and trying to appropriate that for your belief in a &quot;white culture&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist in any meaningful way (4chan is the future of this racist shit, and your future looks like the worst kinds of shitposts). </p>

<p>Of course, you are completely ignorant of actual culture, right? Do you have a favorite painter or poet? Do you understand the difference between classical and quantum mechanics? Do you get that the observable universe is only 1/1 000 000 000th of the size of the unseen universe? That means you are fucking insignificant and meaningless. You are a fucking accident of nature, who will be forgotten by time, like all of humanity regardless of skin color, orientation, religion, or frequency of anon shitposts.
Just try getting over it and not giving a shit.</p>

<p>Get some real perspective (ie you and everyone around is ultimately nothing)  and get the fuck over it. You&#39;ll be happier than sitting here stroking your rage cock. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard this perspective multiple times in my life. It doesn&#39;t get better with each new iteration.</p>

<p>Asking if you have some fucking culture is hate? Lol. You don&#39;t have a favorite poet because you have no soul. You don&#39;t have a favorite painter because you have no vision. </p>

<p>Lol. You aren&#39;t oppressed, you are repressed. It&#39;s completely obvious to anyone who has evolved past their lizard brain. 
Do you think it is good to work? to have a job? be a provider? because you are told everyday what to think at your job, how to behave, what you can be proud of. Are you harmed by that? because if you think that&#39;s true, then you are a fucking communist -- you just probably don&#39;t know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black pride exists because it&#39;s a way for black people to take something that has traditionally take power of something that was originally harmful. Blacks had been dehumanized, literally owned as property. Treated like second class citizens by many because of the color of their skin. Judge someone because they&#39;re black? They can take pride in who they are and empower themselves and others.</p>

<p>White pride on the other has a pretty rough history, typically associated with the very same people who were already treating black people like complete shit. White pride as we know it arose out of a feeling of superiority. Nazis, White Supremacists, the Klan.</p>

<p>Sure maybe not all white people can trace there heritage back far. Maybe they&#39;re so much of a mutt like me that they can&#39;t even keep track of all the different countries I have ancestors from. End of the day the white people in this country came here because their ancestors chose to. Also, as diverse as European cultures are, they&#39;re fairly homogeneous compared to the many of the cultures in Africa.</p>

<p>As for Africa kicking European settlers out, of course they did. They were exploited and largely controlled by Europeans for so long, whenever the chance arose to oust some European power in Africa, they did. </p>

<p>North Africa infiltrated by ISIS? What about South Africa. I wonder if it has anything to do with the geographical proximity in North Africa, combined with the fact that Islam is largely practiced in the region compared to South Africa (although that really just comes down to proximity too)</p>

<p>From my DNA I found out I am Jewish, European white &amp; brown, West &amp; East Asian and Melanesian (black from Pacific Islands). About half Jewish, quarter European and equal parts all the rest. My siblings are roughly the same in varying quantities, but a couple also showed North &amp; West African from 6 generations back. We have traced our specific ancestors and see we are descended from one US slave owner and one slave. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been accused by friends of being a racist and white privilege for ... well... for not voting for Hillary Clinton and not being all up in arms supporting BLM. </p>

<p>I look white, just plain white. Can&#39;t I just be proud of that? I guess I agree with the OP.</p>

<p>But to be honest, I can&#39;t really be bothered to care about being proud of it. I just be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s the &quot;majority social norms&quot; and then there&#39;s anything outside of those social norms which are labeled &quot;taboos&quot;. If the general consensus of a population is to get married (to the opposite sex), have kids, and get a job,, it isn&#39;t frowned upon. Now, when people go outside of these norms, they are ostracized and criticized, and since they are not part of the majority, they are by definition the minority. Minorities are not self labeled, but it is the majority who labels minorities and criticizes them. So to circumvent this criticism, minorities wear these labels as a badge of honor and have pride in going against the status quo. This doesn&#39;t apply to just social norms, it also applies to race... and seeing that the majority of people here in the U.S. are white... Well you get the picture. There&#39;s really no need to shout out your straight white male- it&#39;s redundant and we can already assume you are proud of your status and are taking advantage of the many benefits the majority herd community has to offer you. </p>

Here are some reasons since your brain cant get past color:
1, most bankers, capitalist, politicians are white.
2, a woman is dead because of white pride.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been struck for your beliefs? Do you attend white power branded events? </p>

<p>I do not advocate punching literal neo-nazis, or whatever form of bigot is on display, to be clear. Al long as there just talking. On the flip side, IMO, it&#39;s better to not make them into  maytyrs, and simply show scorn and disapproval at beliefs that need violence towards others to be accomplished. Self segregate all you fucking want, homeboys. Just don&#39;t force it on others, like anything else. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re proud of your heritage, good for you. Yelling about won&#39;t be replaced is the fear of impotency, and I&#39;ll engage in a stereotype here and assume that most actual racist swine has inferiority complexes, and likely engages in repetive behaviors that enforce these ideas. Actual cucked little dicked morons who hate blacks till fantasy football day at the rap concert. Sorry that&#39;s a divergence, but I&#39;LL NEVER understand why racists engage in the cultures they supposedly hate, if they&#39;re not trying to better themselves. Maybe this is just an Ohio thing, but it was like that in parts of Nj, Nc and KY. Memphis and philly, however, felt different. There was some racial tension, but it wasn&#39;t the same. They felt like places where everyone had one culture. On the other side, minorities will always feel singled out and vulnerable, unable to just be nondescript, and forced to deal with constant cultural awkwardness. </p>

<p>One of my buddy&#39;s once told me the story of when he first met his wife&#39;s parents. She didn&#39;t tell them he was black, and they just happened to make fried chicken. He fucking loves fried chicken, not because he&#39;s black, but because it&#39;s awful for you and delectable and awesome. The mom was so embarrassed, she blurted out &quot;she didn&#39;t warn me you were black, I wasn&#39;t being racist.&quot; Then tried to take the chicken away and order pizza. He did not want to be rude, but he wanted the damm homemade chicken, so he just told her that it was actually genetically impossible for a black man to turn down fried chicken made by white ladies. She then told him HE was being racist, even though he was just trying to kid. She never made them fried chicken again, either. For the record, he said it was kinda dry anyhow, but the casserole was good. This was one of the odder tales he told me, most, however, were just depressing. </p>

<p>All kinds of people are snowflakes, it&#39;s just about different shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those guns weren&#39;t fake. The Southern Poverty Law Center clearly states they have been becoming more militant over the years. Imagine if the news was showing videos of these guys and CNN was puting out breaking news that &quot;Black supremacists becoming more militant.&quot; This article is from 2008 but CNN has breaking news headlines about shit that happened like 50 years ago so they could definitely use this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how do you not get this. </p>

<p>There are many groups that use &quot;whatever pride&quot; of their heritage that are not racist hate groups. </p>

<p>There are few groups that use &quot;white pride&quot;, however all are exclusively racist or hate groups. </p>

<p>It really couldn&#39;t be anymore clear but thats the last time I will try to explain it to you, the point has obviously gone way over your head. </p>
