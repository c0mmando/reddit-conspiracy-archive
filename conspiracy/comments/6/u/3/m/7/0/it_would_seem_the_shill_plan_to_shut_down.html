       I ask the racist people to leave us to our alien theories and study of ancient civilizations, knowing full well that this process of corporate censorship probably cannot be stopped.
       <br/>
       The shills will encourage the few actual racists until the conspiracy theorists just leave to escape the hateful rhetoric.

       Didnt you get the memo, everyone is racist now.  Too much truth up in here, so they have to say "racist stuff spews from here" to shut it down.  The op is clearly one of them, and is not warning us, but rather threatening us.  T_D is just a trump meme sub lolz!.

       This made sense early on when it wasn't so shilly in here. The few that were around were fine because you can see what their new angle was for the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lately, they are everywhere, in almost every top comment. And if you have an opposing opinion, they don't try to have a discussion, they instantly insult you &amp; twist your words. It gets tiring.

       Learn when to stop discourse.  Some shills exist only to waste your time in a single comment chain that will then get buried.  This tactic keeps thoughtful comments (and commenters) out of the casual reader's eye.  It does suck to see highly upvoted dogshit comments, though.

       You fight for the the deep state and establishment, so will never be able to fully engage in the proper topics here, because you won't being yourself to understand it.

       Trying to cause bickering and arguing in the comments sections and shitty posts like this won't work.  It just comes across as petty and obvious.

       Theres no decent arguments or points the establishment following left can make that will have any interest here.

       You're better off trying to convince admins that the pace is a hate sub to get it shut down.  That's pretty much the only hope you have of taking down a conspiracy subreddit.

       Conspiracies aren't just limited to alien theories and ancient civilizations though.  There is a valid argument that conspiracy can apply to any facet of life (even say food production).
      </p>
      <p>
       Overabundance of one facet of conspiracy in a short amount of time does show something else is going on however.

       Personally I think this sub should stick to the objectives that are clearly outlined in the subreddit description.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that the forces opposed to the those objectives seek to muddy the definition of conspiracy so much that it is essentially interchangable with terms like pseudoscience, propaganda, disinformation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Identifying as a "conspiracy theorist" should be an honorable and dignified title, shouldn't it? It's a shame that the term didn't spring up organically and was instead created for the exact purpose that is currently being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       If places like Google have their way in a few months Nazi will also be interchangable with conspiracy theorist

       <p>
        compiled by a respected former British MI6 agent named Christopher Steele,Wikipedia's W.svg describes ties between Trump, his advisors, and Russia, along with various Russian efforts to exploit these. Steele was contracted to build a file on Trump’s ties to Russia as part of an opposition research effort undertaken for a bipartisan group of anti-Trump Republicans and Democrats

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        in February 2017, multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials confirmed that some of the conversations between individuals described in the dossier did actually take place on dates and times detailed in the dossier,[12] and "people who discounted it initially have begun to take it more seriously".[13]
A number of claims contained in the dossier — e.g. that Russia agreed to hack DNC emails and funnel them to Wikileaks in exchange for a pro-Russia posture by Trump — have been increasingly corroborated, and numerous other examples of ties between the Trump staff and the Russian government appear to support the dossier's conclusion that Trump is figuratively in Russia's pocket.[14][15]
In July 2017, a series of emails were released that documented Donald Trump Jr's. contact with a Russian attorney in hopes of receiving derogatory information on Hillary Clinton that he understood was "part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump". The emails indicated that the Trump campaign was willing and eager to receive assistance from the Russian government, giving some credibility to allegations contained in the Steele dossier that Putin’s regime was actively funneling derogatory Clinton material to Trump's inner circle.

       Contest mode is useful because it disrupts the paid votes and shill comments. I personally have sorted by new or controversial ever since the shills  have taken over the top comments. The paid votes are painfully obvious can't you see it?

       i dunno.
      </p>
      <p>
       what I think is weird is that if you go the front page of this sub you will find mostly right wing minded threads, with thousands of upvotes. The highest upvoted thread may be left wing, but most of the threads on the front will be right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you go into those threads the highest upvoted comments will usually be more left wing
      </p>
      <p>
       why is that? are people who disagree with the intended point of the thread commenting but still upvoting the thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive always thought that somebody is using upvote bots to vote on what threads make it to the top but not on comments

       Even if they just make it temporary. To see if things chill out around here. I report ALL political posts I see. I don't care what side it's about.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the same headline is found in mainstream subs, it should not be here. 
When it's only about how shitty a political person is, that shouldn't be here. 
When it's saying "hey, this side did it too!" it shouldn't be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the people saying that would be unfair &amp; how would you define "Political" And the ones who have blamed this sub for being for one side only while insulting people...You are the problem. You know DAMN WELL what is political &amp; shouldn't be in this sub. It's almost comical the amount of pure hate &amp; extreme ways topics are spun as well as peoples words. GROSS.

       Of course asking questions isn't racist. The using of bullshit interpretations of history to down play the genocide of 6 million Jews as not happening is absolutely racist because these conclusions always lead to the same bullshit over and over again of a massive Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. The same bullshit that's been pumped out since the 1900's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So sure keep asking as many questions as you want, keep believing in whatever you want, just don't be surprised if you get called racist for trying to sanitise the ideals of Hitler.

       There is plenty of evidence that we have been lied to about the holocaust, even the top historians admit that, but the propaganda and smears are strong as it is such an important narrative to continue.  To label someone as racist for simply researching the facts is simply a smear as an attempt to discredit the individual and to scare others off from daring to voice the same findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Jewish individiuals have been some of the front runners in exposing the holocaust lie.  Being an expert in history and understanding which parts are false does not mean someone is racist.

       You want to talk about propaganda? Lets see some of Hitlers views on Jews in his own words;

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/primary-source-133-adolf-hitler-speech-to-the-great-german-reichstag.pdf&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi82vPMg93VAhVZGsAKHQzCD9Q4ChAWCCQwAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEP3T_FQPVHfr5d8MnPKT-t7lOqNg">
         Today I want to be a prophet once more: if international Jewry succeeds in plunging the nations into another world war, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe!
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv2ch15.html">
         If at the beginning of the War and during the War twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, th sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain. On the contrary: twelve thousand scoundrels eliminated in time might have saved the lives of a million real Germans, valuable for the future.

       Mass graves, concentration camps, testaments from Nazi officals, telegrams and on and on and on and on.

       But sure for arguments sake, lets say your 'experts in history' are correct. Tell me the end game here, why did the fake it, what was the point of it all?

       Let me explain
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Hitler didn't trust the Jews
       </li>
       <li>
        Hitler didn't want the Jews in his country, he had an agreement with the Zionists for them to relocate into the middle east
       </li>
       <li>
        Hitler did move Jews into camps as he felt that they couldn't be trusted to be loyal to Germany, but would show loyalty towards Judism.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So all of that is true, but the bit about the camps being death camps, that's just post-war propaganda to make your enemy look evil.  There is no good evidence that this happened, the more you look into it you will find that the holocaust story does not hold together.  This should actually be good news for everyone as the holocaust stories which Hollywood give us are rather depressing, so to know that they never happened is a wonderful thing.

       Israel is the problem, not Jews. Genocidal ethno-states are repugnant. There's no mention of a Jewish homeland in any holy book, so you have to ask yourself why Lord Palmerston &amp; the British pushed so hard for the
