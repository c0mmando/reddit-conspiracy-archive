    <div class="md"><p>I never presupposed you couldn&#39;t have a reaction. Everyone is capable of a reaction. I stated that I believe certain reactions are anticipated and southgt after, and seek to caution anyone so compelled to have an emotional response to learning of the events of late. </p>

<p>The last line was an analogy aimed at insinuating that those in power manufacture conflict amongst the populous, getting them to break into factions and ultimately distracting them as a means of exerting further control over said populous. It is the basis of Chomsky&#39;s quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ensuing conflict is inevitably used to restrict rights under the guise of security, much in the way that the Patriot Act marked the advent of admitted mass surveillance on the American public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I think the best thing is to fight hateful free speech with...more free speech.  Scientology is finally getting some huge public butt whuppin, not with bans or suppression but by challenging their beliefs with critical conversation. Fight ideology with logic, but it also has a right to exist.
The end goal should be exposure of their flaws to prevent new membership, and peacefully letting the zealots die out. Make documentaries and debates even if debating them seems pointlessly painful. Make sure individuals talking about planning violence get put on watch lists.</p>

<p>The removal of free speech because the speech is disgusting sets a dangerous precedent. Depending on who the &quot;morally right&quot; majority are, your beliefs may end up screwed. Christian and dislike gays? Better hope the majority never sides against you. Atheist and dislike religion? Left? Right? Cat person?
Ok that last one was an extreme joke. But my point is this precedent, if set, can backfire on anyone. We are already seeing people with a blurred definition of &quot;violence&quot;. I will defend the rights of all Americans even if they are absolute scum.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as positive violence. At all. Anywhere. It does not exist. Americans and others need to stop deluding themselves that it exists. It&#39;s OK, because we &#39;fought&#39; the bad guy. No, you attacked someone out of your own hatred. If they were doing something violent: restrain them using non-violent methods.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I should have added to my post that I posit a third group should organically present itself as those who want conflict resolution/diminishing through nonviolent means. I don&#39;t believe this group will be represented in the media however, because as you said, the issue is with the sides we&#39;re being shown.

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t need a third group we need one group.</p>

<p>The issue is people have sticks to far up their asses to realize that their petty indifferences aren&#39;t that big of a deal. Indentity politics goes for everyone, not just the &quot;liberal left&quot;. Quite its utter bullshit.</p>

<p>We also need people to start calling it like it is, current events have shown the lenghts people will go to justify or defend shit tier idealogy under free speech. </p>

<p>People are more likely to align theirselves with a racist than to demonize racism because it makes them look bad to their peers. </p>

<p>We&#39;re in a state of bullshit solely due to the fact that people would rather straddle the line of &quot;politic/logically correct&quot; and it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4">Yuri Bezmenov</a> interview? It&#39;s my go to video for explaining the reality of the existence of psychological operations. In it, Bezmenov explains the politically correct movement as a product of a psyop. He states the operation takes &quot;the amount of time it takes one generation to complete public school.&quot;</p>

<p>There are a lot of videos thrown around here, and it&#39;s hard to discern the good from the bad. This one belongs to the former, I assure you. If you can&#39;t watch now, save it for a rainy day or for a lengthy car ride or something. He just sits and speaks, so the video isn&#39;t essential, just the audio. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s hurt feelings on both sides, and I think it&#39;s irresponsible to point in one direction when it comes to politically correctedness. It&#39;s more effective to point to specific instances of times when one group seeks to limit the accepted scope of debate.</p>

<p>This can be seen in the new Anti BDS laws being proposed. Using antisemitism as a guise, people seek to control businesses&#39; choice to purchase goods from whomever they please for whatever reasons they please. </p>

<p>The issue of antisemitism is inappropriately conflated with the refusal to purchase Israeli goods for personal reasons. It&#39;s portrayed as &quot;The US should support its democratic ally in the middle east.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single rational person who would suggest that a democratic state in the middle east is a bad thing. It would be awesome if every state were democratic where the people were free to self-determine. Instead, the two are equated, and we cannot <em>possibly</em> boycott Israeli goods without being an antisemite. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this is fair, and find it to be a good example or limiting freedoms through political correctedness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to agree with you, but I think your view of the situation is being distorted.</p>

<p>The issue is no longer a matter of divide/conquer. People have become so entrenched in this social mire that attempting to pull people from it would be a waste of time and resources.</p>

<p>We need a conflict, and a big one. We need people to die. Not just a few, but a LOT. I know this sounds horrible, but let&#39;s look at the psychology of the issue.</p>

<p>Currently there are two sides of this issue; one side professes to fight for minorities and &quot;the oppressed&quot;, but they want to provide segregation (aka safe spaces) so that they feel safe from white people. The other side is absolutely convinced that Islam, black people, and mexico are actively trying to destroy us. Each side conjures evidence, mostly out of context with very little actual supporting facts to maintain them. Currently both sides employ psychological tools to reinforce their beliefs when challenged:</p>

<p>&quot;Evidence is a tool of the white man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Black people are inherently evil, so it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a good person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;internalized misogyny.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve heard things like this before and when its reached this point, they don&#39;t want to come together and no amount of campfire sing-alongs is going to fix this. There are simply too many people entrenched emotionally and mentally to extricate themselves from these deeply ingrained notions they&#39;ve been brought to believe.</p>

<p>Think of it as a religion. The person of logic and reason will accept the challenge and look to peer reviewed sources for clarity. The religious person will simply explain away as best they can, deny the contradictions as a &quot;test&quot; of their faith, and tell themselves they&#39;ve won.</p>

<p>You say that violence won&#39;t fix it and neither will finger pointing or name calling, but &quot;taking a stand&quot; and refusing to engage is equally as foolhardy. Sometimes, standing up for yourself and fighting to preserve what you believe is necessary.</p>

<p>Both sides need to fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the sentiment that sometimes standing up for yourself is necessary. Make no mistake, I&#39;m no pacifist. If someone made me choose between my life or theirs through violent means, I&#39;ll do whatever I need to to make sure I walk away safe. My message was more about (hopefully) stopping things before it got to that point in the macro sense. I suppose I was more optimistic than you, but should your (admittedly justifiably) pessimistic view be correct, I would say I agree with you, despite being saddened by the realization. I just hope things are not too far gone. That was well said, thanks for the reply </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the shoe fits.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it should be our first course of action. If anything, a war on domestic soil about whether or not some pink haired feminist should be allowed to identify as cartoon character and pee in whatever bathroom she likes because biological sex is oppressive would be about second most retarded thing ever, the first being the pink haired feminist.</p>

<p>BUT...look at the tenacity of both sides. Look at the defensive dynamic of the ideologies. This isn&#39;t some passive notion shared by a &quot;loud and vocal minority&quot;. There are racists and bigots on both sides, rejecting fact for feelings, clamoring for attention because neither side is willing to admit they are wrong.</p>

<p>War should be our LAST course of action, but we&#39;d be fools to think it hasn&#39;t crossed their minds. &quot;antifa&quot; as ludicrous as their name is, is just as fascist and fanatical as the &quot;alt-right&quot;. Sure, we know they were riled by the financial and political elite, but the damage is done. Even if the top 1% wanted to put an end to it, they CAN&#39;T. They released the perfect weapon onto the masses; a weapon made of fear that requires the insecurity of the ones its mean to work on and make no mistake, it working.</p>

<p>If things continue on the trend they are currently moving toward, war is a real possibility. It won&#39;t be a war for freedom or equality; nothing so noble will be on the table. This will be war of pride.</p>

<p>The left will fight because they&#39;ve felt the spotlight of attention, emboldened by a sense of legitimacy granted by social media. The rejected, the bullied, the socially awkward teens of puberty have found a sense of &quot;rightness&quot; in the conflicting insanity that is social justice. They will feel obligated to fight because of white guilt imposed by a fear of being seen as racists.</p>

<p>The right will fight; in part because of the fanaticism of groups like the KKK clamoring that the left and the BLM are one and the same, degenerates who want to dissolve the American way of life in favor of whatever demon fits the bill; Islam, black power, terrorism. The rest of the right will fight because they feel so diametrically opposed to the ideology of the left.</p>

<p>You and I know both sides are equally stupid, but you and I both know that neither side is capable of admitting they are wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to be tolerant about things we don&#39;t happen to personally agree with that others may willingly do among themselves and quite another to find ourselves being forced to approve of and see that not simply tolerated but actively and officially promoted. </p>

<p>Children and young people do not need to be exposed to things they are by no means mature enough to fully understand or attempt to engage in without knowing enough about themselves or how it may affect them before they do. That particular problem is one that is grows in a climate of undue and unbridled adult permissiveness that fails to take them and their right to simply be children and youths into account.</p>

<p>For example, I don&#39;t particularly like the guy, and I think he&#39;s in over his head now, but I don&#39;t think it was appropriate or helpful in any way for Senator Chapelle-Nadal to call for Trump&#39;s assassination. Call me crazy, but I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s constructive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had an answer for that, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting on Reddit trying to learn a bit more about things. If anyone had an answer for that, we wouldn&#39;t be in the predicament in which we currently find ourselves. </p>

<p>I agree that the Patriot Act has significantly limited our freedoms; anything under the Prism spectrum does essentially. It turns into a debate of security vs. individual freedom, and that always gets ugly fast. </p>

<p>Even something like affirmative action can be seen as limiting rights in a way. For instance; Two 22 year old college educated recent graduates, one white, one black. Identical educational backgrounds, grades, and extracurricular/ communitity service activity. They both apply for the same job, but the black graduate gets the job. When affirmative action was passed, this was done to ensure jobs were not withheld for the basis of race, but now as more people are afforded equal opportunities and racism is far less widespread, is affirmative action still necessary? There will always be instances of fair and unfair choice. </p>

<p>I wish I had a solution for you, truly. I do know that it will be more difficult to find one if the public buys into the diatribe pushed by the media however. </p>
