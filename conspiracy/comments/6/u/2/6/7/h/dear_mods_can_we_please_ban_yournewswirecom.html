<p>Perhaps r/conspiracy could compile a list of &quot;more trustworthy&quot; and &quot;less trustworthy&quot; news sites. </p>

<p>Personally, I like Counterpunch and Consortium, plus a scattered variety of stand-alone stories and independent research I&#39;ve found here. But that&#39;s just me and YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda is considered a psychological weapon. This was legalized by obama and the congress in one of their many back room deals.2012-2013<br/>
<a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/new-bill-legalizes-government-propaganda-and-disinformation-on-american-citizens/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/new-bill-legalizes-government-propaganda-and-disinformation-on-american-citizens/</a></p>

<p>It is also a constitutional violation that violates the first ammendment: 
&quot;Freedom of the press in the United States is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment is generally understood to prevent the government from interfering with the distribution of information and opinions. Nevertheless, freedom of the press is subject to certain restrictions, such as defamation law.&quot; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_the_United_States">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>Evidence that CNN is an arm of CIA. Anderson cooper admits to working for CIA. 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kwMCIe2AGW8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kwMCIe2AGW8</a></p>

<p>As long as propaganda is committed legally and out in the open the public is victimized and misled. That violates the constitution and upsets the balance of power. It eliminates checks and balances that only a free press can provide. Even sadder it diminishes transparency and politicians that already are extremely corrupt can continue to operate defrauding and endangering the public. </p>

<p>CNN is a weapon aimed right at the us citizens holding the truth hostage. It is an act of terror and treason. The law needs tone repealed and the perpetrators should face judgement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sourced facts are not easy to debate on an emotional level. But the reality is that propaganda is legal and it is a psyop. And anyone who supports undermining the constitution and the 1st ammendment  is a traitor.

<p>I would love to know what leaps of logic you took to reach that ledge.  The twists and turn you used to navigate to that result.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sourced facts are not easy to debate on an emotional level. But the reality is that propaganda is legal and it is a psyop. And anyone who supports undermining the constitution and the 1st ammendment is a traitor. CNN is an arm of the CIA and therefore enemies of the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there&#39;s just so many issues.  Was CNN blocked because the sub felt that there was concrete evidence that it is, as an entity and not on an individual level, an arm of the CIA? Nope, was because of claim of threat of doxxing, something this sub did a couple days ago.  Again.  Of the wrong person. Again.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got a site, loaded with iffy scripts and shitty not-right articles, and you&#39;ve got the same people saying don&#39;t ban it that said ban CNN.  What I&#39;m trying to point out, is take a little step back and examine the situation as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am sorry. We are beating a dead horse. A tabloid is easy to spot. A propaganda tool is not. CNN is more dangerous than a tabloid. It pretends to be unbiased news. Unlike a tabloid. 
Reddits official policy is for you to downvote. I am not sure why you simply don&#39;t follow that. Instead you want to ban certain sites.because you don&#39;t agree with their content. I am guessing for political reasons. I simply downvote posts or minimize them and move on. Have you read 1984? No one needs you to control the truth. Perpetrators of lies are part of the conspiracy discussion. I hope you do not mind if I ask what conspiracies are you trying to control and limit here? What are you feeling so threatened by? </p>
