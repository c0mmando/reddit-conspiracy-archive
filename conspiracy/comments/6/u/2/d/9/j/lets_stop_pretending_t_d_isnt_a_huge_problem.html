       I get it. Trump was the underdog. Trump was the anti-establishment pick, at least he was by the time we got down to final nominations. Trump is constantly under fire from sources that we consider to be part of the establishment, helping him to maintain underdog status.
      </p>
      <p>
       But can we talk about r/The_Donald and their deep, aggressive love for censorship? Can we talk about the fact that I left a non-profane, simple comment that questioned what defense was left for them to make at this point, and was
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       (within ten minutes of leaving the comment) banned from the sub and received a mocking message from the mods? Can we talk about the fact that main posts in there cannot be downvoted so that they can continue to force their way into r/all?
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald is a propaganda machine, a dangerous one. This sub loves to talk about how r/politics, r/news, etc. have all fallen to the interests of the left, and yet somehow there exists a massive community on reddit in which one of the
       <strong>
        rules of the sub
       </strong>
       is that you are not allowed to criticize the President. Really think about that. Where in places like politics and news, criticizing the left might be met with a flurry of downvotes, in T_D, criticizing the President is met with a
       <em>
        ban
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that they need it to be a pure echo chamber. Echo chambers generate fervor, they are self-reinforcing loops of emotion that depend heavily on confirmation bias -- and with Trump, the line of reasoning helping to maintain the fervor-generator is so incredibly weak that
       <em>
        they cannot allow for disagreement itself
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say, recently I've been really disappointed with this sub and the way that it is handling the presidency. But I would
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       expect to be banned from this sub for expressing a thought that went against the grain, and THAT IS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SUB. This is the place where anti-establishment thoughts may be shared openly, picked apart, analyzed for their true validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the sidebar, I see that I am being asked to sign a petition to stop Google's censorship of the internet. I ask you -- why stop there? Why not place a heavily censored subreddit like T_D in our crosshairs too? Why do we criticize one echo chamber but then ignore another?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not the underdog anymore. He is the President. Stop drinking the fucking Kool-Aid already.

       The exclusion of r/politics truly ruins a good analysis idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the waves of t_d vs r/politics seem to differ a bit.  T_d brigades seem to get spammy, kinda blanket bombing a topic throughout a day(s), waiting for something to stick, then drive it home.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics brigades tend to show up en masse, using more of a brute force tactic, manipulating votes and comments early and often, "forcing" a particular post to rise to the top.  They leave a lingering wave of narrative themed posts over the next day or so, too.  And god forbid, if one of their msm outlets releases something even
       <em>
        slightly
       </em>
       incriminating against Trump, they will spam, invade, attack, brigade, no holds barred try to burn down this sub.  The "pissgate* fiasco was one of the most absurd sustained brigades I've seen.  "But.. but.. It's the greatest conspiracy of our lifetimes!!!  Reeeeeeee!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Both forms are irritating, but I tend to give t_d
       <em>
        slightly
       </em>
       more of a pass, since they're part of an overwhelming minority on Reddit, and their brigading tactics aren't as brutish and transparent.  Sure, they may be mostly bots and morons, but who am I to judge :)

       I see.  I made it about halfway, long enough to see him justify excluding r/politics, and it wasn't in his first set of numbers.  Honest mistake.  I don't have the interest in digging through all the comments, since I have other studies to pursue today.

       This whole Nazi scare thing is just baffling to me.  It's so artificial and forced, I just don't see any organic hysteria here.  Between wannabe SJW's spamming their Nazi freakouts, and righties twisting logic on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       detail to make it look like a false flag, it's just... weird.  And now there's this whole "if you don't agree with us you're a natzi too!" theme.  Strange times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that whether it's a true "false flag", or not, the whole situation is a media driven frenzy, causing people on both sides (mostly left, though) to turn into raving lunatics.  It's sad to see people be driven apart so easily, over such a contrived event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  We get it.  Natzi racists are bad.  Antifa fascists are bad.  Let's just stop getting sucked into staged events, forcing us to pick sides to hate, and turn our attention to the real murdering, racist fascists in Washington and MSM.

       I was on a reddit hiatus at the time, so I'm just piecing this together with Google searches. But that is how it appears.

      <p>
       They were created to attack Macron before the French elections with the fake leaked documents, then later they came back with Seth Rich and democrat posts. They were getting called out then started to copy comments over from T_D to create some bot hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a few posts about this including a stickied one in which mods commented saying they wouldn't ban them (and I can't see any bans in the log). But at least one person sent the admins a message and they shadowbanned the accounts.

       It is basically a conspiracy within Reddit to generate false support for the president that cannot be contradicted, as well as to ensure that said false support can continue to make the front page by removing the down vote button.

       Listen, I'm not American but even I know for a fact that there are a lot of morons out there who support this guy. There are a lot of morons who think that voting republican or democrat actually means something and that presidents are actually 'the boss.' There are actual legitimate Trump supporters in that sub. A lot of bots/shills too but some of that stuff is organic.

       I don't think they'd have to fake hate for Trump but I do think that anything remotely pro-Trump is drowned out by a sea of down votes. The key difference is that you will not be banned from politics if you express support for Trump.

       He is saying he proved me dishonest by posting one of my comments from a month ago. The screenshot I provided of the conversation between the mods and myself were from 145 days ago.

       He completely missed where it says that plain as day in the screenshot.

       Given that you posted something bannable, I'm betting it was bannable. If they didn't permaban, then its not like the donald. I was permabanned after one post.

       I'm as serious as your apparent spell of confusion. A sub is upsetting you. Don't go in it. You don't have to subscribe to them all.

       r/The_Donald is a fan sub.

       How about actually saying it in plain terms instead of leaving it conveniently vague enough for you to change the definitions to fit your current set of evidence? "C'mon

       Especially when they can't control the platform of discussion. You see them pump out post after post saying shit like "Hey
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       , what do you think of _____!" Then the people who visit the comments section don't see any dissent, which reinforces their beliefs.

       OP addressed this in his post, and I think he made a really good point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They know that they need it to be a pure echo chamber. Echo chambers generate fervor, they are self-reinforcing loops of emotion that depend heavily on confirmation bias -- and with Trump, the line of reasoning helping to maintain the fervor-generator is so incredibly weak that they cannot allow for disagreement itself.

       Ok, so you have a bottle full of something volatile, and right now the bottle is closed and you've moved it pretty far away from most of the things that its contents could actually threaten. Are you then just done paying attention to the volatility of the contents of the bottle? No concern for whether the energy in there is increasing, perhaps to the point where there is too much for it to stay in the bottle?
      </p>

       The bottle doesn't open into the rest of reddit, it opens into the real world.

       I'm not trying to feel morally superior to anyone, a lot of my close friends and family are Trump supporters. My grandmother is one of the greatest people I know, and her moral compass is definitely stronger than mine. That doesn't change just because she's been tricked into supporting Trump

       Because this isn't anyone's fan club, but rather a modest pursuit of the truth and we are quite capable of discerning between those who come here from virtually anywhere else who are like minded or else weighed down with various illusions that we all happen to have in one way or another. Some more so than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       We come here, hopefully, in an effort to shed some of those and gain a clearer picture of things. Some can, some can't, we can only make the best of it as we see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that spends any time here is bound to have their views about something undergo a change that will force them to re-think what they previously thought. That in itself opens the doors to the possibility that other things may need to as well.

       Sorry man, you're going to get crushed for this. You are one hundred percent right though. Unfortunately, there's no arguing with the special brand of stupid that t_d users bring to this sub. Conspiracy is basically a sister sub on the donald now and it's not getting any better. I wouldn't even be shocked if you were banned for this.

       I like keeping an eye on the crazy shit, that's why I also subscribe to r/esist, mostly I was just shocked at how innocuous the comment for which I was banned was. I also don't believe I have any reason that would suggest I am offended by anything? I don't really get truly offended by anything but personal attacks from people who actually know me.

       They don't like that in a 24-7 trump rally.     Don't do that?

       T_D is a bunch of trolls who have a little space on reddit but have been neutered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen all the anti-trump subs and posts every day? Every day reddit becomes smaller and smaller for T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning subs because they have different political ideologies is stupid and only would create an even bigger echo chamber on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would much rather see stupid posts like this toned down and disappear. We could use this "everyone against trump" a little less. You're carrying water for corporate democrats who rigged their own primary and cheated the country out of a progressive.
      </p>

       I don't give two shits about T_D, I care about this United propaganda effort that you're spreading whether knowingly or unknowingly.

       I post to 2 subreddits. T_D and this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to come here quite a bit on my old account before the election. It used to be pretty sweet. Lots of quality 9/11 posts. Lots of discussion on false flags, psychedelics, alien intelligence, mind control, psychic phenomena, all kinds of rad shit. You guys would post videos that would blow my mind. Yeah, i'd even watch the 7 hour long insane shit you guys would link.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since the election and very recently, a lot of really dark and evil shit has come to light. Really bad shit involving he deep state, pedo rings, treasonous activity and real earthly human type bad shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something has changed with this board and its because the bad people who engage in the real conspiracies want to contaminate this board and derail the
       <strong>
        true shit
       </strong>
       you guys find and create and post here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking T_D isnt helpful. Why even mention it? There are people who voted for Trump and go on T_D who actually do come to this board, and when a Trump supporting conspiracy buff learns about some really messed up shit, they will come here and post or comment. There is a LOT of REAL CONSPIRACY going on RIGHT NOW. For people like me who want truth and to expose conspiracies and who spend lots of time here and on /pol/ and other places ... people like me who just honestly are addicted to information and reading "the news" constantly, we just want to be able to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, there are more threads about Seth, the DNC, fucking Iran, Russia, the CIA, etc. Dude, its
       <em>
        what's happening right now
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of shills come on this board to derail actual discussion. Don't believe in ShareBlue or CTR? Or is that another T_D exclusive conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was fucked out of being the DNC nom. We know this from wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clintons
       <em>
        fucking kill people
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is fucking really happening and its an actual fucking conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, this shit takes up a lot of my time. And it probably will for some time. Its no different than people who obsess over chemtrails or fucking antarctica or reptilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever. Can't we just focus on discussing
       <strong>
        conspiracies
       </strong>
       instead of fighting over who may or may not post in T_D?

       You know there are a lot of stupid reddits out there, many of which I disagree with. I don't go into the Brony subreddits and try to shit on them because who cares?

       But you have a mission. You are actively coming into conspiracy threads with mal-intent. If you really thought we were just a bunch of doofs, you simply wouldn't enter, much like it not being worth it to argue with someone who thinks the earth is flat.

       At this point it would be impossible to support Donald Trump on an internet forum without aggressive censorship. With only 30% support nationally, Trump has become so universally despised that anger and false narrative are all this demographic have left to embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is a rebellious teenage phase inflicting a small but vocal group of white males in the US and likely as many Russian bots helping Putin keep his bagman in power long enough to save Rosneft and Gazprom.

       I mean, the same exact thing happens in many pro-Hillary and other leftist subreddits. They're allowed to do what they want in their own thread. The majority of political subreddits are echo chambers and are that way by design. I frequent the donald, I also frequent late stage capitalism, politics, political humor, communism, and other subreddits to get an idea. Most of the people in the donald are normal people sick of identity politics and the establishment left. Then there are a decent number of crazies too. But that's true of every political subreddit. Just don't let it bother you. You say, "I have to say, recently I've been really disappointed with this sub and the way that it is handling the presidency. But I would never expect to be banned from this sub for expressing a thought that went against the grain, and THAT IS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SUB. This is the place where anti-establishment thoughts may be shared openly, picked apart, analyzed for their true validity." but that's the scope of this sub. The donald is literally a pro trump subreddit, so they have rules against anything that's not that stance, and there's many dozens of other sites where you can debate them. There's even ask the donald for the exact purpose of asking them questions. I think a lot of it has to also do with brigading, which has happened a lot to them because everyone on reddit hates them.

       The real problem is their private forums, where memes are generated for propaganda and narratives are decided. We've all seen the big floods after Trump shits the bed; those are spread through partly through T_D, but it's not where it starts or where it's coordinated from.

       i mean the_donald is supposed to be an echo chamber for donald trump whether you like it or not, it's openly admitted as you said in their rules. their problem with r/poltiics r/news is that they are supposed to be unbiased ways to get news but instead they lean left.

       You would think everyone would understand this. They clearly state "Be advised this forum is for serious supporters of President Trump." In fairness r/Politics should state: "Be advised this forum is for serious opposers of President Trump." I have been temp banned there several times simply because some mods assume I am trolling because of my username.

       I never post at T_D, because there is very little actual discussion, but sometimes I will visit just to see opposing view points and how his cheerleaders are reacting to the latest media outcry.

       Because you were in the wrong sub. The_donald is a pro-trump shit-posting site. If you want to talk about Trump then go to askthe_donald or asktrumpsupporters. It's in the rules. Get over it. It's supposed to be an echo chamber.  r/Politics should have been a good place but it's infested with alt-left propaganda.

       I visit T_D, pol, here and all kind of conflicting sites. I am Australian and I like Trump. I understand some of what you say but it's not all that way. There came a time where reddit censored T_D from /all and /popular and that is on going. There were times where T_D would not show on my top bar but politics has not one time in over a year not been there. T_D is dealing with site wide censorship and are doing what they can to get their shit seen, in my humble opinion. I post in T_D and comment in politics but only ever see T_D censored.

       It is basically a conspiracy within Reddit to generate false support for the president that cannot be contradicted, as well as to ensure that said false support can continue to make the front page by removing the down vote button.

       Listen, I'm not American but even I know for a fact that there are a lot of morons out there who support this guy. There are a lot of morons who think that voting republican or democrat actually means something and that presidents are actually 'the boss.' There are actual legitimate Trump supporters in that sub. A lot of bots/shills too but some of that stuff is organic.

       I see.  I made it about halfway, long enough to see him justify excluding r/politics, and it wasn't in his first set of numbers.  Honest mistake.  I don't have the interest in digging through all the comments, since I have other studies to pursue today.

       This whole Nazi scare thing is just baffling to me.  It's so artificial and forced, I just don't see any organic hysteria here.  Between wannabe SJW's spamming their Nazi freakouts, and righties twisting logic on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       detail to make it look like a false flag, it's just... weird.  And now there's this whole "if you don't agree with us you're a natzi too!" theme.  Strange times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that whether it's a true "false flag", or not, the whole situation is a media driven frenzy, causing people on both sides (mostly left, though) to turn into raving lunatics.  It's sad to see people be driven apart so easily, over such a contrived event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  We get it.  Natzi racists are bad.  Antifa fascists are bad.  Let's just stop getting sucked into staged events, forcing us to pick sides to hate, and turn our attention to the real murdering, racist fascists in Washington and MSM.

       Out of curiosity, what made that post rule 10?  Rule 4 I could see though I've honestly seen worse, but why 10?

       Yea, he showed that the messages between me and the mods from 145 days ago discussing my ban for a comment a month ago were dishonest.

       He is saying he proved me dishonest by posting one of my comments from a month ago. The screenshot I provided of the conversation between the mods and myself were from 145 days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       He completely missed where it says that plain as day in the screenshot.
      </p>

       So, this guy isn't the sharpest. As a heads up before arguing with him anymore.
