<p>And when did this surface in investigations? Or did investigations come away relatively empty handed?</p>

<p>You cut off my sentence by the way. Nice of you.</p>

<p>Was the coverage of Clintons emails a distraction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>exposing the fact that the Deep State has completely taken over the US gov</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t a fact though, it&#39;s an interpretation. Trump is being investigated for campaign collusion with Russia, that&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>If you want the media to <em>report</em> on the deep state they would have to engage in fake news because the facts don&#39;t add up to <em>news</em>, they add up to an <em>interpretation</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mockingbird has never been proven to exist in the manner you seem to think it does.</p>

<p>Trump, his campaign, and those connected have been doing that all along. Even core promises from him directly like building a wall and banning Muslims have opened up that whole demographic.</p>

<p>They were very smart, targeted all sorts of marginalised groups who will lick the face of anyone who looks like they might think about throwing them a bone ...one day. Conspiracy theorists included. There are still many here who think he will reveal the existence of aliens, tell us that 9/11 was a false flag and arrest every democrat because of pizzagate.
