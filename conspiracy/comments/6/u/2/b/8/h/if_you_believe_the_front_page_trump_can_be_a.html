       This isn't a fact though, it's an interpretation. Trump is being investigated for campaign collusion with Russia, that's a fact.

       If you want the media to
       <em>
        report
       </em>
       on the deep state they would have to engage in fake news because the facts don't add up to

       , they add up to an

       Trump, his campaign, and those connected have been doing that all along. Even core promises from him directly like building a wall and banning Muslims have opened up that whole demographic.

      <p>
       They were very smart, targeted all sorts of marginalised groups who will lick the face of anyone who looks like they might think about throwing them a bone ...one day. Conspiracy theorists included. There are still many here who think he will reveal the existence of aliens, tell us that 9/11 was a false flag and arrest every democrat because of pizzagate. It's really bloody sad to see people being used.
