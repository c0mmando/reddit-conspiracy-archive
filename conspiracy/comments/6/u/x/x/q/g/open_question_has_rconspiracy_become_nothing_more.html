    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It got really bad recently&quot; I&#39;ve noticed this as well. I wonder if visitors to this sub would be willing to participate in a kind of survey... For example.ma provocative post could be created with the guidelines of the sub and visitors could make public whether they voted up or down etc. The post could have a link with a counter to gauge funny business with votes. A few thousand participates would yeild a viable statistical sample.</p>

<p>Part of the issue is you don&#39;t have anywhere else to go, yes you have specific subs for specific conspiracies but many of these are either hard to find or overly spiritual. </p>

<p>Also formerly good members seem to have run jumping naked into the woods desperate to convert everyone to their &#39;new&#39; system which they have just copied and renamed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It kind of sucks, because I monitor the &#39;new&#39; queue and upvote the posts that get into the more traditional conspiracy topics, downvote the obvious political propaganda and bullshit, but I  am only a single vote in the end. When something is going to get brigaded and certain commentary manipulated to the top of a comment section, my single vote does not seem to have much effect.</p>

<p>I think, in some respects, we are collectively a bitch to our own no-censorship policy. The good intent behind that idea has been hijacked and it&#39;s become bastardized by shilling operations and political bullshit. It&#39;s become a huge pissing contest here. the tone of our front page fucking sucks right now and it is really frustrating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a> for people who lean right and are tired of being dog piled for talking about R-wing stuff that is deemed thought crime by the CTR/shareblue.</p>

<p>I suggest someone do the same for the left although be warned TMOR already created ConspiracyLeft and it&#39;s a shit show from go.  </p>

<p>My theory is that the only way to still be able to talk is to segregate based upon political leanings so the opposite shills aren&#39;t allowed a platform.  And yes I think there are shills on both sides.</p>

<p>No kidding. Plus, ever notice how in some thread with 400+ comments, you always get people saying, &quot;I miss the old conspiracy. I want my aliens and jfk.&quot; Even get front page posts expressing that sentiment. Then, when there&#39;s Actually a post about aliens or JFK, no one cares, it gets like 300 upvotes at best</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my view from someone who&#39;s been subbed here for 4 or so years and watched this place grow and evolve over time.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say traditionally this has been a pretty anti-establishment, anti-government-sub that has leaned heavily to the right as the years have gone on due to who was in power. Now there&#39;s a right-wing president in office you&#39;re getting more left-leaning people coming to this sub because many people believe there was a conspiracy by a foreign country to put that man in power. However the right-wing people are still here and like others have said this has become kind of a battleground of ideological clashes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. This is the first time in eight years that there&#39;s been a republican president. </p>

<p>Back when Bush was in office there were a million conspiracy theories involving him. Then Obama got in, and everybody shifted to conspiracy theories involving him......... And some people are so committed to those theories that they won&#39;t look at Trump suspiciously.</p>

<p>What really distinguishes this is that when Obama was in office, and even beforehand, the conservatives picked up on the potential power of conspiracy theories and started directing them at Obama as a political attack. They&#39;d done it previously, IE the &quot;Swiftboat&quot; campaign ads, or when they planted the conspiracy theory that John McCain had an illegitimate black daughter........ But they took it to new heights, guys like Glen Beck and Alex Jones. </p>

<p>So what you have is one side that discovered that conspiracy theories are an extremely effective way of attacking your political opponent. That&#39;s why Fox News was pushing the Seth Rich story, Trump was pushing Birtherism, and all of the right wing media is pushing anything they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this sub was deliberately ruined. I don&#39;t honestly believe this was the overall intention of other users when some tried to hijack the direction of this sub and push it towards a political ideation. However, I do think that this effect (the subreddit becoming so stagnant and becoming a safe space for like-minded individuals who tell the loudest) was caused by users of the sub becoming so toxic and determined that their own voice was the only right voice; allowing no dissenting opinions. How then, to make this board better, to take it back to its original roots of speculative discussion and interest? My only answer is that maybe if the few conspiracy users who wish to have their subreddit back would collectively agree not to fall for obviously inflammatory bait posts, perhaps the shills/trolls would become bored and stop trying to vehemently push their agendas down our throats. But it would require a lot of concerned, on-going effort; and let&#39;s be real, this is Reddit; where yesterday looks like a few years ago and the future belongs to those who can shape the narrative in a subtle, contrived way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it has not screwed it up. Just ignore it like everybody else. We live in divisive times. We are not privy to lots of info, and weird shit is happening. Watch and listen and wait, and when the time comes, act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the only conspiracies that are acceptable are the same stuff you see on MSNBC and CNN, then the sub has been compromised. </p>

<p>There are real political conspiracies but the Russia situation is not one. It&#39;s a smear campaign and they are derailing all conversation to this and saying &quot;trumps the president now he&#39;s establishment&quot; and it&#39;s so stupid it&#39;s obvious.</p>

<p>Yes there are tons of shills and they push the same narratives you find in politics and CNN. They try to covertly push the same &quot;Russia conspiracy&quot; you find on CNN and they act like its organic. And those comments get tons of upvotes more than any in the thread and if you dissent you are downvoted into oblivion.</p>

<p>Nearly all comments are supporting the narrative too it&#39;s crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the better and more important question to ask is: &quot;has conspiracy become an echo chamber of conspiracy narratives and anyone who disagrees is considered a shill?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think both &quot;sides&quot; of the political debate have a certainn percentage of people who actually aren&#39;t at all political in the sense of the debate of policy (improving government vs. limiting government, being the central debate). In most cases, these people are simply born into a family or environment that supports a certain party, and they stick with it.</p>

<p>These people are both extremely susceptible to suggestive half-truths that confirm their self identity as one of the &#39;good guys&#39;.</p>

<p>I feel like the game of politics has gone so far to influence these people due to our being in the information age, that they areb having a really hard time adapting to it and keeping their sanity.</p>

<p>I just feel like the only political conversation that is worth happening is actually what policy we are pushing, could be pushing, and should be pushing. All else is just noise meant to segment votes out for the politcal parties. </p>

<p>The problem is, the people who know the least, are always the loudest. So these folks, once again DEFINITELY from both sides, are drowning out the actual conversations we absolutely need to be happening right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even really comment here anymore.  Anything you say is going to be taken as being a shill for one side or the other.  Even better is that saying the wrong thing immediately gets you tagged as a Nazi sympathizer, and those wrong things seem to be growing in number by the minute.  </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t have the patience or the energy to try and find some actual discourse here, which is probably exactly what they want, but still.  </p>
