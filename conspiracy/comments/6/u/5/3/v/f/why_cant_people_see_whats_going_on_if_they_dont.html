    <div class="md"><p>this happened in portugal in the 1800s except the roles were a little reversed (globalist merchants overthrowing monarchy) in any event, the ousted PTB staged a counter move and ended up temporarily getting power back when one of the children seized power after claiming his father couldn&#39;t defend himself against provacatorss. This ended up in full-blown civil war. thought it would be interesting if this counter revolution got to one of the kids as dt gets older, weary from constant barrage. prolly not though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one because jews are not all in on this, as an example I&#39;m wealthier than some and so are you. How do you tell the grain from the chaff? Then you have goyim who are in on it, do you give these guys a pass? The masons, politicians, journalists and what not? If not, same problem, how do you tell the grain from the chaff? </p>

<p>The way you tell the grain from the chaff is you let the confrontation run its course, whatever wins gets to be the grain, the chaff will then lay low or convert. But you can bet your ass you will have jews on your side, and eventually you might even be glad they were on your side... Jesus comes to mind.</p>

<p>Please read that link. Here&#39;s what another reddit user mentioned about it as well:</p>

<p>&quot;there were Herodian/Roman-backing &quot;Establishment&quot; priests, the Pharisees and such, who Gentilized the Jewish Messianism of the first century.</p>

<p>Establishment theory has always held, because of the New Testament, that there was a &quot;Judaization&quot; of Christianity, but in reality, Christianity in its Gentile, Paulinized form was a breaking away from the Messianic Jews of the time.</p>

<p>Paul was a Herodian Pharisee Jew, or at least claimed to be, ergo, everyone is reading Revelations&#39; &#39;synagogue of satan&#39; the wrong way. Paul the Pharisee claimed Jewish ties, and in effect created Gentile Messianism, or Christianity, as we know it, which grew into... the Roman Catholic Church. The Synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>Revelations is pretty clearly a &#39;Jewish Christian&#39; book with later Gentile Christian interpolations or additions to fit more closely to what would become orthodox Christianity. The writer of Revelations, clearly more of a Messianic Jew than a Messianic Christian, would have identified what would become the Church as the synagogue of satan.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep telling myself what? That you made two anti-jew posts TODAY already, this being your third? Because you did, it&#39;s in your post history. Or that I&#39;m drinking Manischewitz and eating a bagel?? Okay, maybe I&#39;m not, but goddamn I wish I was! I haven&#39;t had a good bagel in a while. I love the all seed bagels after you heat them up. OH! So good! A little cream cheese, some purple onion, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Manischewitz is great too, especially if you put some vodka in there. OH! Maybe some champagne, make like a kosher mimosa. </p>

You have to be open to other ideas if you believe you know what&#39;s going on with 100% certainty without any credible proof, YOU may be the one willfully ignorant and afraid of realizing what you have been taught your whole life is a lie.</p>

<p>Aristotle said: &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know much, truthfully. We all take the info we seek out, compare it to our own personal agenda (which we all have), and come to conclusions. But that doesn&#39;t mean we KNOW. Especially when it comes to the bible. So many previous tribes before the bible were written. The bible was edited with books being thrown out that didn&#39;t fit the Catholic church&#39;s agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you&#39;re making assumptions about me just to make yourself feel better. I am well researched in this area, and you&#39;re not making any credible points. It&#39;s racist rhetoric, posted by a racist user, found on a racist website.</p>

<p>Pro tip: When you make your next anti-Jew post, DO NOT post anything about Stormfront. Use a website with a less obvious agenda.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you &quot;don&#39;t hate all Jews&quot;. You&#39;ve shown a very clear prejudice against Jews, and you defended a white supremacy website. You&#39;ve shown that you&#39;re racist, stop pretending that you&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give it a rest dude. These people aren&#39;t even jews. They are the devil reincarnate haven&#39;t you ever read the bible?  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. I just said jews because that&#39;s what everyone identifies them as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Devil reincarnate....Have any ACTUAL proof? Have any proof the devil ever existed? Oh, the Bible.....you know that&#39;s not historically accurate, right? If the Bible is the basis for all your conspiracies, you have a LONG ways to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://presscore.ca/bible-identifies-the-catholic-church-as-the-synagogue-of-satan">http://presscore.ca/bible-identifies-the-catholic-church-as-the-synagogue-of-satan</a></p>

<p>Please read that link. Here&#39;s what another reddit user mentioned about it as well:</p>

<p>&quot;there were Herodian/Roman-backing &quot;Establishment&quot; priests, the Pharisees and such, who Gentilized the Jewish Messianism of the first century.</p>

<p>Establishment theory has always held, because of the New Testament, that there was a &quot;Judaization&quot; of Christianity, but in reality, Christianity in its Gentile, Paulinized form was a breaking away from the Messianic Jews of the time.</p>

<p>Paul was a Herodian Pharisee Jew, or at least claimed to be, ergo, everyone is reading Revelations&#39; &#39;synagogue of satan&#39; the wrong way. Paul the Pharisee claimed Jewish ties, and in effect created Gentile Messianism, or Christianity, as we know it, which grew into... the Roman Catholic Church. The Synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>Revelations is pretty clearly a &#39;Jewish Christian&#39; book with later Gentile Christian interpolations or additions to fit more closely to what would become orthodox Christianity. The writer of Revelations, clearly more of a Messianic Jew than a Messianic Christian, would have identified what would become the Church as the synagogue of satan.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s the last post and all, but one thing had always intrigued me about people obsessed with this type of conspiracy. If the &quot;bad&quot; people are of the Khazar origin that means the &quot;bad&quot; people are actually evil white people pretending to be Jews. You assume they must be super rich and powerful, otherwise how did they come to control everything. So, why don&#39;t your Storefront friends burn down banks, news stations or magazines, instead of targeting synagogues or wasting energy to keep Confederate statues from being removed? Hell, these all powerful Khazar probably funded the Confederates and the Union, right. Hell, when di they burn down a Jewish center, or Target real Jews, they are just tormenting innocent people, by your logic. Seems, that Storefront might be a Khazar front to distract you from the real &quot;bad&quot; people. Maybe everything you believe, based on research you obtain from this and other Khazar fronts, is all lies. At the end of the day, it&#39;s very likely the &quot;bad&quot; guys are super rich white men who have been passing their wealth down generations, manipulating the world for their gain, all the while posing as Jews right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading when you said Khazar I searched it up and read up on it <a href="http://www.reformation.org/khazaria.html">http://www.reformation.org/khazaria.html</a> and wow I had no idea of how history and the bible correlated.  So that means these white men posing as &quot;jews&quot; (are they zionists too?) that actually have all the money are fighting to gain Palestine all so the anti-christ will reveal himself? Why are they doing this? Do they know they aren&#39;t actual jews? I can&#39;t seem to completely wrap my head around this. Why are normal jews supporting zionism? </p>
