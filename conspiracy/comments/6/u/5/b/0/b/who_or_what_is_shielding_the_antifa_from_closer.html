       You would think that there would be considerable public interest in Antifa, right?  Young, thin, fierce. Stylish black balaclavas. Super photogenic while hurling molotov cocktails with smoke in the background.  Veins bulging in their necks as they scream "Fuck you Nazi!"  Sounds to me like they have all the ingredients for a Neilson ratings or click-bait winner, right?  But ... media silence.  No segments on the news.  No mini-docs.  No online reportage.  Why?  And now, in the age of instant reporting (Twitter), any comments that slip out prior to an editor's scrub are subject to quick "clarifications."  ( Reference NYT WH Correspondent Cheryl Gay Stolberg who tweeted this from Charlottesville:  "The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right. I saw club-wielding "antifa" beating white nationalists being led out of the park."  Of course she later clarified. And then ... more silence.  Are they being shielded from scrutiny?  If so, why? And by whom?

       Wow! I checked to see if my post "went through" and I already had a comment. That was fast! Anyways, I didnt think I wrote anything too hyperbolic; these are my observations and my thoughts.  And in the case of Stolbeg, fact. I guess you disagree?

       I think they're more or less the same people who've been showing up to left-wing protests and causing trouble for decades now, for which they are frequently called out, but when that trouble is directed at literal Nazis people are cool giving them a pass.

       The issue is not that the data is wrong, it's that you are interpreting it in a ridiculously simple and misleading way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks have lower IQ on average because of poverty, worse schooling, less opportunities to succeed, etc. Jews and Asians are higher because they're typically more well off or have a cultural work ethic that would serve them better in education and employment. These things can be traced back tens to hundreds of years in the past to things like slavery or Jim Crow laws that put black people where they are today. Of course black people can break out of the cycle and succeed if they work hard, but they have to work that much harder than (on average) other races.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a whole thing in the JonTron vs Destiny debate earlier this year, where I think Destiny explained it pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you agree with that conclusion, looking at a simple data point (average IQ) and making a simple statement (black people have lower IQs) is disrespectful of statistics and of the black people you're making the implication of.

       Okay, but which has a more direct correlation? Which one is more representative of reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks have lower IQs because more of them are stuck in the cycles of poverty that affected their parents and grandparents, which afford them less chances in life to get a good education. Alcoholism and drug use are rampant and epidemic. The same can be seen in white rural communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Representing the data as "black people on average have lower IQs" carries the assumption that it's because they're black, not because of economics or social issues. Which is unfair.

       They are ridiculous.  They have no power in the country.  They are a particularly small group.  I read somewhere that the Flat Earth Society has more members than the leading neo-Nazi group.  If they break the law, deal with that.  If they somehow seem to be gathering strength, then be concerned, but at this point, it is the anarchist / communist Antifa who are the far bigger problem.

       Not really.  There are not very many neo-Nazi's in the US.  Americans fought the Nazi's in WWII, so what would be the appeal?  I suspect that some of those in the Charlottesville rally were plants, and the antics -- t-shirts, flags -- was just theater .. . quite silly.  The torches were also ridiculous -- and again, a set up. The neo-Nazi's have little presence in the public sphere, while Antifa violence and anarchism has grabbed headlines since Trump got elected.  I think they are well funded and their role is to create havoc.  Their hope is to bring down the legitimate government.  People need to pay more attention to Antifa.

       Yes, but some people are bloodthirsty and will justify their violence by saying they have a right to assault nazis because nazis advocate genocide. Even if the person in question never advocated anything and is actually just a run-of-the-mill racist person protesting because they want to venerate Confederate war heroes. They make it seem as if being a white racist is equivalent to committing genocide to justify their violence.

       Wooow, what a fucking surprise that the same accounts show up to dismiss the violence perpetrated by the antifa terrorists.  We certainly have a lot of terrorist sympathizers in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hate violence on both sides, you don't have to downplay innocent people getting knocked unconscious and swarmed by the antifa pussies.  Those cowards have been doing it since at least Berkeley, and probably for longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because antifa hasn't killed anyone yet they get a free pass to be political extremist thugs being violent to cause fear in order to push their political agenda?  What's that again, oh yeah, TERRORISM.  Just because they're a bunch of scummy losers doesn't mean they can't be violent too.  I'd probably be violent as well if I was as grimy as those rejects.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/ReadyToLoveAgain, we don't hear about antifa because they are the spaz army that George Soros created to be his domestic terrorists in this country.  Most of the losers who think they're antifa are just brainwashed zombies but, the money and movement behind the name is all a ploy to destabilize our country.  They are there as bait to get a reaction out of crazies on the right so that the globalists can clamp down on our freedoms even more.

       Or maybe we don't hear about them because they're a nearly non existent boogeyman who hasn't killed anyone. Maybe since they were opposing Nazis who did kill someone, No one cares. Maybe since clergymen and a UVA professor said that counter protesters saved their lives from white nationalists? Maybe because it was the white nationalists attacking police and armed to the teeth

       There was only about 500 of them. There are definitely at least 500 literal self-avowed neo-Nazis out there in this country. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some instigators there posing as neo-nazis, but please don't just assume it was all fake. There are people who really think like that, they're just an EXTREMELY small minority.

       The propaganda arm of the Democratic Party, i.e., the "liberal" corporate media, isn't covering their violence honestly. I guess the Democrats don't want to be associated with violence. Anywhere that does admit to violence from them seems to venerate it, as if it's everyone's American duty to punch their neighbor who advocated genocide merely by voting for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's manufactured like everything else the corporate media feeds us.  They're just trying to increase racial tensions. If half the 99% is fighting the other half, we can't team up against the ones actually oppressing us and fucking us all over.

       Antifa isn't an organization or group, per se. There are no headquarters or leaders, formal or informal. That's why the media has such a hard time fully understanding them. Anybody can claim to be antifa or not.

       The MSM never reports on the left, they've got to maintain their right slanting Overton window. If antifa stays in the headlines a bit longer I bet they'll get more attention, and they already have from the (large enough to be mainstream at this point) conservative media, but as long as media is corporately owned they are not going to report accurately or extensively on leftists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see some reporting on antifa, Democracy Now's had a number of segments on/with them. Biased, but up front about it, unlike every other media source.
