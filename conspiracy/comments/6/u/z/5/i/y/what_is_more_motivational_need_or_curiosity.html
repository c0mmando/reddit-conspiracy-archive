<ul>
<li>&quot;The natural human thirst and curiosity for knowledge and understanding of the universe around them.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Is what drives people towards a higher education, but isn&#39;t this dependent on which factor is technically more motivating? For me, nothing comes close to the motivation of basic needs. Humans barely get an education as it is, yet, we are supposed to believe if things get even easier for them, that not only will we have as wide and varied a range of careers and jobs as we do now, but even more? Pure socialist fantasy.</p>

<p>Socialism dictates that in a sea of white flamencos, the pink one must die. It trumpets the virtues of the (non existent) greater good, the single most dangerous ideology in the world, and in the history of our species. It is what has led to every war we&#39;ve ever had, every attempt to take over the world- all a result of utopian Marxist thinking.</p>

<p>You may think that the world is burning down around you, <strong>but it isn&#39;t</strong>. You may think you&#39;re a victim <strong>but you aren&#39;t</strong>. These are the things the media must have you believe. That you&#39;re a helpless, innocent victim, and socialism is the only thing that can save you.</p>

<p>This is even why the government conducts limited hangout operations with regard to conspiracy theories- to confuse you. To make you question every aspect of your reality until you don&#39;t know up, from down, and to piss you off at the capitalist (Marxist) system which oppresses you, so that you will &quot;rise up&quot; against it. <strong>It&#39;s all artificial: they want you to beg for socialism</strong>...</p>

<li>Of course not, but I would like you to list what they are.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Capitalism chewed up and spit out the common laborer back then.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>And we learned because of it. I&#39;m a blue collar worker, my job is very dangerous, but my employer has every single piece of safety equipment, and protocol in place to prevent injury. There&#39;s other way around it: <strong>if we want electricity, we need to have dangerous jobs.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Try reading about what work conditions were like for most people back then.&quot;</p>

<ul>

<p>&quot;It was a system that dramatically favored the privileged and fucked over the poor, while the majority of wealth created stayed in the hands of the select few.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Who the hell do you think works in the power plants? ME.</li>

<p>&quot;Are you trying to suggest that Capitalism is great because you have a dangerous job?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m suggesting that people who do dangerous jobs deserve more money for risky work. I&#39;m suggesting that class based society is a necessity. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Capitalism is pushing us to the brink of a war.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalism is merely an economic system- it doesn&#39;t think, get angry, call people names, wallow in greed, inflame racial tensions, dream of conquest, or do any of the other human qualities you ascribe to it. It is merely a collection of documents of laws and regulations. Not an evil system.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Marxism is what pushes us to the brink of war.</p>

<p><strong>A president who think&#39;s he is above the law, PUSHES US INTO WAR.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a nut shell....</p>

<p>Capitalism: an economic/political system in which goods &amp; services are primarily controlled by private individuals and corporations.</p>

<p>Socialism: an economic/political system in which goods &amp; services are controlled &amp; regulated by the community as a whole. </p>

<p>Communism is a whole different beast so I&#39;m not sure why you brought that up. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen countless versions of Capitalism throughout the years &amp; they have all met tragic deaths. We have never seen a true Socialist society. At least not any that I am aware of. </p>

<p>You are exactly right. Capitalism operates without emotion. Capitalism operates mainly on one goal and one goal only..... profit. I personally can&#39;t think of one corporation that puts the needs of the people ahead of the desire to make a profit..... can you? The owners of WalMart have more money than they could ever possibly need/spend while the majority of their employees can barely survive without some sort of federal assistance. </p>

<p>Capitalism creates a rift between rich and poor which almost always leads to revolutions. It&#39;s no different now than it was a few hundred years ago when the people in America decided that they didn&#39;t want to live under the control of Britain. </p>

<p>I would argue that Socialism rewards hard work far better than Capitalism ever could. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism&#39;s goal is to get to communism.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve seen countless versions of Capitalism throughout the years &amp; they have all met tragic deaths. We have never seen a true Socialist society. At least not any that I am aware of.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>We are naturally moving into a socialist system, and if we <em>don&#39;t</em> do anything drastic, we&#39;ll get to keep our Bill of Rights, and have socialism, all at once. That&#39;s why this is all coming up, now. Because time is running out for them to get rid of our protections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tell me this: Have the elite seen this coming? Have they been able to prepare for it?</p>

<p>&quot;You are exactly right. Capitalism operates without emotion.&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>All political systems operate without emotion- you&#39;re applying human qualities to a system because what you really should be blaming is the people <em>behind</em> the system who exploited it for their own self interest. As I&#39;ve already stated- if something works against the best interests of the continued practice of capitalism, literally undermining it, than it&#39;s not capitalism. It&#39;s like you&#39;re arguing that capitalism is a suicidal, self destructive system- that&#39;s impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>All systems core principal is their continued practice.</p>

<p>&quot;Capitalism operates mainly on one goal and one goal only..... profit&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t you know why this country was founded? Don&#39;t you know what those people who came here were trying to escape? Please learn about why America was founded in the first place. We make enormous mistakes by not learning from out history. Please learn about the history of the founding of this nation, and especially about the persecution they were trying to escape in Europe. This is why we have our Bill of Rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bill of Rights protects everybody. </p>

<p>See this:</p>

<p>&quot;Among the many offenses against liberty in pre-constitutional America, one pivotal event, the Stamp Act of 1765, stands out. To enforce the taxes imposed by the Act, the king’s men used “writs of assistance“ that allowed them to burst into any home or business, with or without suspicion of wrongdoing. American privacy was violated and property ransacked, often simply as a warning of the king’s power. Some colonist was then undoubtedly the first American to mutter, “But if I have nothing to hide, why should I be afraid?” He soon learned that when a population is categorically treated as a potential enemy, everyone has something to hide if the government claims they do.&quot;
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-van-buren/what-weve-lost-since-911_b_5497673.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-van-buren/what-weve-lost-since-911_b_5497673.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Please learn about our history. It&#39;s far worse than the paragraph above.</strong></p>

<p>If we lose our Bill of Rights- every man, women, child, and native that ever died in the making of this nation, died in vain.</p>

<p>&quot;I personally can&#39;t think of one corporation that puts the needs of the people ahead of the desire to make a profit..... can you?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>That&#39;s capitalism purpose- <strong>to make corporations accountable.</strong> Capitalism and capitalists are two different things. Capitalists work against capitalism. That&#39;s why you have to have a sufficient amount of regulations in place to insure they can&#39;t break the system, and we didn&#39;t have them, or they were gutted.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;The owners of WalMart have more money than they could ever possibly need/spend while the majority of their employees can barely survive without some sort of federal assistance.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Walmart couldn&#39;t possible be any more against capitalism. They undermine every chance they get, and they cost tax payers $6 billion dollars a year in welfare for their workers. They are not a capitalist institution- they are purely anti-capitalism. Furthermore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law">America&#39;s antitrust laws are not being adhered to</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Walmart is the most un-American company in our history- they have destroyed more American small businesses than any other.. They are literally a job killer. It&#39;s as if they&#39;re trying to work against us, and that&#39;s not capitalism, it&#39;s the opposite of capitalism. Capitalism DOES NOT MEAN PERVERSION OF THE CONCEPT. </p>

<p>With regard to the Constitution, and it&#39;s absolute importance: </p>

<p>&quot;the Constitution—the documentary embodiment of the Rule of Law replacing the Rule of Man (or Rule of the King, as practical matters had it in the 1780s)—would work only if it became an object of reverence in place of a monarch among the people.  As such, directly attacking the Constitution has always been a non-starter in American politics. Instead, liberals typically repair to the doctrine of the “living Constitution.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Thus it is helpful when a liberal’s impatience with constitutionalism yields to the impulse to rip the façade away and declare their contempt for the Constitution.  Georgetown Law School professor Louis Seidman thus does us the favor of candor with his New York Times op-ed today entitled “Let’s Give Up on the Constitution.”  The first paragraph is enough:</li>
</ul>

<p>AS the nation teeters at the edge of fiscal chaos, observers are reaching the conclusion that the American system of government is broken. But almost no one blames the culprit: our insistence on obedience to the Constitution, with all its archaic, idiosyncratic and downright evil provisions.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/12/a-liberal-comes-clean-we-hate-the-constitution.php">http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/12/a-liberal-comes-clean-we-hate-the-constitution.php</a></p>

<p>&quot;Capitalism creates a rift between rich and poor which almost always leads to revolutions. &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Marxism is the science of creating that rift.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s no different now than it was a few hundred years ago when the people in America decided that they didn&#39;t want to live under the control of Britain.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are the majority, WE run the world. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so imperative that the ruling class brainwashes us into doing their bidding, BECAUSE THERE&#39;S NO OTHER WAY TO CONTROL US.</p>

<p>This is why you think socialism is the answer.</p>

<p><strong>Trust me, it&#39;s much easier to tear up a piece of paper than it is to stage a socialist revolution.</strong></p>

<p>They&#39;re not even close.</p>

Seems all the arm chair economic quarterbacks love to say there&#39;s a problem but then offer no viable solution... Sound like any governmental agency or politican you know ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no solution without general consensus. General consensus is what forms outcomes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the general consensus <em>is</em> we have capitalism, right now, then we&#39;re fucked, and everyone has fallen for the Marxist conspiracy to destroy American sovereignty, and essentially institute world wide socialism under the Rothschild Dynasty.</p>

<p>Trump... Is the &#39;Last American President&#39;...</p>

In the societal sense, I believe Voluntaryism is the best solution, based on the non-aggression principle, and every interaction/contract is voluntary.

    <div class="md"><p>Vote with your dollar. Pretty simple. If x company is doing y, that you disagree with, reach out to the community, and boycott. They either change, or go out of business. Government helps keep them in business, though, by picking winners and losers. A Walmart, for example, could not nor would not be possible in the society that I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far too late and walmart already exists, so how do you get rid of them with capitalism? Small businesses can&#39;t break in if a walmart already exists there, and some small towns don&#39;t have any options <em>but</em> the local walmart so they can&#39;t boycott unless they&#39;re ready to do without(and most people don&#39;t have that kind of fortitude). </p>

<p>I do agree that the govt - corp link makes capitalism look worse than it is. </p>

<p>It sounds like your model assumes consumers would be informed activists. Normal people don&#39;t boycott or look for companies that represent their values, they get the cheapest thing or the closest thing or the thing with the label they know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal opinion is that we, as like minded individuals take over an uninhabited island, and create a new nation. That&#39;s basically all we could do at this point, imo.
