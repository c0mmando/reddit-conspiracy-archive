        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we are getting reports that ANTIFA and the Neo-Nazi/KKK members came on the same bus. But more than that, why was there no fucking police when the riots happened? The whole thing made national news and there was no fucking police? Are you fucking serious? </p>

<p>It is clear that the oligarchs- the higher ups- want to divide this nation on the lines of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; more, and obviously staged the protests at worst, or even if they did not stage them- the oligarchs looked at the opportunity, and sent their own &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;alt-left&quot; people to make the riots much worse. In fact in Boston, more than half the Neo-Nazis have been proven to be fake. And the media is pushing these lies to divide our country.</p>

<p>If you still can&#39;t see this, you are crazy or falling for the lies of the elite. Wake up. This is how our country gets taken away from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guaranteed controlled.  ANTIFA is entirely contrived, probably in one of the think-tanks we&#39;ve heard about for years. TPTB have no doubt studied exactly how the populace will react, and herd us like cattle toward whatever it is they want us to think.  Before a month or so ago, I&#39;d never even heard the word antifa, and now it&#39;s everywhere, used by the media to frighten people.  Brian Williams just admitted that that is his job, and it is.  Ultimately, the media wants to confuse and scare all of us into submission.</p>

<p>Where do you get your news? I&#39;m a news junkie. I watch 1+ hr per day and read 10-50 independent, left, and right news articles per day. Never ever have I heard this claim from the left or even center. No one on CNN, no one on Fox, no one on NPR news has ever made such ridiculous claim. I&#39;ve never ever heard them enforce violent protesters. </p>

<p>Google &quot;antifa are heroes&quot; and see what you find. <strong>You are so full of shit it&#39;s not even funny</strong>.</p>

<p>I think what you are trying to do is conflate the thousand of peaceful protesters in Boston with the handful of antifa thugs. Because that is something I have heard. It&#39;s what they&#39;re doing on right-wing talk radio right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just in Boston last week. Actually the last three months I&#39;ve been on a road trip across America. 31 states visited so far. I&#39;m a Hispanic guy with dreads and I have a white girlfriend. We walked all through the streets of Boston and interacted and talked with complete strangers. Some old, some young. Some white, black, Asian, whatever. My point is that reality is a lot different than what the mainstream media makes it seem. And not just in Boston, or Charlottesville, but everywhere in this country. In reality we are unified. Except on interstate highways.. and certain places in South Dakota.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to know what really pissed me off about this whole thing, it really made me think about what we consider as white. </p>

<p>My friend posted a picture on Facebook, the kind where it&#39;s split into fourths, one said black pride, had someone doing a tribal dance, Latino pride had a Spanish lady dancing, Asian pride had the Chinese new year, white pride had a bunch of nazi/white supremacist shit. </p>

<p>I quickly posted a reply in gif format, both Oktoberfest and St. Patrick&#39;s. </p>

<p>Then I proceeded to tell them that they were completely off base, the fact is, we all came from somewhere else, white, black, Asian, Latino, we all came from a home country. </p>

<p>Germany, Ireland, Scotland, Greenland, France, Russia, Australia, Austria, Norway, all of these people are majority white, and the majority of white Americans celebrate this cultural heritage... Why is it OK to group all of these nations into white people, yet when you say Latino, people generally make a face and point out the difference between Nicaraguan and Mexican?</p>

<p>I posit that this whole fucking illusion of a tribal divide is what is truly an impasse to peace and progress. </p>

<p>We need to start looking at ourselves as an individual of a species rather than a representative of a tribal group. </p>

<p>The real problems we face are class struggles. The wealthy bribe politicians to ensure the government works for rich people while fucking over poor people. Then, on top of that, they use wedge issues like race to break up the working class into groups to fight among ourselves. Because if I&#39;m fistfighting my racist neighbor for voting Trump, I don&#39;t have time to notice that I have no democratic representation from either major political party. If I&#39;m worried about a handful of assholes in Charlottesville, I won&#39;t notice that it&#39;s actually the billionaires and corporations fucking me over and oppressing literally everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tribal divide you described keeps things like St Patty&#39;s and Oktoberfest going - and keeps them out of the Klan. It&#39;s when someone told the Irish and the Germans they had a common non-white and non-christian enemy that they dropped their divisions to fight the hordes that would change them. Ironically enough.</p>

<p>Hell, the Germans and Irish were the first to riot in my town. They both were hunted by the Klan. Civil strife is normal. Solidified marching for hate is not.</p>

<p>Apply this to other groups as you see fit. Antifa can certainly be said to have been brought together under a phony cause as well.</p>

<p><strong>But stop acting like these groups are not real - both are terrorists</strong></p>

As if your racist neighbor who voted for Trump actually represents or has any power over the systems of control that subjugate us all. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re perfect little wage slaves, so desperate for work that they&#39;d assault their fellow proles because a billionaire piece of shit paid them to.

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of argument, I&#39;ll assume both groups are under complete control by outside parties. We have the two opposite ends of the spectrum fighting each other and, at least seemingly so, more people breaking rank with their more moderate counterparts to side with one end or the other.
Does anyone else see the opportunity here? If this divide deepens (it will, at least for a time,) what is preventing those of us who are able to see the big picture from at least attempting to guide the ship in the right direction?
It&#39;s the wrong &quot;us vs. them&quot; right now. That&#39;s plain to see and obvious it is in some capacity fabricated. The left is rabidly trying to stamp out who they see as fascists and their numbers are vastly superior to the other side.
I&#39;d also argue that this increase in support for antifa is a good thing. Why? The typically passive and unwilling centrists and moderate leftists are finally getting in the game, even if it&#39;s at the wrong field. Their sudden shift from &quot;peace and love&quot; to &quot;kill fascism&quot; is a terrific opportunity to tweak that narrative and that agenda towards the common goals of the people.
So, we&#39;re aware of the potential players in this. Why aren&#39;t we one of them? Why can&#39;t we play the game too, only by our rules, to shift and solidify that stronger movement?</p>
