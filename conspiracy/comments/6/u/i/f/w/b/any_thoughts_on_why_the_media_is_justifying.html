<p>Really, and how do you prove that? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nope, you have to let these ideologies speak. Give them enough rope to hang themselves and they will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically speaking, what happens when you give them rope is they hang ethnic minorities, homosexuals, transgender people, and their political opponents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you quash them then you are no better than they are. Don&#39;t stoop to their level. Let them burn out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way to stoop to their level is to endorse ethnic cleansing and a totalitarian ethnostate. Throwing a punch doesn&#39;t make you as bad as a Nazi, I don&#39;t know how anyone can believe that unless they literally think everything else about the Nazis is fine and okay.</p>

<p>Okay, so when the cops can&#39;t or wont protect you, what do you do? Whine on the internet? </p>

<p>What if they&#39;re threatening you and other people in your life with violence, and the cops are silent? Do you let them come to your house and point a gun at you? Do you let them shoot you? These people do a lot more than march. They bomb churches, they murder POC and transgender people, they infiltrate police departments <em>so they can murder POC</em>, they most recently ram cars into crowds of protestors.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#39;t really antifa leaders of any kind, since most of them are anarchists and oppose hierarchy. Usually small crews meet up and decide on rules of engagement beforehand. They&#39;re typically aware that optics are important and do their best to not beat up on complete randos, rather target known, obvious fascists. Seriously, think hard for a moment about the incentives they have to operate within. They <em>know</em> that their ability to do this and not have a whole mob after them hinges on choosing targets carefully. They aren&#39;t the idiots you think they are, they <em>are</em> aware of the narrow line they have to walk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The response to fascism isn&#39;t lawless violence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have no response to fascism except to pretend it&#39;s not an issue and happily assume it&#39;ll just die on its own if we all ignore them. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all you have to offer, period. In other words: exactly nothing except self-comforting words that give you no reason to get out of your desk chair ever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this is that it would be a shame if 200 years of democracy was allowed to be brought down simply to defeat a small neo Nazi party... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know what you meant, but then you also implied that 200 years of democracy can be brought down simply to defeat antifa. It&#39;s a contradiction, you&#39;re demonstrating cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>That shit is a hilariously mythological concern. The comedy is complete in that you&#39;ve deemed some idea of &quot;nazis&quot; in the populace as more concerning than the government Actually Acting Like Nazis.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason antifa isn&#39;t trying to endorse government action against Nazis and instead going with direct action. They know that those laws always come back around to crush the left. </p>

<p>If anyone is going to get squashed in response to antifa violence against Neo-Nazis, it will be antifa themselves, not the Nazis. This has been the pattern all throughout US history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t disagree, but we need to be real, real wary about legitimizing <em>any</em> political violence.  The decent people of the world will always have moral and ethical guardrails these neo-Nazi, white power fascists  fucks don&#39;t.  You punch one in the face, they&#39;ll run people down with their cars.  You beat one with a stick, they&#39;ll burn down a crowded church.  These groups are sprinkled with legit terrorists, and if they sense political violence is okay they will escalate.</p>

<p>The Republic is in grave danger when political violence becomes routine -- look to the fall of the Roman Republic, when politics becomes a blood sport, victory will just go to the most powerful strongman.  And it doesn&#39;t matter what flag that person waves or how they label themselves, rule by strongman always leads to the same place.</p>

About 250 people is the most they could get but sure we can act like there&#39;s an epidemic.</p>

<p>The black hebrew israelites preach that white man shouldn&#39;t exist and are called a black supremacist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. They preach their hate in the middle of Times Square all the time why people sit by and don&#39;t do shit. There&#39;s also more than 1,000% more of them in the US then there is KKK members or neo-nazis. 1,000% isn&#39;t an exaggeration. SPLC estimates there is 200k

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ll link you to some documents that can explain the history of antifa.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, antifa began in Nazi germany right before the nazis came to power. They were formed by militant communists trying to fight back against the brown shirts.</p>

<p>Their basic ideology is- &quot;fascists don&#39;t play by the rules, and every single time fascists come to power, thousands or millions of people die, therefor, anti-fascism will have no boundaries.&quot;</p>

<p>They use the moral repugnance of fascism to justify using violence to &quot;nip it in the bud.&quot;</p>

<p>There is overlap with left leaning ideologies and groups, but they are NOT advocating for any political ideas, and are NOT interested in policy debates. Their entire goal is just &quot;to prevent the rise of fascism by any means necessary.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa doesn&#39;t have goals beyond dispersing and discouraging Fascists when they rally in public. </p>

<p>They have no political platform of their own, laws they want to pass, people they want to elect, none of that. They come together to disperse Fascists then disperse themselves when the Fascists are gone. </p>

<p>They&#39;re a temporary coalition in response to specific circumstances. This in contrast to the Nazis/KKK/Fascists, who have long-term political goals and aspirations for power.</p>

<p>Antifa&#39;s made up of many anarchists and communists who have their own projects...and usually argue amongst themselves when there aren&#39;t fascists to oppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my whole point about the recent events. Yeah, condemn ALL Nazis and the alt-right. Fight back against their racist, bigoted asses. BUT, racism and bigotry is a form of hatred. An act of violence is ALSO an act of hatred. I&#39;ve seen such an uproar on that guy killing someone and injurying tons of people in Charlotssvile. BUT, I&#39;ve seen NONE condemn the violence against the right. There was a video on twitter about a supporter of the Right Wing as he was about to give a statement and he was literally attacked by hundreds of people, chased, punched, thrown in the streets. So violence against the left is frowned upon, but violence against the right is cheered? What kind of mentality is that? Who decided where violence is accepted? Violence is violence and should be condemn in each occasion, regardless of race, political party e.t.c </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because who in their right mind defends an actual Nazi?</p>

<p>This is a whole &#39;nother level of divide and conquer. The actual problem isn&#39;t that &quot;well, not ALL nazis are bad&quot;, the problem is who gets called a nazi.</p>

<p>That guy with the swastika tattoos, that reads Mein Kampf every night before bed, who beats up people he thinks are unworthy to live in his country? Who&#39;s a suspect in the recent fire at the local synagogue? Total nazi, right?</p>

<p>But what if i used the same label on people i dont like? Milo Yianopolois, Ben shipiro, the MRA&#39;s and so on.</p>

<p>The justification of violence against Nazis by the media isn&#39;t done because &quot;wow, society doesn&#39;t know who the bad guys are?&quot;. but rather to stomp out &quot;wrong think&quot;. Nobody in their right mind will actively defend their beliefs except maybe other nazis (though, i do think everyone should be able to believe what they want to believe, regardless of the insanity. An idea/belief can have problems, and they should be talked/argued about. Doubt you can punch an idea out of someone) but who would defend someone &quot;the media&quot; calls a nazi?  That person is obviously a nazi, right? Fuck that guy/gal!!!</p>

<p>Everyone knows Nazis are bad, the problem is who actually is a real nazi and who&#39;s just getting a big target on their back because someone labels them a nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get clicks talking about an idea from both sides. I tie same idea to a larger figure and get more clicks, I tie them again to protests I get more clicks, I tie the same idea to statues and get more clicks and then retie the same people and ideas back to previously stated hated large figure and get more clicks.</p>

<p>They remove the statues. More clicks. They march, more clicks. Big figure is removed more clicks, they run out of statues and go after street names more clicks, they run out of streets and move towards the buildings more clicks, they run out of animate objects and pick a sib group to also dismantle more clicks.</p>

<p>And if one of those moves brings heat to their world. They claim bad source, print a retraction (traction for you Stern nerds) and bury it next to the Dead people killed by this violence in the back of the paper.</p>

<p>Its a business.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying just because 20k fans showed up for a concert that there isn&#39;t more fans.</p>

<p>How many racist do you think are going to actually put effort in demostrating their racism. This is the age of vicariously living through others </p>
