       Somewhere in between I'd estimate. For reference, the Nazi party in Germany took only 12 years from formation to taking to power.

         Nope, but they won't because their ideology is garbage and always has been. The Nazi party gained momentum partially due to the communist resistant by the Weimar Republic. Using violence against them only legitimizes their cause.

       Historically speaking, what happens when you give them rope is they hang ethnic minorities, homosexuals, transgender people, and their political opponents.

       The only way to stoop to their level is to endorse ethnic cleansing and a totalitarian ethnostate. Throwing a punch doesn't make you as bad as a Nazi, I don't know how anyone can believe that unless they literally think everything else about the Nazis is fine and okay.

       There aren't really antifa leaders of any kind, since most of them are anarchists and oppose hierarchy. Usually small crews meet up and decide on rules of engagement beforehand. They're typically aware that optics are important and do their best to not beat up on complete randos, rather target known, obvious fascists. Seriously, think hard for a moment about the incentives they have to operate within. They
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that their ability to do this and not have a whole mob after them hinges on choosing targets carefully. They aren't the idiots you think they are, they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       aware of the narrow line they have to walk.

       You have no response to fascism except to pretend it's not an issue and happily assume it'll just die on its own if we all ignore them. That's it. That's all you have to offer, period. In other words: exactly nothing except self-comforting words that give you no reason to get out of your desk chair ever.

       I know what you meant, but then you also implied that 200 years of democracy can be brought down simply to defeat antifa. It's a contradiction, you're demonstrating cognitive dissonance.

       There's a reason antifa isn't trying to endorse government action against Nazis and instead going with direct action. They know that those laws always come back around to crush the left.

       Don't disagree, but we need to be real, real wary about legitimizing
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       political violence.  The decent people of the world will always have moral and ethical guardrails these neo-Nazi, white power fascists  fucks don't.  You punch one in the face, they'll run people down with their cars.  You beat one with a stick, they'll burn down a crowded church.  These groups are sprinkled with legit terrorists, and if they sense political violence is okay they will escalate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republic is in grave danger when political violence becomes routine -- look to the fall of the Roman Republic, when politics becomes a blood sport, victory will just go to the most powerful strongman.  And it doesn't matter what flag that person waves or how they label themselves, rule by strongman always leads to the same place.

       It's funny that people are actually buying into the Nazi craze and calling violence towards neo-nazis. Do I agree with a neo-nazi? Nope. But 250 people showed up from Canada and the US and this was their biggest showing that took months to plan. About 250 people is the most they could get but sure we can act like there's an epidemic.
      </p>

       The black hebrew israelites preach that white man shouldn't exist and are called a black supremacist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. They preach their hate in the middle of Times Square all the time why people sit by and don't do shit. There's also more than 1,000% more of them in the US then there is KKK members or neo-nazis. 1,000% isn't an exaggeration. SPLC estimates there is 200k

       I disagree.  I think what turned white opinion wasn't fear of black militancy, it was seeing nonviolent protesters sicked with dogs and sprayed with firehoses, and kids pelted with rocks and garbage for trying to go to school.

       You can save your morally justifiable bullshit. Nobody is calling for violence towards the Black Hebrew Israelites who are labeled a black supremacist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. There's 200k members in the US. They stand in NYC and tell white people they should no longer exist:

       No there's nothing to "convince" someone of. A black supremacist is someone who believes the black race is above all other races. There's 200,000 people who hold views similar to that. There are many less caucasian people who can be proven to be in the same categoey.

       you shouldn't let politics get to you like this, my dude. you definitely seem a little hot under the collar here.

       read my post again. i wasn't saying antifa is right in their actions, i'm saying that the narrative that they are the same or worse as literal nazis is an obvious false equivalency.

       i don't support antifa, personally. i think violence is not productive at this stage.

       I'm not even slightly "under the collar". I could care less about politics when it's a social and behavioral issue. I have conservative values, hang with a bunch of friends who consider themselves Democrats and have a Mexican girlfriend so I don't exactly subscribe to some bullshit political side.

       You absolutely said that antifa is trying to defend our country against fascism which is standing up for them. You didn't just say "I'd pick antifa over Nazis". Antifa showed up to a white supremacist rally where people were spewing hate. The other 95% of the time they aren't defending our country or committing acts of violence against "nazis"
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone does something wrong 95% of the time I wouldn't really say they are defending America in any way, shape or form.

       While I'm pretty clear on the KKK, white supremacists, etc, I have some pretty basic questions concerning antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does antifa have an endgame in mind?  Do they stand for anything aside from intolerance toward the intolerant?  How is antifa helping by utilizing violence against Trump supporters?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the outside, it looks like a group of idealogues widening the crack in America's purposefully divided political system; that they're the flip-side to the nazis they're against and that both groups will feed off each other to the detriment to the nation finding common ground.  Does that seem like a fair representation of them?  If not, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there resources that someone could link me to better educate myself on the group?

       Yes, I'll link you to some documents that can explain the history of antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, antifa began in Nazi germany right before the nazis came to power. They were formed by militant communists trying to fight back against the brown shirts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their basic ideology is- "fascists don't play by the rules, and every single time fascists come to power, thousands or millions of people die, therefor, anti-fascism will have no boundaries."
      </p>
      <p>
       They use the moral repugnance of fascism to justify using violence to "nip it in the bud."
      </p>
      <p>
       There is overlap with left leaning ideologies and groups, but they are NOT advocating for any political ideas, and are NOT interested in policy debates. Their entire goal is just "to prevent the rise of fascism by any means necessary."

       Antifa doesn't have goals beyond dispersing and discouraging Fascists when they rally in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have no political platform of their own, laws they want to pass, people they want to elect, none of that. They come together to disperse Fascists then disperse themselves when the Fascists are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're a temporary coalition in response to specific circumstances. This in contrast to the Nazis/KKK/Fascists, who have long-term political goals and aspirations for power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa's made up of many anarchists and communists who have their own projects...and usually argue amongst themselves when there aren't fascists to oppose.

       This is my whole point about the recent events. Yeah, condemn ALL Nazis and the alt-right. Fight back against their racist, bigoted asses. BUT, racism and bigotry is a form of hatred. An act of violence is ALSO an act of hatred. I've seen such an uproar on that guy killing someone and injurying tons of people in Charlotssvile. BUT, I've seen NONE condemn the violence against the right. There was a video on twitter about a supporter of the Right Wing as he was about to give a statement and he was literally attacked by hundreds of people, chased, punched, thrown in the streets. So violence against the left is frowned upon, but violence against the right is cheered? What kind of mentality is that? Who decided where violence is accepted? Violence is violence and should be condemn in each occasion, regardless of race, political party e.t.c

       Don't fall for their narrative. Ugh, sometimes I'm so thankful to live in a small, pretty unknown country. I used to be sort of obsessed with the US and wanted to move there growing up. I sure as hell don't anymore. Sounds like the country is fucked up in all aspects.

       Because who in their right mind defends an actual Nazi?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a whole 'nother level of divide and conquer. The actual problem isn't that "well, not ALL nazis are bad", the problem is who gets called a nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy with the swastika tattoos, that reads Mein Kampf every night before bed, who beats up people he thinks are unworthy to live in his country? Who's a suspect in the recent fire at the local synagogue? Total nazi, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if i used the same label on people i dont like? Milo Yianopolois, Ben shipiro, the MRA's and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The justification of violence against Nazis by the media isn't done because "wow, society doesn't know who the bad guys are?". but rather to stomp out "wrong think". Nobody in their right mind will actively defend their beliefs except maybe other nazis (though, i do think everyone should be able to believe what they want to believe, regardless of the insanity. An idea/belief can have problems, and they should be talked/argued about. Doubt you can punch an idea out of someone) but who would defend someone "the media" calls a nazi?  That person is obviously a nazi, right? Fuck that guy/gal!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows Nazis are bad, the problem is who actually is a real nazi and who's just getting a big target on their back because someone labels them a nazi.

       I get clicks talking about an idea from both sides. I tie same idea to a larger figure and get more clicks, I tie them again to protests I get more clicks, I tie the same idea to statues and get more clicks and then retie the same people and ideas back to previously stated hated large figure and get more clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They remove the statues. More clicks. They march, more clicks. Big figure is removed more clicks, they run out of statues and go after street names more clicks, they run out of streets and move towards the buildings more clicks, they run out of animate objects and pick a sib group to also dismantle more clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if one of those moves brings heat to their world. They claim bad source, print a retraction (traction for you Stern nerds) and bury it next to the Dead people killed by this violence in the back of the paper.
