         “condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter. CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.”

         Very important e-mail in that it demonstrates Hillary's poor judgement (her idea) in the face of influence money and foreshadows how a Clinton Administration would be indebted to bad actors and criminal regimes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "same issues we discussed" mentioned by Robbie Mook in this email is a veiled reference to Morocco's many human rights abuses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Her campaign staff is rightly concerned about the optics of the Clinton Foundation/Clinton Global Initiative accepting huge sums of money from a regime that so frequently violates international law and acts in a way that you'd expect the Clinton Foundation to publicly rebuke.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It seems $12 million is just too much money to allow morals, ethics, and the best interests and values of American citizens to intervene.

       So since we've been selling them weapons for a long time there's no possible way any of those weapon deals ovolved bribery, especially with HRC. Nothing to see here, move along.

       You are right, we sold them weapons long before the Clinton Foundation was started and Hillary was SOS and we continue after she left the government. It was all done because of a donation.

       Do you believe in the possibility that they are two unrelated issues? Are you able to prove that the donation to the foundation was for something they said that they were going to do in Morroco but that hasn't been completed?

       I know just because you hate her is not proof of any wrongdoing. Just to let you know, I did not vote for her nor have I ever said that she should be president except in relationship to trump being elected.

       Where did I ever say that? Not even sure what the two have in common. Like I've asked before and no one has responded with an answer; if we were selling them weapons during the Bush administration and continue through the Obama admin and are still selling them weapons why would he need to bribe her or anybody else? Did we change the type or amount of weapons we are selling them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind the supreme court ruling on political corruption. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court, narrowed the definition of what sort of conduct can serve as the basis of a corruption prosecution. He said only formal and concrete government actions counted — filing a lawsuit, say, or making an administrative determination. Routine political courtesies like arranging meetings or urging underlings to consider a matter, he added, generally do not, even when the people seeking those favors give the public officials gifts or money.

       We're not talking about you,a voting American.We're talking about the foriegn countries who gave money to Hillary in "donations"(i.e.money for later favors) and paid her speaking fees(funny how the speaking engagements and donations dried up after she lost)because it is illegal for foreign countries to donate money to U.S. political campaigns,obviously.

       Until after the foundation releases whatever records they are required to release how are we to know that donations have dried up? Do you have a list of major presidential candidates speaking fees and engagement from before and after they lost the election to compare? I know it's impossible to think that someone would want to relax after going through the primary and general election.

       From your article:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's illegal for foreign individuals, corporations and governments to either give money directly to U.S. candidates or spend on advertising to influence U.S. elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's also illegal for candidates to solicit foreign money, regardless of whether the donations ever materialize.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is now vast documentary evidence that the Trump campaign is continuing to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob Blackman, a member of the U.K. House of Commons, shared with The Hill a fundraising solicitation sent to his government email address from the Trump campaign on July 12.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I did not sign up, these are sent unsolicited," Blackman told The Hill in an email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another member of the U.K. Parliament, Peter Bottomley, said he'd received three solicitations from the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Neither [Trump's] sons nor anyone else has answered my questions about how they acquired my email nor why they were asking for financial support that I suppose to be illegal for [Trump] to accept," Bottomley told The Hill in an email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance watchdog Democracy 21, said he's never in his four-decade career seen a campaign continue to brazenly solicit foreign cash after being publicly called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is kind of absurd. I don't know of anyone else in this situation who would just go on keeping on soliciting money from foreign interests," he said. "I think the fact circumstances here are unprecedented.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If they are put on notice that their fundraising solicitations of potential foreign donors are illegal and they keep doing it, then you potentially have knowing and willful violations of the law, which moves this from civil violations to criminal violations," Wertheimer continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wertheimer said he's going to assess the latest facts and may launch a criminal complaint in addition to his standing FEC complaint.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's open and shut that federal candidates can't solicit contributions from foreign donors," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's an open and shut that federal candidates can't solicit contributions from foreign donors."
      </p>
      <p>
       .."it's also illegal for candidates to solicit money whether or not the donations materialize"(paraphrasing)
      </p>
      <p>
       Did any action against Trump take place for this blatant and obvious solicitation happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.Desipte numerous reports,no action against him took place.Why?This was before he was president.He had no ability to use influence to protect him against legal action against him.And with all the shit thrown at him post-election,you'd think tnat would have been used against him.But,nope!Nothing happened.He is a very business smart man.Don't you think that maybe this is more post Smith-Mundt repeal horeshit?

       Now please explain why when foreign and domestic individuals, corporations, and organizations hold events, stay at, or buy a property from trump and his organization they are not doing it to gain influence with him?

       I'd like to make something clear.Im not a fan of any president except JFK(and I applaud Eisenhower for his farewell speech).I am not for Trump in any way.I just dont like when anyone is unfairly smeared.Smear him for the correct reasons.The fact that he won't audit the fed.The fact that he and every other president in recent history use the same group of people in U.S. finance.The fact that he allowed our internet info to be sold,etc.

       How recent was said bankruptcy?I remember hearing about that 20-25 years ago.

       Of course money matters to a businessman.But my point is that the chump change that these certain people may bring in in comparison to the other things that make his wealth didn't enough to influence.It would take Hillary sized bribes to do that I would imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And,once again,I'm not a Trump fan.I just don't like unfair criticisms/smear campaigns.Nail him on actual shitty things that is proven that he did.Not horseshit conjecture.

       We sold them to other countries before so why were they off limits to Morocco but not to the UAE? I'm sure I could find many other countries that we have sold them too.

       Trump might not have been an elected official but to say he wasn't in politics would be a very narrow view. You seem to think that only elected officials have anything to do with politics and my views is narrow and I'm unable to think for myself and the only views I have is what others (TPTB) tells me they are.

       I know it's impossible for someone to make money quickly in futures trading. Not that 10 months is quick. Remember the story was 1st mentioned in 'the fake' NYT
      </p>
      <p>
       Little experts from the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton opened a trading account, although Blair made most of the trades
      </p>
      <p>
       The editor of the Journal of Futures Markets said in April 1994, "This is like buying ice skates one day and entering the Olympics a day later. She took some extraordinary risks."
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's defenders also stressed that Blair and others stayed in the market longer than Clinton and lost much of what they had previously earned, showing that the risk was real.[3] Indeed, some reports had Blair losing $15 million[22] and Bone was reported as bankrupt.[7]

       1st it was to the Clinton Foundation, not the Clinton’s themselves. 2nd, unless they published all the conversations between the Clinton Foundation and the Kingdom of Morocco I'm unable to state the reason. I can guess what you believe because of your hatred of the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you able to provide a specific reason for the donation that proves that it was illegal? They are our allie and have been for a while, we've sold them military equipment including F-16 aircraft. That sell started under the bush administration.

       So let me get this straight.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are claiming that the $12,000,000 Morocco gave to the Clintons didn't go to them personally but to the foundation that they started, control and employed their daughter and pay for her wedding, among other things.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're claiming that the money was spent to do ________ (something legitimate).  BUT you can't say what.  Where did the $12,000,000 go? For what charitable purpose? It's all public record so lmk.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You also claim that oh no there is no "pay to play" possible even though Hillary was Sec. of State and miraculously the Govt. approved advanced weapons sales months after this ridiculously enormous donation took place?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Maybe you could support your defense of Hillary, Bill, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative with some facts no just that I hate them, which is really irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why don't you give me a specific instance where the Government of Morocco has given $12,000,000 or more to a
       <em>
        private
       </em>
       US based charity or foundation. Ever.  I can't find any record of that but maybe you can.

       I don't care what you think about Trump. this topic is about Hillary and the Clinton Foundation. Prove to me the $12,000,000 wasn't used to bribe the state department to approve the weapons sale.

       No, their bi-partisan controlled just like they are bi-partisan guilty of literal treason that no one ever brings up when talking about the Podesta Leak because it isnt as easy to digest as Morocco and takes a little more time and patience to explain. Its so maddening. How the hell it isnt like the only thing in the news (because people should want it in the news) is baffling. Even T_D misses it entirely and I dont know how, they are probably at least 50% armed services or family of armed services. There was one email in the Podesta Leak that actually mattered because that one email could have changed it all. Maybe Assange is a CIA asset.

        Uranium One
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 2009 to 2013, the Russian atomic energy agency (Rosatom) acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20% of the uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with national security implications, the acquisition was analyzed by a committee of nine government agencies, including the State Department, which was then headed by Clinton. The voting members of the committee can object to such a foreign transaction, but the final decision then rests with the president.[18]
       </p>
       <p>
        In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a prior agreement to do so. In addition, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and which was promoting Uranium One stock paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow shortly after the acquisition was announced. According to Factcheck.org, there is "no evidence" that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions or that she was involved in the State Department's decision to approve the deal.
       </p>

       As you quoted, the State Department was only one of the agencies involved in the sale. However, Hillary was not actually involved in the sale and another State Department employee, Jose Fernandez, handled it. Internal documents, and interviews, show that Hillary did not have any input or decision-making power in the deal. Additionally, uranium cannot be exported outside of the US per US law. This means that a Russian company just makes money off of mining and selling the uranium.

       You really should just stfu about U1 if you actually have a problem with it. There are far easier to understand and far more damning stories that would hurt the people perpetrating U1.

       That is incredibly misleading.  Saudi Arabia donated $100 million dollars to the World Bank Fund for Women Entrepreneurs.  Ivanka Trump came up with the idea for the World Bank to make this fund,
       <strong>
        BUT
       </strong>
       it is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       her fund, it is the World Bank's fund.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The money will help kick off a $1 billion women's empowerment fund that the World Bank will announce in July, he said.
The World Bank fund, which provides technical help and investment funding for women business owners, differs from the Clinton Foundation in some significant ways. While Ivanka Trump proposed the idea along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, she is not involved with its operation.
Norm Eisen, former ethics official for the Obama Administration and a regular critic of the Trump family's conflicts of interest, noted in an email to NPR, "In my view foreign government donations to a fund run by a reputable international organization like the World Bank for a good cause are generally acceptable."

       I doubt any one has direct evidence of anything. But there are a lot of weird things they do that seem to protect the DS. Like when James Clapper announced his retirement back on November 17 of last year NPR talked about his career history. Im sure you can guess what part of his career was not broadcast despite being arguably the single largest event in his career...

       False I care. Examples need to be made. Clinton's are the sole example of what's wrong with American politics. She is the reason trump got elected. So take your Bullshit somewhere else. Unlike you I want too see justice. She is a cunt devil and her horns need to be sawed off. So stop being a bitch.

No, instead I looked into the content of the actual post, because I'm not an idealogue and ideas don't get their merit from where they lie on partisan boundaries.

       They aren't if there's no chance the court will ever see the case.  Just like those two psychologists doing the CIA torture that just got off scott free by giving away out tax payer money to the victims.  Hillary isn't the kind of person you punish in a court of law.  It's fun to pretend nobody is above the law, but that has never be the actual reality in this country.  If you want her to see justice you need to have the balls to break out the polonium.

       Have any proof for this claims? Because the underage rape allegations were exposed as slander scheme by a former Jerry Springer producer, and there's zero proof he ever flew on Epsteins jet or visited his island. WJC on the other hand...

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1.Trump himself has said that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with,” adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women “on the younger side.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Trump was named in Epstein’s “little black book.”
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Epstein’s “little black book” was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed "The Holy Grail" by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed “14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman.”

       He was in his fifties when he said that so of course women in their 20s and 30s are much younger to him. You're really reaching if you think he was admitting to the media that he admired someone for their affinity for underage women.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost as if you can have acquaintances or friends and not be knowledgeable of their crimes/secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black book section isn't even worth commenting on. Trump never denied knowing Epstein so it stands that he would have his contact information.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still didn't put Trump on the Island or anywhere near any of his underage sex parties. Your threshold for evidence seems to be extremely low.

       People hang out with their friends all the time. It still doesn't mean they're knowledgeable/complicit in their crimes. Like I said, your threshold for evidence is extremely low. Meanwhile we know that underage girls were literally used as sex toys on his private jet and island, and there's hard evidence that a former president flew on that jet several times to that exact island, ditching secret service along the way. What you're doing seems more like poor misdirection.

       Still no proof of your points, dude. Also a fake lawsuit naming both of the is just a plot to associate the two. It takes literally nothing but the accusation. It's not like it's the case that got Epstein convicted. It's literally nothing.

       I can see you're trying to bait me into insults or something to get me banned, but you haven't made one solid point backed by evidence, most of which is pure conjecture. I mean it's a super poor attempt at misdirection -- in a post that's has nothing to do with Trump.

       Nope. But I can put Epstein and at least one of the girls he recruited and exploited at

       Again, it's no secret that they were friends. Epstein being at a club of Trumps and bringing a guest Also after Epstein was exposed Trump banned him from their and dropped all contact. Meanwhile who was at Chelsea Clintons wedding? Just the procurer of the girls Epstein used, Ghislaine Maxwell. Like I said, you're doing poor misdirection.

       Are we supposed to be convinced of Trump's innocence because he cut off contact with a guy that was convicted of being a pedophile that threw parties for people like Trump??? LMAO do you seriously expect him to publicly rally to his side? (Eh, nowadays with Trump, you never actually know)

       You're still making claims like "he threw parties for Trump etc" with no source/evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your argument is that since he knew him he's guilty, although other with stronger ties, who can be put on the island, who never cut off Epstein are not to be mentioned. Got it. There's no talking to idiots. You have literally nothing except pointless conjecture. You can put Trump to any sex party and 90% of your evidence is trying to frame past interview answers in a negative fashion.

       Thanks for bringing that point up! So does Trump!

       Turns out, he nominated one of the prosecutors who ended up giving Epstein a slap on the wrist and sent him to jail for the bullshit reduction of "soliciting a minor" and 1 year in jail with time served a cushy job as Labor secretary.
      </p>

       Trump's 15+ year old pal Epstein didn't do any real time thanks to this guy and you know gow Trump rewarded him? By giving him a job when he became president!

       You haven't done anything except make poor loosely tied connections about Trump in a post that isn't about him. Furthermore every time I bring up someone/something that has legitimate ties to Epstein, can be put on his jet/island, was actually involved in a case where a pedophile was sentence all you have to say is "but Trump" or "so did Trump" even though it makes zero sense. Not a Trump fanboy because I can see through your partisan garbage in a post that has nothing to do with Trump. Go back to politically astroturfing

       YOU just don't want me to talk about Trump. That's why you want me to shut up about it. It literally does NOTHING prejudicial to bring up Trump in a conversation about pedophiles and Epstein. It's entirely relevant.

       Trump won't allow her to go down.  Why do you think he never took even the
       <em>
        first

       step to "lock her up"?  Is it because there's literally zero evidence of wrongdoing on her part, or is Trump protecting her?  It's got to be one of the two.

       Ive thought about it. Youre right. Sometimes I forget that Trump was a heel in the WWE and Linda McMahon is literally in the administration. This is theater to convince people to embrace fascism. Thats where Im at in my speculative analysis.

       False I care. Examples need to be made. Clinton's are the sole example of what's wrong with American politics. She is the reason trump got elected. So take your Bullshit somewhere else. Unlike you I want too see justice. She is a cunt devil and her horns need to be sawed off. So stop being a bitch.
