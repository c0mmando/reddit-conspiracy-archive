<p>They are all in unison calling for Trump to be removed, because ______ fill in the blank.  </p>

<p>&quot;Hes racist and no one likes him.&quot; 
His team is even abandoning him! </p>

<p>This outcry is totally natural, and everyone at the same time all pushing for the overthrow is just a coincidence.  Totally natural.  Nothing to do with media bias and social media heads being brainwashed. </p>

<p>What if the anti-american trash gets their way?  Do they think lollipops and gum drops will be handed out and parties will ensue?!   Will YOU and your family be okay and better off after the great American coup?  Be safe, look out for each other, and make sure your head is on right.  Anyone rooting for America to be turned upside down is anti-american.  Plan and simple.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  The Federal Reserve, and the unconstitutional and treasonous Coinage Act of 1965.  </p>

<p>Think of it this way.  If I have to work more to pay down this debt, then I have less time for life, liberty, and the pursuit of pleasure.  </p>

<p>Either way, I think we both agree that this needs to change.  A family of four in the 50&#39;s could live very comfortably on a single income.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be correct in your assumption.  I concur whole-heartily.  Usury debt systems like the Federal Reserve are an infringement of the citizenry&#39;s rights in addition to sullying our coinage and treasury.  Woodrow Wilson (Big time Democrat &amp; KKK) sold this country out to the big banks over a century ago and we just keep letting it bury us further and further into servitude.  So yes, I fundamentally agree with you.  More citizens should be aware of this easily obtainable history and discuss it civilly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between my awareness of what we have discussed and revelations made to us in my lifetime, my worldly personal experience, and every experience in between... this is what drove me to re-seek my religion.  I&#39;m not sure if the wikileaks emails exposing the elite&#39;s spiritual involvement or my own personal journey finally red pilled me.  In the long run is respecting each other, discussion, and exposure.  The truth must be told before we can ever hope to discuss it in hopes of societal progression.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it will get worse because the elite&#39;s spiritual involvement is inherently evil, and they will not let go of it without a fight.  My point of view has changed significantly the past year.  I would have thought the current me was crazy a year ago.  I never really got involved in politics, but I did this time because of Sanders.  </p>

<p>I am wondering if Congress can pass a law to confiscate their wealth.  Perhaps the Patriot Act can be used to do it.  I would not feel bad because they did not acquire their wealth through hard work.  Instead, they inherited it, and stole it from the taxpayers.  We would just be taking it back.  </p>

<p>LOL, what kind of deluded alternate reality do you have to live in to actually believe this? Take a look at his cabinet. Pay-to-play Betsy DeVos, who has given more than $7.8 million.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it takes time to drain a swamp that has been fermenting in shit since about JFK.  Comey was fired, and Priebus resigned, but would have been fired.  The pedo and human trafficking arrests have escalated since Trump came into office. My hope is that he is rolling them up, which takes time.  </p>

<p>You are right.   Trump is not perfect, but he is the best option we have at the moment.  He is one that will not put up with the New World Order globalist shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always ask this, and I get tired of giving the same explanation, but that&#39;s fine.  I think the problem is that people believe what they see and hear without realizing that they are being shown certain things to manipulate their opinions.  People rarely take the time to look behind the scenes at how things really work.  If you watch separate news channels at the same time, you will get the same story being fed to you.  This should make you very suspicious, especially if you are being told what you want to hear.  </p>

<p>This article lists the people that were fired or resigned.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-trump-firings-resignations/">http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-trump-firings-resignations/</a> </p>

<p>Some resigned to distance themselves from Trump, which is fine.  I do not know if they are part of the swamp (i.e. Elon Musk).  People like Comey, Priebus, and others are part of the swamp.  McMaster needs to go, too.  There have been a lot of arrests for human trafficking and pedophilia since Trump came into office.  You are aware of this?  The swamp is full of such people, so they need Trump to go before they get arrested.  Why wasn&#39;t Obama doing something about these people?  He had to have known about it...  </p>

<p>A lot of people believe that Trump walked into the White House last January and started giving orders.  That is not how any of this works.  It has not worked like this since JFK.  It is naive to think that Trump had absolute power to make those cabinet appointments.  </p>

<p>When Obama was first elected, he was given a list of bankers to appoint to his administration.  The list was given to him by Citibank.  I don&#39;t see why it would be any different with Trump.  </p>

<p>What we are seeing today is a clash between the Bilderberg people, who are New World Order globalists, and Trump, who is a Nationalist.  Putin is also a Nationalist.  It is really simple.  It has nothing to do with Democrat versus Republican or Left versus Right.  This is why certain Republicans are aligning themselves against Trump.  They are New World Order globalists, and they will cross party lines to support the New World Order globalist agenda.  </p>

<p>I could go on, but I suggest reading about Bilderberg and the Council on Foreign Relations.  Once you understand the hidden power structure, your point of view will (or should) change drastically.  </p>

<p>Oh, one more thing.  Pence is a New World Order globalist, so this is another reason they would love to get rid of Trump.  I suspect that Pence is a Pedo, just like Biden.  Jeff Flake is implicated, and he is best buddies with Pence.  McCain is implicated, and so is Schumer.  </p>

Usury debt systems like the Federal Reserve are an infringement of the citizenry&#39;s rights in addition to sullying our coinage and treasury.
