        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everything is so strange, so emotional right now. People seem upset and tense. Not just on a few subreddits, but on the whole internet, and in real life too. </p>

<p>The media is messing with us. They want us too emotional to think straight. </p>

<p>The greatest rebellion then would to be calm, because then you will avoid their pre-made psychological traps that trick literally hundreds of millions of people in to holding certain types of beliefs. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the CIA is so involved with radio and tv stations around the world. You can control large groups of people through the message and emotions used. If people were cattle, this is how you would herd them.  </p>

<p>I saw a lot of heedless promotion of violence today on facebook. I haven&#39;t been there in three months, but there were many many people from highschool who are talking about how they want to punch nazis. And another saying  how the means don&#39;t matter as long as the end is attacking nazis. </p>

<p>These people are being hoisted on the petard of their own morals. Of course Nazis are bad. But we&#39;re not having a national crisis because one asshole drove his car in to a group of people. There&#39;s not even enough nazis to punch. Most people will probably never come across one in their life. Although the media is running around like a chicken with its head cut off and everyone is consequently freaking out because they&#39;re so emotionally in-tune with that messaging system. </p>

<p>People just need to calm. down. They are pulling the strings so hard that some are bound to snap. They are losing their grip on power, so they are pulling out all the stops to manipulate billions of people across the world and the US by over-focusing and over-dramatizing these few thousand neo-nazis (which have always been around) vs these few thousand antifa protesters, which are often violent in their own regard. Neither of these groups are good people, although one claims the moral highground because <em>their</em> violence is being used to right social wrongs. How about no. </p>

<p>These extremists on both sides should generally be ignored. I only talk about them here and now because so many people are so worked up, and there&#39;s just no reason to be. These are tiny groups that represent a tiny problem, <em>unless</em> they are given so much national attention that the groups both grow as people join the conflict. It&#39;s the same reason the media will sometimes downplays the power of serial killers and mass murderers and not use their name, to avoid repeats incidents. Not because they&#39;re &quot;mass murder sympathizers who want to sweep it under the rug&quot; but rather because constantly talking about those people only gives them more power. Attention is power. Good attention or bad attention. If you don&#39;t care, which neo-nazis definitely don&#39;t care, then any attention is good attention. What they <em>don&#39;t</em> want is to be unimportant and ignored. Which they pretty much have been until the last week. </p>

<p>Attacking them makes them feel like victims, and then they group together even more and their numbers grow. The numbers also grow as more people get called a nazi by witch-hunting extremist liberals. This is why if you truly wish to disempower people like these, you ignore them and treat them as insignificant as they are. Treat them as a joke. Because they are. They only matter because we constantly talk about them. Just like the Kardashians. Same thing. </p>

<p>If you want to get worked up, talk about the economy, and how the middle class is dying. That&#39;s the real injustice, that affects the quality of life of hundreds of millions of people every day. That&#39;s the thing they want people to shut up about, because that would actually affect their bottom line. </p>

<p>The more emotional you are in a moment, the less nuance you have. They want us in an emotional place, because it literally makes us act dumber. If literally millions of people are flipping a shit because they&#39;ve so perfectly had their buttons pressed (as seems to be the case right now) then all nuance is lost and their worldview narrows to &quot;punching nazis is good&quot; in their righteous fury. They over-focus on the issue because it&#39;s so obvious, and they cannot believe &quot;that the world is like it is&quot;, and the media keeps pushing that sense of disbelief and emotional reaction and inability to accept reality as it is. And keeps over-focusing on it, drawing away from other issues that might actually affect your real actual life. Like your financial position in this world, and the things that affect that. No one is talking about that right now, because everyone&#39;s too emotionally fixated on the outrage de jour, like Guam or domestic Neo-Nazis. All the focus on domestic issues that affect everyone is instead refocused on extremists, or is refocused to issues abroad. And the gray area gets ignored. Meanwhile the tent cities get larger and larger, and the cost of housing, medicine, and college far far outpaces growth in earnings.</p>

<p>People focus on these extremists like they matter. They only matter because people focus on them. Stop. Focus on what actually matters. You only have so many seconds of attention in this lifespan, it&#39;s a precious resource even more than gold. Spend them wisely, and don&#39;t tilt at windmills. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Here is outlined the procedure by which democratic, or even republican, forms of government can be turned into a dictatorship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This technique of subverting a democracy into a dictatorship was spelled out in a book in 1957 by Jan Kozak, a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Mr. Kozak titled his book How Parliament Took a Revolutionary Part in the Transition to Socialism and the Role of the Popular Masses. The American version of his book is titled And Not a Shot is Fired, the Communist Strategy for Subverting a Represen- tative Government. Mr. Kozak describes what has been called the &quot;Pincers Movement,&quot; the method by which the conspirators can use the parliament,
to fight for a firm parliamentary majority which would ensure and develop a strong &#39;pres- sure from above,&#39; and
to see to it that this firm parliamentary majority should rely on the revolutionary activity of the broad working masses exerting &#39;pressure from below. &#39;5</p>

<p>the &quot;Pressure from Above,&quot; and the mob, the &quot;Pressure from Below,&quot; to convert a democracy into a dictatorship. Mr. Kozak explained his strategy:</p>

<p>A preliminary condition for carrying out fundamental social changes and for making it possible that parliament be made use of for the purpose of transforming a capitalistic society into a socialistic one, is:</p>

<p>What Mr. Kozak proposed was a five part program to seize control of a government.</p>

<p>The first step consisted of having the conspiracy&#39;s own people infiltrate the government (the &quot;pressure from above.&quot;)</p>

<p>The second step was to create a real or alleged grievance, usually through either an action of government or through some situation where the government should have acted and didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The third step consisted in having a mob created by the real or alleged grievance that the government or the conspiracy caused demand that the problem be solved by a governmental action (the &quot;pressure from below.&quot;)
The fourth step consisted in having the conspirators in the government remedy the real or alleged sitivation with some oppressive legislation.</p>

<p>The fifth step is a repeat of the last three. The legislation that the government passes does not solve the problem and the mob demands more and more legislation until the government becomes totalitarian in nature by possessing all of the power.</p>

<p>And total power was the goal of those causing the grievance. The plan is, as Nesta Webster wrote in her book World Revolution: &quot;the systematic attempt to create grievances in order to exploit them.&quot;6</p>

<p>This technique was used, with a slight variation, by Adolf Hitler, who sent his own party loyalists into the streets (the &quot;Pressure from Below&quot;) to create the terror that he blamed on the government (the &quot;Pressure from Above.&quot;) The German people, told by Hitler that the government in power couldn&#39;t end the terror even though they passed oppressive legislation in an effort to stop it, listened to the one man who was offering relief: Adolf Hitler. He was in a position to stop the terror. He was the one causing it! And therefore he could end it! And he promised that he would end it when he was given the power of government! </p>
