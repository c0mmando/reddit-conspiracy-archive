    <div class="md"><p>I think they should be taken down, however I do think that the argument you present is perfectly valid and I don&#39;t have an issue at all with what you are saying.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think the problem is that a lot of people aren&#39;t educated about the Civil War. In fact, in a lot of schools in the south it is actually referred to as The War of Northern Aggression. This lack of an educated perspective tends to lead to people abusing the idea of the Civil War and worshipping these statues or their subjects as idols.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, most Confederate memorials <em>don&#39;t</em> serve as reminders of the reasons for or lessons of the war. Most people growing up in Southern states are still taught variations of the &quot;slavery didn&#39;t cause the war&quot; myth, despite growing up around such monuments. If they exist to teach history, they&#39;re not doing their job.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true if you mean the buying and selling of slaves wasn&#39;t the primary economic driver. Cotton was. Slaves worked the cotton plantations. Some historians have argued that the plantation system could have worked without slavery, but the South did not believe so. Their secession statements make it clear that they saw slavery as the cornerstone of their economy, as well as their culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the number of slaves and look at the population. There were millions of people who had nothing to do with slavery and most likely was being hindered by it.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a case to be made that slavery was inefficient; like I said, since historians think the southern economy was held back by it.

<p>Sharing both those view points or to pick a side between the issue is the issue.</p>

<p>You really have to start taking accountability for your decisions and thought processes. You also have to acknowledge that history has came at the expense and benefit of others but that just fuels the bullshit. Now people are &quot;gulity&quot;. </p>

<li><p>That can be done in a museum</p></li>
<li><p>What these monuments <em>don&#39;t</em> remind us of is where <em>they</em> came from. The vast majority were erected by white supremacists groups in the 1910&#39;s and 1960&#39;s, corresponding to the beginning of the Jim Crow period and the Civil Rights Movement, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a difference between portraying historical figures and <em>glorifying</em> them in heroic-looking monuments placed in public parks and in front of government buildings.</p></li>

Everyone vaguely sympathetic to the alt-right will denounce the SPLC as an ANTI-WHITE HATE GROUP so I&#39;d use this only as a guide to start out with finding other, primary sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that graph is pretty jaw dropping. I would love to see a new article written focused on the data (eg not buried so far down) but this is great for now. thanks!</p>
