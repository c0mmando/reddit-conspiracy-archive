      <p>
       Â¿What is a color revolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the setting in motion of seemingly popular revolts which with time become more violent and chaotic whose final desired result is the unseating of a ruling leader. Examples of color revolutions: green revolution in Iran, orange revolution in Ukraine, the so called Libyan revolution against Gadaffi, the so called revolution against Assad in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       How to manufacture color revolutions: Use whatever means possible to incite riots, but more importantly, violent, chaotic riots. Use the press to disseminate a given interpretation and narrative of the events. Associate the negative feelings of that to the target leader and his supporters. Rinse and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's happening at home, in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charlottesville is the clearest example so far:
      </p>
      <p>
       -there were clashes, chaos, dead and injured.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Press is using that to associate Donald Trump with Neo Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Trump supporters and non establishment conservatives are being lumped with Neo Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Big bussiness like google are using these associations to justify the censorship of not only neonazi literature, but of a broad range of conservatives, and other supporters of Donald Trump. Their right to assembly is being curtailed as well on the same grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some facts of Charlotesville events:
      </p>
      <p>
       -The organizer of "unite the right" march was a former "Occupy" activist, associated to Obama campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Police was ordered to stand down, not intervene, full knowing the volatility of a situation where "antifas" are very close to "neonazis" and actually birdogging them.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The video of the car slamming was first shared by Brennan Gilmore, former state department employee with ties to the CIA and experience in special operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Security measures taken were non existant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make your own conclusions.

       No, you said this was another thread saying that it was OK to be a nazi. Where,
       <em>
        in this posr
       </em>
       does it say that? You said that it does, but I don't see it. He seems to be stating there's an active movement to conflate supporting the GOP with being a nazi, and lo and behold, that is what you are accusing OP of.

       No, op is blaming the press for pushing the Donald narrative. What about those of us who don't read or watch that wretched waste of time and decided that through his own actions, great leader Donald dimwit is in fact a nazi sympathizer like op.

       The president said there were good people marching on Friday. Amongst the hate chants denigrating Jews and blacks, there were good people, marching along side. I don't know why you keep putting the numbers at the end of your post. I'd love for you to share why.

       I'm always willing to check out proof
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       if it contradicts a personal belief, as I find few things more encouraging than knowing there's so much more to learn. I believe you focus on a small and noisy userbase, and disregard many of the more thoughtful users in the sub. Yes, we're cynical, but not all are obtuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have little doubt that there were good people protesting, just as I have little doubt there were also hate-mongering, nearly-irredeemable piles of scum protesting as well. My frustration isn't derived from a place of believing it didn't happen; but from a place of not understanding why anyone who questions certain aspects of what happened is subsequently branded a nazi. There is an enormous space in between questioning specific details, and being/ supporting Nazis.

       ANTIFA was there as well. I'm not sure of the numbers each group had in attendance, but the Nazis were not the only group there voicing protest. There was representation from more than just the Nazis, but you seem to be skating by that point and harping on your buzzwords.

       I'm aware Antifa was there. They didn't chant racist things nor run anyone over. As a matter of fact, they saved several people's lives (brother Cornell West included) when the fash marched on a black church with torches. They kkk fam.

       So by your logic, ANTIFA are Nazis. Do you see how these tactics are frustrating when used against you?

      <p>
       It doesn't help find answers when you twist words in an effort to be confrontational. You misrepresented the information by originally insinuating Nazis were the only ones marching, when you knew all along ANTIFA was there as well.

       I'm blaming you for conflating the supporting of the GOP, or the questioning of the narrative pushed by the media, with being a Nazi. Past that, I think this has been a fair exchange of ideas, and no one has really resorted to name calling...other than the Nazi insinuations. I caution anyone who sees so vividly in black-and-white, as there are varying degrees of grey, as well as an entire color spectrum that are ignored.

       Ngl the only people who didn't see a "color revolution" coming was "white america". Also it's not hard to lump trump and his supporters in with "nazis" given the route trump choose to get into the White House.

       I'm not sure about the Charlottesville stuff but I think this idea of color revolutions is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about the top 3 always, or used to always, be in the in news: ISIS, Antifa, and BLM. All funded by Soros and all using the same black and white colors for their flags.
      </p>

       Trump launched his own color revolution whether he knew it or not with the res MAGA hat, although I'm inclined to believe he definitely knew.
