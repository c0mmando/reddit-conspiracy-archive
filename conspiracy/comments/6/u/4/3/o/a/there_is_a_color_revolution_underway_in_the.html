        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Â¿What is a color revolution?</p>

<p>It is the setting in motion of seemingly popular revolts which with time become more violent and chaotic whose final desired result is the unseating of a ruling leader. Examples of color revolutions: green revolution in Iran, orange revolution in Ukraine, the so called Libyan revolution against Gadaffi, the so called revolution against Assad in Syria.</p>

<p>How to manufacture color revolutions: Use whatever means possible to incite riots, but more importantly, violent, chaotic riots. Use the press to disseminate a given interpretation and narrative of the events. Associate the negative feelings of that to the target leader and his supporters. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s happening at home, in the United States. </p>

<p>Charlottesville is the clearest example so far:</p>

<p>-there were clashes, chaos, dead and injured.</p>

<p>-Press is using that to associate Donald Trump with Neo Nazis.</p>

<p>-Trump supporters and non establishment conservatives are being lumped with Neo Nazis.</p>

<p>-Big bussiness like google are using these associations to justify the censorship of not only neonazi literature, but of a broad range of conservatives, and other supporters of Donald Trump. Their right to assembly is being curtailed as well on the same grounds.</p>

<p>Some facts of Charlotesville events:</p>

<p>-The organizer of &quot;unite the right&quot; march was a former &quot;Occupy&quot; activist, associated to Obama campaign.</p>

<p>-Police was ordered to stand down, not intervene, full knowing the volatility of a situation where &quot;antifas&quot; are very close to &quot;neonazis&quot; and actually birdogging them.</p>

<p>-The video of the car slamming was first shared by Brennan Gilmore, former state department employee with ties to the CIA and experience in special operations.</p>

<p>-Security measures taken were non existant.</p>

<p>Make your own conclusions.</p>

<p>The president said there were good people marching on Friday. Amongst the hate chants denigrating Jews and blacks, there were good people, marching along side. I don&#39;t know why you keep putting the numbers at the end of your post. I&#39;d love for you to share why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always willing to check out proof <em>especially</em> if it contradicts a personal belief, as I find few things more encouraging than knowing there&#39;s so much more to learn. I believe you focus on a small and noisy userbase, and disregard many of the more thoughtful users in the sub. Yes, we&#39;re cynical, but not all are obtuse.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that there were good people protesting, just as I have little doubt there were also hate-mongering, nearly-irredeemable piles of scum protesting as well. My frustration isn&#39;t derived from a place of believing it didn&#39;t happen; but from a place of not understanding why anyone who questions certain aspects of what happened is subsequently branded a nazi. There is an enormous space in between questioning specific details, and being/ supporting Nazis. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re mistaking me for some uneducated capitalist neolibcuck, friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware Antifa was there. They didn&#39;t chant racist things nor run anyone over. As a matter of fact, they saved several people&#39;s lives (brother Cornell West included) when the fash marched on a black church with torches. They kkk fam. </p>

<p>So by your logic, ANTIFA are Nazis. Do you see how these tactics are frustrating when used against you? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help find answers when you twist words in an effort to be confrontational. You misrepresented the information by originally insinuating Nazis were the only ones marching, when you knew all along ANTIFA was there as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about the Charlottesville stuff but I think this idea of color revolutions is real. </p>

<p>Just think about the top 3 always, or used to always, be in the in news: ISIS, Antifa, and BLM. All funded by Soros and all using the same black and white colors for their flags.</p>

<p>Trump launched his own color revolution whether he knew it or not with the res MAGA hat, although I&#39;m inclined to believe he definitely knew.</p>

<p>Red blooded patriotism vs the jolly Roger black and white, divided black and white death cults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are witnessing George Soros&#39; attempt at his Purple Revolution.  He bet billions against our economy before the election and he expects his ill gotten winnings.</p>
