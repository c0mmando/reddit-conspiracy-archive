        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The central bank reformed again in 1913 but Andrew Jackson was against them because he was against debt slavery. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/andrew-jackson-shuts-down-second-bank-of-the-u-s">http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/andrew-jackson-shuts-down-second-bank-of-the-u-s</a></p>

<p>Andrew Jackson speech against central bank:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.silverdoctors.com/gold/gold-news/andrew-jacksons-speech-against-central-banksters-as-true-today-as-in-1832/">http://www.silverdoctors.com/gold/gold-news/andrew-jacksons-speech-against-central-banksters-as-true-today-as-in-1832/</a></p>

<p>Andrew Jackson quote: “You are a den of vipers! I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution by morning.” (President Andrew Jackson, 1834.</p>

<p>Trump compares himself to Andrew Jackson:</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/324207-trump-draws-comparisons-to-andrew-jackson-in-nashville">http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/324207-trump-draws-comparisons-to-andrew-jackson-in-nashville</a></p>

<p>Conclusion: I am back on the Trump train as of 2 weeks ago because of various reasons which make me believe Trump has been playing some amazing 12D chess. I just watched a documentary where Andrew Jackson shut down the central banks to prevent debt slavery and remembered Trump comparing himself to this man. This leads me to believe that Trump intends to make shutting down the central bank one of his main priorities since that was basically Andrew Jacksons legacy. And to be fair to Trump, the people also hold a huge chunk of the responsibility for making something this monumental happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is like a wrestler who started off on his back with the cabal on top of him because the cabal has been in power for many decades and Trump and his support team are the white hats who had enough and stepped in to stop the black hats. First thing first, Trump had to wrestle his way from under the cabal which he did. Now, he is trying to get the cabal on their backs. Once he gets the cabal on their back, he can strike the finishing blow which is unleashing the truth to the American people. By them the cabal won&#39;t be able to retaliate. The cabal sees this happening right before their eyes and that is why they have been freaking out lately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a trick question.</p>

<p>No one has the right answer to this question. </p>

<p>The gold standard seems like a good fit but it isn&#39;t feasible die to the lack of gold in circulation and the extraction/printing that would be needed to create a system of support.</p>

<p>Bitcoin seems like a good fit since its 2017 but it is being horded and is finite. There are alsonpther crypto-currencies making their debut ever day.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t have an answer for you because it would take a vast understanding of the entire global economy and financial system to create a solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jackson&#39;s insistence on hard money and war with the SBUS wrecked the US economy, and brought about one of the worst depressions of the 19th century. Hopefully Trump does not do that again, because it isn&#39;t a good idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m 100% correct, but I think Trump is working for the people. That&#39;s just my take on the current happening though. The truth continues to emerge so we will find out soon enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Killed tpp</p></li>
<li><p>Defunded the ISIS mercenary group. </p></li>
<li><p>He spent months trying to get a leg up on the swamp so he can then drain it but he did knick James Comey, Bannon, and a few others so far. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Not bad for the first 6 months. Idk, I was antitrump a month ago but I am back on the Trump train. I now believe a lot of his actions to please the deep state were theatrics to buy time while he planted himself deeply into the White House. Keep in mind, he is dealing with the most dangerous people on Earth so he has to fake the funk early in the game to stay alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t &quot;kill&quot; tpp. Congress was shying away from it before he withdrew so that was a freebie for him. Literally no effort on his part but it made him look sorta cool for a little bit, if you are uninformed. </p>

<p>Still sending money to saudi arabia, #2 was convenient for him but he&#39;s doing shit all to de-escalate the middle east other than that. Trump is netanyahu&#39;s bitch. Did you forget how much trump&#39;s rhetoric calmed down during the campaign after his meeting with netanyahu? </p>

<p>After bannon&#39;s phone comments I&#39;m not even sure bannon is one of the more dangerous ones. He&#39;s a zionist piece of shit but I kinda agree with some of his economic policy and I think he&#39;s too careful to really go overboard. </p>

<p>If those 3 items are enough to convince you trump is on your side, you have low standards. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not faking anything. He is a moron too stupid to play 2D chess. Have you listened to him speak? He is not informed, he is not intelligent. He is not even clever. He&#39;s in over his head and the people he keeps around him are using him, and 0% of them have your and my interests at heart unless it also (and primarily) makes money for them. </p>

<p>If we get 3 years into it and he has made progress on 9/11, prosecuting hilary, middle east withdrawal etc etc etc I will excitedly eat my words. Until then I think it is dangerously naive to expect that he wants to do good but he just isn&#39;t allowed to. He doesn&#39;t know what good is, he grew up in the bubble. However I&#39;m not even sure he will still be around 3 years in, and not because of some conspiracy but because of his own ineptitude. </p>
