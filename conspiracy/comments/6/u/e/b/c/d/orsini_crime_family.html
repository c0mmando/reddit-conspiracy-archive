        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Orsini family of Rome, the Orsini-Rosenberg family of Austria, and the Roseneberg family of Bohemia control Rosicrucianism which is a secret society of alchemists. These families all use the rose on their coat of arms. The Rosicrucian Order is also called the Order of the Rosy Cross. Alchemy is the manipulation of the human psyche and biology through chemicals. The FDA and most food and drug companies are controlled by Rosicrucians. The Orsini family were behind the Ebola propaganda and had developed deadly Ebola vaccines. The creator of the Georgia Guidestones which aim to regulate the population of humanity used the name RC Christian as an alias and was really Robert C Cook an American geneticist involved in population control and eugenics. RCC like Roman Catholic Church and like Rosy Cross. The Rosicrucians made a YouTube video placing a time cube with MM and 16 on it. MM for 2000 and 16 together meant 2016. They intended to unleash a fake outbreak in 2016 to bring down the United States and target society with their deadly vaccines.</p>

<p>The depictions shown of the Ebola virus under a microscope look like an two eights. 8+8=16. The Japanese movie called Virus used a virus called MM88 designed by an American eugenicist. Once this was all exposed the Ebola propaganda ended within the week. They are behind Zika too. Vaccines are one of the most destructive tools the wicked use on humanity and are primarily designed to target the nervous system and weaken a persons spiritual armor or electromagnetic shield. The Orsini and Rosenberg families were also responsible for the Black Plague. They hired people to poison well water in order to spread the disease. The song Ring O Roses goes back to the times of the Black Plague. They used rose petals to mask the smell of death. I also found two people with the name Rosenberg that work in high level positions at Bayer today. The Colonna family of Rome work closely with the Orsini family and are also involved with pharmaceuticals. Stefano Colonna developed the Julia-Colonna Epoxidation which is used by Bayer and Evonik today. The Julia-Colonna Epoxidation is used for binding toxic chemicals with human enzymes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No there is a criminal network operating all over the internet consisting of organized cyber stalkers and hackers that target people who expose criminals. They track people illegally and provide intelligence on them which is used for further targeting including assassinations. They harass and threaten people which is also illegal. They get paid through paypal and other means. If an investigation was to take place these people would be put into prison especially once the all the murders these people assisted in get revealed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ya know, I enjoy your posts and you&#39;ve highlighted a lot of lesser know aristocratic bloodlines that i never knew existed. i genuinely appreciate the effort you put into these posts, but it gets cheapened when you automatically associate any form of criticism with paid shills and gangstalking. im not saying they dont exist, but like the above poster said sometimes people are just dickheads. criticism happens, dont let it back you into a corner where you dismiss it all as targeted harassment. keep doin what you&#39;re doin and fuck the naysayers, you give them far too much attention </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and they are paid. The Wallenberg family of Sweden have massive amounts of wealth. The Wallenberg and Trolle families both serve the House of Bernadotte. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolle</a></p>

<p>Trolle (sometimes in Danish Trold) is the name of a Scanian noble family, originally from Småland, in Sweden. The family has produced prominent people in the histories of Denmark and in Sweden since the Middle Ages and is associated with several estates in Sweden.[1] [2]</p>

<p>The family name comes from the family coat of arms that depicts a headless troll. According to tradition, the family had taken these arms on the basis of a legend that a common ancestor must have killed a troll and robbed a drinking horn, which was called Våxtorpshornet el.</p>
