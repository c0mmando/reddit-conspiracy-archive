       Don't try to prevent getting cancer. We all have it. The goal is to keep your body healthy enough to get rid of the cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay away from milk (look up IGF 1 growth hormone) and sugar, drink enough water, get enough sleep and exercise, and cope with stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't focus so much on "detoxifying" - your body is designed to detoxify on a daily basis. Don't worry too much about which foods are good for you or bad for you. Every human body is different so you need to find what is good for your body specifically. Allergies are a good example of how our bodies are different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our bodies have this amazing beautiful thing that takes the stress off of what you have to worry about. It's called shitting. You put in lots of different elements and your body decides what it needs and shits out the rest. This is a good system that needs to be maintained. The intestinal system basically has two modes: fed, and detox.  When you remain in a constant state of being fed you never get the chance to detox.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't tell you what will work for you but I'll tell you what works for me. For the last few years I have one cup of coffee in the morning. Folgers instant black (no sugar, no cream) and it suppresses my appetite until lunch. Around 9:00 I have a bit of water with lemon and diatomaceous earth (if it does nothing else it alleviates my arthritis like magic). For lunch I pig out and eat 1,000 to 1,300 calories of whatever the fuck I want. Dinner is always the same: 1,000 calories of beer with no food.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been on this diet for about three years and I had a full health assessment a few months back and I'm in tip top shape for a man my age (almost 50). I feel a lot younger than people my age and I look a hell of a lot younger. I am hungry most of the time but I embrace the hunger pains as being beneficial. Over time you can train your mind to like hunger pangs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I allow myself one day a week to indulge in all the unhealthy crap I want but, over time, my interest in that stuff has faded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah...and masturbate. Masturbate a lot. It prevents prostate cancer.

       I had the arthritis since I was 12. It's not always an old person's ailment.

       I did say that my diet alleviates my arthritis and that my diet makes me feel younger. How are you seeing a contradiction?

       Since you're knowledgeable of the subject please explain to me how water, hops, yeast, and barley mixed together is unhealthy. Is it because there's alcohol in it? The reason that humans can digest alcohol is because we already process it in our body.

       You are right. Not nearly as triggering but still not healthy. (OP's original post stated that everything's a carcinogen) but even the purest organic milk still has IGF-1 which is nearly identical in cows and humans.

       If I'm at a party or a get together and I indulge in toxic (but delicious) food I do fast afterwards. You said it - 24 hour fast every 10 days or so is ideal. I stopped doing a regular fast about 6 months ago and feel sluggish more than I used to. I will start the fasting again. Now, surprise surprise, when the monks used to fast they still drank beer.

       I'm trying to stick with only pussy, and only my wife's, because I know where it was grown, and she tells me if there might be any toxins.

       I've also reached the point where I don't mind dying faster, but that has nothing to do with my wife. Really.

       Organic is mostly better than conventional. If it's organic it's not gmo so that's big. Most of the shittier pesticides aren't on organic food(too bad if they're next to a conventional farm though).
      </p>
      <p>
       Make as much of your own food as you can. If you're in a terrible apartment with no light on your balcony, you can hit up farmers markets and speak directly with the people who grew your food about the conditions it was grown in, your money stays local and doesn't support chains etc. A lot of the stands at farmers markets aren't certified organic but essentially are because they don't want the hassle but they'll tell you everything and are happy to inform. There's also CSA to look into.

       I am vegetarian and I think it is the way to be. More power to full on vegans but you really need access to good, varied food for that--amy's, oreos and veggie burgers aren't enough to survive on. Plus I don't think veganism will be possible in the states when avocados, coconut oil, quinoa etc etc aren't being shipped thousands of miles.

       It's not that hard. What was food before it was deconstructed then preservatived and enriched and put in a box? Eat that. We have near infinite information. You could spend your entire life on pubmed and nutritiondata.self crafting the most medicinal diet, but most of it is obvious. Varied diet with the right ratio of macros for your situation, a few afternoons of reading and plain common sense is more than enough. If it doesn't look like what it was before it was harvested, probably don't eat it. If the ingredients is more than a small handful of items and most of those words are stuff from a lab and not from the ground, probably don't eat it.

       Have you ever had a fresh beefsteak tomato, grown by yourself or your neighbor? Your body knows what it wants, listen to it(unless you've fucked up your baseline with msg, high fructose corn syrup and industrial cheeseburgers).
