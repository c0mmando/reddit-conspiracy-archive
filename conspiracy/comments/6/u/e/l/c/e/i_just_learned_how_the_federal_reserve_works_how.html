    <div class="md"><p>If the American banking system crashes fuck your money there are more important things to worry about. The Federal Reserve is not more prone to failure than the rest of the world, doomsdayers have been saying the fiat charade will fall any day every day for who the fuck knows how long. Go back years and years on Zerohedge and see how wrong they all were.</p>

<p>If you are trying to make a responsible financial decision than don&#39;t remove yourself from the banking system, if you want to make some sort of spiritual statement or something change your money into bullets or food and save it.</p>

<p>First step I&#39;m working on, is validating/authenticating my certificate of live birth (remember there is a difference with that and your &quot;birth certificate&quot;). From what I&#39;ve been reading, that is the ultimate first step.</p>

<p>I came across this guys channel, and I think he is more onto it, than the others: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7TV46q1dqo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7TV46q1dqo</a>. Give his few videos a watch. I&#39;m asking you, please do more research. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. I kind of regret in a way posting that Dent video, tbh. But, kind of don&#39;t. Because after that post, a few good people pointed me in a different (more correct, imo) direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, you were supposed to re-claim your name, and re-status yourself. This dates back to 1871, when the US became a Corporation and not a Republic. Technically, you are lost/dead at sea.</p>

<p>Here is a comment I made on another thread:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Possibly a returning of power from the Corporation that is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA via the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 back to the people and the states. </p>

<p>That basically means, returning back to the Constitution and Common Law. We are currently living under UCC and we are dead/lost at sea, supposed to return and re-status ourselves - claim our name and estate. Even more frightening, de facto enemies of the United States. This was what the 13th and 14th amendments were really about, as are our birth certificates. There is a lot more to this, and I&#39;m currently drafting up a post, but yea.. that is the gist.</p>

<p>I knew there was a reason various things were coming to light. After watching this, I kind of had an &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment. I now think it&#39;s connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha I feel you with the cages and the bullet holes. I was actually one of the ones who tried to pay bills with their SS, and it worked, in weird ways, but it worked. Still worried I sold my soul to the devil or will end up in jail, but test accomplished; I know there&#39;s something to this. It sucks that by looking into emancipating yourself from this terrible enslaving system of double speak and entrapment literally makes you into a &quot;terrorist worse than ISIS&quot;, according to the dep of homeland sec. Good luck to you, dude. If you go down this process, document the hell out of it for us, and I&#39;ll keep you in mind if I take any big steps. </p>

<p>Better late than never. If you have just recently learned about the funny money system, then you are probably still unaware of media fakery. I recommend you check out and familiarise yourself with outlets like <a href="https://www.fakeology.com">Fakeology</a> to get a handle on how far the funny business really goes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There aren&#39;t many comments here offering real advice. You need to convert your cash to assets. Buy things that have real value for a human being that are not easily destroyed. For example: houses, land, gold, silver, etc. </p>

<p>The reason any form of money exists is you will notice that if you buy a piece of land for example, it is difficult to quickly exchange for another good or even convert to cash. However, these purchases will act as a store of wealth because, no matter how much the value of the currency fluctuates, the human value remains the same. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t, and if you try, you&#39;ll get raped to death with a bayonet. </p>

<p>Another commenter mentioned credit unions, and credit unions are good, but they&#39;re still tied in to the same banking system ultimately. I hear some of them even keep liquid assets in larger corporate banks, so using a credit union won&#39;t really insulate you if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking. </p>
