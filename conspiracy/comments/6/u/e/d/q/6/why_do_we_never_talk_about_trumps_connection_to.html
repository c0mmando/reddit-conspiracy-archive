    <div class="md"><p>This is one of my favorite subjects! I&#39;m glad that you brought it up! </p>

<p>Did you know that not a single person has witnessed Trump at Epstein&#39;s island? Only testimony from Epstein&#39;s brother saying that he was on the Lolita once, refused to deplane at the island and demanded a ride home. Trumps name doesn&#39;t appear in the flight logs again.</p>

<p>Also, it was testified to by Epstein&#39;s chef that Trump did indeed accept an invitation to Epstein&#39;s mansion for dinner, but he refused to eat at the table, instead choosing the company of the staff in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Another thing, try as I might, I can&#39;t get anyone to come up with a photo if these two gregarious camera hounds <em>together</em>, except for the one photo with the model in the 80&#39;s at a gala, and it looks like they were just standing together, not hanging out together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about the fact that the chef could have been paid off, but that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me. Everyone on the staff, as well as all the dinner guests would have to be paid off, and for a detail so trivial, no lawyer worth his salt would even approach the question without absolutely knowing the answer to be true. Why risk a whole case on a witness perjuring himself on such a minute detail?</p>

<p>The flight logs are evidence that was accepted by the court. I&#39;ve attached the wiki in another comment. Maybe they were faked, but they were deemed legit by the court. </p>

<p>The pageants. I have a theory about that, but you know that.</p>
