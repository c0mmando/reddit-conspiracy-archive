    <div class="md"><p>Well what do you want me to say? My two cents is that the powers that be will try to get some sort of race war, a civil war some sort of event in the next few years and base it all off our gender identity, our racial identity and essentially have us kill each other and once the controlled assets of the alt-right and antifa are killed off or crushed in the war, the national security state will come in as the &quot;saviors&quot; and set up a permanent despotism and you can be rest assured that the NYT, WaPo, Time, CNN and other &quot;fake news&quot; won&#39;t object over the fact that this permanent police state is place now because its not Trump.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been hearing on this sub that the race,civil,police state has been coming for years. You really think they are going to be so heavy handed with how they do this? Also what is fake news anymore? With your real news  can you go to their sources and verify their stories where you are unable to with the Fake news?</p>

<p>Or does it not align with your beliefs and is fake because of that? I see more and more of this as of late than the latter. Look how many times the Seth Rich story has changed to fit a narrative, look how desperately they are trying to blame the left for the Saturdays events.</p>

<p>Im just observing here, and would rather have conversation, if you are going to attack me for my questions than let this die here.  </p>
