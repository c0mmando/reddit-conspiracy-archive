       I mostly agree, but if you questions things you have to be willing and able to admit that your notions are wrong
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is an assumed scientific fact.  There are mountains and mountains of evidence to support that.  There is no evidence that demonstrates it to be false.  Sure, you can question it and want to know the "truth", but at the end of the day your left with a choice...accept the facts or continue to believe that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       and some random youtube dude or 4chan poster know more than every scientist that dedicated their life to studying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of topics in which the truth of the matter is more obscure than with evolution.  Some topics have factual evidence that can point to a number of different conclusions.  It's great to have an opinion on the matter, but if you're honestly looking for the core truth, it's imperative to change your opinion in light of new facts that come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       All too often people form an opinion and then selectively look for facts/evidence to back that opinion up, all the while discarding anything that would invalidate their opinion.  That's the opposite of being open minded.

       The process of evolution sounds very logical to me, i very much enjoyed learning about the speciation of birds on nearby islands and i found it compelling. I believe that the observations darwin made are helpful for our understanding of how species change over time. When someone dismisses "evolution" ask them what they are dismissing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i dismissed evolution it would saying that humans didn't evolve naturally but at some instance there was some form of intervention akin to eugenics. 
I have no proof of this but afaik there are still missing links to prove that the process of evolution caused every form of speciation that we see; particularly looking at humans here. I still believe the process of evolution and the continual refinement of a species towards beneficial mutations occurs. But that's not all i believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with the holocaust; i believe that there were concentration camps, just like with the allies. I believe deaths happened there. I believe there was anti jew propaganda during the rise of Nazi germany. I've heard of genocide caused by using zyklon B but i see no staining on the auschwitz "gas chamber" walls. I've been told that 6 Million jews died but those proclaiming that lowered the figures themselves, twice. I've been indoctrinated to believe that a systemic genocide was carried out there and yet when i searched for proof i found a lack of it. 
The current auschwitz chamber is a recreation; it is claimed that it was turned into an air raid shelter and then after the war it was turned back into a gas chamber so that people would know of what happened. 
I can't know if it was either a gas chamber &gt; air raid shelter &gt; recreation of a gas chamber or just an air raid shelter &gt; recreation of a gas chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make of that what you will. Something that might seem set in stone and unchangable might just be an indication of how you percieve it moreso than how it actually is.

       Evolution is not a law in science. People can and should still question it.

       There are many questions I have now myself (and I used to be a hardcore evolutionist). BTW I still believe in evolution but there are many questions that have not been answered.

       Weren't you calling people shills for "shoving one false narrative down our throats at any one time"?  Doesn't sound like a set up for a debate, when you are blanket dismissing people's post that go against you own narrative.

       These are basically some of the tenets giving cause for the foundation of this nation -
       <em>
        italics
       </em>
       allegedly [very often in politics, as i'm sure you know, the reasons presented are often masks for the underlying truths].
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I decided I wanted to be a cannibal, or arrived at the conclusion that kumquats are really aubergines. Sometimes some things are just plain wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic and facts trumps feelings every single time. That the root of the trouble in this country at the moment: "muh feelings" superseding logic and reason. That only leads to a lifetime ride on the shortbus.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take: We're sort of supposed to evolve intellectually as well as spiritually [our consciousness, spirit, whatever you want to call it], but some like this muck we're mired in &amp; want to stay - devolution, actually; actual degenerates.

       Poor analogy, also many things that are being scrutinised and addressed by members of the public who you chastise for following "theh feelings" aren't best answerable by logic and facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic and facts (manifested in the shape of a banker or politician) told us that we are supposedly making the worst of moves by choosing to leave the EU. Now that i've spent enough time after the vote to learn more i'm very glad the choice was made to leave.
      </p>

       I believe you when you said that we're supposed to evolve intellectually as well as spiritually but those that we might consider to be degenerate right now might not be the really degenerate ones. I would rather sit all night in a thieves den or getting high with a benefit scrounger than take the nicest of teas with an upper class aristocrat.

       by degenerate, i meant 'to unform, move backwards; regressiveness' in the context of things remaining essentially the same culturally [society, over the last 20 years or so], but emotionally and intellectually, by and large, stagnating, even devolving into something more primitive.

       Yes i like the word stagnating. I think that works very well. Being primitive i reckon is fine though; it relates to an empty mind and an empty mind can only act geniunely because it isn't trying to overthink and get in it's own way.

       Because discussion
       <em>
        itself

       is the end goal, not finding the truth. Endless discussion is a powerful weapon - it can be used to deflect, distract, delay, muddy the waters, and win elections. If you can make the goal posts into a perpetual motion machine, then you'll always be the one in control.

       Every time climate change is brought upsets all supposed too live in some hellscape on earth within like 15-20 years. But it hasn't happened.

       Too be fair, knowing about climate change and knowing about the specific timeline/effects/causes of it are two very different things. Science conclusively proves our climate is changing, but new date shows up seemingly every year that muddles the timeline, the effects, and the causes. For example, a definite split of scientists do believe that climate change is inevitable, given earth's loooong history of climate shifts, and that it's not necessarily humanity's fault it's happening and our effects are relatively negligable. Then there are others who believe that the effects of climate change will continue to be minute and that by the time things get serious, we'll either be long gone or so advanced that it won't matter. (I do believe in this last theory, personally)

       Agreed. I was just telling someone today that the ACLU in defense of free speech, should have teeth and
       <em>
        should be something guaranteed to be funded as part of the US government
       </em>
       and should have in its mandate the expectation that it will both critique and defend.
