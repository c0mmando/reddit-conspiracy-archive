       FYI they are mass-banning people at T_D right now because Trump supporters are Protesting why Trump betrayed them by Firing Bannon who is an Anti-War Economic Nationalist and Populist hero from Breitbart. Bannon was /ourguy/ inside the White House. Now hes gone forever. Also, Massive Censorship over at T_D that makes Communist China look like Freedom Heaven. To save face, they are saying that Bannon "resigned" a week ago. That is FALSE. He was fired this morning, right after having breakfast. They kicked him out of the White House like a fucking dog.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large chunk of Trump's base is now furious over this, and is about to leave him forever. Seriously. This was his fatal mistake Firing Steve Bannon, now there will be a large Exodus of Trump fans who will leave him, his base will dwindle down, his approval ratings will soon be in the low 20s or high teens. Nobody will go to his rallies or vote for him anymore. He betrayed his base today. Its all over folks. He betrayed us all.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Im now going back to supporting Rand Paul in the 2020 Republican Primary. He is the only one who won't cheat us.

       I don't like Trump or Bannon, but I was fine with his position once he was removed from the NSC. Presidents should be allowed to have political strategists, but politics should not intersect with national security.

       Agreed. I had no problem with his position. I did not like that he was on the NSC but that was fixed. I'm happy as hell that he is gone though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am getting quite concerned that the national security advisor, secdef and chief of staff are all former high ranking generals. They are cleaning house of Trump loyalists and consolitating power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm am not comfortable having a white house full of high ranking military generals. I'm already furious over the insane amount spening on our military and this is not going to help imo.

       Bannon is an overt racist and was extremely influential in helping to normalise the white supremacist movement that caused Heather Meyer's murder. Racist extremist are very disappointed that
       <em>
        their guy
       </em>
       is no longer going to be whispering Nazi rhetoric to Trump.

       Can you provide proof that Bannon is actually racist? No offense but I see this thrown around all the time and I'm not really able to find anything that he has said or done that is racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it guilt by association because Nazi's for a really weird reason like any sort of nationalist policy?

       Generally the explanation is that Breitbart branded itself as the "platform for the alt-right". And the alt-right is pretty damn racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's... mostly just that guilt by association, barring some stuff his ex-wife said he'd said about Jews. And that Breitbart had an entire search category for "black crime".

       It's all the people who try to paint the right as Nazis, who attack Trump all day using everything to his preference in steak to every little action he takes, each one reeking of deperation. They have a lot of names. Some people call them TPTB, the (((media))), Zionists, some people say it's just Jews for that matter, Illuminati, Masons, Bilderberg, etc. It's too simple to call them "lefties"; lefties are their sheep dogs. I call them legion.

       Bannon said himself he would not be around for the full tenure. Just like we squawk for term limits, a revolving door for cabinet members and advisors is actually preferable. Hewas a loyal soldier, but there are more staunch conservatives available to keep the train on track

       They just tag negative stories of Trump with [Repost] or put it in contest mode. At least T_D admits to stifling dissenting opinion.

       This sub certainly isn't TD2 as many would have people who surf our threads from r/all believe, but it is worth noting the type of censorship that is forming their particular narrative at any given point which is then swiftly downvoted when it creeps into this sub.

       I am pretty much a Trump supporter and I don't care. I don't think actual real people hang out on that sub. I sure don't. I know the anti-Trump people think they can stoke division in the pro-Trump people over Bannon, but they don't realize he is not important.

       What they do is pretty standard for any subreddit that supports a political candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start spouting off reasons that candidate B is better than candidate A in the subreddit for supporters of candidate A, you are going to be seen as trolling, no matter how good or bad your arguments may be.

       It's really weird how hard it has gotten, people who were willing to criticize the DNC a year or 2 ago won't even discuss it without attacking you as a Trump supporter.  On the other side, you can't point out Trumps faults without being labeled a leftist or Hillary supporter.  I'm neither and I still see myself getting pulled into it polarized debates.  It's a crazy time we live in forsure.

       No one on T_D cares that Bannon got canned. They all think its a 4d chess game. It might be, if Brietbart starts maling moves they are right... but if not this probably a simple disagreement like many expect.

       I got banned from there a long time ago. Anyways this news about Bannon is intresting. Bannon is a very strong nationalist and his plan to restore the middle class by restoring those outsourced jobs  aligned very well with Trumps agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what happened to cause the split. As a person who voted for Trump I'm starting to wonder if the globalist cabal is just too much for even the president handle. Perhaps a one world government is inevitable since it appears that anyone with some semblance power in DC, is somehow beholden to some powerful multinational interest.

       If you believe there was an internal coup and that trump is following orders of his military generals, then it almost makes sense why he was fired. I've heard that trump doesn't even have access to his personal phone anymore but that is probably hearsay.

       In surprised this theory isn't explored more. He's literally surrounded by generals and they seem to be enacting the day to day agenda.

       Perhaps you're  right. Last November when it was either him or Hillary, the choice to me was pretty clear. She was 100% establisment/status quo/ NWO and he was the X factor that neither the left or right wanted to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to a lot of conspiracy posters that share the same view as you, that he's been a plant the whole time. I guess I would be more convinced of this notion if the media and major power brokers like Soros and the Koch bros weren't actively working together in an all out effort to stop him at every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that I see him failing to push his agenda forward I am left wondering if it perhaps it  was indeed all for show. It would be pretty amazing if it was, considering how real the animosity seems between him and his major critics on the hill. Then again I  guess that would explain why he let off pursuing Hillary after the election. Time will tell.

       I have seriously mixed feelings about the guy. Yes, I agreed 100% with his populist message of bringing back middle class jobs and fixing the unfair trade policies with China. However, he was also clearly a racist and played by many of the key elements of the authoritarian playbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       He loved the Charlottesville murder news because it keeps us focused on racism and racial issues. Fuck that shit. This kind of divisive politics is going to tear our nation apart. No one wins.

       There is nothing anyone can do to "bring back" middle class jobs. Our economy is intertwined with Mexico, Vietnam, China, Laos and all those little countries that use slave labor.

       This is the truth and people who can't understand that are honestly small-minded, pea-brained people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot have both: either you want manufacturing jobs or you want the easy, luxurious, middle class lifestyle you as an American are accustomed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot have both. Either things are manufactured in America and A. They pay American wages and you can no longer afford computers, cars, homes etc
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are manufactured in America and we abolish minimum wage jobs and people are paid shit wages and you can't afford to buy any of the things you're creating like all the people in the developing world where our bullshit commodities are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       These "middle America" red-state, rust-belt morons can't understand that, or don't want to. They're idiots who would rather swallow feel-good buzzwords and lies than do any actual critical thinking.

       Maybe it's because bannon pushed the white national platform a little too hard and ended up losing the support of the average American.  Basically the racism became impossible to ignore and explain away.

       Watch his poll numbers and his approval rating in the following 2 weeks. There will be a MASSIVE DROP in his numbers to the lower 20s or high teens, because a huge chunk of his base will leave him now that he kicked out Breitbart.com's Steve Bannon, an economic nationalist populist conservative. Breitbart and its affiliates have millions of avid loyal followers. They will not follow Trump blindly like zombies. They will all go back to Rand Paul, like me.

       Bannon can advise him just as well from the outside, sometimes better, since he's not under as much scrutiny.

       The real question is why they did this and why now. Is Bannon going to start publishing something on Breitbart that he wouldn't be able to do while still in an official position?

       I don't particularly like Bannon, but I do think he's a very smart strategist. I don't feel betrayed by him being fired. I am curious why he was fired. If Trump were under attack, he would keep Bannon closer, not push him away. I suspect something large is coming soon.

       Ok, so I checked and the only unusual stories on Breitbart are a piece calling Bill Clinton a sexual predator (comparing statues of him to status of Confederates) and a story about Chelsea Clinton tweeting about Lucifer being bad and then Ryan Adams defending Lucifer.

       Trump supporters don't rely on polls. I think we have a fox in the henhouse here folks ^ don't listen to this guys lies and narrative. He is also good buddies with /u./TrumpRusConspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal here is to diminish support for Trump as much as possible either to get an impeachment or to get control again in 2018. Don't listen to these people they use every firing, tweet, controversy to claim that there is a mass exodus because they NEED THAT TO HAPPEN. They are pushing so hard right now and if we don't budge they will take it to war until we are so beat down we don't give a fuck what establishment puppet they cram into office.

       Calling him a Nazi apologist is part of the alt-left disinformation campaign. He (and I) both acknowledge that there were good and bad people on both sides. Antifa on the left and KKK/Neo-Nazis on the right. There were good people protesting the removal of the confederate memorials too. Antifa did some disgusting things to them too... unprovoked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone who supported keeping those statues in Charlottesville was, a Nazi, KKK, White-Supremacist, etc. Yes, some were, but there were good and bad people on both sides. There are people like me who HATE having the KKK/Nazis/White Supremecists associated with any of their beliefs, but we cannot control those vocal idiots. It is much the same way that the peaceful lefties who protest G-7 every year get coopted by the Anarchists that show up and just start burning cars. Let me tell you there are some real "pieces of shit" on both sides. I'm looking at Antifa thugs like this guy (and the guys who defended him and lied to the police) at the Charolettesville rally who flat out sucker punched someone for saying they were not a Nazi.

       Who is the good guy and who is the bad guy in this video. Is not a peaceful "Good Person" being punched in the face by a thug for no reason? Is this not textbook terrorism by the left, violent intimidation to affect political belief?

       This is what Trump means by there being good people and bad people on both sides.

       Your line of thought is leading us down the path to civil war. Trump had enough votes to win the election, and I suspect will have even more votes in congress in 2018. I honestly think the media portrayal of 99% of Americans being upset with Trump not being reflected in the 2018 election will be a source of great civil strive when folks like you do not have your wild bias confirmed by an election victory.

       Bannon is CIA trained, which means he is probably a New World Order globalist.  I noticed the other day that his wiki page was edited to remove the reference to his training as a diplomat, which is cover for being CIA.  I suspect that Bannon was betraying Trump, and Trump caught him.  Same thing with the others that were fired or resigned.

       My understanding is that Trump has been rolling up the people who are leaking information.  Flynn is helping in this regard.

       Hmmmm... Interesting.  It seems like Bannon is saying the right things about China and economic Nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO globalists eviscerated US manufacturing, and turned China into an economic giant.  They betrayed the American workers by giving these jobs and money to Communists.
      </p>
      <p>
       From that article, I would say that Bannon is not a New World Order globalist.  LOL.

       I think wall st has convinced Trump he doesn't understand global trade, which he doesn't. And that's why Trump is a terrible fucking president and the terrible representative of the people. He's just a tool with a big ego.

       I think that Trump walked into the White House not really knowing how it all works.  Why would he?  He is a first time politician, and he is not a lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I honestly believe that Hillary would have been much worse.  I think that Trump is good in the sense that he is pissing off all the people that I am against.  I would be more worried if the MSM was positive towards him.

       Bannon has also suggested taxing the rich, starting a trade war with China, and pulling out of the middle east. Good or bad, Bannon is an agent for change.
       <br/>
       He also recently called white nationalists a bunch of clowns.

       Thats why he was /ourguy/. Trump kicked him out. He betrayed his base of supporters. Now a huge chunk of them will leave him and never vote for him ever again. If you cant see that he betrayed you, then you are blind.

       But wouldn't they know this would get them banned? I've only twice had a cursory look at The_Donald and know if you ever disagree with anything it's a ban. This dosen't make common sense unless they were posting in protest knowing it will be removed and they will get the hammer.

       I'm not a Trump supporter and look in T_D like once every two months but I wouldn't exactly call him a fascist. What exactly does a fascist administration look like to you? Is it because he is deporting people who aren't actually citizens?

       I think he talks like a drunk incoherent 90 year old on xanax bars but not a fascist.

       First you're wrong. Here's a quote from the article.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More puzzling is the fact that Bannon would phone a writer and editor of a progressive publication

       Again you're wrong. Doesn't say anything remotely close to that.

       The Paul's are just as ingrained in the political infrastructure as anyone else. I appreciate Rand and Ron Paul, but they have so many family members in the political world that one can question their motives too. Ultimately, Rand Paul may be the candidate I support but I will be doing my own due diligence.

       Even though you can see the results of a conspiracy doesn't not make it a conspiracy.  Are the mods not working together in secret to ban users?  I would consider it harmful to die hard T_D's subscribers to be banned for being critical of someone they supported.  Fit's the definition of conspiracy for me!

       They do have a rule called "concerned trolling" which might why people have been banned??

       Have you read the rules of T_D??? It specifically states ONLY POST IF YOU SUPPORT TRUMP! There are literally hundreds of Reddit subs where you can hate on Trump all you want. T_D is and always has been a rally/support forum. If you go in there guns blazing, yes you will get banned, AS PER THEIR RULES!!

       There is a huge difference between veing critical of someone while being a supporter and out right attacking them.  The fact you support removing any critical debate about someone who they supported is mind blowing and ignorant.

       There is Ask the Donald for public debate. There are all kinds of different forums on here and each one has specific rules to abide by. T_D has already been censored and banned from reaching the front page and r/all. Everyone there has to be "extra" careful so we don't lose our sub, unlike all the other dom/reddits that are allowed..pedophilia, cannibalism, perfectly acceptable. Support the President and we get banned, censored, threatened, so please understand we enjoy our little corner and have no use for anyone who is looking for a fight. And that's what happens.

       Look, if I'm going to criticize a sub like r/news for censoring the Awan story, I'm sure as shit going to point out T_D removes any criticism of Trump.  I don't give a shit what the rules say, grow a back bone.

       You see what ShareBlue does to this sub, you can only imagine what they would do and try to do with ours. T_D is our fun place, but you don't get to dictate the rules because you feel like criticizing something. As I said, you can do that in a couple hundred thread on Reddit. You don't get to do it in T_D. It sounds like you specifically want to go in there and debate, criticize, mock etc but sorry, it's not the place to do that.

       Yes, T_D is a support/rally forum, it is not a debate forum. You are free to debate, criticize, call Trump whatever you want, but not in a forum that is specifically set up as one that supports POTUS.

       I'd like you to answer why you should be allowed to break the rules of a sub? No government is saying you can't criticize the president, a support forum is. (I actually don't care, but I'm bored and don't mind debating this)

       Don't conflate rules on an internet forum with governing. I think you have something you want to say to the people who comment in T_D and you may very well be correct in your criticism but it is just not the place to do it! You don't get the rules changed to suit your feelings. It's a place to shitpost, make fun of liberals, make silly, fun memes, what we don't want to do there is argue with people. It's really quite as simple as that.

       The more compelling question here is why would a (large) group of people want to participate in a forum where such strict thought-policing occurs? There are a lot of things I'm very enthusiastic about, none of them would ever inspire me to hang out on a forum where only positive things about that topic are allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that ANY level of criticism damages your 'safe space' so easily that it's banned is DISTURBING. How fragile does the echo-chamber need to be to absolutely disallow anything even remotely critical?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your question is "Why should you be allowed to break the rules of a sub?" - I think the much more important question is "Why would anyone want to participate in a sub with such insanely restrictive rules?".

       This is some crazy thinking, you require blind support of his supporters.  If anything, I would expect someone who supported Trump to be even more critical since they are the ones that got him in office.  North Korea also requires blind support of their leader as well.

       Once again, my point is the mods of the Donald are conspiring to remove any criticism of Trump.  I'd take it even farther and say the sub is creating blind followers like yourself who feel if you take issue with one aspect of Trumps Administration you aren't a supporter.

       It's not conspiring if it's in the side bar every user sees so your point is moot. It's not a conspiracy. It's open knowledge and the only people with an issue are the people who wants to criticize trump in a (by definition) a safe space sub for the Donald.

       Yes it is, the mods, who by the way created the rules, now get to judge where in the sand comments get deleted and users get banned (hence this post).  Angry supports who may not have anything that bad, but we don't know.  Look Look I get it, you want to protect your comminity from the shit of r/politics &amp; CTR shit, I understand more than you know.  I've been on this sub since the beginning, we've had entire communities built around fucking with this place, just like your sub.  But to sit and act like we shouldn't talk about the mods 'conspiring' to cause 'harm' by banning users on a day that Steve Bannon is fucking nuts.  The more you guys keep coming out of the wood to defend the mods actions, the more my analogy of North Korea seems to fit:
* The mods = extra fat Kim Jong Un
* Trump supporter = NK peasants 
* And the mods just mass executed a bunch of you for not being supportive enough during a hard time.

       That wasn't an insult, that was a real analysis/criticism of your point of view with regards to T_D's mods and feeling the need to defend them in a seperate sub... probably because you'll get banned if it happened there.  I know I would be pissed if r/conspiracy started banning people for pointing out flaws in a conspiracy.   Enjoy the perfect echo chamber.

       Thats why he was /ourguy/. Trump kicked him out. He betrayed his base of supporters. Now a huge chunk of them will leave him and never vote for him ever again. If you cant see that he betrayed you, then you are blind.

       What they do is pretty standard for any subreddit that supports a political candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start spouting off reasons that candidate B is better than candidate A in the subreddit for supporters of candidate A, you are going to be seen as trolling, no matter how good or bad your arguments may be.

       So by firing him does this mean Trump is against those things?

       Don't conflate rules on an internet forum with governing. I think you have something you want to say to the people who comment in T_D and you may very well be correct in your criticism but it is just not the place to do it! You don't get the rules changed to suit your feelings. It's a place to shitpost, make fun of liberals, make silly, fun memes, what we don't want to do there is argue with people. It's really quite as simple as that.
