My guess is that the Kelly/Mattis/McMaster wing thought keeping Bannon on after the recent controversies would be bad optics so they forced him out. Curious to hear people&#39;s thoughts about what could be going on behind the scenes here.</p>

<p>Edit: as an update it looks like Sarah Huckabee Sanders is saying that Bannon and John Kelly &quot;mutually agreed that today is Steve&#39;s last day&quot; So seems like it was one of those &quot;quit or be fired&quot; situations and they agreed today would be his last day.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Here is the story from Breitbart: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/18/steve-bannon-out-white-house/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/18/steve-bannon-out-white-house/</a> It also indicates that Bannon submitted his resignation August 7, after there had been some discussion that he should be dismissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is my number one question. I am REALLY curious to see how Breitbart reacts. I know that Bannon took a &quot;leave of absence&quot; or whatever but I think he is still running the show there. If he is pissed about his termination then wonder if he will hit back. It is possible he has some dirt on people in the White House which could come out.</p>

<p>it&#39;s 100% certain.  I&#39;m skeptical that Bannon will turn on him, but I guarantee Bannon has piles of dirt if necessary.  We&#39;ll see if Bannon stays true to his dream of tearing the system down</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bannon is not an idiot. He did that on purpose. For what specific purpose or reasoning is up in the air, but it reeks of orchestrated and planned.</p>

<p>Bannon and Brietbart is just going to go hardcore against any enemies of Trump, which includes both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on how much of their lives are orchestrated. The Mooch just this last week on Colbert was saying the president should fire Bannonbart. Either the Mooch did come in as planned to take out Prebius and Bannon or the Mooch really did find the leakers and it makes sense it was those two.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched some of Bannon&#39;s docs and seen two of his speeches. He would seem to hate a guy like Trump tbh. It&#39;s entirely possible that guy was right when Bannon supposedly told him that Bannon himself was a &quot;Leninist&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;There are no morals in politics; there is only expedience. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel&quot;</p>

<p>If Bannon is indeed &quot;trying to suck his own cock&quot;. Getting fired from the position that gave him a shadow position to run a state propaganda news outlet has gotta sting. Really though if you read Breitbart, I have them on my facebook for the comments section, nothing will change for them. If they ever went against Trump they&#39;d lose everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess the opposite. Bannon can now publish anything he wants on Breitbart without fear of it being attached to him as a White House official. I just can&#39;t figure what he was holding back on, that now he can publish. A more anti-left stance on Charlottesville that will be labeled as pro-Nazi by MSM?</p>

<p>This is assuming he left somewhat amicably. If McMasters and Kelly forced him out and Trump sided with them, Bannon may change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. That is kind of strange and seemingly at odds with what has been reported. From what I have seen (and this is from many MSM outlets so do take it with a grain of salt) Trump &quot;decided to remove Bannon.&quot; So it is weird that Bannon would say he resigned two weeks ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with your theory, it was likely about optics. A few other thoughts, though.</p>

<p>McMaster and Kelly are deep state and forced Bannon out. This wouldn&#39;t bode well for Mattis being a good guy. I don&#39;t really think this is the case, since the call was ultimately Trump&#39;s.</p>

<p>Bannon could be getting ready to publish something, be it evidence or an opinion/narrative, on Breitbart that he would get too much flak for if still in official capacity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a distraction. The Purple Revolution has begun in earnest, Assange hinted at such and recently turned over information to a congresswoman to give to Trump. Movements are happening in the background, and this is cover to distract from something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the White House knew that Unite the Right was bait before-hand, he could have resigned a few days ahead of time to make sure Bannon was ahead of any fallout. August 7 was also pretty shortly after Kelly got up and running, I bet he was putting pressure to drop him. Bannon will probably get a longer leash and be able to do whatever he wants without the backlash being immediately attached to Trump. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope he keeps up with his &quot;alt-right are clowns&quot; style rather than sparking tensions more than they need to be right now. Making a big move towards re-energizing the far right will tear his &#39;economic nationalism&#39; apart if civil tensions start to upset the economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Bannon, the Breitbart/GS &quot;neo-nazi,&quot; &quot;secretly resigned&quot; a week before Charlottesville?</p>
