<p>You&#39;re right. Unless they are a bigot. With your example, I believe those statistics are real, but there are other statistics and facts that show why that statistic doesn&#39;t speak towards genetics but other factors. If you refuse to hear and consider those things, then you&#39;ve a confirmation bias issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes those accusations are true about you even if you don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m a lefty and I can point out to other liberals that they aren&#39;t as evolved as they think because their communities and schools are more segregated than the south. That&#39;s institutional racism. They don&#39;t think they&#39;re supporting racism, but they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PC is ridiculous and it&#39;s destroying intelligence. Consider this when someone says something and someone else replies with negativity, that negativity is actually intelligence. </p>

<p>Obviously we have to avoid negative negativity which is just being negative for the sake of being negative but for the most part negativity is intelligence. </p>

<p>With this new era of PC we constantly have to be polite and positive and there isn&#39;t anything wrong with those attributes but let&#39;s face it if someone has something to say they should be able to be frank, direct and right to the point. None of this beating around the bush bullshit to protect everyone&#39;s feelings. </p>
