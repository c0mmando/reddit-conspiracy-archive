        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Both subreddits are the most popular socialist subreddits, and both are much more than just socialist subreddits. They also believe in white knighting, they are anti-cops, they literally just had a post today that just said to take away prisons as if it were a meme, all things reddit is mostly opposed to, and are just ridiculous ideas that have nothing to do with socialism or communism. Why would they take a losing battle filled where people simply believe it&#39;s the best thing to help other people, and turn it&#39;s subreddits into this bullshit? I know tons and tons of mature people who believe we need more socialistic ideas, and none of them believe what either of those subreddits are doing is ok. Who would want to stop socialism and communism more than the people that benefit most from capitalism? Reddit is a huge platform, and those two subreddits have become a joke to the rest of reddit, why would any mature, half-way intelligent human being push people away from their cause to push some other bullshit agendas? Like I said, of all the socialists and communists I&#39;ve met, none of them agree with what that subreddit believes in besides the fact that the rich do everything in their power to keep the poor down, which is an undeniable truth.</p>

<p>Agree or disagree with socialism and communism all you want, I for one think communism is insane to suggest in the world we currently live in, but what they are doing just makes no sense unless they want people to not believe in their ideas.</p>

Marx didn&#39;t come up with anything, just put his name on it. Fun fact, Marx had Rothschild relatives, and married into royalty...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>please remember this, because it might be really important one day.</p>

<p>if you ever wake up and find men with hoses in your burning apartment, please consider that they might not be merely intruders, or &quot;infiltrators&quot; trying to steal your fine collection of goods using some new water weapon device.</p>

<p>it could be that they actually mean you no harm, and they may in fact be the only people able to help you escape the inferno.. </p>

<p>sure, if they only seem interested in knowing where you keep the non flammable, high value items, then i guess it could actually be some kind of elaborate heist, but before you reach for the 12 gauge, have a little think first.</p>
