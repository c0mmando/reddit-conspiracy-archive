 Sure when you have a crowed of 15,000 some people will get out of hand. But as the <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/347237-boston-police-commissioner-999-percent-of-protesters-here-for">Boston Police Commissioner said</a></p>

<p>15,000 protesters and praise from the  Police Commissioner. Keep spreading your lies and fake news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude there is video.  A lot of those people came together for free speech, a lot of them came together for antifa to shut free speech down, very few came together for Nazism because that has never been a big group here.</p>

<p>I never said &quot;a dozen or so&quot; bad actors represent 15,000 people.  Antifa also doesn&#39;t represent 15,000 people and Nazism doesn&#39;t represent everything on the right.  Get over it.  Charlottesville was a Trainwreck because they funnelled all the bad actors from both sides into the same spot.  Trump told the truth about the violence coming from both sides.</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally videos of everything, good and bad.  Everyone can see it for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lighting is deceptive. There are plenty of pictures where she is as brown as many Mexicans are. And then iff you think Mexican&#39;s are white, then Trump is racist towards white people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really trying to make race an issue here. Just pointing out that the media has a field day trying to craft a narrative that Trump is racist. When they could just as well craft a narrative that he is racist towards white people or anything equally as stupid. He&#39;s definitely a nationalist, but other than that there isn&#39;t a good case that he&#39;s racist.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s wife is Slavic, his daughter is Jewish. These were the two nearby &quot;races&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavic_sentiment">despised by Hitler</a> the most. Which makes it ridiculous to compare Trump with Hitler.</p>

<p>Evidently it is a joke on the part of the central planners. Trump, for all intents and purposes, is Jewish himself; causing gullible fools to make that comparison is fun for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s subjective, the news says she&#39;s white because it fits their narrative. Many people would say she isn&#39;t white.</p>

<p>White sometimes just refers to skin color and not ethnic decent.
If she&#39;s white then Mexicans are white also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ridiculous. It&#39;s all the media has left. Which makes me think, if the majority of the media is owned by evil Jews as some of this sub will blindly copy and paste, why is trump portrayed an anti-Semite or a neo nazi??</p>

<p>1986: trump receives Ellis island Medal of Honor with Rosa parks</p>

<p>1991: trump says he &quot;hates seeing&quot; what David duke represents</p>

<p>1997: anti defamation league president praises trump for tackling the issue of discrimination at private clubs (trump opened his private gulf clubs to blacks and Jews which was unheard of. The clintons were members at an all white club)</p>

<p>2000: trump calls David duke a bigot and a racist </p>

<p>2008: trump shelters Jennifer Hudson after her family was murdered</p>

<p>2015: trump says he doesn&#39;t want David dukes support</p>

Duke was. It&#39;s so easy to say fuck the nazis who support me. But even that took him 2 days. He clearly thinks everyone who supports him is awesome, even the racist pieces of shit that love him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was damn weird - my guess is that it was a mini temper-tantrum because he thought it was insulting to have to disavow again. He dropped out in 2000 bc Duke and Buchanan got involved in Reform Party, so it was obviously a lie, but he&#39;s also obviously more than media savvy enough to know that Duke is about as toxic as hating puppies. </p>
