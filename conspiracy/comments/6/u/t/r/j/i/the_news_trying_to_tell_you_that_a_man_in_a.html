       The news is telling people, because that's what happened. I know, I was there. There were cameras everywhere, but no real footage of this so called "violent left", because the protest was peaceful.
 Sure when you have a crowed of 15,000 some people will get out of hand. But as the

       They were clearly there and violent, the police e did a great job keeping it to a minimum but there are thousands of Livestreams from the even showing masked hoodlums being violent dicks, antagonising the police or anyone holding an American flag.

       Dude there is video.  A lot of those people came together for free speech, a lot of them came together for antifa to shut free speech down, very few came together for Nazism because that has never been a big group here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said "a dozen or so" bad actors represent 15,000 people.  Antifa also doesn't represent 15,000 people and Nazism doesn't represent everything on the right.  Get over it.  Charlottesville was a Trainwreck because they funnelled all the bad actors from both sides into the same spot.  Trump told the truth about the violence coming from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally videos of everything, good and bad.  Everyone can see it for themselves.

       Sorry I didn't get a PhD in race studies. She just doesn't look what most people would think of as a white person. Not that it's important but the point is that the news media doesn't view it that way because it doesn't suit their interest.

       Anyone who wants to criticize Trump and has slightly brown colored skin can claim authority on whether Trump's a racist, but they don't care about his wife at all.

       The lighting is deceptive. There are plenty of pictures where she is as brown as many Mexicans are. And then iff you think Mexican's are white, then Trump is racist towards white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really trying to make race an issue here. Just pointing out that the media has a field day trying to craft a narrative that Trump is racist. When they could just as well craft a narrative that he is racist towards white people or anything equally as stupid. He's definitely a nationalist, but other than that there isn't a good case that he's racist.

       Trump's wife is Slavic, his daughter is Jewish. These were the two nearby "races"

       the most. Which makes it ridiculous to compare Trump with Hitler.

       Evidently it is a joke on the part of the central planners. Trump, for all intents and purposes, is Jewish himself; causing gullible fools to make that comparison is fun for them.

       It's subjective, the news says she's white because it fits their narrative. Many people would say she isn't white.

       It's ridiculous. It's all the media has left. Which makes me think, if the majority of the media is owned by evil Jews as some of this sub will blindly copy and paste, why is trump portrayed an anti-Semite or a neo nazi??

         Three times in a row on Feb. 28, Trump sidestepped opportunities to renounce white nationalist and former KKK leader David Duke, who told his radio audience last week that voting for any candidate other than Trump is “really treason to your heritage.”

       Maybe he should handle these softballs better when ever they come up. The dude pretended he didn't know who David d
Duke was. It's so easy to say fuck the nazis who support me. But even that took him 2 days. He clearly thinks everyone who supports him is awesome, even the racist pieces of shit that love him.

       That was damn weird - my guess is that it was a mini temper-tantrum because he thought it was insulting to have to disavow again. He dropped out in 2000 bc Duke and Buchanan got involved in Reform Party, so it was obviously a lie, but he's also obviously more than media savvy enough to know that Duke is about as toxic as hating puppies.

       Oops. Still would you say Irish and Dutch are the same race? How about African and Jamaican? Just because people are the same color doesn't mean they are the same race. Psh racist. /s

       Seriously tho we all humans. Human race. All one but not the same.
