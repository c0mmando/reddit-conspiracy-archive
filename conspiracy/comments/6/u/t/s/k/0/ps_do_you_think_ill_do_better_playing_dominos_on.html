<p>Turns out it that quote was from a Bankster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Sandler">Herbert Sandler</a> who was CEO of the second largest Savings and Loan bank in the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_West_Financial">Golden West Financial</a> with his wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Sandler">Marion Sandler</a>.</p>

<p><strong>25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis - Marion and Herb Sandler</strong></p>

<p><em>In the early 1980s, the Sandlers&#39; World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to back-load your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed $2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings&#39; loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo.</em></p>

<p>The email also says &quot;I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.&quot;  </p>

<p>The date of the email is December 24th, 2015, which is Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>If you look at the Satanic calendar, it is customary to receive a gift of body parts of a male infant.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always nice to see another voice of reason, but it feels like a lost cause. When someone sees an email from Christmas, thanking a person for a box of cheese, and wondering if they&#39;ll play dominos better after having eaten cheese instead of pasta, and that someone assumes &#39;pedophile&#39; or &#39;children&#39;s body parts, reasoning with them doesn&#39;t seem likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, it should not hurt to offer alternative explanations for people to think about.  I did not say that my explanation was the correct one.  </p>

<p>You mischaracterize what the email says.  Herb asks about playing dominos ON cheese rather than on pasta.  </p>

<p>Dominoes is the game you refer to, not dominos.  Could it be a mispelling?  Of course.  But, look up domino and domino mask.  If Herb&#39;s spelling is correct, then the meaning makes more sense and it is much darker.  </p>

<p>Saying &quot;Should I play dominoes on cheese or pasta?&quot; does not make sense.   </p>

<p>Saying &quot;Should I play dominos on cheese or pasta?&quot; does make sense according to the pedo code.  </p>

<p>I hope you can ponder these ideas without attacking the messenger.  That does not help.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, i am sure you are an intelligent person.  I don&#39;t want you to tell me I am right.  Just consider the explanation.  </p>

<p>Wikileaks has released about 1% of what they have.  They were going to drop the truth bomb after Hillary won, but she lost so they held back.  I am sure Wikileaks has the true and correct explanation.  </p>

<p>To answer your question, pasta is a little boy and cheese is a little girl, according to the pedo code.  Playing dominos on is dominating.  </p>

<p>Just file all this away for future reference.  If it turns out to be nothing, then so be it.  I honestly hope this interpretation is incorrect, but I have done a lot of researching.  </p>

<li><p>Can you link to any evidence of this being a code or this code being used anywhere else, that is not the same screenshot of 4chan? Literally anything else that predates Pizzagate.</p></li>
<li><p>Even with the code you just explained, that phrase makes no sense. Assuming that, according to you, pasta is a little boy, cheese is a little girl, and playing dominos on is dominating, then what he&#39;s saying is:
&quot;Do you think I’ll do better dominating on little girls than on little boys?&quot;
Which... isn&#39;t how you would say that thought? Why would he repeated &quot;on&quot;, since that doesn&#39;t make sense?</p></li>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot of evidence showing this is simply a stupid joke that makes perfect sense in context, while the code you claim (with no reputable evidence showing it&#39;s real) doesn&#39;t even do that.</p>

<p>If he is using the pedo code, then he is asking Podesta if he will do better dominating a little girl rather than a little boy.  </p>

It would incredibly confusing and no doubt be changed right away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A source predating Pizzagate will be very hard to come by, as you can appreciate.  Unless you are willing to use Tor and risk exploring the deep web.  This question has been asked many times, and it is valid.  I do recall someone posted something months ago, but I do not recall where.  They said that if you say you want your pizza cooked for 5 to 7 minutes, then it is code for your age preference.  </p>

<p>There is this.  They appear to use &quot;slices&quot; to indicate age.  </p>

<p>I can tell you where I&#39;ve seen the code. It was in the post telling me that Pizzagate was real. But I&#39;ve seen nothing to back it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about pizza, because I have seen links that suggest it is a code that date to years before pizzagate, but cheese, pasta, walnut, handkerchief. I heard of all of those for the first time in the same post in which I first learned of Pizzagate. And I believed it, and the claims that FBI documents confirmed the code. </p>

<p>But the only FBI document I&#39;ve seen was about the visual symbols, not any code language. So basically some random poster said &#39;these are code words&#39; then pointed to the emails that contained those words, but I&#39;ve seen nothing to prove that they didn&#39;t start with the emails and just decide some of the words would be code, because they sounded bad in that context.</p>

<p>Yes, but I don&#39;t actively go looking for things to disagree with online. </p>

<p>You&#39;re in a sub for conspiracies. You&#39;re trying to explain away suspect language that ties into the idea of rampant sexual abuse of children, by people high in our government. Which has been one of the biggest potential conspiracies of our time. I guarantee you the authors of the OPs email don&#39;t need you to chime in. 99% of Americans don&#39;t believe/couldn&#39;t give a shit less about the topic the OPs posting about. </p>

<p>So if you want some heart, stick to the mainstream. Next time you&#39;re out with your friends have a chuckle over the idea that sexual abuse of children can happen at the hands of people in the spotlight.</p>

<p>You&#39;re either disingenuous or foolish to constantly spend time here explaining away ridiculous language used in emails. </p>

<p>Such a narrow minded view, to believe that no one reasonable could see what you&#39;ve seen and come to a different conclusion.</p>

<p>I started pizzagate a believer. Then I looked into it on my own, and all the &#39;code word&#39; stuff just fell apart. It&#39;s phrases taken out of context that only seem like code if you go into it believing it&#39;s code.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start PG trying to disprove it. But my own review of the evidence led me to believe it was wrong. I&#39;m not saying there is no pedophilia among the elite, I&#39;m not even saying Podesta isn&#39;t a pedophile. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that there is no convincing evidence in these emails that there is a pedophile circle, or that anything that they said in those emails was secret code.</p>

<p>However, this attitude:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re either disingenuous or foolish </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tells me you have no interest in actually arguing in good faith. You&#39;ve made up your mind and dismissed anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with you, so don&#39;t expect any further response from me.</p>
