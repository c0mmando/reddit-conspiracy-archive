       <em>
        In the early 1980s, the Sandlers' World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to back-load your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed $2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings' loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo.

       I have posted this before, but here it goes again for those that did not see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The email also says "I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them."

       The date of the email is December 24th, 2015, which is Christmas Eve.

       If you look at the Satanic calendar, it is customary to receive a gift of body parts of a male infant.

       yeah, while i the other guy is right about christmas not being an odd time to exchange gifts, there is something off and code-wordy about the pasta/cheese dichotomy. not to mention the whole "I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box" which is weird as fuck

       It's always nice to see another voice of reason, but it feels like a lost cause. When someone sees an email from Christmas, thanking a person for a box of cheese, and wondering if they'll play dominos better after having eaten cheese instead of pasta, and that someone assumes 'pedophile' or 'children's body parts, reasoning with them doesn't seem likely.

       Look, it should not hurt to offer alternative explanations for people to think about.  I did not say that my explanation was the correct one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mischaracterize what the email says.  Herb asks about playing dominos ON cheese rather than on pasta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dominoes is the game you refer to, not dominos.  Could it be a mispelling?  Of course.  But, look up domino and domino mask.  If Herb's spelling is correct, then the meaning makes more sense and it is much darker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying "Should I play dominoes on cheese or pasta?" does not make sense.

       Saying "Should I play dominos on cheese or pasta?" does make sense according to the pedo code.

       It's a stupid joke. The stupid joke is pretending that the cheese or pasta is like a performance enhancing drug. 'Do you think I'll play better at the game of dominos(sic) after having consumed cheese as opposed to after having consumed pasta'.

       Wikileaks has released about 1% of what they have.  They were going to drop the truth bomb after Hillary won, but she lost so they held back.  I am sure Wikileaks has the true and correct explanation.

       To answer your question, pasta is a little boy and cheese is a little girl, according to the pedo code.  Playing dominos on is dominating.

       Just file all this away for future reference.  If it turns out to be nothing, then so be it.  I honestly hope this interpretation is incorrect, but I have done a lot of researching.

         Can you link to any evidence of this being a code or this code being used anywhere else, that is not the same screenshot of 4chan? Literally anything else that predates Pizzagate.

         Even with the code you just explained, that phrase makes no sense. Assuming that, according to you, pasta is a little boy, cheese is a little girl, and playing dominos on is dominating, then what he's saying is:
"Do you think I’ll do better dominating on little girls than on little boys?"
Which... isn't how you would say that thought? Why would he repeated "on", since that doesn't make sense?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There's been a lot of evidence showing this is simply a stupid joke that makes perfect sense in context, while the code you claim (with no reputable evidence showing it's real) doesn't even do that.

       Even if they were existing codewords, not made up by someone on 4chan after pizzagate (which they 100% are and no one has ever been able to provide evidence to the contrary), don't you think it'd be a terrible code to use given this all centers around a pizza shop and a guy with Italian heritage who likes to cook? It would incredibly confusing and no doubt be changed right away.

       A source predating Pizzagate will be very hard to come by, as you can appreciate.  Unless you are willing to use Tor and risk exploring the deep web.  This question has been asked many times, and it is valid.  I do recall someone posted something months ago, but I do not recall where.  They said that if you say you want your pizza cooked for 5 to 7 minutes, then it is code for your age preference.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is this.  They appear to use "slices" to indicate age.

       I can tell you where I've seen the code. It was in the post telling me that Pizzagate was real. But I've seen nothing to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about pizza, because I have seen links that suggest it is a code that date to years before pizzagate, but cheese, pasta, walnut, handkerchief. I heard of all of those for the first time in the same post in which I first learned of Pizzagate. And I believed it, and the claims that FBI documents confirmed the code.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the only FBI document I've seen was about the visual symbols, not any code language. So basically some random poster said 'these are code words' then pointed to the emails that contained those words, but I've seen nothing to prove that they didn't start with the emails and just decide some of the words would be code, because they sounded bad in that context.

       Yes, that is also where I have seen the code, and it proves nothing.  This question has been raised many times, and I am not going to the deep web to look.  I have just seen screen shots of various forums in which the code was allegedly being used.  I do not recall where this post was at.

       Yes, but I don't actively go looking for things to disagree with online.

       You're in a sub for conspiracies. You're trying to explain away suspect language that ties into the idea of rampant sexual abuse of children, by people high in our government. Which has been one of the biggest potential conspiracies of our time. I guarantee you the authors of the OPs email don't need you to chime in. 99% of Americans don't believe/couldn't give a shit less about the topic the OPs posting about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you want some heart, stick to the mainstream. Next time you're out with your friends have a chuckle over the idea that sexual abuse of children can happen at the hands of people in the spotlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're either disingenuous or foolish to constantly spend time here explaining away ridiculous language used in emails.

       Such a narrow minded view, to believe that no one reasonable could see what you've seen and come to a different conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started pizzagate a believer. Then I looked into it on my own, and all the 'code word' stuff just fell apart. It's phrases taken out of context that only seem like code if you go into it believing it's code.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't start PG trying to disprove it. But my own review of the evidence led me to believe it was wrong. I'm not saying there is no pedophilia among the elite, I'm not even saying Podesta isn't a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that there is no convincing evidence in these emails that there is a pedophile circle, or that anything that they said in those emails was secret code.

       The topic could be about any conspiracy. Sexual abuse of children, UFOs, etc. You're in a conspiracy forum telling people there isn't a conspiracy. That's why you're either disingenuous or a fool.

      </p>
      <p>
       I've gone over this so many times, I feel little interest in doing it again, because I've never convinced anyone who already assumed it was pedophilia code, except for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get tired of telling people "nothing to see here" then move on from telling people in a conspiracy forum there isn't a conspiracy.  What I told him isn't gatekeeping, it should be common sense.

       Do you develop strategies while gifting and think the strategy changed once you see the package if it's not in the same box that last year?

       If it was drugs they were really talking about this would all make more sense. Like the emails about "Obama flying in 65 thousand dollars worth of hot dogs" would just be about Obama flying in some coke or something. What if Pizza just means a drug?

       Do you believe they are not Luciferians/Satanists?  There are ex-CIA people saying they are.

       I don't believe that, no. And why are these ex-CIA people trustworthy now? I thought the CIA was the enemy.

       The CIA is the enemy.  One can argue that this is why these people left.  I am referring to Robert David Steele, for one.  I can provide you with his video interview, if you want to watch it.

       I've spent way more time on pizzagate than I'd like. In the pile of videos I've watched and articles I've read, nothing has remotely convinced me. If something difinitive comes out, or even remotely convincing, then I'll certainly check it out. Until then, I'm going to keep ignoring what seems like a completely made up story.

       Greetings!  One of the Satanic commandments is to not hurt the little children.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that these people practice the Babylonian Mystery religion, which somehow includes the Talmud.  People say "Satanism" because it is what everyone understands.  I am still not sure what the difference is between Satanism and Luciferianism.  Perhaps you know...
