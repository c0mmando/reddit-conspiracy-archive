<p>This is one of the few places people will question sources.</p>

<p>Most of us don&#39;t even believe in political parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There came a point in time where everyone who used to call &quot;us&quot; conspiracy theorists as a pejorative got tired of wearing egg on their face (sometime around 2014) and decided to try their hand at CTs (look mah, I&#39;m running with scissors!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is that this sub has more people concerned about larger influences than even the president, any president. And the narrowing of conversation to between parties of a government that&#39;s greatest purpose is to control is exactly the purpose of the parties in the first place, to divide.  Of course politicians conspire and they should
Be held accountable but like in sports you can&#39;t always blame the player when the coach called the play.  We are to shine light on the people who buy these politicians not picking sides of those who sell a line of thought you could agree with. </p>
