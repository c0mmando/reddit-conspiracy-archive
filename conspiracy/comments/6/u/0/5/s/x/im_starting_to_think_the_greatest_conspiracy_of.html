       Conspiracy theorists always keep themselves open to even the tiniest thing that could possibly be perceived as a clue, they don't tend to question websites they've never heard of before or anonymous web board posters, most of them lean pretty far right (at least on this particular sub), and anytime the flow of repeated verbatim influx of threads about the evils of the left wing gets interrupted for a while it isn't long until the dissenting users are shunned and the repetitive narrative flow can be restored.

       Every political party "conspires" to take power. What we're interested in are the ones that will go to any lengths and use any means, including criminal ones that they further conspire to hide and obscure by pinning the blame on someone or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too easy and too trite to write-off any attempts to unravel and get to the bottom of those crimes as simply working for whoever their political opponents happen to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the criminals own first line of defence and it's plain that anyone levelling those accusations is either willingly or unwittingly  trying to help them cover up or for find some means to explain away they actually did.

       the group you define here with terms like 'always' seems pretty narrow and vulnerable which is why many seem to be moving to the more broad term researcher which has its own flavor of shit (eg researchers who present 'data' quickly followed by permitted 'speculation')

       This guy gets it. Russians are weaponizing propagandamaswuerading as conspiracy theories. It's brilliantly diabolical. At the same time they convince a large piece of the conspiracy community that all this Russia stuff is just fake news. Again, brilliant. You have to hand it to them.

       There came a point in time where everyone who used to call "us" conspiracy theorists as a pejorative got tired of wearing egg on their face (sometime around 2014) and decided to try their hand at CTs (look mah, I'm running with scissors!)

       This was the start of the push/pull you sense now.  It's like when Big Bang Theory got popular and all the Stacies bought problem glasses and reduced 80's/90's nerd culture into a fashion statement.

       What I'm saying is that this sub has more people concerned about larger influences than even the president, any president. And the narrowing of conversation to between parties of a government that's greatest purpose is to control is exactly the purpose of the parties in the first place, to divide.  Of course politicians conspire and they should
Be held accountable but like in sports you can't always blame the player when the coach called the play.  We are to shine light on the people who buy these politicians not picking sides of those who sell a line of thought you could agree with.
