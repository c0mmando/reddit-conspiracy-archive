        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me preface this with the fact that I&#39;m genuinely curious, and want to hear what people think. I&#39;m not looking for name calling or fighting, just really want some kind of rational explanation here. Because I&#39;m really depressed by whats happening in our country, a country I love and have sacrificed for. We teach our kids to be good, play nice, be honest, be fair, to treat others how we&#39;d want to be treated, generally do the right thing.....and this is the example we set....marches, rioting, vandalizing....its disgraceful, and as the President said, there is plenty of blame to go around (and I rarely agree with President Trump).</p>

<p>A white man with mental issues drives his car into a crowd of protestors in Virginia, and every media outlet is going on and on about domestic terrorism.....and the media is all about white supremacist being the devil, and a terrorist organization, etc.</p>

<p>But looking back at the ambush killings of cops in Dallas and other places....not a single mention of terrorism. Also, while I don&#39;t endorse or agree with the KKK and other white supremacist groups...how does BLM, ANTIFA, BAMN, and minority groups that blatantly incite violence get a pass?   </p>

<p>It just seems like the media is doing everything they can to divide us at every opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually just googled it, and none of the MSM outlets used the word &quot;terrorism&quot; once that I saw, not for Dallas or any of the other police ambushes.  </p>

<p>Yet all day today all I&#39;ve heard about is the domestic terrorism in Virginia, and now the KKK is being called a terrorist organization in Illinois...which is baffling to me. These white supremacist groups gather, talk, and generally look like stereotypical idiots, but you dont see them looting, burning buildings, etc like the groups I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Those are NOT in the OP. I&#39;m not reading every side convo you have to find what YOU have to prove.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because the KKK since the 1860&#39;s killed people and done so with little to no repercussions.</p>

I posted this last night because I saw the MSM immediately go to terrorism, and it just surprised me.

    <div class="md"><p>No group is fully innocent. They are here to keep us divided and if you just see the geopolitics book of russia, they were supposed to be in this country along with KKK like groups. It is a well planned project. When people in a country can&#39;t trust one another it is bound for a great fall. It requires very less amount of budget, but is highly effective. It always worked. </p>

<p>Honestly speaking, MSM is directly responsible for making people like Trump and his minions. All day and night, since 9/11th they have been doing nothing, but blabbering about war on terrorism. No matter how much they deny that they never mentioned &quot;Islam&quot;, but radical Islam and &quot;Muslim extremists&quot; instead of &quot;Muslims&quot;, majority of the people read it as &quot;Islam&quot;  and &quot;Muslims&quot; only. Once humans begin to be afraid, they will try to take aggressive actions. This gets much worse if they are highly uneducated. Putin just used that. It seems MSM along with Pentagon never imagined that their picnic with war on terrorism was going to backfire this badly. </p>

<p>Trump and people who support him have problematic mentality. They&#39;ll believe in anything that is against any group they hate the most. Even if the news is about criminal activity of only handful of people they want to take action against the entire group. This is the main problem for which MSM won&#39;t touch reports on ANTIFA and BLM. I have also seen that educated people who hate Trump do wish for some groups to attack him and his supporters. They may not go against the law, but if someone else is doing it they probably feel happy inside. </p>

<p>Interestingly, most sectarians trapped by FBI in terrorism crimes also had mental issues, but it was never fully covered by MSM. They have just started talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They divided the country up into two teams, both teams are completely fake, always vote for the oligarchs.</p>

<p>You have to have one team that seems like it&#39;s the smart team to be on for people who are really &quot;woke.&quot; They decided that would be the Republicans.</p>

<p>So they have the news have Democrat bias. But if you really dig deeper, and listen to alternative sources, you&#39;ll see the Republicans are really right. Dig even deeper, and maybe you&#39;ll see the Libertarians, or the Socialists, or left-Marxist Anarchist Bolshevism is really the way.</p>

<p>The point is, it doesn&#39;t matter which ideology you pick, because Congress is a bunch of blackmailed perverts. </p>

<p>And the bankers laugh all the way... well... to the bank.</p>
