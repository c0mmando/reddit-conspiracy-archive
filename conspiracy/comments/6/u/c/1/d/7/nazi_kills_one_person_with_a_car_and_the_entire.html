       Nazi kills one person with a car, and every subreddit on this site has posts about the incident, including completely unrelated subs about comics, movies and music. Every politician and media figure comes out to denounce the ideology of the attacker. The entirety of social media is nothing but this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslim kills 13 people with a car and gets into a shootout with police. 1 post on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       from worldnews. No other posts about the incident, infact right now there are 3 posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       about the "Nazi" narrative, with only one post about this attack. All the people denouncing "hateful ideology" so loudly only a day ago are strangely quiet about this hateful ideology. Surely every politician will line up to denounce this? Surely this will be the subject of every late night show tonight? Will the media push for all muslims to answer for this ideology like they did with white people only a few days ago?

       You usually have a lot of good things to share here. Sad to see you think the MSM has an agenda in this regard. White people, mainly dominating top positions in media, trying to push an agenda against themselves, in favor of people who have nothing to do with them, who don't even have jobs in the same office building?

       You're saying that the MSM
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       have an agenda in regards to Islam? Have you been living under a rock? There is an active campaign to say: #NotAllMuslims. With the Charlottesville incident, they are propagating basically all white conservatives are fascist neo-nazis, and that racism is
       <strong>
        everywhere
       </strong>
       . Even though, we had a Black president for 8 damn years. If you cannot see the agenda, I'm afraid you're a lost cause. Open your eyes, and step outside of bias.

       That's like something a teenager would say. How does the rest of the country feel, who didn't support him? Does their mental state simply assimilate to that of the common whole, and they now love African Americans because their president is black? Of course not.

       Pretty indifferent to the color of his skin, I'd say. Most were pissed off at his ideology and political views, not too mention the shit he passed while in office.  I'm one of those people.

       You are saying the MSM is pushing a pro-Islam anti-white agenda. This suggests one of 2 scenarios:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) TPTB are pro-Muslim and anti-white, despite being mostly white
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The MSM is against TPTB
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you please elaborate?

       According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of America in 2012 was approximately 312 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       That year, President Obama received 65,915,795 votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means that just shy of 21% of the country voted for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That hardly equates to "a pretty good indication" that racism "is not common."

        Why would Poles emigrate to the dirty, Brown filled, country, that is UK -&gt; **however, this was your post, which was quoted by the poster u/ooh-eeh-ooh-ah-ahh20**

    Well, you should ask them, because hundreds of thousands of them already have emigrated there.

       "Why would Poles emigrate to the dirty, Brown filled, country, that is UK"
Using dirty and Brown filled right after one another clearly has 0 implications. In the first place, you downplay the inherent worth of a country because it is filled with browns. Don't be coy, Squeaker. You and I both know what you were getting at.

       But Why?  What agenda?  The MSM is owned by white, christians for the most part.  Why would white Christians push an agenda which according to you, seeks to marginalize white folks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think that all conservatives shouldn't be blamed for the racism they are allowing to flourish within their own party, why do you think that the idea of #NotAllMuslims is some sort of agenda?  It's saying
       <em>
        exactly the same thing
       </em>
       that not all of a particular group (conservatives, muslims) are responsible or should be blamed for the actions of a few radicals (nazi terrorists, islamist terrorists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, having a black president doesn't get rid of racism.  If anything, it mobilized white supremacists, made them more politically active.

       This is what I'm trying to figure out. Like why tf would they spend millions and push stories that have no impact on them. I still have yet to see a convincing motive for any of them to be anti white. Plus it's not like if you're white you get kicked out the country or something if a bad story breaks. I legit don't get where all this fear is coming from.

       I just think maybe because this happened in Spain and the other happened in Virginia that might be a reason why Americans arnt posting or commenting about this as much. Also on some level people have been desensitized to terror overseas in general and thats sad.

       When you live between Germany and Russia, over Ukraine and Turkey, USA seems like a pretty far echo.

       The coverage is exponentially higher due to Trump's remarks; if he just hit the can-of-corn any other President would have hit out of the park many would be moving on. Sometimes I think he does this shit on purpose, because he's a narcissist addicted to attention (either good or bad).

       I was thinking that. I found myself thinking Monday "wow, he might not have meant it but what he said was good for us to come together as a country" then he scheduled a press conference on his own, he had prepared remarks on infrastructure and then completely just started ranting about it. It is no way this man is that dumb. Like I can't even say I'm mad, it's more a mix between confusing and a "wtf" this can not be real feeling" like this has to be either a distraction or a ploy to divide the nation for some reason.  Trump supporters keep saying how Trump is the great negotiator and is the man of the people but in all the years of my life, I have literally not once felt more divided as a country. This has to be part of a bigger plan.

       Ave you read the Felix Sater story? He is a Russian born real estate developer and property management director and advisor to Trumps organization. He negotiated a lot of things on behalf of Trump and has very close ties to Trump so hes not some rando. He is claiming that he and his family are preparing for him to go to jail and is confident Trump will join him. He says that he has been working with Mueller and is under an NDA but said it's mostly money laundering and financial crimes tied with the Russian mob. He said he expects to be sentenced this fall and the last timeline he gave said 30-35 days. The story was first published August 3rd. Maybe this is it?

       I know. I don't think any major outlets picked up on it yet which is probably why it hasn't gained any traction. The way that they source their info seems to be hard to verify since everyone working with mueller is under a strict NDA, so idk if I'm giving it much weight either. It's just a very interesting sorry if it is true.

       What's not true, that major head lines are picking up on it. I just did and didn't see any. I saw Inquisiter, Raw story, spectator. Have have not seen anything from NBC CNBC, Fox, Cnn(I know), washpo, NPR, MSNBC, ABC, NYT etc. I'm not saying I don't believe it, just that I'm going to wait until the story picks up steam to put all my eggs in one basket.

       Wow. I did not see those tweets yet. The Papapopolous guy or how ever you sell it seems like someone who is at the heart of this big thing. I think this weekend I'm going to compile a list of all the shit going on, and make it pretty big coherent post. It seems like when we get a story a week it doesn't look suspicious by itself, and I understand why people don't read into it if they think it's no evidence, but when putting it into context and actually reading through all of this shit, and connecting the obvious dots I have no clue how people think that this is a nothing burger. It is just no fucking way. I guess we just have to wait it out

       I only don't follow it, aside from what I come across, because I know better than to expect substantial leaks and I want the full picture. Some people have this strange expectation that everything will be leaked/released just because it has happened with some other things - although much of that false equivalence / unrealistic expectations is artifice from supporters.

       if you look at animals, there is a history of forced sexual encounters from males (rape) in order to reproduce when their usual methods of attracting mates are denied. I'm not saying what she said is true, but I'd like to think that humans have evolved to where rape isn't an idea we're born with, especially since most cases of rape aren't in order to impregnate and have children.

       All things have bias. Any educational thing will be biased in some way. To state that colleges are similar to evergreen is blatantly false. Not sure where you went to college or when, but I went to a private school on the northeast and nothing like evergreen ever occurred or was even close.

       I never sympathize with terrorist, of any race or religion. Let's rehash this since you're trying to twist my fucking words to push your government agenda. The guy before said countries had been fighting Islamic Terrorism and you equated it with hashtags on Twitter, I said that western countries have been literally fighting it in the Middle East and have killed a lot of people over there, you tell me learn history and tell me that I'm a terrorist sympathizer. Wtf. What in the hell did I say that was factually incorrect? I never even said whether it was right or wrong, just it's an objective verifiable fact that we have been fighting Islamic terrorism for decades. What point are you even trying to make?

       Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, which nobody honest can deny. He led a coup against his own government to grab power, used chemical weapons against his own citizens and had very recently led an invasion of a nearby country. All of these things led credibility to the USA's narrative that he was pursuing WMDs. Had he led a peaceful nation without a history of recent and brutal atrocities, it would have been nearly impossible for the Bush administration to sell such an outrageous lie and launch their occupation of the country.

       Saddam Hussein was also put into power and supported by interests in the West.  We put a puppet in power in Iran, too.  That went well.  We should stop trying to run other countries and stop starting wars and focus on building not bombing.

       When did I pretend this was a new development? Quit talking out your ass. Your logic is that since it's been happening for a long time then it's okay. I'm sure all those civilians and their families aren't mad because we didn't kill them on purpose. Just an accident no big deal.

       "The middle east" as the commenter I responded too put it, is not a single nation at all. The wars between Christians and Arabs have been ongoing for so long nobody even knows exactly how hostilities started anymore, all we know is that people from each region have been responsible for horrible atrocities at different points in time.
      </p>

       As long as people are pretending that one side is totally evil and the other completely innocent, this conflict is never going to end.

       George W. Bush, the man who led the USA during their initial invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan (where I'm assuming you're alluding too) was a very religious Christian. The USA itself, and western civilization in general, is derived from Christian heritage and a great many of the citizens are very strong believers (more than any other religion).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East on the other hand is predominantly Muslim, with a great many fundamentalists who frequently cite their faith as a primary reason for waging war against the west.

       The history of conflict between these two civilizations goes back literally thousands of years.

       We got a post about Trump being basically a Nazi, assange being a Russian shill and something about a white supremacist. So that's good.

       I was about to say. I feel like lot of users especially on this sub forget how American centric this website is.

       For example in Australia we have had I think at this point 4 of our politicians to have been revealed to be dual citizens of other counties. One of the being our deputy prime minister.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine if Pence got revealed to be a Ukrainian or Russian citizen and then refused to resign. You would see it on Te top of all for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better yet what about if there was a shooting in New Zealand by a cop or Singapore. You might not see it. But I don't see anyone calling that a conspiracy.

       You make an excellent point. The only solution seems to be checking out the very few YouTubers from Australia who cover both conspiracy and auspol. For example, a

        video on the recent Hanson Burqa funnies

       Where do get your news? The only non American new sources I know are BBC and Al-jezera which are both biased as well. 
The only way I know to form my own opinion is to watch/read as much news as possible and be highly (and at times, immaturly) clinical of everything.

       That's how I follow the news also. I read a few different outlets through the day (Guardian, AJ, BBC, The Canary (for UK politics)) but again everything feels spun these days and I'm now wary of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it's always been that way but currently with the ability to read the same story from a few different places you can occasional/often see what angle is being pushed. Not with everything mind you.

       I mean in the sense I try to see a wide array of sources and then eventually make my own opinion based off that. And yeah I know the Canary is very spun, it's just a good basis of how far to the other side it can be swung sometimes.

       One, it's a move to further make Australians disregard their politicians so we're even more apathetic about how fucked our system is. 
Two, it's to normalise dual citizen politicians so we change our constitution to let dual citizens in. But that'd obviously be fucking moronic for a country to allow dual citizens, right?

       That's nothing, a sizable chunk of our politicians are dual citizens of Israel and consistently vote for their interests over ours and no one gives a shit, and if they do, they're called an anti-semite.

       Well, I mean, it's not really a fair comparison to complain that a scandal in Australia doesn't get the same attention as a similar scandal in America would. One country represents the largest military, the third largest economy, and arguably the largest cultural exporter in the world, while the other is an island nation with an economy based on vegemite and drop bear repellent.

       Right, and I totally agree with you, but I was pointing out that the same phenomenon happens in most other global media, too, because quite frankly, events in America are far reaching whereas events in Australia simply aren't. The entire world is affected by instability in the American government. Most outside of Australia couldn't tell you who the Australian PM is.

       Sorry friend, the next time Germany or some other invading force decides to conquer the continent we'll just sit at home and mind our own business. Marshall Plan? Berlin Airlift? Nah you guys would rather we didn't help, so we won't. It's like Europe is a guy inside a burning house, who gets mad at a neighbor who smells smoke and offers to bring a bucket of water... or a fire engine freedom tank.

       I was downvoted to hell yesterday trying to explain this. It's almost like people don't even have common sense anymore... Reddit is very clearly majority American and most people care more about what happens in their own country than other places around the world. I guess this concept is too much for people?

       I'm not seeing the conspiracy theory here. I mean, it doesn't take a conspiracy to explain that we are sadly used to radical Islamic terrorism, and that hating Nazis is popular this week. Duh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you what, if white supremacists want to declare war on the US and fight a protracted war of terrorism and insurgency against the forces of the enlightenment and the west, we'll probably stop making a big deal over it in about 20 years, OK?

       American citizen commiting a terroristic attack (and hate crime) on American soil. Of course it is a bigger deal in terms of our daily news. This shit just doesn't happen. Also the dude was a fucking nazi, at a nazi rally.

         Muslim does car attack and kills 13 because hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed by their host nations. Understandable, its a retaliation.

       Now we know the Terrorists only a fraction of the Military capabilities of the US so we can infer that it is unreasonable to assume the Terrorists killed more civilians than the US.

       I was informed the other day about how nicely the Germans treated the Jews, protecting them from war in camps, and it was only the bad Allied bombing that caused the people in the camps to starve.   Turns out, Germany was going to give everyone a free Porsche and Leica cameras after the war, but we ruined all that.

       Also the fascist doctrine is in no way based off the teachings of that book. As opposed to say, the Bible and Christianity, the Koran and Islam, the Talmud or Kabbala and Judaism.  Written by one dude who wanted to be popular within his own echo-chamber.

       I agree, it is a lack of self awareness and critical thinking, blatant echo-chamber, and widespread confirmation bias. It allows these people to not examine their hypocracy and anti-human attitudes, and pretend it's ok.

       Many of the people born today are borne into a system that makes them support the whole 'big brother' thing without their conscious approval and they take it for granted, and when you try to 'wake' them up they resist thinking that you're trying to shatter their status quo, e.g. security. Another thing is is that many like having hard choices being taken care for them and like living in the illusion of freedom without the burden of responsibility.

       It is impossible to wake people up until they are already waking by themselves. The cognitive dissonance is too much to overcome without some inherent desire by the sleeper.

       True, they invest their souls in it. When the person has their eyes set upon a goal, it's hard to divert them; in this case the goal of the sleeper is going back to sleep, i.e. numbness. So many are eager to become willfully ignorant and go about their days saying: 'same shit different day'.

      <p>
       I don't have to worry, or think, I just have to be a productive worker. I don't have to think about how I'm sacrificing the only thing of value I have on this earth, my time, for nothing more than the ability to afford to continue sacrificing it day in and day out.

      <p>
       There's no worry that the people who make all the decisions are deciding that they are more important and can keep taking from me, leaving me with less and less, forcing me to continuously narrow my focus to avoid seeing the things I don't want to think about.

       To add to your post....he was also labeled a terrorist!!  So you know, patriot act takes over. No due process, rights of any kind, wipe your ass with that document created in 1776....etc etc etc. Now before I get exploded with down votes, he's a vile cowardly human being. I'm simply stating that a precedence has been set for any random act of violence to be labeled as a terrorist. Being a terrorist is a very subjective label as well....who gets to decide who's a terrorist and who's not?

       This wasn't some "random act of violence", it was a right-wing protestor running his car in to leftist protestors. At a political rally. Not random.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrorism is doing a violent act to instill fear, and send a message. Often political. I think it's possible to call what happened in Charlottesville terrorism, but I also think there's an argument against it.

       Here's a nice quote this situation (and your post) reminds me of though I'm not sure where Becky Fisher falls on the scale of crazyness. Ranting elsewhere in the documentary about Warlocks and Harry Potter? Probably only moderately crazy, I've seen some crazy shit posted on reddit. "It's no wonder, with that kind of intense training and discipline, that those young people are ready to kill themselves for the cause of Islam. I wanna see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam. I wanna see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine and all those different places, you know, because we have... excuse me, but we have the truth!"

       Ya know what activates my almonds? For the past week there have been hotly contested yet upvoted-to-positive posts in this sub theorizing that the Nazis in Charlottesville couldn't actually be genuine Nazis and must be some sort of psyop from tptb to divide us. Yet, instead of a similar post about Barcelona being a psyop from tptb to divide us, we get this.

       Without being facetious about it: We've grown weary of Muslim based terror. So what...yet ANOTHER Muslim terror attack. Ho hum. We're bored with it, it doesn't shock, anger, or TERRORIZE us anymore. We expect it, and have grown numb trying to comprehend the hows and whys of yet another attack that started with someone being radicalized.

       I'm NOT trying to be insensitive or callous, but unless its another 9/11, or a nuke is involved, many people just don't have the emotional energy to care any longer. This is what 16 years of war has done to us.

       Well the thing you have to understand is that Nazi symbols are very offensive to the chosen people. In fact,
       <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/jym.png">
        the suffering of the jewish people is the entire reason that the concept was even defined
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok to keep attention rooted on this because G-d chose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile over 10 europeans are dead but that's a bit different. You see, g-d didn't choose Europeans as the chosen people. And it's extremely offensive to think that European suffering is anywhere near as important as Jewish suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything those Europeans should just accept brown migrants to their country then remember BrownLivesMatter (only when interacting with europeans) so that the Europeans don't get too uppity.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will keep those damn Europeans down for good, and will be a final solution to the xenophobic problem!

       I know that I'm way to late for this thread but it's simpke. Domestic news vs international news. There's a lot more redditors who care about shit happening in America vs in Barcelona. Another factor is the frequency of attacks, how often do you read about terrorists running people over in the us? Not to mention Reddit is still in a massive anti Nazi circlejerk, and this isn't that.

       This is another Dark Age, can't you tell? We're being lied to everyday. And what you believe is irrelevant if you're not a liberal. Except the Vatican is replaced with: The far left, Black Lives Matter, Millennials, The Transgender community, Feminists, and people who don't know what the the Equal Pay Act of 1963 is.

       But, you need to realize it is all the same. It doesnt matter how many died. The climate right now is not about muslims. It is about one kind of white vs everyone.

       The altright white nationalist surge is undermining all sorts of civil progress over the last 50+ years.

       A large portion of these people are also the reason why so many muslims in the world have died.

       I live in Barcelona and I'm American. You guys are nuts. What happened in America is what happened today, the difference being is that as Americans we are viewed as a respectful, diverse minded group and the world finally understood when so many of us talk about the open racism happening. The world was shocked to see us expose our rancid culture so openly and dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please respect what happened in Barcelona but also understand that here no one thought the USA was full of that many idiots especially with the biggest one currently in office.

       One psychopath attack happened in the US, the other in Spain. The US press gave more attention to the attack that happened in US soil (go figure!).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're implying that muslims in general don't get enough hate from the press already, and that racist white people are being persecuted for their harmless ideology of white supremacy on a multi-cultural country. Seriously, go fuck yourself. All those "muslim terrorist" attacks are on account of your stupid country which fucking funded the damn ISIL and gave all the means for that group to have the power they have now.

       All terrible excuses to ignore the clear fucking bias in the media. The guy in Charlottesville was attacked and panicked. The media is using this to relate everyone on the right to fringe extremist racist groups. All white people are racist, everyone who disagrees is a (literal) nazi sympathizer, fuck Trump, etc. This was a literal terrorist attack and the silence in comparison is deafening.

       It was a government staged false flag like the rest, a lot of police were observed setting up the scene before the van arrived and at least 2 people from previous staged events were involved, another clear sign.

       There was a time when the media would have simply called someone a "self-styled Nazi" so as not to confuse any of your wannabe everyday run-of-the-mill low-life's, street criminals, and budding psychopaths with a swastika tattoo on their forearm or a big double lightning-bolt emblazoned on their calf just for the hell of it from the kind of highly trained and methodical killers that Hitler's regime produced since there is no real comparison between them nor between what you might call having a reasonable amount of caution and concern regarding the existence of the one vs. the far more real and palpable fear that surrounded the existence of other in it's day.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short the media has a responsibility NOT to overstate or engender any further public fear when there clearly was no obvious need or reason to and they fully recognised and took that responsibility seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone goes off the proverbial "deep-end" it's important to maintain that perspective in what you proceed to report about them or whatever they presumably believe that apparently set them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all kinds of incidents that fall into that category like the man who took a shotgun and actually killed a nine year old boy in the process of running across his front lawn for no other reason than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such incidents are disturbing but we recognise the unlikely nature of the incidents themselves in regards to the likelihood of them ever occurring again. We certainly don't live in abject fear of the idea that such people can and do exist or we'd never go out the door again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's missing from all the MSM accounts attempting to actually generate an unreasonable amount of fear over this is how it was all very much
       <em>
        allowed to happen
       </em>
       by the police and civil authorities who knew far enough in advance that if they were going to allow a controversial and questionable gathering in the first place they needed to take adequate measures to see that the assembly and dispersal was peaceful and orderly and that the streets surrounding the gathering had a strong police presence to ensure that there were no incidents of violence, vandalism, or confrontations with any ordinary people simply going about their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       The event, of course, very much resembles what took place in Times Square New York not so very long ago, that was suspicious enough to consider if they aren't in fact linked or were set-up according to some pre-determined agenda that the MSM is also assisting in.

       Islam is not an ideology. Muslims don't
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       represent the tenets of the Islamic spiritual tradition. To find out what the Islamic tradition actually teaches, you'd have to look at those sources, not Muslims. As far as I know, Naziism is a political ideology that does indeed encourage and condone violence.

       White nazi terrorists are a new trend of summer 2017. It seems that this is just a cause for new Israeli political line. Netanyahu's son has already stated that "I'm a Jew. I'm an Israeli, the neo Nazis scums in Virginia hate me and my country."

       I bet if Mariano Rajoy Brey came out and said "there is blame on both sides" there would be a shit storm of controversy. But at this point, I don't think these terrorists are like our terrorists in that they are involved with the nations politics and are more of the same ME Islamic Wahhabi psychos - probably with ties to Saudi Arabia more than Iran or Iraq or even Syria is my guess. That is why it isn't all over the news channels.

       Because I'm willing to bet the majority of Reddit is American and we are self centered creatures. Yeah that shit was bad, but everything across the Atlantic is just articles online. If the same thing happened here in America it would be just as crazy as the Nazi thing. Except the president might actually condemn the people that did it.

       I'd be better if it was possible to discuss theories and discuss discrepancies within certain incidents instead of running a half pissing contest which looks like a near equivalence of children demanding fairness. Yes, the coverage is unbalanced, and it could be for reasons that are more nuanced. No muslim owes you anything though if this is your personal opinion OP, and not general reflection. This instance it could be likely because an attack like this hasn't been as common, (ideology) and it's on US soil.                   Numerous people have died under Western policies, because of the war machine in the m/e. Is it more "fair" now? I agree that it should be balanced, but this bickering frames it as some sort of contest, but at least in invites to discussion too.

       It's 100% on purpose no doubt about it. You see all over Reddit comments about everyone's a Nazi but you make 1 comment about a Muslim and it's deleted with a ban to go with it. There's a big agenda on here and all the main stream media.

       To be fair, I'm nearly 50 and I've been hearing about middle east terrorism since I was a kid.   We all know it exists and we're tired of it, but nobody seems to have a good solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the point with the Nazis is people are sure as hell not willing to let a White Nationalist movement start killing people in the US in the name of whatever the fuck it is they're after.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe there are people with a vested interest in brewing up a race division that doesn't need to be aggravated, and that just like the middle east, there are people wrong on both sides of things.

       We're all in this together.  We're adults.  It's time to settle the fuck down and get on to more important tasks.
