       First let me say that I have no proof of this, just a sneaking suspicion. I do not condone the KKK/White Supremacists/ Antifa/Neo-Confederates, etc. I am posting this on the conspiracy forum for a reason, it is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, many on this site have pointed out that the police were told to stand down multiple times in Charlottesville, and that the 2 groups were permitted to stage about a third of a mile apart, with no wall of police between them (bad idea).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say that you are the KKK, a neo-confederate, a goose stepping Nazi. Somebody you really hate. Lets say you go push your BS, maybe even rough up a few people, and count yourself lucky that you are not arrested. Lets say you get into your car to head home, and as you are leaving a line of Antifa cross your path, recognize you, and start to beat your car with baseball bats. You, as a piece of shit, but a piece of shit who is in legitimate fear for your life panic, and try to get out of the situation. Your car is repeatedly beaten, you see an empty street as you are chased, and you try to flee, only to have your path blocked. You are fearful for your life and try to ram through the group. You injure a bunch of people and kill someone. You then find another way out, and are ultimately arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is still an unacceptable course of action, but is a far cry from deliberately trying to mow down a group of people. I believe that if this was pre-meditated and an actual terrorist attack, he would have killed far more people. If I'm not mistaken, assuming this is terrorism, this idiot will have the lowest kill count of any terrorist vehicular attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if he were actually just trying to kill a bunch of people, he would have aimed for just a crowd of people, not a crowd of people and cars. If I am not mistaken, people usually get out and try to shoot/stab people to when they do this. I just saw the guy panic and try to get away.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did this guys car get damaged before he ran into the crowd if this was a straight up terrorist attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is a controversial statement, but I thought I'd put it here to see if anyone had the same thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, let me say that the KKK/Antifa/White Supremacists/ neo-nazis are bad people... who all have the right to their (ignorant) free speech and dangerous ideas.

       There's no evidence anyone attacked his car prior to him driving into the crowd.

        Given, this was just moments before the collision with the crowd, but there is evidence of his car being struck before. From the videos it seems like he already had some speed going before that though, so I can't say I really think it was 100% self-defense.

       Both of those are from
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       the dude starts accelerating into the crowd. You can see people diving out of the way. Everybody is either running like hell or fighting back, a perfectly reasonable set of responses to a car accelerating toward you.

       Really? I believe there are pictures of the back of his car with pre-existing damage (from when who knows) and there is a video on RT (maybe) that seems to show a protestor wielding a bat or something similar striking his vehicle. Having said that, those would still be a weak case for self-defense.

       Yes it is. I'm not going to argue with you about it. Facts are facts. When that guy took a swing with the pole at the back of the killers car, the killer was already speeding into the crowd causing people to jump out of the way. The connection with the civilian hitting the back of the car with a pole and the driver hitting bodies is less than one second. I can understand a conspiracy about who the driver was/someone coercing him/etc, etc. But the whole "he was scared!" theory is a lie and provably false.

       Let me repeat myself: BEFORE and AFTER. You state that the antifas damaged the car. That means that you either have a picture of someone actively doing it before the car started to accelerate, or you have pictures of how the car was before and after the rallies (someone might argue that the damaged happened another way, but I am willng to accept it).

       Yeah definitely. I could see a similar unknown case being judged on its merits and going either way, but in this scenario as soon as the prosecution states that he was in a "Nazi" rally and that he didn't seek police help or stop after the alleged "self defense", the jurors will hang him without a second thought. They have already made up their minds, they just need a bump in confidence so they feel justified in their opinion.

       I didn't see airbag deploy in any of the videos or pictures. The reason more people didn't die was because there was a car just a few people deep in the crowd that he couldn't see and hit. That messed up his plan.

       The airbag didn't deploy in a crash where I'm pretty sure any airbag would deploy. Either he disabled or removed it. It may not be as easy as disabling the passenger side, but it must be possible.

       in this video you can hear people screaming in horror, see people reacting by starting to record with their phones, and hear his tires screech from acceleration well before that dumbass taps his bumper with the bat. in fact, one could argue that bumper tap was some kind of knee jerk response to this obvious aggression by acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
       looks like this moron didnt account for any other cars being in the crowd to prevent him to continue to accelerate.

       You literally just asked,
       <strong>
        i wonder if theres any other recorded moments where a driver felt it was necessary to drive a heavy metal object through a crowd to save his/her life?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am saying that this may be a recorded moment where a driver felt it was necessary to drive a heavy metal object through a crowd to save his/her life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say the driver was attacked before he rammed the crowd, and you could see he was visibly in fear for his life. How many people would it be okay for him to mow down to save his own? This is 100% related if my initial conspiracy is correct.

       my intent in asking these questions is to better understand your theory, which i am doing with an open mind. i do have my own opinion on the subject, such as the video i posted with the description of the events as i saw them. these questions might make you uncomfortable, but im attempting to help you elaborate more on your take on this by asking those critical thinking type questions.

       If there were evidence, do you think the Antifa thugs would publish it? Take a look at this short video from Charlotesville, where Antifa sucker punches someone with no provocation, and then an entire crowd tries to convince the cops Antifa sucker punched someone in self defense.

       Is your point here that the car might have been attacked first, but all evidence of that being the case was "suppressed" by Antifa?

       With the supposed absence of evidence we can only speculate with no certainty. the only evidence ive seen of him being threatened was when someone hit his bumper as he was driving into the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me ask you though, why was he driving down that street to begin with? There are videos of the incident from a birds-eye  view thanks to drone footage, and it clearly shows that the intersection was really the only place where that crowd was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would this guy drive on a street that clearly has a crowd that you can see blocks away? Why didnt he just head down another street to get around it? Could it be safe to assume at the very least he drove down this street with the idea of anatagonizing the protestors that he disagreed with?

       Let me repeat myself: BEFORE and AFTER. You state that the antifas damaged the car. That means that you either have a picture of someone actively doing it before the car started to accelerate, or you have pictures of how the car was before and after the rallies (someone might argue that the damaged happened another way, but I am willng to accept it).

       Look at the car from the beginning of the video until he bumps into the people.  You can't unintentionally miss it.
