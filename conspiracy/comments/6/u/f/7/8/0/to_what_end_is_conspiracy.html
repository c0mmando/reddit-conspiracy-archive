Sure, I get making a quick buck no matter what the cost, but to what end? Wouldn&#39;t generations of soulless lifestyles bring an end to the mindset of greed and manipulation, in not out of boredom? Serious question, I&#39;ve entertained some out there theories before like energy harvesting of human emotion and such, but given the evidence we have so far, what is the goal for the world to be in so much conflict or at least appear to be from the media&#39;s perspective? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering about this a few seasons ago. There&#39;s no evidence about whatever conspiracy because they can easily remove it from the internet. What you gotta do is look around at the world and ask yourself.. ok what&#39;s happening out here. Maybe there&#39;s a bit of proof you can observe with the way things are operating. </p>

<p>What you see these days is corporation takeovers and mergers. Every day some bigger conglomerate buys a smaller one. The governments do nothing to stop it. Eventually seems like you&#39;ll wind up with 1 entity that own all the companies that manufacture things you can buy. They make it look like they&#39;re all fractured corporations but you&#39;ve probably see the infographics of parent companies that own other ones. </p>

<p>Something&#39;s fishy with all that. It&#39;s like this one world government but in the business world. No more competition so they can change whatever they want. It&#39;s already pretty bad out there, only 2-3 main stores you can buy things at.  </p>

<p>So what&#39;s going on with that.. what&#39;s their purpose. It really does seem like eventually it&#39;ll be 1 company that owns all the others. 1 place that makes the product even though it looks like it&#39;s other brands. Now they can control it all of what goes in being put in products. Now they can drug the people with who knows what kind of undetectable nano technology or something. Who knows. </p>

<p>Seasons ago I was looking into who runs the world behind the scenes. You hear stories of them all being devil worshipers. You ask yourself WHY about it. You hear tales of these archon negative entities who control them. This is when you mentioned the &quot;energy harvesting of human emotion&quot;. For tales like that, you&#39;re going to have to just believe stories with no proof. You&#39;d have to do research and new tidbits would fit in with other puzzle pieces and make sense. The only proof you&#39;re going to have is what you observe going on in the real world. Then if that fits in with these puzzle pieces it may make more sense. The only way you&#39;re going to get classified proof though is to get money, then power and you can play with the big boys in the business world. Then you can uncover what&#39;s really going on. </p>

<p>Until then you guys are all losing with your browsing around youtube and google images trying to uncover the truth. You&#39;ll never find it there. The only avenue would be text story tales with zero proof. What you want to do is get power so you can go research those tales in the real world. Until then, you&#39;re losing online surfing the internet. You&#39;ve done the research, you&#39;re schooled, you know what&#39;s going on. Now it&#39;s time to work towards concrete methods instead. So shut this internet stuff off and work towards big money. </p>

<p>The thing with you guys is you have no plan on how you could get that big money and then have power. So what do you try and do about this conspiracy stuff, you surf around the internet. You should know by now that&#39;ll never get you anywhere. Time&#39;s up, schooling&#39;s done and go get the big money instead. </p>

<p>You&#39;re religious? I started checking out a documentary yesterday. Was checking the fullmoviesonyoutube subreddit and noticed this one about all these buncha religious people in New York&#39;s Time&#39;s square. Hang on, let me go get that link. </p>

<p>&quot;The Gods of Times Square (1999) [480p]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/6u70sf/the_gods_of_times_square_1999_480p/">https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/6u70sf/the_gods_of_times_square_1999_480p/</a></p>

<p>Holy shit are these people ever off their rocker. I&#39;d believe in this God right after I see scientific evidence to warrant a logical belief. For them, they&#39;re all fervent, meanwhile what if it&#39;s all bullshit. You can reason with any of these people they&#39;re completely nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that is the intersection of the difference between &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;belief&quot;.  To me, existence/reality itself is proof, furthered by the Holy Bible.  Just my belief I guess.</p>

<p>&quot;meanwhile what if it&#39;s all bullshit&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve though about that.  My answer is, that my faith is what makes me happy in this life.  Furthermore, if it is all bs, I go with the following logic:
7 billion people exist today.  It is believed that the total population of humanity throughout time is estimated to be 108 billion (including the 7 billion alive today).  That is less than 10% of the total population of humans throughout time are alive today.  Which means, 99.x% of humans are not mentioned in history books, thus are forgotten by those who are leap-frogged through time, meaning my little life wouldn&#39;t matter anyway in the scheme of things since we all die at some point.  </p>

<p>Which then strengthens my faith that my life, like the 99 billion of humans that are dead now, do matter, even if not remembered.  And no matter how short of a life it is, what would an extra x amount of years buy me anyway when it will end anyway....</p>

<p>I came back on to check how &quot;uptight and twatty&quot; the &quot;larvals&quot; were. haha. You know how it is anytime you gotta deal with somebody from the average public these days. They&#39;re all &quot;on the rag&quot;. </p>

<p>What do they do about how things get worse out there, they increase their addiction to distractions. Pretty bad out there these days. What take a hit because of it, sleep. So they all have accumulated sleep deprivation, making them even more miserable. </p>

<p>All the stuff they do during their spare time after work to try and feel better about how their lives fail compared to those they see on TV and in the movies. </p>

<p>They never think how they could work towards being one of them instead. </p>
