       I can bet that given the exact same circumstances as Assange, we would all do the same and not release anything that goes against Putin's agenda.

       No.  You would have to provide more proof before I would even consider it.  I can imagine scenarios where they have mutually aligned goals, but I haven't seen anything to prove that he is controlled by Russia.  If he is owned, why not China, U.K., or some secret society?  You haven't provided any proof that passes even the smallest sniff test.

       From the original FP article, that this one above is a rewrite.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The logs, which were provided to FP, only included WikiLeaks’s side of the conversation.
“As far as we recall these are already public,” WikiLeaks wrote at the time.
“WikiLeaks rejects all submissions that it cannot verify. WikiLeaks rejects submissions that have already been published elsewhere or which are likely to be considered insignificant. WikiLeaks has never rejected a submission due to its country of origin,” the organization wrote in a Twitter direct message when contacted by FP about the Russian cache.

       The US is the world's military super power, and we had an election. Pretty sure that is top priority over the shit Russia had done... When was the last time Russia attack someone after WWII, and how many times has the US since then? Hillary wanted WWIII, Trump doesn't. I don't blame Assange. That being said, I've said this before. Snowden is in Russia working for the CIA (Holy Roman Empire) because Assange is in the UK either wittingly or unwittingly working for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Ultimately, both are controlled by the same hidden group, imo. Tis' all smoke and mirrors.

       I didn't vote for him (or anyone), but I don't think he is doing it just for himself. I've seen/heard too much, and the people who are saying that, are bias and not paying attention, imo. Trump really is different, and that is evident by all the backlash he is getting. We live in interesting times.

       He's not incompetent. When was the last time an incompetent person became a billionaire? People who say he is, are the incompetent and ignorant ones, imo. I've seen many intelligent people trick stupid people, but I have not seen stupid people trick intelligent people. You are self-projecting. Speaking of "me, me, me". Who did you vote for, and why?

       Look at the Whitehouse, it's a dumpster on fire. Look at all the people he surrounds himself with. He can't even make good deals. He's further dividing the US with his controversial rhetoric and outlandish tweets.

       Nothing definitive, really. Just speculations. I go by, once a spook, always a spook, and nothing in politics happens without reason. What info did he actually release that many/most of us didn't already know? The masses now think of self-censorship, because "big brother is watching".

       It's interesting, when the KGB agent Uri Resnick I think was his name, defected from Russia and came to the US and told the CIA all about Lee Harvey Oswald's time in the USSR, the CIA ultimately split into camps of people that believed Resnick, and people that didn't. Resnick was trying to allay concerns that Oswald was somehow a mind-controlled Russian asset or was in any way trained by the KGB. He marched to Washington to clearly say: we didn't do anything with Oswald, Oswald was just his own guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then a couple years later some
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       former KGB agent comes by and tells the CIA that Resnick is lying, and actually it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a KGB plot that recruited and trained Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the CIA didn't know who to believe, so they ultimately made Resnick a prisoner of sorts for awhile, didn't sort anything out, and ultimately just got bored of the whole situation and wiped their hands in defeated indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moral of the story is, we can't believe anything the Russian government says to us, or anything the US government says to us about Russia. It's a double-edged geopolitical sword.
