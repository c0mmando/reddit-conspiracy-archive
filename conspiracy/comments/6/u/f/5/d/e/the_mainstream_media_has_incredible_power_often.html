       This is an incredibly strange phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the the media says it, it often comes true.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, during elections, the media can make shit up, like back in 2012 they say "Mitt Romney is the leader in the republican race". Even though Ron Paul was the favorite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, he BECOMES the leader in the race. All of a sudden there's Romney signs in everyone's front yard and he's all the chit chat at work...
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been so programmed to think that whatever the "important people on tv in suits and ties" say, that those things they say are happening, actually come to fruition!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an incredible power, and that same thing applies to the race war they are creating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media says racial tensions are bad, they BECOME bad because you assume it must be true. Many peoples behaviors are directly linked to this and will start to change based on what they hear is Happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the MSM is used to program behavior and force people to act based on what they see/hear on tv and herd mentality. They can steer the "herd" in any direction they want with this, and I'll bet the social engineers know a rough percentage of just how many people in the US are still under their spell...

       They plant the idea in your head. Then, it sort of festers and grows as the media shows you examples month after month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, some people will be dumb enough to take action and go protest. These people are really sad and empty people who don't understand the life journey. They're angry and mad and looking for someone to pinpoint it on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The social engineers are HOPING there's enough of those kind of people to keep the story going and building up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people want to stay out of this and don't give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I've noticed is the idea that some people think there are a bunch of "secret" racists" who just had the courage to come out now that there is a leader who is representing them in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys, this is all a sham. Trump is a catalyst for this race war. He's probably not even honestly racist in real life, but the elites need him to play this "character" in the media to help build this tension up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election was no doubt a part of this ploy. Trumps anti Mexican rhetoric and pro violence rhetoric was determined for him by the script writers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, it's a big production. These people are actors.

       He's probably not even racist in real life?  Seriously?  He's not a racist dude.  Not even a little bit.  I think he's like me.  I hate everyone equally.  At least until you've proven yourself worthy of my love.  Maybe he's prejudiced in some ways?  Probably?  Who isnt?   The guy is not a white supremacist neo nazi.  Please.

       Trump is merely an actor. A very good one too.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's simply playing the role he is told to. He has advisors telling him what to say, how to carry himself during speeches, what not to say, what subjects to stray away from.

       I think many of you would be blown away at how fake and phony all of this really is. This DC politics stuff is literally like making a movie. They have makeup people for the politicians before they go on camera, they have lines that they recite, and I'm sure they practice their "I care about America" faces in the mirror.

       Remember the clip of GWBush II kind of practicing his "sentimental appeal" into the camera in Michael Moore's movie ? Seriously he pretends to have this serious "I care about americans" face before giving his state of the union, and then someone says "ACTION" and they roll it...and of course he comes out with the,

      <p>
       "My fellow americans...." Bullshit..
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump does the same thing. The elite choose people who have the capability to act like this. They don't pick idiots with no cultural appeal.

       They tricked you dude. They knew you expected HC to win. So they threw a "wild card" out there who is a self made businessman to challenge her. The social engineers knew he was a good choice because he represented a large block of people. They think of these elections as opportunities to divide us all and split us up.

       Since he won, now you think he must be against "the system" lol...Thats EXACTLY what I would do If I was planning to take over the world. I'd plant a president that the people
       <em>

       is an outsider, but he would be on my side all the time. And i own the media so I can program the populace as I choose to forward my goal.

       Don't think I didn't see the early 90s interviews with Trump where he called both parties for the most part idiots. What I'm saying is. That anyone on that level don't give a fuck about us. It's all about priming. I'm not saying I know whats gonna happen but infor sure know that the dems thought they had this in the bag.

       I can recall a national news story from many long years ago where there was a mistake in the number of deaths that were annually attributed to a particular disease that was erroneously given as being ten times what it was supposed to be and strange but true there actually were that many deaths from it in the year that followed the publishing of that national news article.

       I remember being told in university that if a newspaper publishes a story about how deadly a certain highway is, deaths on that highway will actually increase. It raises some interesting ethical questions for journalists.

       I decided to write a college paper on media influence back in 2002-03ish. Back then the media deregulation, and the Subsequent raping of airwaves that were supposed to have been turned over to municipals/localities after the digital conversion was a fairly recent turn of events. I ended up overwhelming myself with the depressing reality of just how much our public is unaware that the media is ENTIRELY govt/corporate propaganda. Not a little, not most - ALL of it.

       I believe this. My mom is a great example. She remarks a lot about how the "world is gone" because of x or y happening. I remind her that stuff like x and y has always gone on - you just didn't have 24 hour news reporting on it all the time. You're a lot calmer if you limit the amount of media you look at. Otherwise people get worked up and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy kind of thing.
