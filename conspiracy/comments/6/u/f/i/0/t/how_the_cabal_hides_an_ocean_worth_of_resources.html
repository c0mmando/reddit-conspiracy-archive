       Combining this video with other research, here is what's happening in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabal has oceans of resources and technology. If these oceans were released into the population, everything would become dirt cheap and technology would solve most every major human problem that we pay big money for today. Therefore, they create fake scarcity. They only release enough resources so that people fight over them by paying top dollar. Whoever pays more, gets the resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also don't want to release technology for a multitude of reasons. First, they can just drop it into the economy inch by inch so that they and their future grandchildren can profit pretty much endlessly since they come up with new discoveries as they go. For example, if they released all the technology today, we would soon start looking like what we would look like in 2075. Second, all this technology solves many of our problems that we pay an arm and a leg for. This is why they killed the electric car. Now we can keep paying for oil we don't even need. There are many reasons for these things but these are the main 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video below explains the scarcity concept and why we aren't living in an abundant Utopia right now:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pxR73XR5UHc">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They control the resource extractions which they used to pay taxes on but eventually passed those taxes onto the middle class. They control the patents so that the technology cannot reach the public. They create artificial criminals through artificial poverty and then enslave those criminals in jails and use that slave power to generate more profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that unleashing our wealth would naturally level out the playing field but they would rather be on top of us with their heel on our necks. These soon to be jailed scumbags have such a low sense of self worth that they have to go to these extremes to feel any sense of pride in their existence. They only feel good when everyone else feels bad.

       Also, if you really want to get into the technology of the elites, look into the testimonies of Marine Captain Randy Cramer, civilian Tony Rodriguez, and Washington-based practicing attorney Andrew D. Basiago.  The elite have technologies that are literally out of this world.

       As Ben Rich, who was the head of Skunk Works, said: "We've had the technology to take E.T. home for quite some time now."
