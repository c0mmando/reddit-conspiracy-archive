After the presentation he opened it up for questions, and a guy, probably mid-20s said completely straight faced: &quot;When Trump kills Obamacare, when will he get on it [Mt Rushmore]?&quot;. I still don&#39;t know if he was joking or not, he said it completely straight faced and showed no emotion afterward.

<p>Vice had an article today advocating for blowing up Mt. Rushmore (which they quickly edited to &quot;destroy&quot; Mt. Rushmore).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t advocating for destroying Mt. Rushmore at all. It&#39;s pretty clear you didn&#39;t actually read the article, especially clear since you claim they changed it to &quot;destroy&quot; which is also false.</p>

<p>The article is about how every major person in U.S. history has both good and bad and that we shouldn&#39;t revere people like deities and instead accept them as multi-faceted individuals so that we can learn from both what they did right as well as what they did wrong. In addition, the original headline was referring to a <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/15/its-time-to-blow-up-mount-rushmore/">Daily Caller article</a>. </p>

<p>This is what certain revisionists on this sub would have you believe, yet when you look into the Declaration of Causes of Seceding States you see:</p>

<p>Over 30% of white families in the south owned slaves according to the 1860 Census.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but would it possible to argue that many southern soldiers were fighting or motivated by a variety of complex reasons besides the rights of slave owning plantation owners?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying slavery was the <em>only</em> reason, I&#39;m saying that it was the substantial one, which is supported by the reasoning outlined in the Declaration of Causes of Seceding States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And is it possible to suggest that people&#39;s defense of the statues now are down to more reasons than racism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, but it&#39;s odd that statues of slave-owners who lost the war would still be standing in the first place.  You don&#39;t see statues of Hitler or Stalin standing in Europe ...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only if you believe they should be standing in the first place ... which, for the most part, boils down to ignorance and fear.</p>

<p>Documents show Lee was cruel to his slaves and encouraged his overseers to severely beat slaves captured after trying to escape.

One slave at Arlington, Pryor noted, called Lee, &quot;the worst man I ever see.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re disputing that Lee had slaves?  Seriously?  Furthermore the generals on the Union side were fighting to create a country where slavery would be abolished, that&#39;s kind of like the <strong>key difference</strong> in the two sides.</p>

<p>Yup, totally revisionist when the seceding states literally said:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mississippi - Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Georgia - For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property ...</p></li>
<li><p>Texas - She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;m not disputing he had slaves, I&#39;m disputing that he mistreated them as Douglas Freeman himself said Lee was excellent to his slaves and had only been around those who were as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This [opinion] was the prevailing view among most religious people of Lee&#39;s class in the border states. They believed that slavery existed because God willed it and they thought it would end when God so ruled. The time and the means were not theirs to decide, conscious though they were of the ill-effects of Negro slavery on both races. Lee shared these convictions of his neighbors without having come in contact with the worst evils of African bondage. He spent no considerable time in any state south of Virginia from the day he left Fort Pulaski in 1831 until he went to Texas in 1856. All his reflective years had been passed in the North or in the border states. He had never been among the blacks on a cotton or rice plantation. At Arlington, the servants had been notoriously indolent, their master&#39;s master. Lee, in short, was only acquainted with slavery at its best, and he judged it accordingly. At the same time, he was under no illusion regarding the aims of the Abolitionists or the effect of their agitation&quot;</p>

<p>Lee was fighting for State&#39;s rights, the right for them to make their own decisions on abolition is part of that.

All it takes is a quick look at his Wikipedia to understand Lee never experienced first hand the more violent abuse prevalent in plantation slavery. </p>

<p>He was from a rich Virginia family. The difference was night and day between cotton plantation slaves and living among rich Virginia families with a couple black servants around the house. The ignorance of the time compounded this as he thought that slavery was God&#39;s will. Which was a very common belief among the rich old money of the south that never witnessed the harsh lives of slaves on plantations.</p>

<p>The picture you try to paint of Robert E. Lee as some kind of plantation owning, slave whipping, psycho is just historically inaccurate. The reality is that most of the old money in the south were very ignorant about the reality of the atrocities happening on plantations in the south. Here is a letter from Lee to his wife on the subject of slavery and how he feels about the ordeal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country.

<p>The irony is that you&#39;re the one playing revisionist history. I love history and one thing people seem to forget is that nothing is so cut and dry when it comes to human history. Everything is lost in the murky grey in-between, there is no good and evil. Just flawed men trying to do the right thing. I think Robert E. Lee deserves any statue people want to erect in his honor, he helped shape the America we see today. The treaty Lee pushed for made sure the transition for the south back to the Republic would have no more blood shed.</p>

<p>Know where there&#39;s plenty of History? In fucking books.</p>

<p>These statues are not Priceless antiques acting as a Timeless bookmark in the pages of History.  They were put up in the fifties and sixties as a reaction to the Civil Rights Movement, the solidified salt of the tears klansmen.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not, I&#39;m saying that in the 2010s we can look at statues we have standing in our society and decide whether they still deserve to be there.  There&#39;s no Hitler or Stalin statues chilling in Europe.</p>
