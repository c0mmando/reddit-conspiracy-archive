<p>It&#39;s not curious. Because he&#39;s meeting with Assange, he&#39;s suddenly big news. Therefore, relevant or at least attention grabbing stories about him are suddenly worth more. It doesn&#39;t have to be part of a coordinated effort, it would happen quite naturally. </p>

<p>Kevin McCarthy commented that then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and California congressional colleague Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) were being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>“There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy said in the recording of a June 15 exchange obtained and published by the Washington Post. At that point, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) cut off the conversation and swore those present to secrecy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty damning evidence despite your attempts to spin it and downplay it. </p>

<p>Honestly, if there&#39;s anyone in the country who knows more about being bought and paid for - it&#39;s politicians. Its pretty much in their job description.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> trying to defend these guys is really odd to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not spinning anything. It&#39;s a verbal allegation.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s no solid evidence of it. You&#39;re talking about corrupt politicians discussing behind closed doors being paid off by foreign governments. If there was evidence of it they&#39;d be out of a job and possibly facing treason charges. </p>

<p>I&#39;m defending his right of innocence till proven guilty.</p>

<p>If he is proven guilty of a crime through proper legal process I won&#39;t defend that anymore. It&#39;s very simple. I will still have the right to question the verdict..but if the evidence is sufficient, I doubt I would do that.</p>

<p>What makes your posts especially odd is that just the other day you were attacking Google for removing an app from their appstore.

    <div class="md"><p>Who called you a shill?</p>

<p>Me calling someone a truth seeker in jest at the fact that they try to suppress any discussion of narratives that don&#39;t fit their ideologies is not calling someone a shill.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my little way of saying I think you have a closed mind.</p>

<p>Prove me wrong in the future..and I will apologize and refrain from repeating the behavior..</p>

<p>Until then..I have every right in the world to say I think you have a closed mind.</p>

<p>So to say Russian accusations just came about the last couple days is demonstrably false. Rohrabacher added fuel to that fire. </p>

<p>I contacted Hersh on Friday via email. He confirmed to me that it was his voice on the tape by angrily condemning those who he said secretly recorded him, without identifying them.

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder how many knows that there have been two, maybe three professional smear operations against Assange. It was the dating site company that was uncovered, the government group flying to New Zealand for a shady operation that was sent packing by their government and lastly I think I recall some unfounded paedophilia accusations.</p>

<p>Assange has been under attack for some time now. I hope Assange keeps at it, they&#39;re great at spitting truth at the corrupt!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Important plot point..to this day, Wikileaks still has an accuracy track record of 100% on information released.</p>

<p>Information...</p>

<p>The Business Insider is doing what in this article? Are they releasing information? What kind of information?</p>

<p>Is it accurate information? Is it verified information? Have they proven it&#39;s accurate and verified? Journalism use to hold itself to this required standard.</p>

<p>So..while you defend the Business Insider (attempt to) with the questionable argument that a major news publication need not supply proof..</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering why you would do so. And I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s preventing you from even considering the possibility that this is a blatant and unsubstantiated hit piece that is designed to do one thing...discredit Assange.</p>

<p>What&#39;s stopping you from considering that that is their motive? Considering the suspicious timing of the articles release.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/Worldnews is a shit show.</p>

<p>Filled with partisan democrat hacks. I&#39;m a fan of Jeremy Corbyn here in the UK. If Wikileaks and Julian Assange exposed foul play, corruption orchestrated by Corbyn specifically (not a fan of the party in general), I wouldn&#39;t start pointing at how they supposedly treat Russia different or how Wikileaks is  under Russian control (bs). I&#39;m not Russian, I couldn&#39;t give a fuck about them. If they&#39;re providing accurate information to do with my country that&#39;s all I care about. Notice how nobody ever questions the contents of their leaks, it&#39;s the source. As far as I&#39;m aware the &quot;left&quot; who don&#39;t like Wikileaks are apologists for corruption.</p>
