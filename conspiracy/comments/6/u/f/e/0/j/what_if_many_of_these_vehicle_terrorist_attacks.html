    <div class="md"><p>well technically adoption of self-driving technology would shrink the attack surface of &quot;rogue drivers&quot; to a much smaller problem set, and more scalable if coopted payout.  if you just left humans as drivers, coopting all of them, or any particular one of them beings more problematic.  i presume that the tech that runs the driving is easily hackable/exploitable on the general principle that signals can be replayed and teased out, and the driverless tech is ultimately satellite driven so that signal can be overridden.  given all of these things driverless cars are more of a terrorist threat than has-driver-cars are, per unit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a definite possibility. One side effect of the fairly recent Times Square car attack <em>hoax</em> was that IIRC there was discussion about lining the streets of Manhattan with massive barriers to prevent cars from straying onto sidewalks. Anything that more closely resembles a Half-Life-esque police state, I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a similar theory regarding guns during bush jr&#39;s term. Then when obama took office everyone swore guns were going to be taken. And with every mass shooting people became more and more afraid for their guns. After sandy hook gun sales went through the roof. Then no one ever came for the guns. Obama left and prices dropped so hard that some gun companies went out of business. </p>

<p>Cars are a bit different but America has so much expanse and many large parts of the country would not see the self driving infrastructure built for many many many years (rural areas of our country).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably but the tech just isn&#39;t completely there yet &quot;small bugs need to be worked out&quot; plus a massive system is needed to control the cars . Also in some European countries getting a gun isn&#39;t an easy thing to do but renting a moving van is simple and does a lot of damage. The terrorist will find a way because they are not actually terrorist but your government finding out ways to stop the population from killing them. First they will remove guns, then metal knifes then cars then whatever they feel could kill them not for your protection because they can give a rats arse about you but for their protection against you while they hide behind their armies and cops </p>
