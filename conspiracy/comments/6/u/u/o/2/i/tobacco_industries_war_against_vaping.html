        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vaping is a non-harmful alternative to smoking tobacco, yet majority of social response, memes, tweets &amp; videos etc are always there to joke about vaping, to say it&#39;s &#39;gay&#39; or for &#39;try-hards&#39; or &#39;wannabes&#39;. This is merely an active social campaign backed by big tobacco. </p>

<p>Vaping is able to allow smokers to easily quit, they still get their nicotine, it tastes great and doesn&#39;t smell like chemicals and death. Big Tobacco hates this and they want to destroy it!</p>

<p>Funny how you can&#39;t vape in an office or a train in most countries, why? It&#39;s water vapour, non harmful! The Nicotine juice is even illegal in some countries, i.e Australia, WHY? Because of Big Tobacco worldwide lobbying, campaigning and doing what they can to stop the vape nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big Tobacco tries to make vaping look just as dangerous as cigarettes , if not more dangerous. They do this because if people think that , then why quit?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a nonsmoker and are curious about vaping , and think that it&#39;s just as dangerous as cigarettes , why not just try a cigarette?</p>

<p>It&#39;s such a shame that people fall for these tactics. I was a smoker for 30 years and quit absolutely stress free using a vaporizer. It&#39;s changed my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think nicotine in all its forms should be banned in every public setting as it has no value to human biological function, and only serves to bring harm. </p>

<p>Those &quot;water vapors&quot; from a vape isn&#39;t just H2O, it does contain other contaminants that could very well be harmful similar to second hand smoke from traditional cigarettes. Not because one puff is as bad as a puff from a cig, but because people have this belief that it&#39;s pure H2O, and thus many more will vape in area, and by volume it can equal cig second hand smoke. </p>

<p>*...the concerns go beyond nicotine alone.</p>

<p>Some brands contain chemicals including formaldehyde -- often used in building materials -- and another ingredient used in antifreeze that can cause cancer.</p>

<p>Flavors in e-cigs also raise red flags. Some use a buttery-tasting chemical called diacetyl, which is often added to foods like popcorn. When it&#39;s inhaled, it can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Diacetyl is a well-known harmful chemical, which, among other things, causes a lung disease called &#39;popcorn lung,&#39;&quot; says Erika Sward, assistant vice president for national advocacy at the American Lung Association.*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, vapers using e-liquids that contain diacetyl would probably be unable to ever inhale diketones in amounts comparable to what the popcorn workers experienced. Cigarettes contain diacetyl too, and considerably more than any e-liquid. <strong>So is it safe to inhale diacetyl? Probably not, but your odds are better vaping it than smoking. Not all e-liquid contains diketones. And, by the way, no smoker or vaper has been diagnosed with popcorn lung.</strong>       </p>

<p>Right in my first post mate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s harmful. Don&#39;t have to compare it to other things, except the human body. It&#39;s harmful to the human body. I don;t want indirect exposure from someone else vaping. If I&#39;m exposed to it dozens or hundreds of times in a day (which is possible in many places) who&#39;s to say it&#39;s not harmful? Having 1 puff might not kill you, but being exposed to it from dozens or hundreds of vapers regularly is more than &quot;occupational exposure&quot;. Therein lies the harm.</p>

<p>And as a closing, can you prove to a medical certainty it&#39;s harmless? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that little word, &quot;current&quot;? Same misdirection as the cig companies used for decades. &quot;There isn&#39;t any proof currently... blah blah&quot;. </p>

<p>However, everyone agrees that Diacetyl is harmful. Vaping recreationally may not be directly harmful, but being exposed to dozens or hundreds of vapers vapors regularly amounts to a level of harmful.</p>

<p>If you want to vape in your home (or elsewhere with non-vapers around), go right ahead. In public, don&#39;t do it near others since you can not be sure it&#39;s 100% harmless, and you have no idea how much exposure they have had or what condition their lungs are in. Stay away from vaping in public.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard for you to understand other people, but please try. Be considerate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start attacking the person when you you ran out of ammo attacking the facts, eh?</p>

<p>The facts are the facts. Whether nictine is bad or not is not even a question. Countless studies have proven it. Cancer is not the only bad thing that can happen to you. If you are unaware, please research it and you&#39;ll see the rabbit hole nicotine will show you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not using any popcorn industry to say it&#39;s bad, the actual scientists do.</p>

<p>Please feel free to try again with a proper argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns are banned in most counties around the world. Transport of guns are done securely, with the gun secured separately from the firing mechanism and bullets. So yeah, ban guns from being carried in public. Shoot at gun clubs, hunt and have fun, but not in public. </p>

<p>High caloric food doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else. Just make good choices.</p>

<p>Alcohol should be regulated, just as it is. Maybe put a limit on BAC in bars. Hit 0.15 and you&#39;re cut off at bars et al. Caught driving under the influence? Banned from driving for life.
Drinking at home? Go for it! </p>

<p>But most of all, take responsibility for your actions, and be considerate of others. Even if you think it&#39;s only &quot;water vapors&quot; it&#39;s impolite to be clouding up public places, specially indoors. </p>

The tobacco companys make 35 billion a year in PROFIT.   </p>

<p>You can buy a lot of lawmakers for that kind of cash.<br/>
It&#39;s just good business .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing a big part which is the tobacco settlement money and taxes states get.  It&#39;s a big part of their economy and less people smoking is less money.  So it is in their interest to demonize it.</p>

<p>For transparency I quit through vaping after smoking for 14 years.  Watching the government demonize vaping through false information and studies has been an eye open for how screwed up our media and funded studies are.</p>
