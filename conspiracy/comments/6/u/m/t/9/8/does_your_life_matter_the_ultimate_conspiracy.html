        The Lies ‘they’ tell us are all connected
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Synchronicity
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us realize that much of what we have been told or taught is a lie, so that is not really the point of this post. Instead, I wanted to focus on what type of lies we are told, and why we are told those specific lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come across people who seem to think that there is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       agenda. All of this crazy stuff that happens is just random, right?
I would say absolutely not. We can study patterns, and we can figure out what is going on if we really want to. People have gotten so good at doing this that they can predict the next false flag events down to days (seriously just spend some time on 4chan!)
      </p>
      <p>
       When we stop thinking that our daily lives are just full of random events, I feel like we can see the picture more clearly. Everything is connected, and concepts like synchronicity do not have to be completely separated from a scientific worldview:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In my view, synchronicity is a phenomenon that might help bridge scientific and spiritual perspectives in several ways. Firstly, there is scientific evidence for phenomena in the natural world that have features in common with synchronicity. Secondly, the experience of synchronicity can enhance people’s spiritual development in terms of promoting a sense of purpose and meaning, which scientific research has shown can enhance people’s mental health and well-being. Thirdly, recent findings in brain science point to the potential of synchronistic experiences to enhance mental health by promoting neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific and spiritual views of the world are often seen to be antithetical. However, a belief in the validity of synchronistic experience is not inconsistent with a scientific mindset. Indeed, Carl Jung developed his ideas on synchronicity in part through discussions with Albert Einstein. Furthermore, he only came to write about it after active encouragement from Wolfgang Pauli, one of the founders of quantum mechanics. A number of the leading quantum physicists from earlier to more recent times have seen connections between findings in quantum physics and mystical beliefs, including a seeming overlap between synchronicity and established scientific evidence for the phenomenon of entanglement.”

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you do not believe the mystical side of things, we need to stop treating conspiracy events like they are just random and coincidental. Does true randomness exist in an interconnected universe? Even if it does, it is certain that most of the events we experience are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       random.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do understand that this could all be a debate within itself, but the point is that life is not as random as it often seems. Have you heard of six degrees of separation?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All the events we read about daily are linked, especially the conspiratorial events. While my view is more spiritual, I want to write for the people who do not necessarily believe in God or the spiritual side of things (though I’m sure you can guess how I think it all connects). Instead, I am writing to claim that the link between all of these conspiracy theories is that they want you to think that it is all your fault, and there is nothing that can be done to change things. They want you to think it’s all random, and you’re just a victim, and nothing you do really matters. Here is how they do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The One Percent
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I get to the point of the post, I want to clarify that when I say “they” I am referring to the one percent (just want to make sure I am respectfully using pronouns…hehe). They want you to believe that you are responsible for all the problems in the world, when in reality, there is a select group of billionaires who control and own everything and could change everything, if they really wanted to. Let’s not forget that 8 people, 8 people, have as much wealth as half of the world:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50">
        https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, nobody can deny that there is absolutely a 1% (or even less than that) that basically controls everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You are Destroying the World
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite own giant corporations that take a devastating toll on our environment, but it is you, driving your car to work, that needs changing – not them, right? Well, it’s what they want you to think, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just 90 companies caused two-thirds of man made global warming:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change">
        https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you do not believe in global warming, it is clear that they want you to, and they want you to believe you are the one destroying the world. Not them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they tell you to reduce your carbon footprint and maybe brush your teeth less or something (just kidding here). The point is that they are doing nothing to change their actions, but they want you to change yours!
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I am not against doing things to help the world and environment, but I am against people lying to me about who is really in control of it all, and who is really causing the mess – they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global warming is just one example, but think about how much we are told we are collectively destroying the planet, when in reality, there is a small group of people who rule and control everything, especially those big corporations contributing to pollution, toxic waste, greenhouse gases, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one more example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Live in a Tiny House because YOU are destroying the world!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote a post about this once, and it was met with some hostility. If you opt to have a tiny house, then great, but as always, I feel there is a larger agenda here. Tiny houses are a push in the Agenda 21 direction. Here are some qualms and concerns I have about them:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Lack of privacy - it is not healthy or normal for individuals, both kids and adults, to have no privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Spending more for less - this is just getting us more and more used to the rising prices of things and our stagnant incomes
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Lack of socialization - it is really hard to have friends or big families or maybe even the motivation to socialize when you are so crammed. I guess people will just have to go online all day...
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Stress - every being needs adequate space, even rats
      </p>
      <p>
       5) We sure as hell know the elite are not going to be living in tiny houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) How do we start distinguishing between tiny houses and third world living conditions?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to go to point five, and I want you to really think about it. They want YOU to live in a tiny house, but they certainly are not moving out of their extravagant mansions on private islands any time soon, are they? But, you should live in a tiny house because it helps the environment and it is more
       <em>
        sustainable
       </em>
       right? By the way, tiny homes may very well be the future of our cities:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/japans-tiny-homes-are-the-future-of-cities-2015-11">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/japans-tiny-homes-are-the-future-of-cities-2015-11
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think the world’s biggest landowners will be moving into tiny homes any time soon:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-landowners-2011-3">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-landowners-2011-3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the point is that we are again tricked to believe that we need to cut down and reduce (and maybe we do), but there is never any mention of the elite doing so. Rather, they are looked at as admirable for all of their wealth, land, and fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You are Stupid
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do they want you to believe that you are destroying the world, but they want you to believe that you are stupid, too. They want you to believe that society would be much better off without people, so I absolutely believe there is a push for eugenics. I did write an entire post about eugenics, but not many read it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6qjgk5/eugenics_a_forced_prophecy_of_subhumanism_in_a/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6qjgk5/eugenics_a_forced_prophecy_of_subhumanism_in_a/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day on Reddit, I see a post about how the world would just be better off if certain people could stop breeding (and other comments like that). With this myth (that the 1% are truly looking out for us), they look at society and they see just how terrible people are – I mean, why are they so poor and why are they so stupid? It cannot be the class system, or the education system, or anything like that – it is the people themselves. They think eugenics would be a great way to simply control who is born – those of certain and preferable genes would make for the best society, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this the teacher in me, but I believe this is completely false. I believe all beings begin with potential, and while genes do contribute, there are systems in place that determine whether or not somebody will be successful, smart, etc. There is study after study on how your social class will ultimately determine your success:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/social-class-determines-childs-success-934240.html">
        http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/social-class-determines-childs-success-934240.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I do understand that genes have an effect and do shape us, but ultimately, our environment is most important. If our environment (the structures in place) was changed, our world would be a better place, and people would be better overall. Of course, there would always be exceptions, but quite simply, the majority of people thrive in good environments. While there are many studies on this, you might want to read on the “rat park” study:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The study concludes that drugs themselves do not necessarily cause addiction, but the environment is more of an important factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way, the problems of our world are not necessarily caused by some people being inherently stupid or lazy, but rather, environment has a huge impact on what actually happens to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easier, though, for them to just say that you (and most other people) are just naturally stupid and lazy. They want you to believe that they did not create an environment that purposefully fosters the problems we see – Rather, they want you to think it is just all random.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teacher, I know firsthand that the environment of my classroom is one of the top factors correlated with the success of my students. I believe all my students can learn and grow, and that I am responsible for creating an environment where that can be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is ultimately in control of the environments of our lives?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You Perpetuate Hatred
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to believe all of the hatred is caused by you. In reality, they have been using divide and conquer strategies for centuries, and these strategies absolutely work. Let’s think about all of the ways our society is divided:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Rich vs. poor
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Black vs. white (or any racial group vs. another racial group)
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Men vs. women
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Liberal vs. Conservative
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  OR Democrat vs. Republican
      </p>
      <p>
       6)  Adult vs. Children
      </p>
      <p>
       7)  LBGTQ vs Straight?
      </p>
      <p>
       8)  Minorities vs. White
      </p>
      <p>
       9)  Dogs vs. Cats (JK)
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Christian vs. Muslim
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Atheist vs. Christian
      </p>
      <p>
       12) Fat vs. Thin (seriously)
      </p>
      <p>
       13) Teacher vs. Student
      </p>
      <p>
       What did I miss? There are many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can keep going. They create the dichotomy and extremism, so that it is never US against the 1%. There was a movement against the 1% a few years back, and it was sadly squashed. Do you remember Occupy Wall street?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/the-triumph-of-occupy-wall-street/395408/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that we are forced into these black and white groups, and in the process, we never fight those truly in control. We never unite this way, and it works out perfectly for them. By the way, I am not saying that division is never necessary, but it is clear why they divide us. They create the hatred – not us.
There are many psychological operations to make us feel that there is always an enemy. Who is your enemy? I’m sure it is a Trump supporter (or an anti-Trump supporter), or a man, or another woman, or a black person, or the white rich guy, but is your hatred ever for those truly in control?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have to agree with all of Malcom X’s views, but he definitely had some important things to say about the divide and conquer strategy:

       </a>

       It’s nothing new, and they want you to believe that you create the hatred that exists, and it is NOT them.
      </p>

       <strong>
        You are Meaningless

      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of feel like I’m starting a new term – anti-nihilism. I’m over nihilism, and I feel like that is what is being promoted in our society currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       From YOLO to songs about dying young, they want you to believe that your life has no inherent value. And it works doesn’t it?
When is the last time you heard that something you did made a valuable contribution to society? They don’t want you thinking that, and they want very few people feeling that way (except maybe children, but then they crush their dreams). As a teacher, I know that they even have destroyed most teachers’ capacities to instill this meaningfulness in their students
.
First, they absolutely do not want you to think there is a God. Whether or not you believe in God, I hope you consider that the propaganda is currently pushing most people toward atheism, the world’s newest religion:

       And even if you are trying to find value in life, they certainly want to keep you distracted: phones, infotainment, and tv shows occupy most people’s lives. There is little time to spend on meaningful hobbies or interests anymore. Here is an article on why millennials do not have hobbies anymore:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://elitedaily.com/life/millennials-hobbies-anymore/1287244/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe you are searching for the meaning of life, but they want to tell you that there is no meaning through pop culture or others means. I just wrote a post about nihilism perpetuated through tv shows if you’re interested:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, finally, they tell you there is NO GOD, but we are living in some sort of meaningless simulation…but trust them, there is no God. I mean, trust Bank of America:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that they want you to think that your life is meaningless and it has no inherent value. However, their lives are valuable, and they should be worshipped!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do people worship celebrities
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       But scientists have become the new ‘high priests’ of society…Neil Degrasse Tyson anyone? People trust these people and institutions, but they do not think any further than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they twisted it again. We should trust THEM and not anything else. We should worship THEM and nobody else. Yet, people mock the worship of God, but how is it any different?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You cannot help ANYONE, not even yourself
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the biggest lie they tell you is that you cannot help others. They tell you it is best to be selfish and look out for yourself and not try to change things. By the way, before I write this segment, I am not saying that one should be walked over or should be abused or anything like that. As somebody who has been in those positions, I now know the difference between helping others and being taken advantage of…
      </p>
      <p>
       They make it seem as though the only people who can help the world are those who make millions (and end up getting whatever they donate back in taxes). They make it seem that changing the world can only be done by noble prize winners, or people who went to Harvard (insert other college here). The point is, they are lying to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier on
       <a href="/r/c_s_t">
        /r/c_s_t
       </a>
       , somebody said that it was truly not possible to help others – that we must live for ourselves. I completely disagree. We can
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       help others, in the most simple ways. 
Serving others if the ultimate form of worship. Even if you do not believe in God, serving others is the ultimate form of humility. There is a way to serve others every single moment of the day – from the comment you write online, to your kindness to the waitress at the restaurant. To the smile at a stranger, to bringing food to the homeless guy down the road. It is endless. There are an infinite of ways to help those around you, and that is that. Your thoughts and actions you put into the universe ultimately reflect on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, they make you believe that you have to be rich or famous or ‘something special’ to help anybody, and I want to tell you right now, that is NOT true. They want to associate the power of helping others to this elite group, but we all have the power within ourselves. Do you see how they twist things? You don’t have to be Angelina Jolie to help the world (don’t worry, she’s in the illuminati anyway lol). You can just be you and do good things for anybody at anytime  (if you so choose).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, study after study shows that the secret to happiness is helping others:
      </p>

        http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not the mansion. Not the power. Not the money. Helping others.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You do not have freewill
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe ultimately they just want us to believe we are rats in cages. I know at times life does feel like we have no free will, but I do think we do. I do not think we are living in a simulation, like Bank of America says. While there are many factors beyond our control (probably at least 75% of our lives or more), I still feel we have at least 10% free will, and they can’t take that away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The debate about free will vs. fate has been argued for centuries, so I do not think I can find any actual studies on it, but I do think every day we have a choice of at least our thoughts, if nothing else, and our thoughts become our actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they convince us we do not have free will, they can fully take control of us. Even Richard Dawkins said, “I am very comfortable with the idea we can override biology with free will.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion: You Matter (The Ultimate Conspiracy)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are reading this tonight, I want you to know you do matter. If you have worked with children, you KNOW THIS. If you have children, you know this. No matter what race, ethnicity, religion, etc. children are, we know that they are the most beautiful souls imaginable. What I mean is, if you are a racist reading this, certainly you would not hate a black child (or a white child)? When we look at children, we see them as pure and innocent, and really, they are. Eventually, they are corrupted by the world, which means, we have all been corrupted by the world. We were all once children - even the worst of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no matter what views you hold, I would hope you would never tell a child they do not matter. But, don’t stop there…I hope you would never tell another human being they do not matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This elite group wants to make you believe you are low, stupid, and desperate. They want you believe that you deserve the atrocities of the world. They want you to believe that you caused them, but can’t you see how they twist things?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are wrong. You are not low. You are not stupid. And you are not desperate. You have a beautiful soul that is capable of many things in life, no matter what they lead you to believe, and ultimately, maybe you do have some free will (even if very little), and maybe life has some meaning (no matter what you believe).
      </p>
      <p>
       If my conclusion is a little corny, I do apologize, but I believe that every person has value. I read a quote the other day: The people we do not get along with are our teachers. Even the people we dislike have value in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       To end with a quote,
      </p>
      <p>
       “I believe that I am not responsible for the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of life, but that I am responsible for what I do with the life I've got.” 
― Hermann Hesse, Verliebt in die verrückte Welt: Betrachtungen, Gedichte, Erzählungen, Briefe
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate conspiracy it that you matter.

       Well, guy you replied to originally was subversively taking a jab at one of the two "sides" we have forming right now, saying that people here are all racist/homophobic, implying that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a haven for them at the least. You replied to him saying that it sucks how divisive things are, which was just fine and a nice thing to say, but other bro who said he "was taking the post seriously" is on the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       "side", and so he saw you replying amicably as you yourself siding with the "everyone is a Nazi" side of this whole schism. Man that's confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so OG poster=I hate Nazis party

      <p>
       You replied nicely to him.

      <p>
       2nd poster=People who call others Nazis are tools of the system, sheep, or shills.. party

       2nd poster wanted you to be in the same party, so he got upset when you weren't disagreeable with OG poster.

       Very well said. People always assume they're powerless. A good example to include in here is about learned helplessness. Elephants held captive are at first chained with metal and after a while only rope, which they don't even bother attempting to break because they've learned they can't break their bondage.

       The thing is, they're not smart enough to realize the metal has been replaced with ropes. An analogous mind prison for a human needs to be much more complex, but follow the same principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words: When you lack the mental capacity to determine whether you can indeed flee, you may feel like maybe you can, but never be sure enough to try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like MKUltra surely yielded a lot of results and data on how to construct such a mind prison that is close to impossible to escape on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing about the elephants: What if they are aware that they could tear through that rope but simply know that even if they do, they will eventually be caught with even bigger metal?

       It's the same. Human beings are just on level 3 mindfuck instead of level 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fail to realize that its not even rope holding us in bondage anymore rofl, it's IMAGINATION. We have the potential to find unity and change everything we know about the world for the better within the hour you read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your imagination can always construct "bigger metal" as most humans do. The plot twist though is there is no metal. Once we collectively realize that - we win.

      <p>
       Considering how fast I've seen memes rip through the collective consciousness I'm more than just hopeful these days, I'm becoming certain.

       Ive been meditating on this a lot. All people hate this social system but they play along with it everyday. Getting up driving to work, paying taxes, keeping up with politics. This all one big social construct that THE PEOPLE play along with. If we collectively stopped playing along all at once they couldn't do anything. Were so close to breaking out of the system at all times but we don't. Why? Why don't humans just stop playing along with this construct?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm ready to stop playing along if others are. And spend my limited time on this beautiful planet the way it should be spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       When others are ready to stop playing along with this game Ill be ready but until then I guess ill keep going.

       Good post, but as someone who knows about drug addicts-I take huge issue with the conclusions of the rat park study. I can go into detail if requested. One variable I'll mention is that humans are not rats.

       I'll get long-winded later, but a short answer is: ALL my fellow teen/20-25 year old suburban friends were pretty well off (One could cite so called "Affluenza"). We had "toys" such as cars and plenty of music equipment, plus stuff to do-we began as potheads who were into pot making everything better. Opiates got readily available and we didn't even know what we had on our hands immediately. But percs felt GREAT! We weren't snorting ritalin and popping percs and smoking weed or walking around on acid because we lived in the ghetto. My friend who was the most spoiled was the quickest to get into cocaine and IV drug use. No shortage of the human equivalent of what the drug free rats had. We did these drugs and other drugs as a group, not because we were necessarily lonely or felt disenfranchised or poor or powerless.

       In my opinion humans are a lot like trees or plants. Our happiness is sunshine while hard times and difficulties are our rain. If we have nothing but sunshine we don't grow. On top of that I also think the seeking of happiness leads in and of itself to a hedonistic lifestyle. Hedonism usually leads towards addictions of various types. Look into Jordan Peterson and his maps of meanings course on youtube. He is a college psychology professor and it is amazing.

       I think to add to your idea of an affluenza, a lot of people have much more than they need. "More money, more problems." I don't think it's a coincidence that we have such large consumer debt and such high rates of mental illness. We have as a species, I think, almost forgotten how to produce things on our own. I think that this issue is definitely made worse by our obsession with technology and social media and a lack of mindfulness towards the slot-machine like design of things like facebook and snapchat.

       Read Professor Ted Kaczynski's essay "Industrial society and the future" It gives root causes for drug abuse/addiction that are in line with what you wrote. Namely "oversocialization." I happened to be in a South Florida area that was just flooded with all sorts of goodies and I was a pushover and easily influenced into trying drugs which I turned out to like a little too much. We all had the money for recreational drugs, plus job opportunities to find our habits, whice would not be the case in places like inner city areas. Having drugs made any given person "popular" as did a place to hang out and get high freely. At least 2 of my friends and 1 acquaintance are dead from overdosing.(long before any news stories of an opioid epidemic). If the Rat Park study were true when applied to humans, there wouldn't be high relapse rates in 12 step groups. The retention rates might be higher than they are and rehabs wouldn't have revolving doors.

       I completely agree with your point that humans are much more complex than rats and can't just be placed in a "rat park" where they won't feel the slightest inclination to do drugs (The rat park scenario is a gross oversimplification but contains some very interesting ideas)...there's no priority placed on mental well being in our current society and I think the lack of freedom (you have to buy things you want or pay for a class/degree) and especially imagination we have in our lives contribute to this matrix-like society where people seek to get better at consuming things than taking time and energy to improve themselves and be mindful especially of over-consumption/reliance.

       At the very least, a human equivalent 'rat park' would be quite different from a rat version of 'rat park'. The human mind needs to be able to access specific healthy forms of stimulation that rats may not need imo.

       It's not just that there are exceptions, it's that drugs just work a certain way physically. I have a great life and absolutely needed a new environment to kick my procrastination addiction and porn addiction out. But drugs like heroin are simply such an insane overload to the brain that it doesn't matter what the environment is, the brain will continue to seek that high.

       We are thinking creatures that are left to own devices when it comes to how we want to live, how we think we should live, and how through no fault of our own we are all inevitably compelled, coerced, and inculcated to live by a culture we were simply born into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far too many factors to deal with that we have no control or influence over and worse yet aren't even aware of in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all wind up doing a lot of pretending as a result. Pretending to care about things we don't actually care about, or to not care when we actually do. A litany of self-betrayals and false faces that are necessary to navigate our way through a society we didn't create or have any real say in virtually from the day we were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       We persevere and press on and try to make the best of it and yes some souls are simply overwhelmed by it all or fall by the wayside as a result. Something inside and about them as individuals that doesn't seem to have any place or worth or way to be expressed, not because it doesn't have a value but because it isn't acknowledged or given any in our over-commercialized and commoditized world. They want to believe in themselves and yet can't find anyone else that does to provide some evidence and re-assurance that they should and need to. Lost, alone, and alienated, and looking for some way, any way, to escape that feeling.

       Recovered alcoholic/addict here. Everyone I know, myself included, who has suffered from addiction of any kind, has something in common: they never felt comfortable in their own skin. In many cases, a traumatic event in childhood or adolescence goes hand-in-hand with this (which would be an environmental factor), but not necessarily. Something about our brains is hypersensitive, and makes us feel fundamentally different from "normal" people, whether we're conscious of it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the Rat Park study that there is nothing inherently addictive about drugs or alcohol, they just make you feel good. However, as I understand it, addiction is centered in the brain, not the environment. More often than not the environment is a major factor in developing addiction, but it's secondary. A person can become addicted to anything that produces pleasure, anything that taps into the reward centers of the brain. Sex, candy, exercise, etc. Over time the brain begins to rewire itself around that activity, and will seek it out as ruthlessly as it would food, water, or oxygen.

       Not at all! I didn't get that impression from your post, of which addiction is only a small part. Tbh I was mostly fleshing out these ideas for myself as I was writing my comment. It is still kind of a mystery for me. It's something that you can't really understand unless you live with it (and who would want to, anyway?) and even then you don't really understand it...

       Part of me doesn't even want to believe that there is more because it would make me realize how much was taken from me and I'm not ready to deal with that kind of pain.

       Think of it as "taken from you" is one way to think of it. A rather depressing way, sure, but it's not the only way. You could view it as something your soul didn't need and temporarily let go of. Or you could see that whatever it was was never "yours" to begin with, which can be kinda liberating. However far the true extent of conscious existence spans, we'll experience it again. Probably after our bodies die. Maybe while we're still "alive" for the lucky few of us. But while we're in this time-dictated dimension conscious experience through the filter of these bodies we inhabit will always obscure the true nature of reality. Don't worry about what you don't have, and don't worry about losing what you have now. Everything comes and goes. Even life. Just enjoy the now as best you can!

       Corny can be good, it seems more altruistic and genuine if you speak from the heart of a child (just the simplicity, not immaturity) than speaking as a lawyer on a case. Society is a bit sick at the moment and could use all the altruistic love it can get, corny or not. :)

       I have been told by other teachers that I'm too corny...not necessarily as an insult (I don't think)
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think for me I am sometimes uncomfortable with it because I was raised in a very loveless household so I'm always afraid people will not like me being this way. I don't know if that makes any sense.

       That's good, it probably wasn't. At least hopefully if they were teachers, lol.

       Oh, yes.. I know that feeling. It's what led me to seek the answers to these questions, to even see the issues themselves instead of just accepting the suffering at face value. It's interesting... how the negative tendencies in people running amok can be the cause for a great amount of positive change. Just like negativity, positivity is a disease in the sense that it spreads from person to person and can be like a seed. :) the inside of the sickness lies the antidote.

       Excellent points. I had
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6u9xht/are_the_pyramids_a_terraforming_device/">
        a post
       </a>
       the other day presenting a rather wild idea that an ancient, very advanced antediluvian civilisation put up the pyramid network as a geoengineering system to mitigate climate change. Several commenters remarked on these ancient guys:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "highly intelligent and passionate architects"
       </p>
       <p>
        "The truly neat thing about the pyramids is not their scale, it is their precision. That requires high mathematical competency which is very abstract thought. Mathematicians are some of the most careful, precise, considered thinkers on the planet. That these existed in droves necessary to do all the astrological work tells you about a society that was living luxurious lives by modern standards..... what it tells you about is the magic of a society organized towards the interest of the people, the magic of living in harmony, and so on. The pyramid is remarkable only in the sense of the remarkable fall man has experienced in the intervening period, not so much a remarkable achievement in itself."
       </p>
       <p>
        "As a species we did that, we made those, we are capable of amazing things if we put our minds to it and can get enough people to make a collective effort towards a common goal."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, we are truly capable of great achievements. What has the current 1% elite brought to mitigate climate change though? Global carbon tax and the agenda that our lives do not matter.

       I might not have a useful opinion, but I feel like I need to at least put it out to be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate Jung and associated Eranos group for, in general, synthesizing spiritual and scientific. What you're talking about seems to me more as an existential problem akin to Nietzsche's "Religion of Comfortableness."
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% (as you say) is an advantageous group. But a Tiny House is a function of the onslaught of capitalism and mankind's lust for order, not an intentional action by a small group of assholes - unless that group is people that make tiny houses - the idea becomes popular because it's what gets attention in a world of normal houses and so propagated by those that seek attention for their products, normal people living every day that make those choices without having attention to the negatives you're listing because they found a way to gain pieces of paper from others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are noting negatives of something that is "normally" associated with positives. Any technology, any idea, has a gradient of response, but it just becomes what's shown. These perspectives are out there, just not popularized for attention (which is why I'm glad to see them here, thanks). I can't say that's a conspiracy, people are changed by media (and themselves), media is changed by people (and itself to further its' interests down the line, but just a piece of that problem).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dichotomies have provided an important and needed component for consciousness and our advancement (you know this, you use them a few times in the post). But dichotomies in the western world seem to be seen as exclusive binaries - not the limits of a wholeness in a unity. Natural human state to put the world in ordered terms in our quest of order seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything this is a problem because our culture propagates the framework of binary which in turn benefits those that grab control instead of power. Human nature pushes that (muddled by the butterfly effect of conscious manipulation of one another, such as the formulation of capitalism) - but not some greedy men that just feed off of it skillfully, even if they extensive exert efforts to continue their own means of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for helping others, I agree with my understanding of Nietzsche again, offering that we should embrace helping the weak, but not to fetishize it as a way of dissuading fabricated societal guilt. That distinction deserves to be made. Associating "them" to the power of helping others though, I haven't considered that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for posting, I see your posts occasionally and enjoy that you're creating discussion. Despite my criticism I still get that it's a useful call to an action I support.

       Generally the predictions are made on /pol/. Go to 4chan archive /pol/ and in the search bar type in something like, "false flag predictions". They aren't always right but they have been on occasion.

       A neurotransmitter called oxytocin is likely a contributing factor to in-group and out-group mentalities (particularly along ethnic boundaries), as suggested along by Dreu et al. (abstract link below).  People subconsciously dividing into groups is at least partially natural.

       Nice post, and I agree for the most part, and entirely with the primary contention. Even when entirely viewed through the rigid lens of science, life itself is inescapably teleological, and even Darwin uses the term
       <em>
        final cause
       </em>
       in Origin of species. "Final cause" is an Aristotelian conception which refers to teleology: innate
       <em>
        meaning
       </em>
       that everything in existence is
       <em>
        striving towards
       </em>
       . Life itself is meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one place where I would disagree would be concerning your assumptions on the value of the life of a child that
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       would and should attribute. Cattle have higher esteem in the eyes of many, and I am not even talking about the hapsburg-chin motherfuckers who rape them and bathe in their blood, I mean the vast majority of
       <em>
        Homers
       </em>
       who prefer McBurger to McBabies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to seriously fix shit and even I can see that many people
       <em>
        should not be breeding
       </em>
       . It is building an iodiocracy, brick by living brick. I'm not into eugenics, but simply observant of what is happening around me. People are being dumbed down to the point that they are adult babies having children, who are then often having children
       <em>
        as children
       </em>
       . I know
       <em>
        every child is special
       </em>
       , but they are getting more and more short bus special and less and less kodak moment special the longer this all goes on...

       As for children I think that's another conspiracy that I've written about.

       I think that yes many people are starting to hate or grow apathetic toward the thought of children and I feel that is absolutely purposeful.

       Great post except I disagree with your last bit on children. Why do you say everyone has been corrupted once they are not children? Why people say only children are innocent? There are many people who haven't been corrupted or have withstood corruption after their time of being a child.

       Working with children they truly change at about 11-12. My 8th graders come to me and even acknowledge that as the point they lost their innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying children are 100% innocent. But they are mostly pure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why Jesus says one must be like a child to enter the kingdom of heaven.

       Oh yes I definitely agree that many children change at that age. i remember my private school the kids there were totally different from the public school I had to transfer to for a year. I experienced it first hand against me, the 8th graders (and 7th graders) bullied other people, me, talking about people behind their back, used swear words, make fun of kids shows they used to watch, etc. They become 'little adults'. I've always wondered why so many kids change at that junction, I guess it's hormones. But some kids don't change like that, a small percentage grow up to still contain an innocence within. sigh, it really is too bad. Thanks for your insight, it is much welcomed.

       Great post! I've had similar thoughts lately and I think a lot or it comes down to identity and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think empathy plays a big role in why our existence seems so hard to grasp. You can analyse a structure and by the time you're done it has already changed. Identity seems like a mean to navigate between these two methods. Analysis and empathy.

       Reminds me of what I personally think of as the "Mozart phenomenon" which can equally apply to other "crafted personas" like Shakespeare and Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we've been taught that
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       genius appears only once every generation or two, and that the "rest" of us can never achieve such heights.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mozart" became such a trademark back in the day, that many aspiring composers simply labeled their work "Mozart" to get it more attention...it was essentially an entire industry. Now, a good portion of "Mozart's" works aren't even composed by the historical Amadeus (his ties to Freemasonry are also indicative of sort form of deception...see the Magic Flute and the circumstances of his death).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Shakespeare was
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       not the author of those plays...they were written by
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       people (likely including Edward de Vere, John Dee, and others).
      </p>
      <p>
       Much has been written about the suspicious histories of certain scientific luminaries like Einstein and Hawking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are not what they seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to admire these individuals as gods, and not men, because they want us to continue to forget that we are gods ourselves.

       And yes if you read a book on any subject such as quantum mechanics or the holographic universe you know 1000% or more percent than most people you will meet. It just takes effort. And about hawking, it may not be a fair question, but if he was such an epic genius why can't he heal himself? The reason is that his knowledge comes from a paradigm where such things are not possible. Someone like Dispenza actually did heal himself and opens so many minds.

       I was thinking the other day that true genius like lets just use a common example. Einstein and the theory of relativity. He had to develop a branch of math and do this by hand. Today's standards we would call that person insane and they would inevitably be doped up on "anti psychotics" or whatever class of poison they sell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the overbranding of mental illness is to keep humans at a weaker level?
 What if the ones we call crazy now a days are the Einstein's of the past?

       I would ask you to consider that the 1% vs the 99% is another divisive strategy. Most people in the 1% are just as much in the rat race but have just been successful at it. The actual top of the pyramid is much, much smaller than 1%, perhaps .01% or even .0001%

       Here are some choice quotes for folks who may have missed reading it:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Just 90 companies caused two-thirds of man-made global warming emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The climate crisis....has been caused largely by just 90 companies, which between them produced nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions generated since the dawning of the industrial age [Year 1750], new research suggests.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The companies range from investor-owned firms – household names such as Chevron, Exxon and BP – to state-owned and government-run firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Half of the estimated emissions were produced just in the past 25 years [!!] – well past the date when governments and corporations became aware that rising greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of coal and oil were causing dangerous climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Between them, the 90 companies on the list of top emitters produced 63% of the cumulative global emissions of industrial carbon dioxide and methane between [the year] 1751 to 2010, amounting to about 914 gigatonne CO2 emissions, according to the research.  / All but seven of the 90 were energy companies producing oil, gas and coal. The remaining seven were cement manufacturers." /
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nearly 30% of emissions were produced just by the top 20 companies, the research found.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Meanwhile, Oreskes, who has written extensively about corporate-funded climate denial, noted that several of the top companies on the list had funded the climate denial movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       " 'For me one of the most interesting things to think about was the overlap of large scale producers and the funding of disinformation campaigns, and how that has delayed action,' she said.

       did you reflect on the idea of 'ownership'? - How would you react to the statement: "You are thinking inside the idea framework provided by those you seek to oppose."
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, a bit more metaphorical: "You are looking at the veil, but not beyond."

       However, I feel like there is one truth and anybody can find that one truth - rich or poor, black or white...it is open to everyone and they can never hide it.

      <p>
       They try to hide it and make you think it's not real.

       I do not rly differ between the abrahamic religions (jewism, christianity, islamism ... and all other subcategories). They are too identical in their base philosophy of dividing the world and values into some abstract "good" and "evil". Additionally they all prey to the
       <strong>
        exact same
       </strong>
       thingy they call god, which they interpret as an omniscient and omnipotent conscious being... (which is contradicting in itself, from my point of interpretation of the world - i would assume that omniscience/omnipotence is exclusive to/with a conscious form being)
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       essential thing they differ in:
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslim: "I like Mohamed."
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ: "I like Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
       Jew: "Me no like."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       :/
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you avoided my initial question - or maybe i formulated it not clearly enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think of the idea called 'ownership'? Do you think ownership is something intrinsic to being or do you think ownership is a social construct of humans? (I usually do not like to ask "or-questions", because they put the questioned one on a pre-defined path...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your initial post stated that those who seem in power own stuff - without questioning the idea of ownership itself. I just wanted to give you a little push in that direction ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       oh, and plz tell me you are no agent of the jesuits T_T (
       <code>
        truth is Christ
       </code>
       rings a lot of alarm bells inside my mind.)
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: to clarify a bit further, 'huhu' is just another form of saying hi, hey, hello, holla, ollah, konichi wa, [...]

       As for ownership....I think every human should have the right to the basics.

       And as Tupac said, you can have a nice mansion, but you don't need 10 nice mansions.

       This is honestly something I haven't contemplated well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Christianity is the only of those that says Jesus is God. So that's how it differs.

       I'm currently of the belief that the secret being held back from us is not that any of these religions are right; more that we are capable of much more as humans than we are led to believe. I think spirituality intermixed with science and technology will propel the race forward.

       It also equates Jesus with God many times throughout the bible. God sent Jesus for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) We could not see or comprehend the heavenly form of God. The Bible states the light of angels was blinding...so I don't think it would be even possible to see God in this realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) God in his ultimate state is largely incomprehensible to most. The Bhagavad Gita states that most cannot comprehend Braham (universal God), so the personal form of God (Krishna) is a way to connect. I believe that applies here. Jesus was sent so we could better understand God's ways (which are likely very hard for us to understand)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) We cannot be perfect like God. However, we can try to be like Jesus, God in human form. Jesus is the model we should be following.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The bible supports the trinity (though I'm not Catholic)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also offer versus if you're interested!

       It's possible! To me though I think the secret is that we can all connect with God.

       The Freemasons  (and other secret societies) say that this knowledge is only for a select few. But the bible says this knowledge is for everyone.

       While some of the contributing factors to people undervaluing their lives are purposefully devised, I feel that much of the problem comes from people expecting meaning in life to be handed to them rather than discovered by them.

       Fantastic post! I archived it. You're spot on about the main goal of all of this (to permanently separate humans from God and make them mind-controlled slaves for the .01%). Also, don't feel like you need to engage the trolls. You'll never get anywhere with OverexertedUndereducated (whatever his real name is). He's a programmed shill.

       I do not rly differ between the abrahamic religions (jewism, christianity, islamism ... and all other subcategories). They are too identical in their base philosophy of dividing the world and values into some abstract "good" and "evil". Additionally they all prey to the
       <strong>
        exact same
       </strong>
       thingy they call god, which they interpret as an omniscient and omnipotent conscious being... (which is contradicting in itself, from my point of interpretation of the world - i would assume that omniscience/omnipotence is exclusive to/with a conscious form being)
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       essential thing they differ in:
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslim: "I like Mohamed."
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ: "I like Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
       Jew: "Me no like."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       :/
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you avoided my initial question - or maybe i formulated it not clearly enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think of the idea called 'ownership'? Do you think ownership is something intrinsic to being or do you think ownership is a social construct of humans? (I usually do not like to ask "or-questions", because they put the questioned one on a pre-defined path...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your initial post stated that those who seem in power own stuff - without questioning the idea of ownership itself. I just wanted to give you a little push in that direction ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       oh, and plz tell me you are no agent of the jesuits T_T (
       <code>
        truth is Christ
       </code>
       rings a lot of alarm bells inside my mind.)
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: to clarify a bit further, 'huhu' is just another form of saying hi, hey, hello, holla, ollah, konichi wa, [...]

       A neurotransmitter called oxytocin is likely a contributing factor to in-group and out-group mentalities (particularly along ethnic boundaries), as suggested along by Dreu et al. (abstract link below).  People subconsciously dividing into groups is at least partially natural.
