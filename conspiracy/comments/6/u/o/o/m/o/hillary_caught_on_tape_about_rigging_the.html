         “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.”

         According to
         <a href="http://observer.com/2016/10/2006-audio-emerges-of-hillary-clinton-proposing-rigging-palestine-election/">
          an article by The Observer,
         </a>
         "On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.  The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.  The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Chomsky recalls being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea - offered by a national political leader, no less - that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is 100% proof that she is willing to debauch an electoral process.  This also shows that she knows what it takes to rig an election.

       My favorite was in the Podesta emails, one of the foreign campaign donations to Clinton came from a guy running for president in Libya. There was also a FARA filed between this guy and Podesta because he gave Podesta a ton of money for "political consultancy" or some such nonsense that made zero sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Translation = pay-to-play, foreign edition. Whoever gave Clinton the most money of the Libyan candidates was going to be chosen for president in their own country owing to the fact that the US oversees elections in countries they destabilize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting were the campaign contributions coming from the Libyan asset recovery fund. Basically, some of the liquid assets looted from Libya during Clinton's time as Sec of State then went to her presidential campaign.

       I personally think these were more damning than the above comments, but ah well.

       How does Podesta have anything to do with Trump? Maybe I don't see the same type of posts you do around here but people seem to be vehemently against Trump regardless of beliefs about human-trafficking.

       Are we gonna ignore the analysis done just last week that 100% proved that T_D has an overwhelming amount of users here and makes the front page at an extremely high rate? Even with that proof we're still gonna just go ahead and say, "nope, nothing strange about the all the weird/fast votes and cross over with a political sub known to like doing just that?" Ok, good, just checking.

       Don't you think it's possible that most of conspiracy users became trump supporters when trump decided to run?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the majority of conspiracy users knew the government was corrupt. We knew the government like to coverup things. We knew they weren't to be trusted to have our interest in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump rallies were dominated with lock her up chants due to her being one of those many corrupt people. Not to mention the drain the swamp comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of overlap I agree, maybe more than what your willing to admit to. That analysis doesn't show what happened before during and after, only after the election. So that analysis is missing a lot of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are those users brigading this sub, are were they here all the time. That's the question I want answered.

      <p>
       No. But it is possible that many Trump supporters are conspiracy theorists and thus found there another logical subreddit to frequent.
      </p>
      <p>
       however in my opinion, the biggest exodus of T_D users to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was the banning of
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       . That was when things really started taking a turn and this became a political sub and no longer just about conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the DNC vs Bernie Sanders conspiracy also made this sub very political.

      <p>
       How can you say that when conspiracy theorists and this sub existed long before trump was in a position to be supported.

       We knew the media wasn't to be trusted, and seeing them turn on trump so hard might have a role in that. The enemy of my enemy...and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now than trump labeled the media fake news, we now all of a sudden give credence to what MSM says?
      </p>
      <p>
       The voices didn't change, they want a transparent government and somewhat have that now. The voices you hear are the true conspiracy nuts that makes this sub fighting the political shills from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy isnt about being anti-government. It is about exposing what people want covered up. If a clown conspired to commit a crime we wouldn't be anti-circus now would we?

       The whole reason many of us voted for Trump is because we knew that the corrupt establishment career politicians would hate it. We knew that if he couldn't get the economy pointed in the right direction, he probably would run the country into the ground. This is exactly what we wanted him to do, fuck the government up even worse than it was already fucked, so people would finally get pissed off enough to the point that there would be dead politicians hanging from lampposts in Washington, D.C., which is exactly what they deserve for fucking us over so hard the last 50 years. Those of us in the middle/poor classes that still have a functioning set of balls are pissed off and we're tired of getting fucked.

       You mean reddit as a whole? What does that even mean? You think the actual subreddits trend conservative, or the people who view them? The largest subreddits typically contain comments that I would not say trend right. Usually quite the opposite. Which would likely mean the majority of users on this site dont trend conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER. This is based purely off observation and I have no proof of it. But neither do you. What makes you think that the rest of Reddit trends conservative? Maybe because of the echo chambers you hang out in? It happens to everyone, you think that things are much more popular or common simply because of the company you are frequently around. But it is not representative of any type of whole on this website or in society as whole.

       How does that makes sense? She says the push for the election itself was a mistake. They would obviously have projections. To determine who would win, in this context, translates to have direct or indirect influence. To what degree we don't know because it didn't happen, but I think it's a pretty clear reading.

       Antifa look and behave something like ISIS. Masked men running around destroying property and physically attacking people for simply having a different political opinion. If you don't think it's wrong to condemn this violent hate group then there is probably no hope.

       Just because she lost the election doesn't mean we should forget she's corrupt as fuck. Just as Trump is an obvious and easy target on the "right", hillary is an obvious and easy target on the "left". They're both corrupt. It's not "whataboutism", it's saying "yes, but also be aware of this because it shows how both 'sides' are not accurate representations of what you think they represent"

       I spent three hours yesterday watching a football game instead of being outraged by Nazis. It was hard, but in the end I felt fine. You're probably not a football fan, but if you happen to see a game, you'll notice that the crowd doesn't all have picket signs about Nazis or Russians. Maybe you could start a thread about that problem because it's only going to get worse in the next few months. Hundreds of thousands of people will be distracted from your preferred news topics. I don't mean to sound alarmist or anything. Anyway good luck with your content crusade.

       Are you outraged by the fact that HRC had conversations about manipulating an election in another country? If so, you're being successfully distracted. You're falling for someone else's agenda.

       Ooh, let me guess, it's the Russians! It's the Russians' agenda isn't it?! You bring up a good point though, there isn't a subreddit for people to discuss only your approved conspiracies. I tried r/jay_howardsConspiracies but apparently it's not a thing.   Maybe someone needs to create it, because when I browse Reddit all I see is distraction after distraction.

       Really? Are you equally preoccupied with the war crimes of the Cheney administration? Or 9/11? Why aren't you pushing for the prosecution of Dick Cheney? He's also a private citizen with tentacles that reach deep into the political-military-industrial machinery, who has committed countless acts of violence on others for profit. Where's your outrage? Probably in the same place as mine: nowhere to be found because it's not helpful to the current situation.

       If you can't see that, you're being successfully distracted. If this forum has a purpose, it should be to help people open their eyes to the hijacking of their consciousness. It's happening with every HRC story.

       It's obvious to me, but to many, they cannot help themselves. If there's a fire in front of you, don't let someone tell you that another fire down the street is even worse. Unless you want the place to burn. Then at least we understand each other.

       Avoiding my question, I see. Listen man, I've been a conspiracy theorist for a long fucking time now, and I don't believe something just because someone tells me. So you can stop trying to belittle me with your pitiful assumptions. How many of those big criminal bankers got arrested in 2008 after the financial banking crisis? One. Same concept is applied here with Hillary. Corruption.

       outraged? All my focus isn't on Hillary, but she was the subject of our conversation. Here, I'll try to use an example to see where you're coming from. Let's say a pedophile has been committing crimes people demand he should be prosecuted, but then another pedophile takes his place and starts molesting kids and shit; in your way of thinking, we should focus on the newest one? Why not prosecute them both? Hmmm. I hope you understand my point. I understand your concern for not getting distracted by current events, but that doesn't mean we just completely forget about everything else that's happened and turn a blind eye.

       You still haven't made sense of why HRC isn't being prosecuted. If there's enough evidence to convict, why doesn't some ambitious DA go after her. It would make a career instantly. The real answer you can't seem to grasp is that the evidence to convict doesn't exist.

       Like there wasn't enough evidence to convict the big bankers responsible for the 2008 banking crisis, right? You're a broken fucking record. Corruption is the answer.

       You ask how she hasn't been convicted if she's a criminal, I told you why and gave you a simple example. I never called her a murder or a fraudster, and I never used the line "international gangster" (you were the one who did that) but you gotta keep putting words in my mouth to make your argument sound better don't you? Why are you trying so hard to defend her? I'm not the one talking about Hillary Clinton in every post (besides this conversation we're having), in fact, I hardly

       You didn't tell me why she wasn't convicted. You just said "look at the bad bankers. They weren't convicted. Does it surprise you she's not convicted?" Yes. Yes it does. She lost to a very unlikable opponent because she's easy to hate. That means there are tonnes of federal, state and local authorities who would
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to convict the shit out of her.
      </p>

       And yet, she's free. Why? Do all these police agencies not have access to the internet like you? If only they could read that case-cracker article from the "The Daily Distraction" like you, maybe they'd realize she murders and eats babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you still linger under this fantasy like HRC has some magic shield around her. Such nonsense. You haven't made a cogent case yet for what she should be convicted of. Let's hear it. We're so far down this thread, no one will ever have to know what absolute horseshit you call "the truth". Please. What do you think should be priority #1 for convicting HRC?

       I said corruption. Can you not fucking read? I never said she murders or eats babies. You really can't stop putting words in my mouth, can you. Tell me why the big bankers weren't convicted, or why Nixon wasn't convicted, or why the NSA didn't get in any legal trouble for illegally spying on US citizens (they even admitted to it). If that's the groundwork of your argument, that "if Hillary ever committed any criminal a criminal act, than why hasn't she been prosecuted, huh? Huuuh", than it's obviously a terrible fucking argument, and i think you know it is. I asked you earlier if you think Hillary has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       committed a criminal act, and you said
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       . Kinda contradicting yourself man. And it looks like no one is ever going to see these comments cause they stopped showing up on the thread awhile ago, so maybe that's why you're going on and on with your deluded shitty arguments. I'm talking to a brick wall. Stop riding Hillary's dick.

       Now, who's not reading for comprehension? Has she committed a crime? Yea, likely. Is there a criminal case to be made? Doesn't appear so. Like I said, if you have the evidence that the FBI can't seem to get, and you really feel as strongly about "locking her up" as you say, why not share it with the FBI? Probably because there isn't any evidence worth a damn.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she's guilty of something that can be proven, fucking prosecute her to fullest extent possible. I'd love to see that too. But it's just not a priority. I don't know if you realize this, but we have a fucking traitor in the White House. Why isn't that important to you?

       I never said it's not important. Fuck, man, stop putting words in my mouth. I literally just said Hillary isn't my priority. There wasn't any evidence for the 2008 banking crisis, right? See, your argument points are fucking deluded. There was
       <em>
        definitly
       </em>
       evidence for that shit, but only
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       person was prosecuted, so if there was evidence for Hillary committing crimes, what makes you think she'd be prosecuted? Honestly, explain why you think she's different than any other corrupt government official/banker/CEO.

       So if I can't explain to you why no one went to jail for the 2008 banking meltdown, then what? Clinton is guilty and there's a suppressed investigation? I've been very patient waiting for you to make any bit of this make sense. The best you can do is give some vague analogy to some unrelated event. You think that bullshit counts for an argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       You either believe there's a suppressed investigation or that the Clintons somehow have influence over the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Or is there another explanation that makes more sense to you? This is your chance to spell it out clearly.

       I don't think you know what you're talking about. What statute is that "treason"? It might be illegal. I couldn't point to a statute in any code of law about that. Could you? And like I said, that doesn't mean she
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       break the law, but I have to take the Justice Department's word for it that if she did, there'd be a prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you got information that the FBI doesn't? No. Would the FBI prosecute her to the wall if they could? Definitely. So, what basis do you have to claim there's a suppressed investigation?

       If she's guilty, then she should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Starting a war under false pretenses should be prosecuted too, but I don't see you pushing for the prosecution of Dick Cheney. Why not? Why HRC and not Dick Cheney? And more importantly, why are you ignoring the fuckup whitehouse of the century?

Are you gonna assume I'm ignoring what's happening to Qatar right now because we aren't talking about it? Jesus Christ. I hope you can see how pitiful your argument points are..

       Obviously current events are more important. This is a thread about Hillary, though. If it was a thread about Trump, we'd be talking about him. If it was a thread about Bush, we'd be talking about him. Etcetera.

       ? It's not because she's "current events." There's another reason... It's not because she's committed the most heinous crimes, even in recent history. Not because she's relevant or current. Why do you suppose she's being pushed so hard. Hmmm.... Can you take a guess?

       the problem isn't Hillary Clinton, it is the establishment as a whole. You are naive if you think she is the only politician like this. She rose to the top, so of course she is one of the most prominent, but this is widespread and rampant and until we focus on fixing the system and not harping on specific individuals, we will never move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a logical good starting point, and that is to remove money from elections. Politicians should be working on politics, not elections and campaigns, but the reality is, even once a politician is elected, they simply are starting their campaign for reelection. If they can't win an election just by raising the needed money, they will have to start relying on their actions and their perception and actually start representing the people who put them in office, instead of the dollars.

       Ooh, let me guess, it's the Russians! It's the Russians' agenda isn't it?! You bring up a good point though, there isn't a subreddit for people to discuss only your approved conspiracies. I tried r/jay_howardsConspiracies but apparently it's not a thing.   Maybe someone needs to create it, because when I browse Reddit all I see is distraction after distraction.

       I could be in r/pics right now upvoting a photo of trump with a Hitler mustache but you sure are trying to keep me in this HRC post. Is that what you mean by an agenda? Am I going to get arrested by the distraction police if I keep talking to you?

       Treason or not, it's illegal. You seem to know a lot about what the FBI would do, even though there's been multiple times in the past where they've failed to prosecute guilty criminals.

       That's my point: why are we even fucking talking about Hillary Clinton? She's an inconsequential nobody with zero input in our government or way of life. Put it this way: Who's more important, Clinton or the POTUS?
