       I know I'm gonna get a lot of "do your research into Zionism and you will agree" replies to this question but isn't this not too far removed to "Nazi type thinking" also? Why not condemn the blacks, Chinese, mexicans..... And turn this sub into a full blown sub that is pro racism on all counts?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it reflects badly on this sub and "thinking people"  in general to keep allowing this kind of rhetoric in a sub that is supposed to celebrate sceptical thinking. Where are the skeptics of "Zionism".

       I've found that people don't want to take responsibility for anything. Its more a liberal thing, but you find that a lot of people want to dislike a group of people based on the group doing better than them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its always easier to blame other people for you being a broke and dumb loser than actually doing something about your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is that we are all in the same "system" and some of us work hard and do well, while others want to blame the jews, the rich, white people, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are people that are fucking us. Sure there are people that didn't work for their money. Sure the system is unfair as fuck. I know people that can't write their name that have millions of dollars and people with Harvard bumper stickers on a car that isn't worth $500.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe the haters should just work hard and smart and get somewhere in life rather than hating.

       The thing about free speech is you can't stop someone from talking. Sure, mods can, if they break the rules. What steps am I going to take? Report them for not liking a peticular group? Track them down and dox? There is nothing you can do other than ignore them. There is an ignore feature on this site, is there not? I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say, I can imagine blocking 5 users will negate everything you just complained about. That's right, it's all of us.

       Because Nazis currently exist in the same realm as winged cockatrices, that is the imagination. The closest thing to a Nazi nowadays is a white guy in prison who gets a swastika tattoo. None of the groups at the rally or elsewhere identify as Nazis and the ones that are labeled as such by Wikipedia or the media are FBI honeypots, just like the KKK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same people who are scared of Nazis should be equally scared of Vermicious Knids.

        The NSM's core beliefs include defending the rights of white people everywhere, preservation of our European culture and heritage, strengthening family values, economic self-sufficiency, reform of illegal immigration policies, immediate withdrawal of our national military from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation, and promotion of white separation.

        The current two-party system is flawed, one in which each party in turn works to dismantle the work of the party formerly in power — and the cycle goes round and round, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars.  Progress is brought to a virtual halt as the two major parties spend most of their time bickering, rather than putting their country first!

       Considering I acknowledged that there were groups you can point to in my original comment, where I said they were FBI honeypots, the goalposts have not moved.

       Liberals love socialism. They just don't understand it doesn't and never will work in a "melting pot."

       If you traded out the words "white" or "European" with any other ethnicity, liberals would joyfully applaud and support such a group.

       It's mostly fraudulent misrepresentation so we ignore it as a community because it has been going on for years.  They did it when Obama was in office to make us look racist.  They do it now to make us look anti-jew which is ironic when major news networks are publishing "Goy, Bye" in their titles.  The simple fact is the entire thing is a fraud and we have proven that over the last 15 years, this is their best and last ditch attempt at stopping people from figuring out the entire thing is a gigantic fraud.
