       When you woke up this morning and drove to work. Ask yourself. Did you see any signs of crazy racism? Civil war 2? 
When you got to work. Ask yourself. Do you see any signs of intense hate towards another race ? Other people violently screaming at each other over color ?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. You did not. Everything was normal and it seemed no one cared. That's the hard truth. 95% of the people went home and got on reddit because jack nothing happened all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let them lead us into this. Their just showing you what's exciting. Unfortunately , it has an effect of making people who wouldn't other wise want this. To build resentment and want to act out too.
      </p>

       Just know most of America is going about their daily lives . Only stopping briefly to look at the shit show in constant display on whatever T.V and Media.

       It seems as though the corporate media is attempting to foment a war on American soil, they have showed their true colors, they appear to be attempting to convince Americans that its ok to hurt and possibly even kill each other for political reasons.

       I don't think a massive civil war is happening tomorrow. They are going to push this shit until there is a balkanization of sorts. This is already pretty close to reality in California. Realizing how ridiculous and synthetic it is does not exclude acknowledging this is the actual goal they are after.

       Sure, there are various movements trying similar things all over. You got this new CA one, the TX one that has been around forever, and also things like Cascadia that aren't explicitly negative. I kinda dig the Cascadia project myself,

       News is dragging Nazis because it's an easy, almost unanimously disliked target. They can have their big scandal headlines with no backlash. There's a reason why movies often choose Nazis as the bad guys, it's an easy sell.

       that may be true on face of it, but real civilizational changes are being made that impacts people's lives.

       you might also ask:
      </p>
      <p>
       did your management sent an email outlining the company's stance on cultural issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       do you know anyone who's had content removed or demonetized as a result of cultural issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       did someone you passed on the street censor their own speech recently, holding back a sentiment that would not be questionable 6 months ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       change is happening and this is small potatoes compared to the new economy that is under development every single day

       I like the way you think, but I feel as though you didn't interpret my post correctly. Change IS happened everyday, but we are not on the brink of some cutt-throat battle where we arm the streets and thousands fight. Similar to how the media portrays it.

       Always fight for freedom. Your ability to express that freedom.

       My post wasn't outlining every change that's happening or denying any change. My post was geared towards not paying attention to the destructiveness the media would have you believe. DO fight for your rights tho internet censorship etc... like you said.

       So turn off CNN or Fox News. They are dramatized accounts of real life, fed by Government propaganda. Talk to your neighbors and family. Learn about the past and compare it to the present. Understand that "normal" is a fantasy perpetuated by our extremely safe &amp; secluded lifestyles. Dig into the idea that our universe is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a reductionist, materialistic universe.

       I genuinely don't understand what you're getting at. Are people claiming that most people are white supremacists? Why couldn't a small, but growing, group of people stir up racial tension? In my day to day life I also don't see any evidence of geopolitical conflict with North Korea, but that doesn't make it any less real or important. The reason why we focus on negatives and extremes is that those events matter a lot to the people they affect.

       In reality there is no conflict between the US and North Korea. There's a lot of interventionist, war mongering talk on the subject but when it comes to any real action nothing has happened. I would argue it's totally unproductive to pay attention to all the hype. It's propaganda and manipulation. Once either side takes action against the other then seek out facts and determine if it effects you personally.

       I would never argue these things are not important. In fact, I spend a good half of my time either reading, discussing or preaching about world affairs. They affect the course of humanity and many lives in the process. But you should never let these grand narratives affect your own daily life too much, let alone the way you view your fellow human beings. If you are blessed enough to live a peaceful life in a peaceful country, you should acknowledge that blessing from time to time. All the positivity around is not getting enough credit. We could all be killing each other in the streets, but we aren't and instead contribute daily to a societal system which enables each other to have a wholesome life. That in itself is beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The horrible things we face, for instance on this forum, are exceptions - and should be approached as such. Again, that doesn't make them any less important.

       Alright I get your point. How people weigh the good and bad in the world is highly subjective though. It depends on your disposition, the things that have happened to you, and your personal beliefs. So yea, if you feel like there's some good in your life and you can appreciate it, good for you, but literally billions of people are not so lucky.

       Is that really that much of a stretch though? Trump is clearly sympathetic to white supremacists, because he refuses to denounce them (except for once but he already back tracked on that). So if you support someone like that what does that make you? I mean sure that doesn't make you a white supremacist, but it does mean that you are willing to look past it, even in a president.

       it is a stretch and just because Trump and neo nazis have a common enemy doesnt mean they on the same page. You're trying a guilt by association because Trump doesnt denounce nazis more vhemently than the leftists. Both sides are truly equal in moral repugnance. You trying this guilt by association fallacy does nothing but prove the distaste for leftist rhetoric.

       I think the media wants people to violently protest. Controversy is the gasoline that fuels news ratings.  Here's just one example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesse-benn/sorry-liberals-a-violent-_b_10316186.html">
        Sorry Liberals, A Violent Response To Trump Is As Logical As Any
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Most articles are not that blatant about it, but they still get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is part of the problem, too. He's not careful enough with his wording and still hasn't figured out that he needs to hire a team to reword his statements more precisely. The media latch onto any statements from him that they could interpret as violent in order to get people to believe that conservatives are the only violent party. The implication is that violence must be used against violence. Both sides need to realize that the majority of both parties are not violent. We have more in common than we think.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a person who is middle of the road on a lot of political issues, I hate how some people want to imply that fringe leftists don't exist because the term "alt-left" was invented by so and so. They don't actually say "fringe leftists don't exist," but they want others to think they don't exist because of the "invented term." All words were invented by somebody, but here's my point: There are a lot of people out there who want to associate right-leaning politics with fringe alt-right ideology. They want you to think that if you accept a right wing talking point as legit on some topic, then you may slide down the slippery slope leading to nazism. They want full coverage of any right wing extremist actions, and they want to make sure that you know those people were right wing. If you point out that there are also left wing extremists, that kills the whole argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about association.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 14, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, Republican member of Congress and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot while practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity, scheduled for the following day. Also shot were Crystal Griner, a Capitol Police officer assigned to protect Scalise; Zack Barth, a Congressional aide; and Matt Mika, a Tyson Foods lobbyist.
       </p>
       <p>
        A ten-minute shootout ensued between the shooter—James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, a left-wing activist[7][8]—and officers from the Capitol and Alexandria Police.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hodgkinson had participated in the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign during the 2016 United States presidential election

        Sandford said that if he were on the street tomorrow, he would try it again. He claimed he had lived in the US for approximately a year and a half and had been planning to attempt to kill Trump for about a year but finally felt confident enough to try it on Saturday, according to Swierkowski’s report.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also told Swierkowski that he had tickets for a Trump rally in Phoenix, Arizona, later that day, and planned to try to kill Trump there as well.

       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-lee-harvey-oswald/">
        Lee Harvey Oswald, the alledged gunman who shot JFK, had socialist leanings.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature,” Oswald wrote in his diary. “I had to dig for my books in the back of dusty shelves of libraries.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the publications Oswald received were
        <em>
         The Worker
        </em>
        , the newspaper of the American Communist Party, as well as
        <em>
         The Militant,
        </em>
        the paper of the Socialist Workers Party.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seven months before the Kennedy assassination, Oswald allegedly fired into the home of an ultra-right wing Army general named Edwin Walker. The bullet, which missed Walker, was linked to Oswald’s ammunition after the Kennedy assassination.
       </p>
       <p>
        “He despised America. He despised capitalism. When he eventually had the opportunity to strike against Kennedy, it was that symbol of the system that he was going after.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The amount of violence is also being exaggerated. They say that hate crimes are on the rise. Maybe that's true, but many of those "hate crimes" were actually faked. Somebody out there is either coordinating all of these fake hate crimes somehow, maybe through convincing people all over the country on forums that it's the right things to do, or I suppose there could be some other explanation for why tons of people decided last year to fake these crimes. It happens on both sides btw.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61bkif/many_of_the_widely_reported_hate_crimes_have/">
        Here is a list of fake hate crimes.
       </a>
       Keep in mind that the number of people who were caught faking a hate crime is much lower than the actual number. The media don't care. They will flood the airwaves with the allegation and give very little coverage to the correction.

       Emotional Addicts. That's the right wording for it. I was trying to describe this exact same thing to a friend the other day. So many of my friends are sharing videos and Nazi websites for the sake of being appalled and it really does not serve a purpose. And so many others respond to these posts with 'that's disgusting, I'm angry, thank you for sharing'. Such a weird thing going on right now.

       Hmm, seems like you missed the whole point of that post. I've seen a ton of stories about left wingers beating and killing people. I've seen a ton of stories of Trump supporters getting beaten for things like wearing a red Trump hat. If I had time, I would make a similar list, but that would still be trailing off into a different discussion altogether. The media gives way more coverage to any violent Trump supporters, digging into their past, etc. They don't do the same for left wingers, except maybe from Fox news on occasion. Remember Loughner? The media described him as a conservative, but he was an independent, former liberal radical, who turned into a conspiracy theorist nutjob who read marxist literature. The whole thing was super complicated and he was clearly insane, but the media decided to claim he was a conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal nutjobs do exist and the media are using nazis to character assassinate conservatives when they should really just cover "radical nutjobs" from the left and right as a separate category.

       I think we're past yellow journalists seeking ratings.

       The consolidated "American" news media is now a part of the power apparatus. They (along with the banks and major industry) are quasi governmental entities.

       Their pursuit of chaos is purposeful, and goes beyond "ratings."

       Sorry, but I'd just like to nit-pick at that specific point because I hear it come up over and over again. Like the popular one-liner "the only winning move is not to play", PC culture is a tool that consumes anyone who doesn't conform to what the MSM deems acceptable. If you even try and play that game, you'll find yourself endlessly chasing an ever-moving goal. By flat out rejecting PC culture right out of the gate, he may come across as an impulsive fool sometimes, but he is very resistant to being derailed by a barrage of non-issues.

       Yeah, well, I wouldn't have Trumps MAGA sticker on my car in the rough parts of town.  I saw a funny youtube experiment, assuming not staged.  Guy parks a beater car in an urban parking lot.  Car has a trump yard sign in the window of the back passenger side window.  Then they went to their other car to record.  They captured several people seeing the sign while walking past, and the urbanites proceeded to beat the car, or get their friends to beat the car with them.

       How many people would ever even think about Nazi white supremacist groups in this country without them being given free publicity non-stop on every news channel? No press is bad press, so even talking about them negatively helps to further their cause. No ones apologizing for Nazis here, rather saying 99% of people even give a fuck about these people for a large majority of their lives, but now the news says everyone needs to care until they are completely gone.

       That's not at all what he or I am saying. No one said to ignore it if you see it happening, he said stop talking about it. Don't plaster individual examples from all over the world/country on the news every day and force people to discuss it and be outraged. That's the point. Fight it when it comes up, but don't force people who would otherwise not even think about it have to join the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       No need for the hostilities man, I want racism to be lessened just as much as you do. I just think the way the media is handling is absolutely not the right way to go.

       Hmm, that is a fair point. My first thought was to just let those people change on their own with time. Again, just like religion, the coasts are the first to progress (atheism/non-organized religion) and the middle of the country follows slowly behind. If you go to the south and an entire town is racist, then you either don't live there, or tolerate it. When any of the people that grew up there leave and go to places that are more PC, then the people there will correct/condemn him when he says racist shit, and then they learn that it's not cool. Over time, it will diminish to the point that people don't even get the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       But trying to force people to change right away sounds like a recipe for civil war. Imagine going to the Bible Belt, and telling them all that they need to change the way the think about the world immediately, and that their belief in their religion is detrimental to society and is holding us back. You think that would go over well? Hell no. But if you go to a coastal city (or most cities even) you'll see tons of young people that came from those environments, but decided on their own to not buy into the nonsense their parents tried to sell them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I making sense here? Please let me know if any of that sounds wrong. I'm pretty much just spitballing here because I do think this is an interesting but delicate topic (
       <em>
        plus I might be a little baked

        But trying to force people to change right away sounds like a recipe for civil war. Imagine going to the Bible Belt, and telling them all that they need to change the way the think about the world immediately, and that their belief in their religion is detrimental to society and is holding us back

       Keeping dialogue open and calling it out when you see it is how it happens. Its the same thing as sex education. Conservative christians are so afraid of sex so they teach abstinence, and then you end up in a society with the opposite effect of what you want. Education and discussion is how it happens, it isn't just something that can be fixed overnight.

       That's very true. Education is the answer, it's just hard to successfully reach those that are being educated by those who were improperly educated themselves by the generation before them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with both of these issues, I feel that personal freedoms should not be infringed upon in order to try and force these changes to happen faster, which is what the news always advocates very hard for whenever they bring it up. This was my main point originally, which is that the media is not doing us any favors with the way they are covering these events, and are even just making things worse. All so that they can convince everyone to give the government more control, and civilians less freedoms.

       I don't generally find that the media calls for action most of the time. They generally restrict that to explicit opinion pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most popular media always does a mediocre job or representing complex issues, for the same reason that memes will take over a subreddit if the mods if the mods let it; low quality entertainment is easy to produce and consume. But just because those outlets do a shitty job of talking about it doesn't mean that it doesn't need to be talked about.

       I'm the parent poster by the way. BlackhawkBolly said pretty similar things to what I would have, so there wasn't much point having the same conversation. I'd just like to add that white supremacy has reportedly been on the rise lately, so it's not just going away on its own.

       if a group of dummies is saying something dumb, you don't have to stop and speak up to tell them they are talking dumb.  It doesn't matter if they are Nazis, commies, whatever.  If you see them hurting someone, go for it - protect the victim - but ignoring dummies and freaks TALKING diminishes their effect, not normalizes it.  Ignoring their ACTIONS normalizes.

       I'm not sure why you felt the need to inject this. Just because the Russian collision and election interference issues aren't at the top of the news at the moment does not mean that it has gone away. That is just a really weak way of trying to discredit it.

        Data from the Southern Poverty Law Center suggests the number of hate groups is currently near the country’s all-time recorded high, in 2011. The SPLC reports that as of 2016, there are 917 active groups. (That’s 100 fewer than the 1,108 groups reported in 2011.) The SPLC’s hate map identifies groups by tracking their publications and websites. Of those 917, more than 90 are neo-Nazi groups.

       Or a shill, or a conformist, or whatever else. The truth is there are some extraordinary people here who actually get it but they are significantly outnumbered by vain people who sit atop their high horse and shout: Don't believe the media narrative. (and rightfully so ).but they further their premise by harping on how open minded they are and love to remind you to: believe what you want to believe, think how you want to think. That is until they encounter someone who that in addition to disbelieving the official narrative also choose to question the conspiracy theories.

       Ok, you got me. I'll reply one more time, but if you can't wrap your head around it this time it's useless. I'm talking about the media portraying it and how it's completely different from how it acts out in reality. Some people get lost in distinguishing the 2, or finding a middle ground. Never said racial tendencies aren't prevalent.

       there will always be racism.  Always, until everyone is on the same financial footing - and that will never happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was Chris Rock that said we won't have peace until we all acknowledge that we are all a little racist.  In my workplaces, I've been lucky to where people make fun of everyone they like, often in non-PC ways.  no one takes it seriously, because at the end of the day we are all professionals there doing a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if I see someone threatening someone racially, that is another story.  But we are talking about a rally of dummies spouting dumb speak - so as long as you don't give them attention, you won't hear what they have to say or be hurt by it.

       Just because your immediate surrounding isn't as advanced as you think you deserve, doesn't mean there has to be a war for 'progress'. Maybe , a crashcouse could be sufficient for those people? Crashcouse on acceptance of immediate surroundings . Maybe, just maybe, we could talk like adults, without screaming, about the problems that bother us? Not all of them would be solved, but more than with war, I assure you.

       White/black/asian nationalism is due to the
       <em>
        cultural and financial differences
       </em>
       - and not the skin color.
       <br/>
       If you make people mostly uniform in their income and education (the way it was done in the Soviet Union) - you'd quickly see all the discrimination disappear, as there would be no envy to fuel it.

       Racism would still be there. It would most likely be less though. There are people who would be white pride, until they have all white. Then it would be blonde hair pride, till there were white and blond. Then it might be green eye pride. Some people just like to make themselves feel better by finding some way to look down on others.

       Everyone not is one party, is complicit in what the other party does, right? Did I get it right? Let's fight everyone! Pick a side. No substitutions. Go! Hurry!

       Anarchists are not responsible for anything the politically minded do.

       But if they do anything but foment revolution, they equate with Mussolini or Hitler. Even a ten minute break makes you look like Pol Pot on a murder spree.

       Fair enough. But honestly, hear me out this not an excuse at all, people deal with a lot of shit on a regular basis and the daily grind can be tiresome. People have their own problems and struggle to deal with them. So I feel the average person just hears this shit on the news, gets more depressed and then wants nothing to do with it. They then go back home and try to ignore it and not deal with it like me maybe should.

       Lol   alright buddy.   "Rich white men".  So in other words all of the soros funded protest groups, left wing causes, and donations to Clintons campaign = Trump's buddy.   Ohhh thanks for clearing that up.  Look I get it you want to shill against Trump and you're in a sub where Soros is anathema,  so you're linking them with absolutely zero reason.  McCain is a thorn in Trump's side and has met Soros on multiple occasions just saying.

       Yeah I always considered myself white growing up until i got old enough to experience direct racism. I've been called a spic, sand n****r, goat fucker and recently someone yelled trump at me as an insult. Racism is hard to see when you aren't on the receiving end

       So true.  The facade is just that and a weak one at best.  I live in a very diverse neighborhood in South Carolina and have not noticed any changes in the treatment toward me. White or black, people still smile and wave going about their day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what I am concerned about is the noticeable anger and hostility that comes from the youth age 25 and under.  There is an obvious difference between the reactions of the older generations versus the young generation. The older generation is in a washout wave see mode while the younger seems to be seething with anger ready to go fight for any cause regardless of consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference? Humility.  When young,  many have yet to experience enough of life to know that a) it's a really short ride b) other than maybe your friends &amp; family no one gives a rats ass what you think(this applies to my post as well) c) you can't change the world without hurting someone  else in the process d) people that disagree with you have a right to do so and trying to change that forcibly is against everything the word liberty is defined as

       Yep. And they want you to think that "the media" or someone is artificially creating this issue to manipulate us. Here's the actual order of events recently:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Charlottesville city considers removing racist statue.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) White supremacists hold rally to support the statue.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Anti-racists hold counter-rally to oppose supremacists.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Neo-Nazi murders woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) President of the United States defends the neo-nazi rally and says "many sides" bear responsibility for the violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Lots of people loose their shit because SERIOUSLY?!
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Some users on this "Conspiracy" sub start downplaying the issue, claiming that
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       is trying to artificially create racist tension. What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every part of this stupid, tragic story really happened. This is not fake news and I don't even understand what 'conspiracy' we're supposed to be worried about.

       It's less a conspiracy and more people not wanting to think too hard real world problems. So instead it gets waved away with posts like this. Why think when you can blame unseen powers that control everything? It's easier that way. Nevermind the very complicated real conspiracies out there.

       the conspiracy part is that one of the organizers of the rally, jason kessler, was an occupy wall street democrat that supported obama x 8 years, became a "trump supporter" somehow and organized a bullshit rally, at a time that is very convenient to the democrats (russia story is falling apart, DWS and her IT aide are in a world of trouble, democrats have no message, etc......). nobody besides these white supremacists argue on behalf of the white supremacists. people are sick of the leftist media not calling out violence when violence happens. if it is a white person, they are a founder of the KKK and immediately all trump supporters are grand wizards in the KKK. if it is a muslim with a bomb, "motive unclear" or "lone wolf"...if it is BLM ambushing and killing cops while chanting in the streets, "police need retrained" and "we need to be more sensitive to needs of black people"....
      </p>
      <p>
       how about violence is wrong. committing an act of violence and a crime is wrong. Antifa hitting people with locks is wrong, but you won't hear that on CNN. BLM beating up white people all over the place is wrong, won't hear that on CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       people are sick of being called a bigot or a member of the KKK or a "fascist" because we support trump.

       If the President and his supporters are tired of being lumped in with the KKK, they should probably stop trying to equate such white-supremacist groups to peaceful anti-racist protesters.

       I assume you're referring to the case of Micah Xavier Johnson murdering police officers in Dallas last year. He was a member of New Black Panther Party, Nation of Islam, and Black Riders Liberation Army, all of which are hate groups. He may have also claimed support for Black Lives Matter, but it is not correct to hold BLM responsible in any way for his actions, as they are a peaceful group promoting police reform and not hatred or violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that Antifa does say they will meet fascists with preemptive violence--an attitude that goes too far. But the counter-protest in Charlottesville was composed of a number of anti-racist groups and individuals who are not a part of Antifa, including many Charlottesville locals who seem to have had no motive or association other than opposition to the white-supremacist rally they were protesting.

       BLM is a black supremacist group.  The founder literally believes blacks are the superior race.

       That is not among the issues that BLM advocates for, or which any member is required to subscribe to.

      <p>
       In addition, if you are going to make such an extraordinary claim, you should be good enough to provide some evidence, please. The founder's personal failings will not change the facts about BLM's good purpose (police reform), but I would be curious to see something about what you're saying.

       That's part of it, people definitely aren't going to believe you when you say you're not a white supremacist, but that's because you're condoning white supremacists at least enough to march shoulder to shoulder with them.

      <p>
       I'm not sure why emotion shouldn't factor in as it's a huge part of the human experience, but that aside, I think expectations are different these days. With all the resources on the internet, if Neo-Nazis were willing to have or even listen to a logical discussion about race in good faith, they already wouldn't be Neo-Nazis. As it stands, they've mostly dived into the wealth of rationalizations the internet provides them, so actually trying to shoot them down point by point is exhausting on top of being fruitless 99% of the time.

       You're entitled to your view and I appreciate the response.  I just take the view that there may have been "normal" people there just upset a historical statue was being removed, and some people upset with the statue itself (the "very fine people" you say).  Fine.  Then the shit show started with extremists from both sides.  Neo-nazis, antifa, whatever.  Everyone on those extremes are the people we need to be worrying about.  He specifically condemned the violence and specifically called out the neo-nazi groups.  So now you're just believing what you want and projecting that onto the President.

       This whole crap about removing statues is just fucking stupid anyway.  Why are we all of the sudden wanting to throw everything down the memory hole?

      <p>
       It isn't all of the sudden. Communities have been discussing and removing these statues for a long time, and they have been coming down slowly. These statues were put up during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights era of the 20th Century to perpetuate a myth of Confederate nobility, often by the KKK itself. They now belong in a museum near the displays on slavery and mass death, not in places of honor in public parks. Lets save those spots for rebels who won their rebellion, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
      </p>
      <p>
       This most recent controversy started when the white supremacists decided to protest the possible removal of a statue which they support for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me be clear: when fascists and racists are advocating for their positions in public, they will be rightfully met with opposition from good people. Those of us protesting these disgusting retrogrades are not the problem, not even a bit of it. And the louder the racists protest, the angrier they get, the more they will see their positions fail in the light of day.

       The neo-nazis showed up to conduct a very coordinated March for Vice who made what look like a Hollywood style documentary. If you check out videos of people who were there during the day for the actual protest it was people from all sorts of walks of life on both ends and lots of people on the right who were clearly not neo-nazis, if you go simply by off the footage on CNN ya the president looks kind of bad, but the CNN footage is not representative of most of the event at all.

       The rebellion of the southern states of the United States of America that took the political form of the Confederate States of America. It was formed in response to actions by certain northern states against laws like the fugitive slave act as well as the election of Abraham Lincoln to the office of president of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war itself began when confederate soldiers were ordered to fire on Ft. Sumter. A fort belonging to the United States Army.
      </p>
      <p>
       It continued for a number of years until the north finally won and brought the rebellious states back into the union. Slavery was abolished in those states that had rebelled and then nation wide a number of years later after the passing of the 13,14,15th amendments to the constitution.

       I worry that it's the same reason they recently seem opposed to things like honesty, generosity, and respect. Those formerly universal attitudes, along with opposition to kleptocratic Russia and other authoritarian regimes have been ceded to the left, apparently.

       They have become so spiteful. I blame Fox News for this. They really pitted their viewers against democrats and truly went out of their way to paint liberals as evil while pretending to be neutral. The other stations didn't do that. Bill o'reilly's show was basically hours of dialogue meant to outrage people. Sure other news stations contribute to mass hysteria but they never tried to paint half the country as evil.

       Neo-Nazis
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       a race war, you'll recall. They don't want peace, peace means they remain ostracized on the sidelines. They want to triumph over the "Alt Left" by winning moral victories and public sympathy (by portraying their opponents as the aggressors in fights), marking out territory, maybe holding family-friendly picnic events and continually normalizing their position as a rational one. One of the ways they're gathering allies is preying on extant fringey conservatives (mostly libertarians) who aren't racist or particularly extreme, but feel anyone left of center is a communist bent on destroying free speech, not specifically aimed at shutting down Nazis but controlling thought. Seeing as the political center right now is basically neo-liberal, that's another easily hateable enemy shared by many. They also try to recruit white, disenchanted leftists by promoting the "socialism" aspect of their program.

       Speaking as a minority. I don't let racism bother me. I know it may be difficult at times. If you let someone's racist views have effect on you, it gives them power. Whenever I come across a racist, I remind myself that people died for the freedom to believe what you wanted. I said people, the government doesn't give a shit.

       I think you have this backwards. Stokeley Carmichael said "If a man wants to lynch me, that's his problem. If he wants to lynch me and has the power to do it, that's my problem." They don't get power from you not reacting, your ability to ignore it is an indicator they don't have real power. But what happens when that racist whose insults don't bother you is on your jury, or in a police cruiser pulling you over?

       Unfortunately I don't see a realistic solution to this. You can't legislate racism out of existence. So what do we do about it? Certainly widening the racial divide, as we see happening right now, isn't the answer?

       I see blatant racism every time I go out in public. Whether it's overheard someone mutter the n word or the black gentleman who was hassled about his membership card for sam's club.  It's terrible how much it visibly hurts someone to be the victim of racism. Just because YOU are oblivious doesn't mean it's not happening.

       I just got my breakfast today, saw three cops holding over 2 black guys with bikes on the side of the street in a hot as fuck day. Hour later on my way back, they are still there, nothing doing, just holding them there on the side of the street for all to witness. Sorry but I can't not see race when I see 2 white cops hold over a couple black guys who seem completely calm and know what police quotas are

       That's a shame that apparently that kind of behavior is prevalent in parts of WV.  I don't think I can remember a single time anything like that has happened where I'm from.  Institutional and police racism is still a problem here just like it is in most places, but it's not so blatantly visible on a day to day basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I don't see how the media drumming up racial tensions and steering people towards a race war is going to help those who are oppressed, quite the opposite really.

       True, but I don't think that's OPs point. Aside from the civil war being much more complicated than just slavery, today we are looking at legacy media amplifying .01% of the population in an attempt to make it appear mainstream.

       OPs point is just a common misunderstanding of history. When a decade of war and crisis is condensed to a chapter, it sounds like non-stop chaos. The reality, for the vast majority of the population, is usually rather mundane.

       The people with that is your definition of racism may be wildly different from someone else's. For instance, someone is an asshole and when they get angry they throw out a racial slur at you. Now maybe they're racist. But maybe, just maybe, they're actually just a petty asshole who wanted to say the meanest thing possible to you. And they'd do the exact same thing to a person of their own "race" if they thought it would hurt them. What I'm getting at is, I don't really believe there many
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       racists—meaning people who have a deep enough understanding about wait race supposedly to even be able to hold an educated opinion about certain races being inferior than others. I think most people who do racist shit are really just fucking assholes who know that race is a sensitive topic for people and will use that as their means of inflicting maximum harm. It's like... if you have really bad acne and an asshole knows or assumes to know you are self-conscious about it, they're going to key in on that one physical trait and use it to mercilessly attack you. It doesn't mean they hate all people with acne as a matter of principle. It just means they're assholes who have enough awareness about what's most likely to hurt any given person.

       I mean, you can just label people as "racist" without putting any critical thought behind what is meant by racism and why it is they are engaging it, but then you'd never actually learn anything. Tell me this: why is racism worse than any other kind of prejudice against traits that cannot be changed?

       I'd argue it's not about determining the "worse" kind of prejudice, but rather about the prevalence and depth of prejudice.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that effect, racism is concerning to me because the primary manner it exists in 2017
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       the explicit asshole, but rather all the ways we unconsciously absorb and then (often) inadvertently act on these biases. This is especially problematic when these decentralized forms of racism amalgamate into structurally destructive ones, like the discrepancy in policing techniques against black and white citizens.

       See, what you're doing is chasing ghosts. When you have to come up with more and more elaborate explanations for how racism is alive and well and worse than ever, you might actually ignoring the possibility that it actually has gone away. All this talk about systemic racism wreaks of conspiracy theorizing. You can't point to racist individuals or policies, but you can identity all sorts of outcomes that could have plausibly been caused by racism, and that's enough for you to declare that it is alive and well but simply more cleverly hidden. In fact, it's so well hidden that the people hiding it
       <em>
        aren't even aware they're hiding it
       </em>
       , and so they must be "reeducated" to "correct" their "unconscious bias". It's unbelievably Orwellian and completely unfalsifiable. In fact, it's the exact same crap religious fundamentalists try to pull on people if you just replace "racism" with "the devil". It's intellectually bankrupt.

       Now see I might argue that the intellectually bankrupt position is willfully ignoring an incredible amount of experimental and sociological research demonstrating the "ghosts" you speak of. Why do you choose to ignore this?

       Because none of that research has found a smoking gun; by which I mean, an actual quantifiable problem to which an actual, realistic solution exists. You're not supposed to come out of school believing everything your professors told you, you're supposed to come out more skeptical about commonly held beliefs than when you when in, and with a lifelong hunger to seek the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be. Sociologist have close to a 90% ideological alignment politically, which makes it very hard to swallow the results of their studies—especially when &lt;
       <em>
        gasp!
       </em>
       &gt; those results are also overwhelmingly aligned with their political ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, when I confront someone on these high minded intellectual sounding concepts, I expect them to be able to defend them with some level of competency rather than just appealing to authority or reverting to accusations of racism or launching into a meta discussion about my insincerity or closed-mindedness.

       I know people have come up with "critical theory", which is little more than rebranded Marxism. Having a Socratic dialogue

       critical thinking. It might as well be the freaking definition. Maybe you could stand to articulate your own thoughts rather than regurgitating nonsense using nebulous blanket terms like "systemic racism".

       I don't mean to be dismissive, and I'm sorry for that, but you really haven't offered anything beyond the standard "racism exists because racism exists" circular argument. I just want to have an honest discussion about the actual mechanisms and epistemology of race that isn't just met with the same arsenal of 5 dollar buzzwords that academia is foisting on college kids and now the general public. Every time I try to scratch the surface of concepts like "systemic racism" or "unconscious bias" I'm met with either anger, obstinance, accusations of racism, or most often, an immediate shutting down of the conversation. All that says to me is that people are literally being indoctrinated into the critical theory ideology and instead of ever having had to actually defend it in a logical debate were instead instructed to shut the conversation down as soon as possible on the false basis that I'm not arguing in good faith and am just using my "white privilege" (which apparently includes logic and truth now) to further "oppress" "marginalized" "people of color".

       sounds like you're being disingenuous and aren't actually interested in learning. You were overtly uninterested in learning before, and now you're switching to a "I just want to have an honest conversation!" tone that is at odds with your previous remarks... and also at odds with the rest of this very comment, in which you are mocking positions you disagree with.

       is enormously ironic -- it's

       that you have no intention of speaking in "good faith". When you try to lie about that next time, try not moving on to mocking two words later.

      <p>
       In conclusion, if you are actually interested in learning about the ideas you disagree with, you're either going to have to actually approach it humbly and without malice (which you have proven presently incapable of), or pursue this learning outside of a dialogue, i.e. via texts.

       Amazing. Look, I've tried the polite approach in the past, and I get all those buzzwords thrown at me. When I ask for clarifications about them or disagree with their underlying premise, I get the exact same response from them as you're giving me just now: a meta discussion about tone and accusations of concern trolling or lack of sincerity (or racism—love that one).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with you progressives is that you expect the rest of us to take your five-dollar terms as a priori, and immediately end the conversation if we don't. If you're not willing to discuss these topics using agreed upon language and definitions, there is absolutely no hope for productive conversation. You shouldn't get so bent out of shape when your buzzwords are mocked or thrown aside. Aren't you guys supposed to be interested in activism? Doesn't activism involve trying to convince others of the supposed truths you have uncovered?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I know that critical theory and progressivism can offer no real truth is because people who subscribe to them are completely uninterested in convincing other people if their validity. If it really was truth, and you truly wanted to make the world a better place, you wouldn't let a few snarky comments in a debate offend you to the point of ending the discussion. You would try new tactics, learn from your mistakes, observe the person you're debating with and try to win them over with calm responses and persistence. In other words, you would be absolutely dedicated to spreading the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The behavior I see is more akin to religious devotion. You've been taught one point of view for how the world works, and been reassured about its absolute validity in no uncertain terms. As soon as you confront a nonbeliever who not only rejects your presuppositions, but says exactly the things your priests have warned you that the evil nonbelievers would say (like race isn't real, or IQ is hereditary, or reverse racism is real, or minorities can be racist too, etc), you scream "heretic!" and shun them. You remain ideologically pure and continue on believing the only thing you were taught to believe, and every day the evil forces you were warned about grow larger and more menacing until finally you band together with your fellow adherents to take up arms in the streets in a great crusade to smite the great devil that lurks around every corner to the cries of "No Racists! No KKK! No fascist USA!" and "Racist! Sexist! Anti-gay! Neo-Nazis go away!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then a bunch of people get beat up and a girl gets run over by a car and the entire nation turns into one big dumpster fire and I just wanna know what the fuck "systemic racism" really means..

       This is pure fantasy, do you understand that? Like the previous passage, it reads a lot like apparent projection. There is nothing like "screaming heretic and shunning" going on from me to you. I have told you
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       ways in which it is difficult and unconstructive to engage with your comments. Meanwhile, you have "screamed progressive" and are now telling me about all the things that "we progressives" think and do. So... if anyone here is labeling the other and discounting them based on a wholly fictional &amp; deliberately constructed fantasy meant to insulate their own belief system, it
       <em>
        really looks like
       </em>
       it's you.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we're here, let's have a little break to stop slinging mud and do something constructive. I am going to legitimately tell you how I feel about those parenthetical issues you brought up. In this manner, we will be having an honest, good-faith exchange of ideas, so that we might better understand each other. I still do not believe that that is what you are looking for, but if it is then this should be helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Race isn't real" doesn't mean a whole lot. If you mean something like "there is no biological or cultural basis for racial divisions", I am of course wholly in agreement with you. I think you are severely misled if you think that "progressives" would be in disagreement with you. But of course "race" is still something we refer to, and is real to that extent -- to the extent that it is a social force. To be precise, the racial categories we are familiar with come from the legal and extra-legal schema of the transatlantic slave trade and American plantation slavery. They are "real" to the extent that they were codified in law and other social forms, and that has a deep and continuing legacy. "Race isn't real" the same way "money isn't real" -- it's not a natural law, but as a human concept it has deep and continuing implications for our lives. Our racial categories were made up as a specific system of domination, a specific legal caste society, and we have not yet shaken off their legacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       IQ is hereditary. This is a scientific fact. I mean, obviously not
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       hereditary -- not even close, I hope that's not what you meant -- but it has a hereditary component. I don't know why you'd think it's part of your "progressive agenda" to claim that IQ has no hereditary component. I wonder -- how easy would it be for you to find a "progressive" source making this claim? And conversely, how easy would it be to find a "non-progressive" source
       <em>
        claiming
       </em>
       that progressives make this claim? What I'm getting at here is that based on these "issues" you've brought up, I strongly think that you get your ideas from the kind of echo-chamber that you imagine I live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "reverse racism is real" and "minorities can be racist too", I think that if you look at my two comments where I answered your initial question -- you know, those comments that you wiped aside as college liberal gobbledygook -- you will begin to understand how we conceptualize "racism" differently. When I talk about "racism", I don't give a fraction of a shit about calling people names or having negative ideas about groups of people. You want to refer to such things as "racism", but what I want to refer to is
       <em>
        things that matter
       </em>
       , material, structural things, things like racialized mass incarceration, ghettos, employment, access to capital, access to social services, police brutality, etc. From previous conversations that I've had, I suspect you may feel like it is unfair to commandeer the word "racism" to refer to these things rather than what you want to refer to. To this point I would like to say -- what leads you to believe that the definition of "racism" that you use is the original one? It isn't, it's just the one you had built for you through your life experiences -- specifically, life experiences that
       <em>

       <em>
        real contemporary issues of race

       . In short -- and it is possible I am barking up the wrong tree here -- I believe your formative experiences led you to a milquetoast and inconsequential definition of "racism". I have encountered several people who think that the definition of "racism" is being changed on them, but that's not the case -- they just had parents and teachers who didn't engage with racial problems and preferred teaching "racism" as "calling people bad names".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to be clear -- neither I nor anyone else disagrees that non-white people can be prejudiced in lots of ways. If you want to choose "that counts as racism!" as a political hill to die on... Okay. We don't call that "racism" because it literally doesn't fucking matter (in the US, at least). If this is an issue you care about, what it
       <em>
        looks
       </em>
       like you're saying is "I don't give a fraction of a shit about brutal material oppression, but what I
       <em>

       care about is
       <em>
        my own white identity

       !" So... Seems disingenuous and even, yep,
       <em>
        racist
       </em>
       to mark "reverse-racism is real" as an issue when you literally don't care about
       <em>
        actual racial issues
       </em>
       .

        "Race isn't real" doesn't mean a whole lot. If you mean something like "there is no biological or cultural basis for racial divisions", I am of course wholly in agreement with you. I think you are severely misled if you think that "progressives" would be in disagreement with you. But of course "race" is still something we refer to, and is real to that extent -- to the extent that it is a social force. To be precise, the racial categories we are familiar with come from the legal and extra-legal schema of the transatlantic slave trade and American plantation slavery. They are "real" to the extent that they were codified in law and other social forms, and that has a deep and continuing legacy. "Race isn't real" the same way "money isn't real" -- it's not a natural law, but as a human concept it has deep and continuing implications for our lives. Our racial categories were made up as a specific system of domination, a specific legal caste society, and we have not yet shaken off their legacies.

       I understand you took my parenthetical list of heretical regressive beliefs to be ones I personally hold, but I don't (necessarily). My "race isn't real" is quite a bit more nuanced than most people's who make that claim, I understand the real implications of hereditary IQ and would never make the absurd leap in logic that race can be mapped onto it, and you seem to agree on the "reverse racism" and "minorities can be racist" claims but dismiss the claim that all progressives reject them out of hand, but again, "progressive" is a broad category. There are ideological wars being fought in this country and in a war one must identify an enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard the comparison of the abstract concept of race to the abstract concept of money but I think a far more apt comparison is to beauty or humor. What really matters is how many people agree on it. With money, we all agree on the value. If we didn't, we'd be in a lot of trouble. With race, we all clearly do not, which I see as the source of all our problems related to race. I'm fine with loosely agreed upon abstractions so long as the consequences of that loose agreement are negligible. When it results in actual negative side effects, though, that's when I start to demand more strict standards.

       If somebody points to statistics about blacks being overrepresented in the prison population as proof of racism, and does that in service to a movement that seeks to demonize white people and American values, I'm not going to dismiss the evidence out of hand because I'm a scientific person. What I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       going to do, however, is ask that they get reallllly crispy about their definition of racism. Suddenly, the nebulous but very real concept of "racism" you're talking about (which I actually agree with you on) starts to evaporate in the fact of the cold and emotionless nature of scientific inquiry.

I wonder -- how easy would it be for you to find a "progressive" source making this claim? And conversely, how easy would it be to find a "non-progressive" source claiming that progressives make this claim? What I'm getting at here is that based on these "issues" you've brought up, I strongly think that you get your ideas from the kind of echo-chamber that you imagine I live in.

       I try to be aware of my echo chambers and I usually spend more time outside of them than inside because, well.. I like to argue with people. You should really ask Charles Murray whether or not the progressive agenda claims that IQ has no hereditary component, because he'd probably set you straight on that. Then again, it could be that my use of the word "progressive" is too imprecise, but I can tighten that down to "intersectional progressive" if it helps.

       Yes, here we are starting to agree, although your (dare I say) progressive leanings are showing again.

       care and lack the capacity or desire to think critically about it and have a nuanced discussion. We saw a few of those folks gather in Charlottesville recently. I'm not big on political violence, so I tend to get upset when I think I recognize what the cause of that violence might be.

       The biggest problem I have with racism is how narrow it is. What I think the concept of intersectionality gets right is the fact that oppression can come in many forms and based on many different things. Skin color gets a lot of attention because it's
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       noticeable. Gender and disabilities are right up there too. But then you have culture, heritage, intelligence, beauty, athleticism, social ineptitude, height, etc. The number of ways in which we can be oppressed are limited only by our imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the (we'll call them) intersectionalists understand this, and it's a real problem because now anybody can make a valid claim that they are oppressed and be able to make a good case for it. In fact, I believe this is why the progressives turned to Marxist theory. What this allowed them to do was create a hierarchy of oppression based on the traditional Marxist metrics, wealth and power. It writes itself from there—in order to be oppressed, one must lack wealth and power. Conversely, one cannot claim oppression while simultaneously holding positions of power or wealth. Hence, the infamous "racism = prejudice + power" formula.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite clever, really, except for the fact that it makes the same fatal mistake that Marx made in believing that wealth and power are the only values that we humans care about. They aren't, and history has proven that because the prediction that Marx made about the proletariat rising up against the bourgeoisie never came to pass. It turns out, people value a lot more than just wealth and power. Namely, group inclusion, religious devotion, personal development, family cohesion, escapism, etc. At the heart of it, people (men in particular) want to climb dominance hierarchies, and while wealth and power are obvious hierarchies, they are far from the only ones available. For instance, being the best basketball player on your block may be just as meaningful to you as becoming independently wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the academic definition of racism relies on the false assumption that we are strictly one dimensional creatures. And for that reason, I completely reject it. If I'm born white into a wealthy family with great political power, but my parents are in a loveless marriage and they pay me no attention whatsoever, relying on nannies and maids to raise me, am I really more privileged than the poor black kid whose parents are deeply in love, spend as much time as possible with him, and provide him the archetypal blueprints to follow as he goes out into the world? You'd be hard press to convince anybody that the former is more privileged.

I don't find anything particularly great about white people and if anything I feel we are quite lame when it comes to the things that really matter in life. The political hill I want to die on is the fighting over who gets to claim they are the most oppressed, but really that political hill is the one where I fend off marxism in all its forms. Social justice just happens to be the latest form it has take on. For the record, I realize I need to get better about not

I'm a classic 80s child who grew up liberal and "colorblind" and (perhaps naively) still believes in MLK's dream. So with that out of the way, I think you're absolutely right to categorize those fools in the same way. Spot on, in fact. A solid truth I stumbled upon the hard way last year was this concept that our fears grow in proportion to the degree to which we avoid confronting them. This is a psychological concept, as I'm sure you know, and the only cure is to face the fear head on. I think the radical left (well, most of the left, sadly) is gripped by such a fear, due mainly to their isolation from controversy in the name of anti-bullying and political correctness. It's gotten to the point where a bunch of dorky, disaffected white boys with autism gathering together for a white supremacist rally is evidence that the 4th Reich is about to be established. Those same white boys think jews run the country and blacks are inferior creatures beyond redemption, so I diagnose them in the same way.

       How does it "make that mistake"? How does a formulation of the definition of racism make the claim that something is "all humans care about"? I don't see the leap there. I'm with you up until the "fatal mistake" line -- it might as well say "the fatal mistake that it doesn't account for fashion sense" for all the relevance. No, that formulation of "racism" doesn't "account for" various identitarian formations. On purpose. Neither does my definition of "seagull". You can't say "your definition of 'seagull' relies on the false assumption that we are strictly one dimensional creatures." The definition of "seagull" is not meant to provide an exhaustive list of possibilities of the human condition. It just refers to a thing.

       Did MLK believe that race didn't have a social functioning? Was he colorblind? Did he think there weren't any social effects of race and racism?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say "believe in MLK's dream", do you mean you believe in working towards MLK's dream, or do you mean that you believe it wasn't a dream and it's actually just how things are?

        What really matters is how many people agree on it. With money, we all agree on the value. If we didn't, we'd be in a lot of trouble. With race, we all clearly do not, which I see as the source of all our problems related to race.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, what matters isn't "how many people agree on it", it's "how much systems of power are built around them". This holds for both money and race. Money doesn't continue to work the specific ways it does in this country because "most people agree on it". "Most people" are never asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly do you feel we "don't agree on" with regards to race? I think nearly all people believe it "doesn't exist" in the way I laid out, and that the recent resurgence of those who believe it most definitely does, while serious and important, continues to represent a fringe group. I think Americans "don't agree on" whether race continues to have a social function, a very large one that defines lives and defines the country.

      <p>
       I do not think political violence comes from anger about uses of the word "racism", nor do I think that it would be a good or meaningful policy to linguistically appease such sensitive people. I think neo-Nazis organize around their
       <em>
        material interest
       </em>
       of furthering white supremacy in American political institutions. These are simply people who feel they personally would be better off in a society that privileges their axes of identity than your liberal meritocracy in which they are floundering. Any anger about this syntactic "issue" or that ethical "value" are simply ideological blabber foaming at the mouth of that material beast. This country has a concrete history of racial domination to draw on and these people are using it to imagine a world where they're on top. It would be nice if they imagined a better life for themselves through labor movements, but those have been thoroughly targeted, destroyed and/or recuperated by the US government and halls of power. Among political paths to power, white supremacy is an attractive one, because it minimally challenges those who are already in power -- unlike, say, the labor movement. Because they are already overwhelmingly white, the ruling class and its interests are far less threatened by and far more receptive to a "white identity &amp; white power" political movement. This I would call a basic premise of structural white supremacy.

       Maybe people don't want to converse because of your condescending attitude? Just a thought. At any rate, there's certainly more evidence for racism in the USA than there is for Marxism. Although I can see how such a belief would be useful for conservatives as it allows them to feign victimhood.

       I think even though very few people are nazi/racist a lot of people "wouldnt mind" if their policies were enacted. For example look at all the people who would refuse to date outside their race or would be appaled to find their daughter dating out of race. These are the people im sure "wouldnt mind" if they came and took away all the muslims/jews/blacks etc.

       The civil war was a little more organized than that, considering population numbers at the time. Nobody is saying that war means that 100% of the population is involved - the post is saying look for real and true threats instead of boogey-men.

       I think the vast majority of racists and ethnonationalists don't consider themselves racists or ethnonationalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       While only hundreds of actual Nazis showed up, I think that represents a much larger group of people that internally agree with their ideas but just don't like Nazi symbology for historical reasons.

       Personally I think ethnonationalism has been artificially absent from Western politics for the last 70 years because of WW2, kind of like how vaccine skepticism rises and wanes with rate of epedemics.

       so let's say there are 1% nazis... do you really believe we have 4 million nazis chillin across the nation? at what % do they become a problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a hard time believing even 5% of the nation (20 million people) are neo-nazi. Here's what I could find from wiki:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are several neo-Nazi groups in the United States. The National Socialist Movement (NSM), with about 400 members in 32 states, is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what 'vast majority' are you talking about? Are we now psychoanalyzing millions of people with a broad stroke? There is nothing intellectual about your approach. It is heavy-handed and immature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, i'll ask you the same question - do you feel like the 'alt-right' is an actual threat? and by what basis you feel that way?

       David Duke was an imperial wizard of the KKK and in the Louisiana House of Representatives.  I don't think you need to be a card carrying member of a racist group to outwardly support or secretly support their ideals.

       If alt-right sentiments became the norm, I assure you that 4chan would swing hard Left just to fuck with the "normies". It's the only reason why they started going hard Right during The Election anyway; it was the most offensive position to take that could get the maximum amount of lulz.

       Agree 100%. There's a lot of people online that like trolling people. South Park did a great job of satirizing that, when Randy became an online troll. It's troubling to see guys like Millennial Matt fed to the wolves, when it appears that his schtick was a joke. (Admittedly a tasteless, insensitive joke, but still a joke.)

       Actual Trump Quote: Check out the Nazi love in this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to all that we hold dear as Americans.”
      </p>
      <p>
       How Drumpf could say something so despicable is beyond me. Anyone defending Donald Trump after saying something like that can leave this great country. That is not what our forefathers fought for.

       We haven't even seen an investigation into what happened. You are not a genuine, thoughtful person if you can't understand that we need both sides to calm down right now. luckily the actual number of neo-nazis and white supremacists is so small that this ridiculous charade will pass. Don't stoke the fires of hate. If you're not careful, your anti-nazi stance will suddenly become very nazi in practice. Remember - the nazis started their reign by demonizing a group of people. Aren't you doing the same?

       how do you propose you fight white supremacists? his "both sides" argument has been widely condemned even in his own party. people are violent towards white supremacists because we've seen what happened when those people thrive. this false moral equivalence is laughable.

       With the law?
      </p>
      <p>
       If somebody wants to be a white supremacist and doesn't break any laws and is peaceful, then we let them. The law covers hate speech and crime - it is well represented. This sudden revelation that nazis are out in full force is a false dichotomy - it doesn't have any bearing in real life and its a complete exaggeration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any neo-nazi or WS that breaks the laws - hate or otherwise - should be punished. However, trying to corral every 'alt-right nazi' into a group for slaughter is no better than what the Nazis did themselves. Dont' turn into what you hate. Freedom can be uncomfortable sometimes, but there are lines in the sand (the law) for a reason.

       clearly you don't have an idea of what a white supremacist is. equating them to peaceful is ridiculous. i'm going to make a wild guess and assume you're not the target of these groups. i'm against them because they want me destroyed. there's nothing peaceful about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as your previous argument goes, check out paradox of tolerance. it states:  Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you think the law is the solution then by all means. again, i assume your life isn't in danger if these groups flourish. i personally don't have that luxury. nazism was not defeated by people who peacefully asked them to stop. the civil rights act happened because people fought for them in the streets. same with labor laws, equal marriage. society isn't some benevolent entity that give everyone the same rights. they were fought for and won.

       Also, why don't you consider the law into your worldview? What crimes are going unpunished? The law applies to everybody fairly (except the rich). Hate laws have been put into place to curb this kind of thinking and behavior. Outside of no longer being a free society, I dont know how you police this better than the law does.

       There is no reason to believe these groups are flourishing. These people make up less than 0.05% of the population in total (in terms of identifying as a neo-nazi/WS). Yes - there are hateful, crazy people out there. I can point you to some BLM nut jobs who have also taken lives, but that isn't representative of the whole or the message.

       downplaying which events? there hasn't even been a full investigation report released and you're ready to hang the guy? The police booked him for 2nd degree murder, which designates that it was not pre-meditated. How can a 'terrorist attack' not be pre-meditated? Could it be that this kid killed her through negligence and not due to ideology? especially considering she's a white woman and not a target of these hate groups?
      </p>

       Try using some critical thought sometime. There were 9 homicides in Chicago alone on the same day - do they not matter or do we only pay attention to what the media tells us?

       Full investigation? There are images of that guy in the front of the line with a shield in that rally. There is video of his attack. Two police died because of the incitement they endorsed inappropriately. They came with weapons, mace, and very aggressive stances.

      <p>
       There's video of several white men clearly beating a black man in a parking deck. I'm not exactly sure what you think happened during the whole situation but I tell you one thing. The guy who started the rally can't sleep right and privatized his twitter profile. If you think they somehow need to be protected for anything you're mistaken. They have every right to say whatever they want but when you show up the way you do and act the way you act there is not going to be any tolerance, ever. Being a person who was white what if she was jewish? Why does that part matter at all to you? She was someone who
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       racist, you have to remember that. She was against it.

       Chicago itself has more killings in the entire year. There is a gun ban specifically in the city. When you make those kind of changes they alter the way they operate. The line is hardened and the criminals act accordingly. The city itself is a major drug hub so, when you're talking about the city of Chicago it has many a fault but they're not killing in the name of a supremacy of people, just drugs.

       I never claimed there wasn't any violence, but I hope those men were charged with hate crimes. The penalties are stiff. I haven't seen any evidence of a sharp rise in hate crimes or anything from the neo-nazis and WS extreme either.

       and look at how they responded after getting absolutely slammed in the media this week... do you hear of anything noteworthy? or do you hear a bunch of internet trolls groaning and a some ideological dinosaurs in extremely small numbers (est. 0.05% of the population) who should just be ignored and punished if they act on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, your anti-nazi stance becomes pretty nazi. We have the law for a reason - hate crimes are represented and carry additional penalty. Unless you're advocating for charging people with pre-crime based on ideology, i'm not sure what you're trying to get at.

       Why are you giving the mechanics a free pass? The helicopter is to be ridden in. The fact that they were going to the rally is not related at all. For you to try to blame that on the people involved in the protest when they had proper permits is asinine.

       Yes we all agree on that, but we don't put them in jail or hurt them because they aren't as cultured as you would like them to be. You don't know why they prescribe to these ideologies, and your hate towards these people might be mirrored in their own experience. The law is the only way to police this properly and fairly - otherwise we need to tolerate other people's opinions. I don't know if it was you who brought up the 'paradox of intolerance' earlier, but the answer to that is simply to uphold the law. Intolerant acts can be charged as hate crimes. Intolerant speech can be charged as hate speech. End of story. No need for concentrations camps in the 21st century, like what you might conjure up...

       Nothing conjured. I'm not looking for someone to blame to make my argument sound. You can be the one to blame the mechanic. Could have been another person that died instead I guess and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       we can blame the mechanic. Your pedantic breakdown of succession to a death is terrible. I can't imagine that was their destination prior to the call for state of emergency.

       The law does need to be upheld but again you are completely disregarding the information I stated previously. They came with intent. The law will do hopefully what it was intended to do there are pictures circulating of the people who did the violence. You're right, rule of law determines the situation. You're disgusting to think your argument of people who have evidence against themselves of acting in a violent way makes it okay for them to speak. We are in the 21st century, the rest of the troglodytes need to catch up or get the drift.

       1000 people showed up but millions are defending them. It shouldn't be controversial to hate the kkk, nazis and the alt right(who are white supremacists with a friendlier name). But so many people think that just because liberals don't like them they automatically have to disagree. The right and left should be able to agree on things but people are so petty and spiteful they will defend abhorrent racists out of spite

       you realize you just said that it should be okay for you to hate the hate groups because they hate people? Again, this is the domain of the law. If they are peaceful and law-abiding, we are better off spending our energy finding ways of making this better and relating to one another.

       Again, why doesn't this same logic apply to WS/neo-nazis? You are a hypocrite. i'm not sticking up for any of these people's ideologies either - I just acknowledge that things get really dicey when we start getting punitive over opinions. You are more or less calling for a 1984 situation where censorship rules over all. I think that is a mistake.

       yes you are calling for censorship because you don't want these people to be able to have their opinions. You want them to either hide it or you want them jailed/eliminated. There is no other way of interpreting your stance on this.

       Well we tried that and look what happened.... you create situations that are powder kegs and on top of it, guys like Soros will use their crisis actors to stir up trouble and gain political will.

       Just a thought here--but maybe some of these protests and action should actually be taken against the DNC?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the hadn't rigged the primaries against Bernie, he would have won the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is anecdotal only, but 95% of every person I know who voted 3rd party (and most of the people I know voted 3rd party) would've voted Bernie in a heart beat, and at least 1/3 of the Republican voters I know also would have. Not because they agreed with his policies, but because he seemed like a genuinely good man. I've read a lot of stories online of people who say similar.

       Thats some moral masterbation right there. If you really wanted to help why not do it in a location that is actually racist. NYC is one of the least racist places on the planet, you are just preaching to the choire. Even just doing it in upstate new york would have helped more.

       They are the patsy for the impetus of reducing civil rights or thought policing.  And all of it is to ensure that we don't rise up against the 1% and tax the fuck out of them.  It's all for show.  Now that these groups are 'hate groups' or 'extremists', they'll be spied on and locked up one by one.

       I support the attitude behind your appeal to calm.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing which makes the events of this week urgent--to me--is that the President of the United States really does seem to
       <em>
        enjoy
       </em>
       the support of the white supremacists at the Charlottesville rally. I believe it is important for the good people of this nation to demonstrate at volume that it is unacceptable for our political leaders to flirt with fascism.

      <p>
       Trump has perverted a number of our political norms already, and I hope that this one is a bridge too far.

       Can you point to a couple of examples of the media making false inflammatory claims on this issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all I've noticed in the past week or so is lots of reporting on the murder of an innocent woman by a white-supremacist, and the President's claim that anti-racists like the victim were partly to blame. Which is genuinely outrageous.

       I guess it comes down to how "real" you consider the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put aside more egregious stuff like paid shills and disingenuous people (concern trolls, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people tend to be much more strident and abrasive on the internet than they would be in person. Anonymity inflames this, but you also see people using their real names on social media use inflammatory language they would never use in real life. Does hatefulness not count if it's limited to 4Chan and Twitter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure of my own opinion on the matter. It's certainly preferable to violence on the streets, but people using hateful slurs and violent language on social media isn't nothing. Maybe there's little-to-no bleed over into real life, but I've certainly noticed a gradual uptick in hatefulness between sjw/alt-right types online.

       I was the same, felt like racism was going away.  I was just ignorant and ignoring it though.  I dated and married a black woman and started noticing it all over.   Work, stores we shopped at, and I even have family who won't see or talk to me now.  It's around and people like OP are just ignorant or pretending they aren't racist themselves.

       I was like that too. But since 2002, I just started noticing people being more and more open about their racism, coming to  crescendo last year during the run up to the campaign.  People I've known for a long time, I can't even stand to be around them anymore.   I just don't get it.  I grew up around the same stuff they did and it is incomprehensible to me to have the views they do.  Weak minded assholes is all I see now.

       People live in their own manicured bubbles, no one is "racist" because it's not societally acceptable. IF you call out people for their racist shit, a lot of "white" allies start realizing the racist shit they do. There's a reason a whole chunk of my white friends are regurgitating this "I see both sides, are we taking down washington now?" shit, and it's not because my northerner friends give a fuck about statues

       Yeah, I live in Michigan, and you'd think as a Union state we wouldn't have much of an issue. But sadly, I see intense racism every day from horrible people. Cement City, Westland, and a few others are a hotbed for White Supremecists and Neo-Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day I had to wait on a customer who was a biker, saying the black guy pumping gas made him uncomfortable, and he's glad he was packing, in case he approached. The biker was decked out in Iron Crosses, SS pins, and Swastikas (and one Michigan State Police patch for some reason..). The black guy he was talking about was a 20 something kid who was a regular and was there every night. But cement city is only a few miles away, so I see these Nazis pretty often.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a white man, and I see racism every single day, even though it's not against me. I'm sick of people who seriously think it's some made up problem.

       Well I don't work on Saturdays but I see race issues almost every single day. Some people yelling or screaming or calling each other (towards myself too) terrible names. So there's that.

       AGREED! in my lowend conservative suburb, my unemployed enighbors owrry about the impending race war. "They" are coming out of the city to get us! These car breakins are just scouting missions! They tell me that if i were to go into the 'hood' that id be kidnapped and beheaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Que my job. I hangout in hoods all the time. I'm a surveyor. Every alley gets surveyed. EVERY ALLEY. 
I try to dress like a halfhippie outdoorsman, we leave a person next to our equipment, and we have NO ISSUES.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen the other side also. I've had older inner city school kids tell other school kids to stay away from us because we're white and will arrest them if they get in our way, or that we will take them and make them work. (no joke)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its all propaganda. Whoevere spouts talk of an actual war of aggression between the two races must be enjoyable to listen to because they are full of shit
      </p>
      <p>
       (also, they should really be complaining about the white folk here to take their land. Oh yeah, they think they know their property lines, what they dont know is that we're here to expand road easements,m to expand the road, to later REZONE!)

       It's like the situation in hong kong. We have a huge bunch of "Democracy Groups" Waiting to induce revolutionary terror so they can depopulate hong kong and build a us base there so it can directly attack china.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is everyone i know personally in hong kong all unanimously sees them as what they are: Insane, Dangerous Wretches.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The same goes for the LGBT problem. You see that there are so many LGBT people on screen and the msm forces us to worship them as gods. The reality is: 99 percent of people i know are NOT LGBT. Out of all of the friends i know, maybe only 2 are LGBT (Both Bisexual). And i have friends all over the internet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       And finally England's Islamization. My mother went to england for work and takes place in london. The reality in the most populous place of london from what she told me, It was not like africa. It was still like London. Most people she saw were still English.  It's a different story for Other areas i think but for the whole 4 days she was in london.

       The moral is do not swallow the words of the media by word. They are always here to cause the divide by exeggravating events and helping only one side, left or right. No neutral media. Those who were neutral were censored almost instantly.

       After Agassiz came to the United States he wrote prolifically on polygenism, the idea that races were created separately, that they could be classified on the basis of specific climatic zones, and that they were endowed with unequal attributes,[32] ideas now included under the rubric of scientific racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cambridge elementary school north of Harvard University was named in his honor and the surrounding neighborhood became known as "Agassiz" as a result. The school's name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21, 2002, due to concerns about Agassiz's racism, and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin the African-American principal of the school who served from 1889 until 1922.[26][27] The neighborhood, however, continues to be known as Agassiz.[28]

      <p>
       <a href="https://agassizschool.org/">
        https://agassizschool.org/
       </a>
       - Nevertheless, the Agassiz school exists in another form, for kids pre-K through 8th grade in Chicago. 3rd graders get to go to a school named for a guy who argued the races are genetically unequal and promoted scientific racism

       Yes but he STILL did so much more good than bad that cultural relativism can look upon him favorably. He wasn't giving speeches about killing or enslaving gay people. He was giving speeches about empowering humanity and coming together, his own personal faults be damned.

       Now that I think about it.  We had a rally by white supremacist and nationalist.  Same event happened the year before.  In this event you had a tragedy.  A white supremacist that murdered a white female.   White supremacist that killed a white female.
      </p>
      <p>
       These statues have been standing for many many years.  Rallies and protest have happened over the years but without violence until this year.  We have known astroturf leadership on one side.  We have a governor who made the decision to not allow police to intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US how many Nazi's, white supremacists are there? I live in the south and never see this. I see confederate flags occasionally but never see nazi symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have mass hysteria and everyone calling half of the country racists.  The stupidity that is occurring is truly unbelievable.

       As a general rule of thumb, it's good to remember that just because you don't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Not saying we're on the brink of a race war, but we should try to look beyond our anecdotal experiences.

       I'm not particularly afraid of white-nationalism, I'm more afraid of the status quo. That said, it does seem like the number of people who believe in racist ideologies and the jewish conspiracy have jumped in recent years among young right wingers. Maybe that's just the internet magnifying those voices.

       No the number of media stories about these people have dramatically increased. I'm from Alabama and i have literally never met a single nazi or extreme alt right or whatever the hell you want to call them. Now all of a sudden the media wants you to think that anything conservative is associated with some bullshit extreme 'alt right.' This is fucking ridiculous.

       This somewhat leads to ignorance. Just because  something doesn't directly affect you or your daily routine, doesn't make it any less of a valid problem, or future to be problem. I'm not denying that things are being said in a hyperbolic way, for example, making the few hundreds of people with questionable beliefs in Charlottesville seem like an entire army, when in actuality it's just a small group of people, being actually helped by the media coverage. But still, you have to acknowledge the problem, in order to stop it from perpetually getting bigger and eventually doing more harm than if it would've been handled to begin with.

       I'd wager to say that almost no one in regular life thinks a civil war is going to happen. Also, almost no one thinks the news media is trying to goad the country into civil war. This idea of a civil war is a manifest of the echo chamber that is r/conspiracy.

       Reminder: The only people pushing for civil war are either globalist shills, kikes or indoctrinated retards who are unaware they are pushing a globalist zionist agenda. Civil war and unrest in America is the wet dream of groups like ADL, AIPAC, The Hasbara, JIDF, Israel, Soros’ Open Society or some other filthy and dirty zionist organization  that pays people to shill here.

       "Redpilled" people screaming for RACE WAR NOW are just as dumb as socialistic liberal retards. Without Law &amp; Order we would be crumbling into a war torn shit hole and vulnerable to regime shifts. If we actually had a civil war we could be attacked by foreign countries, we could lose many of our rights, and many people could die pointless deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody wants a civil war but people who seek to destroy America. Deescalation and diplomacy are what you should be supporting. The far left is pushing to shut down diplomacy, escalate the situation and create a conflict. A conflict without discussion and diplomacy will only lead to violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       BLM, Antifa, BAMN, Charlottesville psyop, etc... are attempts at inciting a crisis. So far tension is building and people are becoming more and more radical and unreasonable. These are funded organized movements with the goal of growing into something that takes on a life of it's own.

       I'm going to tell you this is all relative to where you live.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in San Diego, and while I have not experienced a rise in anti black or semetic tendencies, I have seen a rise in racism towards our Mexican brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
       A short story, my co worker was working his manager shift at a Denny's. A white guy comes in, completely normal looking, and asks for a grand slam Togo. My co worker puts in the order and goes about his business.
      </p>
      <p>
       5-10 minutes passes, no food. My co worker goes to the window and asks in Spanish why it's taking so long, it's a dead store , yada yada yada. All of a sudden the guy who ordered the food comes out of no where.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Aye," he says.  "What were you two talking about back there?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "I was asking him about your order?" My coworker responds confused. Literally never has he ever had a customer ask him what he was saying when he was talking to a co worker in Spanish.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well I don't understand that language and you seemed angry," the man replied.
      </p>
      <p>
       My coworker describes his face as a mixture of confusion and aghast. This put the customer over.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I hear a lot of Spanish back there. English is America's national language, ya know? You got any illegals back there? How would you like it if I got ICE to come down here and check everyones documentation?" He put both his hands to his hips and my coworker swears on his life that on his right hand are the letters TRUMP tatted on this otherwise upper middle class looking guy's knuckles.
      </p>
      <p>
       My co worker apologized for.....Speaking spanish? He gave the man his food for free to attempt to avert trouble, and now is getting written up by the regional manager for potentially subjecting the store to a possible ICE raid.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck....This is southern California. We are very tolerant here, and we still are. However I see racists coming out of the wetwork and becoming more vocal AND they are harder to avoid/ignore because they are attempting to rebrand themselves and white nationalism as a political movement, ala Alt-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be curious to know where you're from to compare experiences.

       Yeah. I had a guy show up at my job and say "There's a black man in the building!" .. and no one gave a shit if he was black or white, he was just a man who came in and announced he was there. We couldn't help him with what he needed so he left.

       This mindset is a perfect example of what is wrong with civilization. If you dont see it, it doesnt exist is flawed logic. The idea that all this anger and frustration is the product of the media is also flawed logic. It puts the blame on the media for simply doing its job. Do they amplify the anger? Sure they cover things people will watch and things that will get them ratings. The media doesnt fuel our anger, our anger attracts the media. We fuel our own distress by watching, posting and sharing media to maintain our mindset and reinforce our beliefs.

       People are upset and justly so. Everyone will calm down soon, but now is a time to recognize the dangerous mindset that infests our fellow americans, citizens and president.

       The only reason for everyone being "angry" now is because they ruined their own lives. This current system of anger and violence is just a scapegoat for people who fucked up and need someone or something to blame.

       Thai-American friend of mine was having dinner with her husband at a fancy restaurant, hear an older couple next to them talking loudly about how Asians and Jews are the races whites should hate the most, blacks of course but Asians and Jews are the ones in positions of power right now, and should be more hated by the general populace.

       Just a nice restaurant on a Friday night in a big city, proudly discussing fucked up racist shit for all to overhear. The barely-there previous fear of being ostracized for being a racist is fading away. It will not lead to a civil war here, but it's really fucked up to hear about, much less experience.

       I wish I can say that, but... in my case, at work I hear lots of bullshit small talk among the same minded people tring to justify shit that was happening in central Va. Worst part is I can hear most of their talks because they are next to my cubicle. Almost always I have to get up and walk away cuz I cannot sit and listen anymore.
I guess looking at it from the bright side, it's good to  have motivation to get, walk and stretch occasionally.

       Yes, while you are right about the exaggeration of conflict and the sort of misleading news that is propelled by media and what not, you cannot live your life thinking so close minded that because you in fact didnt see any conflict or suffering, that means there is no conflict or suffering at all. It certainly is still present although you may not have experienced it yourself, right?

       Being a white person who doesn't witness or experience racism first-hand doesn't mean we get to say racism doesn't exist... this type of ignorant perspective is exactly what upsets POC who actually experience those things, and who get no empathy because others don't witness it themselves.

       I actually wish more people were focused on this, and not the opposite. They're using these events as excuses to curtail our rights. They're using these events as excuses to push people to further divide.

       I purposefully avoid the news local and otherwise just because it's either shit that is directed to make me angry like having colleges make white people attend a class to check their privilege or it's someone locked a baby in a car and it died. It's so depressing and demoralizing that I just avoid it save for the weather.

       People need something to occupy their time.  I'm alright with it being people wanting to work toward ending racism and not tolerating white nationalism.  I don't necessarily believe that people are going to fight the nationalists.  Those on the left and the far left tend to be peace loving folk.

       Actually... I work at IBM and we had an email from our CEO Ginny explaining that IBM has withdrawn from the presidents technology advisory council. She said we have always advised presidents until now. The reason for withdraw is because he wasn't strong enough in condemning the Charlotte "supremacists".
      </p>

       I'm honestly sad about this. I like my company and I'm proud we were helping to provide leadership in our nation. But the media really spun Trump's message out of proportion and context. I understand from a PR perspective that we have to distance the company from the media-popularized perception of Trump's response. It's just sad that what is going on forces IBM to make these decisions to protect our brand and profitability.

       The reason why you don't see racism, hate, screaming, etc at work is because there are very strong coercive forces suppressing all of that in the workplace.  It's bad for business and you wouldn't last long if you made your workplace suffer for your political views.  If you want to know who people really are you have to see what they are willing to say when they have what they perceive as personal anonymity.  "Give a  man a mask and he'll show his true face."

       It's working. Even on the sports blog I like to read, accusations of racism are flying around in the comments. They are thinking and acting exactly as intended. I remember as a kid (I'm 48) there used to be a lot of talk of 'peace' and how we hope to attain it. We don't hear that any more.

       Today my black coworker's son dropped out of college in the bible belt because there had been violence against blacks by groups in the area. Its not literally everywhere and most of us don't experience it because we're white. Not all minorities are experiencing this but some are, and we shouldn't ignore this issue.

       Like I said man, it was a conversation with a coworker. The violence could be even as little as just shoving for all I know, the point was his son didn't feel safe. This is the thing we shouldn't be ignoring, the fact that some people are legitimately scared. I'm not saying anything political in this except that we simply can't dismiss an issue that doesn't affect us directly just because we don't see it everyday. Once you see this on a regular, daily basis the problem is too big. Its the same arguement most have about Islamic terrorism: just because most of you are not violent terrorists doesn't mean we can't react to, and against, those of you who are. This is a simplification of an analogy I have thought much about and my views are not this simple, please do not think I'm saying all Muslims are terrorists or that I am saying those ignoring the problem is a terrorist; all I am trying to express is that in the interest of all other humans, we have to acknowledge that there are people committing crimes against people because of the color of their skin and that this must stop. Your children should not fear their community.

       Why are most people not screaming at each other and still going about their daily lives? Because politics is not their lives.
People who come up hard against politics in some way or another and decide to fight are the ones who are living this. People in the BLM movement who have seen one too many of their friends killed or falsely imprisoned by a racist system. People in the environmental movement who have seen friends beaten at peaceful protests, who have had comrades murdered for getting too close to the truth of corporate ecological-rape. People who have worked all their lives only to end up on the wrong side of a ridiculously huge medical bill because they made redundant then got cancer and refuse to sit down and eat their popcorn and watch their tv every night like good citizens. 
Until you come up against wrong doing and refuse to hide your head and ignore it. Until you start fighting your corner only then will you see how desperate things get, and how people end up sat on the floor peacefully protesting, then marching, then fighting.
So many people look upon those who protest and those who fight as 'someone else'. That person is not like me. But they are like you, exactly like you.

       I'm 52 white male, biker type,best friend 65 black male, artist type, we go to home depot together security doesnt know which one of us to follow ..we laugh n split up just to mess with 'em. I asked him today if he would possibly take a chance of being seen with "whitey" n have a beer..He replied "hell yes mate" ! and we did ..neighborhood bar,arts district Las Vegas. There was NO rude comments, NO racism, NO trauma ,..to anyone.. of any kind ! Just because STUPIDITY surrounds one doesn't necessitate being a participant in it...Moreover it REQUIRES those of us who've seen some shit that is no fucking good , to stand up n be the VOICES of REASON,LOGIC and GUIDANCE to those young souls esily influenced by hearsay and disinformation.Much luck to us all !!

       If there is a dearth of evidence supporting a claim, odds are said claim is false. I f you wish to be taken seriously, produce some evidence supporting the claim that America has experienced an increase in racism or nazism.

Fat girls with purple hair half shaved, gay dudes etc. No one paying any more attention to any else outside of not bumping into them.

       Wanna know what else I didn't see? 2.5million inmates locked in prison. 2.3 million military personnel. 13k military aircraft. 42million immigrants. 1.6million homeless people..
      </p>
      <p>
       But statisically, they all exist.
       <br/>
       I get your point, this "race war" shit is completely overhyped. But to believe that these alt-right arent the vile hate-filled people they've led us to believe they are, or that their numbers aren't as large as they claim, is the same as pretending those inmates and homeless people aren't really a problem. If you dont address an issue when it arises, it becomes a crisis.

       Right. The ''terrorist'' meme is pretty played out now they're onto nazis/racism. There are probably only a handful of white supremacists in the country (excluding prisons), the others are on some agency payroll, just like terrorists, only a few in reality. If you're old enough you'd remember the ''red scare'' of the 50s, the flag burning uproar in the 80s, then the drug scare just say no of the 80s/90s. While in reality people worldwide are quietly going about their lives and very little real drama outside of the concoction network.

       Looking back you can readily see that the real reasons for just about any and all wars were never the ones given to those who wound up fighting and dying in them, nor did any of those who presumably won and survived them ever get anything more out of them besides getting to return to their more ordinary lives in the very same or even in some lesser state than they left them in... and you see that over, and over, and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact you can see the blindness and senselessness to it enough times to seriously wonder how that can possibly be?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the answer to that is actually a very simple one. People would rather trust and follow whatever the authorities tell them and find out that they've been betrayed only later and after the fact, than face the possibility that they're being deliberately set-up and lied to from the very beginning, all the way through, and even long after it's all over. They not only won't believe that there are people who could possibly ever do that to them but can't bring themselves to believe or accept it even when they know it's true.

       The news has "producers" whose job is not to report a variety of important topics.  They are there to keep you tuned to their station.  They choose to produce entertainment through the exploitation of events, dialectical materialism, conspiring in false flags, searching through sound bites, and so forth.  And not just entertainment for advertising profit, but they are guilty of the problem reaction solution mechanism that gives away liberty and classified thought as good or bad.

       Probably no more people than a WBC rally yet the media will convince you that every conservative is secretly on edge of these people and that they are a growing threat. It's pure fucking propaganda.

       Full investigation? There are images of that guy in the front of the line with a shield in that rally. There is video of his attack. Two police died because of the incitement they endorsed inappropriately. They came with weapons, mace, and very aggressive stances.

       A documentary made directly with the nazis and anti-semites.
      </p>

       There's video of several white men clearly beating a black man in a parking deck. I'm not exactly sure what you think happened during the whole situation but I tell you one thing. The guy who started the rally can't sleep right and privatized his twitter profile. If you think they somehow need to be protected for anything you're mistaken. They have every right to say whatever they want but when you show up the way you do and act the way you act there is not going to be any tolerance, ever. Being a person who was white what if she was jewish? Why does that part matter at all to you? She was someone who
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       racist, you have to remember that. She was against it.

       Chicago itself has more killings in the entire year. There is a gun ban specifically in the city. When you make those kind of changes they alter the way they operate. The line is hardened and the criminals act accordingly. The city itself is a major drug hub so, when you're talking about the city of Chicago it has many a fault but they're not killing in the name of a supremacy of people, just drugs.

       Actually quite annoying had to take a couple of small streets to get around since the police had closed everything off. Of course it had to happen the day I was in the region.
