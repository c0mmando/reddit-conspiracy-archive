<p><strong>Temple of Set</strong> - Separated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Satan">Church of Satan</a>; - Set = Egyptian Satan</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set</a></p>

<p><em>In 1984, one US Army lieutenant colonel Michael Aquino, a psychological operations specialist, was being investigated by the military concerning allegations of pedophilia surrounding a daycare center at The Presidio of San Francisco when it was still a US Army post. No charges were brought against Aquino. He was protected by his fellows. Aquino was a member of the Church of Satan but split off as a founder of the Temple of Set (Set referring to the Egyptian god of whom Aquino holds Satan is a derivative). This concept is the opposite of unity and oneness and wholeness as expressed by Jesus.</em></p>

<p><em>The Set followers are solipsistic, meaning they hold that the self is the only knowable reality (not self in God and God&#39;s self in one but rather the self as willpower apart from God). This stream is heading in the opposite direction of Jesus Christ. It is antichrist. It is the individual human will above all. It leads to the Leopold and Loeb mentality. It is in line with Nietzsche, Machiavelli, Ayn Rand, humanism (the apostate brand), libertarianism (also the apostate brand), militarism, capitalism, etc., which cascades into sociopathy where others are seen as there to do with as the strong please since to evil minds, survival of the fittest is the law and the fittest are those most capable of ruthlessness for selfish aims. Lust can easily be unbridled. Appetites, distorted by abuse, can be hedonistically indulged without compassion. The downward spiral is all rationalized away. These currents never lead to Christlikeness. They never lead to giving and sharing all freely. They always lead to taking for self at the expense of others. They license deception to achieve their aims, which they often claim are ennobling no matter how depraved. It is the hypocritical direction.</em></p>

<p><strong>MindWar</strong></p>

<p><em>Along with retired major general Paul E. Vallely, who has been a senior military analyst for FOX News, Aquino co-authored a paper entitled, From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory. That paper advocated in 1980 much of the mindset that is being projected now by the US military. The basic tenets of the paper include being absolutely convincing that you will outlast any enemy (never quitting) and completely dominating mass media both foreign and domestic including not allowing the home front to hear or see any information coming from the other side. By extension, this leads to terrorizing (if the first stages in the MindWar fail) an enemy into believing in the futility of resistance.</em></p>

<p><em>Fascinated by Nazi paganism, Aquino conducted satanic rituals at Nazi SS (Schutzstaffel; defense echelon) chief Heinrich Himmler&#39;s Wewelsburg Castle in Bavaria. Aquino wrote about the ritual he conducted at Himmler&#39;s castle as follows:</em></p>

<p><em>... the Wewelsburg was conceived by Heinrich Himmler to be the &quot;Mittelpunkt der Welt&quot; (Middle of the World), and as the focus of the Hall of the Dead was to be the Gate of that Center, to summon the Powers of Darkness at their most powerful locus.</em></p>

<p><em>Are you connecting the dots yet? Perhaps as a propagandist, you knew all of this. Well, others will be reading it for the first time. They&#39;ll go out searching using Google, etc. They may run into &quot;The Finders&quot; and the &quot;Franklin Pedophile&quot; case and how it connects directly to the White House and how people &quot;mysteriously&quot; died surrounding the issues and how the FBI and U.S. military combined to cover it all up. Think 9/11 cover-up.</em></p>

<p><strong>On September 19, 1982, Michael Aquino purchases Johnny for $35,000.</strong></p>

<p><em>They travel to Colorado (to a house near Sedalia in the vicinity of Elephant Rock and Jarre Canyon; this house was shown on one of the AMW programs broadcast in 1992) where Johnny begins a program of torture, mind control and prostitution. Aquino is a military intelligence officer with ties to the CIA’s mind control branch; he has the contacts, resources and motivation to head an organization of criminals that kidnap children and transform them into sex slaves to satisfy his own personal mental illness while disguising the operation under the umbrella of “national security.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Satanic subversion of the U.S. Military - Franklin Coverup + Michael Aquino identified as who ordered the kidnappings</strong></p>

<p>Paul Bonacci, who was simultaneously a victim and a member of the nationwide pedophile crime syndicate, has subsequently identified Aquino as the man who ordered the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch. In his February 5 testimony, Bonacci referred to the mastermind of the Gosch abduction as &quot;the Colonel.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Reinventing Religion: Ancient Egypt in the European History of Religion</strong></p>

<p><em>The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZbIBSRU.jpg">“Prince of Darkness”</a> appeared to him as the deity Set, who declared that he wanted to be worshiped by his original name, Set, which had become obsolete as humans had come to know him as Satan and Lucifer. Set had already revealed himself to the ancient Egyptians, but, while the priesthood of the god Osiris knew a “Book of the Dead,” Set now wanted to reveal a “Book of Life.” Based on this etiology, Michael Aquino named the new organization the “temple” of the god Set, where “temple” refers, not to a building, but to the human being itself as a vessel for the personal conception of Satan.</em></p>

Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruin.
Is the scene of evil doings
It&#39;s a place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats&#39; innards.
I guess it&#39;s the same, where ever you may go
Oh lord yeah</p>

<p>Carry banners which denounce the lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with dead rat&#39;s blood</p>

<p>See them stick the stake through me
Oh</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hold me back cause I just gotta go
They&#39;ve got a hold of my soul now
Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene
Look in my eyes I&#39;m there enough
Yeah</p>

<p>On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyre
Casts the priest into the fire
It&#39;s the place for all bad sinners.

    <div class="md"><p>Well... crap.  I changed ISPs last week.  Now I&#39;m going looking for it, and it seems to have gone straight down the memory hole.  It&#39;s a Christian novel, published <em>right before</em> Aquino&#39;s paper, in 1979 I believe.  The name was <em>almost</em> the same as Mindwar.  It might have even been Mindwar, or Brain Wars or something like that.  It was on Amazon.  And the author is well-known, with a Wiki page.  But now I&#39;m finding five different books by that name, one from 1979 even, and none of them are it.</p>

<p>My internet is really screwed up lately.  Google seems to think I&#39;m in Dubai.  I&#39;ll keep looking.</p>

<p>Holy Bible, book of Revelation, chapter 19:11-14.
&quot;11 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had[a] a name written that no one knew except Himself. 13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 14 And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean,[b] followed Him on white horses.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird man, and very weird things discussed concerning him. There have been so many things said, from the very serious to the outlandish that it is hard to find your way through it all. Ultimately though the presidio affair is much darker and much more real than most people realize. It was swept under the rug with the &quot;satanic panic&quot;, but there was some definite hinky shit attached to Aquino. He is brilliant man, but an evil one. There is more to him than meets the eye. The satanic panic was not the hysterical witch hunt that the journalists would have you think. In fact it was the journalists that usually were at fault in overblowing obviously silly cases, and underreporting, and even misreporting on the serious ones. There was serious exposure of the darker underbelly of the government/MIC during that time. Read about the franklin scandal for some info on it. That shit was real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those pictures of &#39;military men doing Satanic handsigns&#39; could also be a simple marksmanship drill to establish which eye is dominant when aiming a weapon. Do you have audio suggesting otherwise? Them doing training would make more sense than a bunch of guys in uniform worshipping Satan.</p>

<p>Also, your post seems a bit biased, subtley suggesting that Christianity is the right way to think. A lot of your links are Christian sensationalism from the days of the Satanic Panic.</p>

<p>This Aquino guy is a strange character, but the military doesn&#39;t work the way you suggest; that a single Colonel could use his command for child kidnapping and torture. If there was ever any evidence that children were harmed on a base or operationally in the capacity you suggest, there would be a mob of angry fathers and mothers going after this guy relentlessly, by any and all means.</p>

<p>Some details of your post are compelling. One part you didn&#39;t cover was that Aquino did write some religious manuals for the Army that painted his belief systems in a more positive way. But, the reality is that the military is secular and no one really cares, I doubt his manual converted many soldiers to the Temple of Set. Chaplains are usually Christian, but soldiers can be whatever faith they choose, and even get time to pray or worship, whatever that means to them. And honestly, it doesn&#39;t even come up very much, besides maybe a prayer before a mission or optional bible studies occasionally, its not a driving force.</p>

<p>He probably did some hocus pocus stuff at Wewelsburg castle, but that doesn&#39;t mean there really are dark forces to summon.</p>

<p>The people who care most about characters like this tend to be fundamentalist Christians that make alarmist videos. Look up any YouTube video about this guy, its almost always on a channel called &#39;christiantruth&#39;, or &#39;lightofgod&#39;, outside of his opposition, I don&#39;t think people take him too seriously. I doubt that Aquino actually hurt anyone, evidence would have surfaced by now, the guy has been somewhat of a public figure outspoken on his personal controversial ideology for decades now.</p>

<p>About the solipsism this is also known as the service to self polarity of choice spoken of and detailed in the law of one material. If you are interested in understanding the polarity of choice which according to Ra is what level of will of consiousness we are currently residing at/in.  This is the density of choice in which the entity begins the polarisation process. To graduate or be harvestable in this density it is required for service to others that your choices be polarised 51% service to others while for the service to self polarity requires an astonishing polarisation of 95% of choices service to self. This simple understanding imo makes so much sense of the world and the ensuing battle of light/dark. Right hand/left hand paths. </p>

<p>Some interesting information on this page here - <a href="http://www.controverscial.com/Michael%20A.%20Aquino.htm">http://www.controverscial.com/Michael%20A.%20Aquino.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>His mother Marian Dorothy Elisabeth Ford (affectionately known as <strong>Betty Ford</strong>) was a child prodigy, after only three years of early formal education and at the age of just fourteen years, she was enrolled as one of the youngest students ever admitted into <strong>Stanford University</strong>. </p>

<p>In 1985 Aquino’s devoted mother ‘Betty’ passed away having died of cancer in San Francisco.  Betty, who had steadfastly supported her son through all his endeavors including the child-abuse allegations, was also a <strong>High Priestess in his Temple of Set.</strong>  On her death she left her him a $3.2 million estate, which included <strong>a house leased by Project Care for Children and the Marin County Child Abuse Council</strong> (I have so far found no association here with the earlier allegations). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently he also had a sound proof room that was found during the Presidio investigations but claims that it was for religious use in chanting invocations so that he wouldn&#39;t bother his neighbors.</p>

<p>On August 14, 1987, a search warrant was served. Confiscated in the raid were videotapes, photos, photographic negatives, cassette tapes, and address books. Investigators also found a soundproof room.</p>

<p>The problem(s) come in with the blood-drinking, cannibalism, child molestation, rape, ritualistic murder, etc.  Usually the person having these things done to them are unwilling, thus a problem/wrong (I mean, if someone is willing, then it probably isn&#39;t a problem).</p>

<p>If any being does those things listed above, no matter which group they are associated with, or even lack of association with a group, it is wrong if it involves even one unwilling participant.  The issue is that satanists do those things more frequently and/or with intent with unwilling participants.</p>
