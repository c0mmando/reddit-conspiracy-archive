       Watch his interview of a Dutch ex-banker who literally said he had to quit his job after finding out what the top level bankers wanted him to do with children...
      </p>
      <p>
       he said something about having to be susceptible to blackmail in order to rise up to the top of the financial world.

       I'll explain exactly to you what they mean.

       Let's pretend me and you are buddies. Maybe we sell drugs.

       Here's what our emails look like:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Hey man i need 50 lbs of the green/ 420/ white / black.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Ok I'm gonna put it in this secret place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Green could mean asparagus for my small side produce business. But we all know it would be referring to drugs. Especially when you're hanging out on skid row.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these pizza and domino words are the equivalent to drug slang and anything else. These are even the terms the FBI looks for when searching for maybe not so elitist rings.

       No, I think the employee posting pics of a man pouring maple syrup on his naked body and with a pizza on his genitals with the Tag being "come to comet ping pong tonight" a little strange. You don't? Do you think that'd be strange if you didn't?

       Ok before we move past the codwords (because you still haven't provided any actual evidence). You don't think using pizza as a code word for child abuse in a pizza shop would lead to situations where people not involved in the abuse would soon learn?
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer your leading question: I certainly don't see a man pouring maple syrup on himself is in anyway connected to child abuse. To draw a conclusion that it does is a really unusual way to look at the world.

       It is sexual yes.

      <p>
       So let's recap we've established: A pizza place posted pictures sexual in nature (Before you say "omg it's a family restaurant", let's face it, sexual used in advertising across the board. Including family products and chain restaurants).
      </p>
      <p>
       What we haven't established: Evidence of code words, evidence of child abuse.

       Wrong. By establishing the pizza is somehow sexually related, we have uncovered that is code for something. Now maybe other codes around that might lead us somewhere else.

       Any business using sexual imagery to promote their business is also a front for a child sex ring? Is this where we've landed here?

       I'm quite certain you have seen it and I'm not feeling like linking smut. If you really care about this issue, go look at the Instagram pics that you are proclaiming as "taken out of context". You are acting like an authority, yet you aren't familiar with the evidence? How is that logical?

       I'm familiar with the "evidence" you're bringing up, and I am 100% certain the picture you are describing was not uploaded by James Alefantis, John Podesta, or any of accused.

       In other words, you are taking it out of context. It's a common tactic for pizzagate "investigators" to misrepresent their "evidence".

       But the image you mentioned has never been posted anywhere I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been following pizzagate since very early. I've seen every instagram post of JA. I've followed the pizzagate subreddit since it's inception to it's end. I have followed on voat and various chan sites during that time as well, and I have never seen that posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can prove me wrong I'd be really happy (as that would be a big step towards proving something is up with pizzagate).

       Please link me, either in a comment or a PM. If you won't link me please tell me exactly where I can find this image with proof of it's authenticity or what I must search to find it.

       I'm aware of the panda connections though (such as cumpanda and that panda magazine) but have never made a concrete conclusion on what I think it means (although I've seen people propose that it's a child who has two black eyes from being beaten).

       My intent is to question your motives of commenting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       You made the claim that there's a picture of men in a room with children grabbing lube and condoms out of a bowl at a party. To continue to comment without backing up that claim is extremely disingenuous, especially so when asked several times for proof of said claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should also apologize for how I came across in my original comment, it was much too harsh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you to provide this proof because you claim to be a warehouse of PG info. Please be that now, if possible. I'm a PG skeptic, I don't believe in PG as it originally started but can agree with the new intended focus of the investigation (you have to be fucking blind or dumb to not know that elites and their cronies are involved in a widespread international child trafficking ring).
      </p>
      <p>
       So Recovering, I hope I've laid out my case well enough for you. Please let me know if I need to clarify or if I've come across in an unflattering manner.

       Well, first I would like to question how you think that I come across as one of the most disingenuous users here. I'm fairly sure that you know the opposite is true. I don't treat this as a game. I take it very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the pic I was referring to, it's been circulated and a simple search- even on google- will quickly find it for you. I have spent a year looking at this disgusting shit and I honestly can't look at it anymore. Spend a year trying in earnest to debunk PG by actually looking at the evidence and you will understand what I mean by this. My spirit can only take so much and I assume the same will be for you.

       Pizza gate doesn't mean kids in the basement of the store. The MSM or whoever, kind of hijacked it and made it sound like that's what pizza gate was, to make it sound like not a big deal/obviously bullshit that a world child trafficking ring runs completely out of the basement like they made it sound. I could be wrong, but I think actual white supremacist/ nationalist / morons also hi-jacked the term "alt-right" although I don't know if the media is 100% to blame for that one. What I heard is Richard Spencer or some other clown like him started calling themselves that, and then it kind of ruined it for everyone. Like I said not 100% sure in the "alt-right" thing, but definitely 100% sure about pizzagate.

       The way I experienced it go down was:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Pizzagate" is coined to describe specific Comet Ping Pong speculation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pizzagate slowly gains ridicule, encourages an armed gunman, generally looks bad.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As a reaction, the term "Pizzagate" is expanded to include all elite pedophilia, and even ordinary pedophilia.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I don't know how accurate this is to the real usage of the word, maybe someone else has some examples of Pizzagate being used all-encompassingly before the MSM brought it to light publicly.

       Eh, I think you are a little naive if you think the content can't be disputed. The whole argument is built on the FBI code word system. Go figure that a pizza shop owner talks about pizza with people. Also some of the reasoning "There is a ping pong table in the background, it must be Comet's" is too much. Or that playing with children in a pool is some how pedophilic in nature is just circular reasoning. You have to abandon so much logic. I can't squint that hard man.

       Weren't the terms "cheese pizza" and "hot dogs" determined to be code words by the FBI? Because if they were determined by Roscoe and Jethro in their mom's basement for 4chan, that makes the theory even weaker.

       The only FBI thing is a PDF on Wikileaks that shows symbols
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       pedophiles have appropriated (hence why pizzagaters go crazy every time they see anything vaguely like a spiral).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Cheese pizza" predates pizzagate, it was used a lot on 4chan for almost as long as it existed and it was a joke not code. Of course such usage will have spread from 4chan and it's possible some stupid pedophiles used it. I've single a single screenshot purportedly selling child pornography on a .onion that used the term, but there's no reason to use code on a darknet site.

       The emails don't mention "cheese pizza" so

       That's what bugs me about it.  There's plenty of theorized conspiracies that I don't fully buy, but none of them seem to me as dangerous or persistent as PG.  IMHO the "evidence" cited by pizzagaters is so unbelievably flimsy, particularly in retrospect, that it's one of those theories that makes us look crazy.  Meanwhile more and more conspiracies are being proven correct and should be giving more credibility to the (obvious) notion that groups of powerful people collude to benefit their interests.  PG is like a thumb on the crazy side of the scale.

       Just like theories about Flat Earth and Reptilian Overlords, I think PG was designed to make our community look crazy to the casual observer.  Both of those theories also have countless of hours of coverage on youtube and very well designed websites trying to make them seem legit. There is probably some truth to PG, rich pedophiles what not, but no one will believe if solid evidence ever emerges.

       Yes, that too.  Shills are always trying to convince us the e-fits are of one person. But I have my own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe law enforcement knew it was them, but could not prove it with evidence (or didn't want to expose their knowledge and sources).  So instead, they created some incredibly accurate sketches hoping that someone would recognize them and come forward with evidence they could actually use.

       The kicker for me is the sketches were made long before the podestas were newsworthy.  Ask yourself what are the chances two men wanted for a crime would randomly happen to look like the Podesta brothers.

       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate has not been proven or disproven. There has been no formal investigations. There is circumstancial evidence. People get investigated for on circumstancial evidence all the time, even with less circumstancial evidence.

       It's easy to dismiss satanism as the outlandish eccentric fascinations of a few skewed individuals until they have a spirit cooking event for few of their friends, invite their movie star friends and you learn the person conducting the spirit cooking has associations with the political elite.

       It's reasonable to be concerned. Children's lives are at stake. Don't forget about Laura Silsby stealing 33 children from Haiti, that's never been explained.

       Right because having a mummified child in effigy (we hope) sitting in the corner in the same room that you're ladling blood and semen over a person and then eating it is somehow perfectly acceptable behavior.

       That's ... really strange. Why would that convince you of anything? You don't understand a description of a handkerchief a realtor found in
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zaqGYB4.png">
        a kitchen
       </a>
       in
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uUgkWc8.png">
        a rental house
       </a>
       on Martha's Vineyard, and somehow you leap to the conclusion that it's related to child sexual abuse. WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are handkerchiefs with maps (
       <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/map_handkerchief">

        3
       </a>
       ) and there are pizza-related handkerchiefs (

       ), and
       <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=pizza%20accessories">
        lots of other pizza-themed merchandise
       </a>
       . And there are maps with pizza (

       ,

       </a>
       ), some of which are on handkerchiefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow you think that someone describing a handkerchief as having "a map that seems pizza-related" is
       <em>
        so preposterous
       </em>
       that it must be code. And it must be code for child sexual abuse! Because ... well, because someone on 4chan
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RXZUHDD.png">
        made up the pizza code
       </a>
       five days before the election.

       If you have not read the wikileaks exchange, do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cleaning lady says she found a handkerchief at the house and asks the realtor if she knows whose it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The realtor sends an email to Podesta asking if he left behind a handkerchief and then says she thinks it might have a pizza related map on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok fine, but the original email said nothing about pizza or a map, kits a handkerchief only.
      </p>
      <p>
       The realtor added those details herself, and it is unclear why.  That alone is just weird, but if you combine it with all the other pizza themed code language and other creepy shit they are into, it is not hard to see there is something fucky going on.

       Actually, the realtor sends an email to the renter, Susan Sandler with two questions. Susan Sandler
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">
        forwards the email
       </a>
       to John Podesta (and his secretary) with the extra details. Presumably Susan Sandler picked up the phone and talked with the realtor. I haven't seen any "pizza themed code language".

       Pizzagate is attacking John Podesta, who helped start David Brock's
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America">
        Media Matters for America
       </a>
       and James Alefantis, David Brock's former boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Brock controls Media Matters, Correct the Record, ShareBlue, etc., so he has the ability to respond to these attacks using "shills"
       <em>
        whether the allegations are true or not
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, whether you believe the allegations or not, Podesta's emails were hacked, posted on wikileaks and combed over by hundreds of "weaponized autists"
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of his leadership position with the Clinton campaign and the Democratic party. Of course they are going to respond with whatever resources they can.

       I don't like podesta, but you have no right to his private conversation, nor should you demand that he explain the meaning of private conversation. I get that it was hacked and posted to WikiLeaks, but it should have never been and we shouldn't cheer it. This was private email account, not government. It would be like your emails being posted for the world to make crazy assumptions about. I'm sure you have said weird things and shared inside jokes. Let's all twist your private communication to accuse you of the worst thing imaginable.

       They don’t care about being blatant and make no attempt to hide it so they usually comment on their own posts and even reply to their own comments. Links them together easily. There’s more to it than just that of course. Spend a few minutes looking through yourself.

       Remember the homosexual handkerchief colour chart?

      <p>
       The white handkerchief at the bottom representing a preference for kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's actually a fraud.  The white handkerchief was added by whomever is pushing this agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wayback machine proves the chart never had a white handkerchief, let alone one representing a fondness for kids.

       Yeah, an email about a unique handkerchief someone lost could never be anything other than secret pedo code. That woman realized Podesta might want his cum rag mailed to him (obviously) and somehow knows this obscure code. Smoking gun.

       Why would you even need to answer questions about an unimportant email about accidentally leaving a personal item at a house? People would still say it's pedo code and all of their words are twisted into pedo code whether it's real or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can look at is what's most likely true and what's logical. If we took the assumption that the pizzagate interpretation is true, the scenario is extremely odd and makes little sense. Maybe you think it's weird to have art prints on your handkerchief, but I find that much less weird than the alternative situation and the idea that all these people have this unique pedo language.

       Pizzagate is the reason I started paying attention to conspiracies in general. I was like, "Holy shit. People are going to start talking about the hell I experienced firsthand."
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit seemed real when the sub got shut down, I thought. I was kind of heartbroken and scared but also hopeful, because to me the backlash the topic got seemed like almost an admission of guilt.

       Humanity has treated children like they aren't human forever. It seems like keeping this sort of thing a secret is a relatively new thing. Society would be pissed and discussed now if it got out. That's why everybody was fighting it and denying it. They know people won't take that shit now.

       I hope you feel awful about yourself for making that comment and that you think twice before treating people like that in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, what am I doing? I volunteer for my local Victims Advocacy. I dress victims for court and help them with their cases, explain court rules, act as a go-between with the clerks and make certain that victims are aware of and have access to any filings that will keep them and their children safe. I watch their children while they are in court or with their attorney. I spend hours of my week finding safe-houses for victims and building support networks for them so they don't end up going back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through this process, I've become personal friends with my local judges, sheriff, detectives, state attorneys, etc. And they are seeing the truth, finally.

      <p>
       What are you doing?

There's a TED talk video that has been theorized as the originator of the Pizza/Sex -language with paedos etc. and the guy in that video said how we should stop using Baseball terms to discuss sex and change it to Pizza related stuff. Homerun, third base, second base, touch down etc.

       It was banned for doxxing, which is something the mods were implicitly against and were actively enforcing against, though some sleeper mods/admins went behind their back and unhid many of the posts. Please get informed.

       You can pretty much take any public figure with social media accounts, find connections to the "elite", out-of-context creepy-sounding jokes by them or their associates, and make up pedo-related code words for things they've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, you can create this kind of "evidence" for anything if you already have an idea in mind. This is what pizzagate is.

       yeah they were rescuing them after the earthquake. you think they took these kids and disappeared them ? they stole little haitian babies and are killing them?
      </p>
      <p>
       im seeing theres 32000 orphans still there. why arent they taking them? seems like if theyre counted they are being documented. i even see that they have 1 or 2 parents that want them, but typically they cant care for them
      </p>
      <p>
       im not seeing an reliable sources about taking kids from haiti.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am seeing they raised 30m in funds for haiti but it seems like the people who spent the money did a poor job and had little oversight. thats a good conspiracy, but not quite pizzagate

       how many of those kids are out there? Stats say about 100 missing kids per year are actual kidnappings by strangers. how are they finding all of them? you make an accusation like this you shouldnt be so vague and casual about the details, or it seems like you just believe anything bad about people you dont agree with

       couple points here

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Tuam home closed in 1961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The discovery confirms decades of suspicions that the vast majority of children who died at the home were interred on the site in unmarked graves, a common practice at such Catholic-run facilities amid high child mortality rates in early 20th-century Ireland.
       </p>
       <p>
        she was given documents from the 1970s, including an official map of the present-day estate the council built on the site.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “They obviously didn’t see the importance,” said Corless. “There is an area across the map marked ‘burial ground’,” she says. “First, the houses were built, around that area. Finally a playground was built on part of the burial ground itself.”
      </p>
      <p>
       none of this supports your narrative
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the 800,000 number is the quickest thing debunked ever. You think there is 800,000 kidnappings every year? holy shit population crisis!
      </p>
      <p>
       No. 800,000ish kids are REPORTED MISSING. the vast vast vast majority are home within 24 hours. kid spent the night forgot to tell mom, divorced parents having a dispute, kid ran away for 4 hours
      </p>
      <p>
       literally the first link when you 'look into this'
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States -- that's roughly 2,000 per day. Of those, there are 115 child "stranger abduction" cases each year, which means the child was taken by an unknown person
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       human trafficking for prostitution does exist and is terrible. but its not close to satanic pizzagate. its an organized crime problem, ie, a real conspiracy motivated by greedy people. not satan worshiping democrats

        Nevertheless, the number of identified victims (or convicted traffickers) is far less than the official estimate (by the U.S. State Department) that as many 14,500–17,500 individuals are trafficked into the United States every year.[14] A recent analysis by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed a gap between the claimed number of victims and the number of confirmed cases of victimization.

       so i think we can gather that there arent good numbers on this

       and im not arguing whether or not human trafficking is a thing
      </p>
      <p>
       im arguing whether human trafficking has any relevance to the pizzagate theory. the fact that human trafficking is a thing is about the only thing true about theory so far

       trafficked for what purpose? all these mexican kids living with their mexican families? how many of them are trafficked in with no parents, no ties, and then are killed leaving no body and no evidence of pizzagate crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       these questions have to be answered, and many others, for me to lend pizzagate any credence, and the numbers dont exist. nobody is able to track it, according to your link

       dude lol. you wanna be oddly specific and argue against Pizzagate be my guest lol. well if you look into the definition of human trafficking 
there you go:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery, with illegal smuggling and trading of people, for forced labor or sexual exploitation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling.

       Buddy here's your original quote. Like you do fucking understand if you research human trafficking imported into America and not just kidnapping you'll get a higher statistic than 100 kidnapped children right? Not to fucking mention the undocumented ones.

       The Podesta stuff was fucking weird and by making it all about the Pizza Place the media was able to mockingbird it down an instant rabbit hole. The "crazed gunman" was a telegenic touch.

       Although there appears to be plenty of tacky, edgy queer smoke there still appears to be no investigation that has yielded chargeable criminal fire.

       If you take the view that these sources have all clearly "outed" themselves as being part of the problem rather than having any honest concerns about it, the huge size and scope of the problem itself and the degree to which it has been hidden and any serious investigation into it has been shut down and avoided just as much as possible is self-explanatory because the path of any honest search for truth about who's really behind and profiting from it would lead straight to their very own doorsteps.

       Oh I know that, pizzagate was here ages ago, I investigated it thoroughly at the time which is why it's hilarious that the best the pizzabots can do is post the same old stale images.

       Call it pedogate and it gets less ridiculous. Call it pedophilic blackmail entrapment and it gets very serious. Having seen the suggestive images and the downright perverted videos, those that dismiss the allegations against Alefantis and Podesta generally seem so enthusiastic in their denial that I question their piety.

       Laughing at rape jokes is deranged. It might be socially acceptable, but so is murdering stubborn people and imprisoning potheads and bombing foriegners.
      </p>
      <p>
       RTJ has it right:&gt; "The fellows at the top are likely rapists, but you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax, it's really not that complicated" Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explained. Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged

       If we accept the fact that a certain percentage of the population are active pedophiles and that not one person who qualifies as a member of the elite has ever been prosecuted then ergo there is a conspiracy. The absence of evidence is evidence.

       They do a good job of covering up for each other, but a lot of them also suspiciously die right before going to trail where they could possibly incriminate other people who are involved. It is a cover up that uses murder as a regular tactic.

       This thread shows me that it doesn't matter how many times different parts of pizzagate are debunked or explained. That's either buried or soon forgotten and every piece of it, no matter how crazy, remains as a part of the mythology.
