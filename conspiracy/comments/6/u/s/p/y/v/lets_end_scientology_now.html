       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been a longtime lurker here, never really posted before. I've commented a few times but it was pretty dumb. Anyway, enough about me, let's get into my proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientology. We've all heard of it, and we ALL know that something shady is going on there. Leah Reminis new show is shedding the light on this very fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that theyre holding people jostage, they're destroying lives, and spreading terror in communities that don't join them. And what is the government doing about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing. Theyre doing jack shit to solve this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientology has gone too far. People are born into this cult and brainwashed at a young age to hate non-scientologists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys want to make a difference in the world, if you guys want to actually help make America a better place, then let's do it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting Monday, let's call our representatives in Congress daily. Tell them they need to call for a congressional hearing into Scientology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been doing this for a couple weeks now, and nothing's happened. We can't make a difference alone, but we can together.
      </p>

       yeah I did read your post. Look, I can't defend scientology. Don't even want to actually. I just think there's more important shit to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you want to take on that cause, go for it. May as well add the Mormon church to your list as well. Some pretty messed up shit happens to kids there as well.

       I'm talking about the majority of religious people, are very hateful and use their region to justify their hatred towards others
      </p>

       also, how in anyway is that statement bigoted? i said ORGANIZED religion, individuals  can believe whatever they want, but all religious establishments should be abolished
      </p>
      <p>
       also, only retards are religious... how can you not see it's simply a form of indoctrination and brainwashing, you have nothing to gain by being religious, it's a dangerous addiction

       Where exactly does it state that in the Bible?  Sorry, you are talking out your woo-hah.  And, you also stated that someone going to spend eternity in hell is a FACT, which at the very least would be unknowable, so I don't see how a truly religious person would "take comfort" in that idea.  I also don't see why you would bring up an entirely different issue (relishing others damnation) which is irrelevant to whether organized religions should exist.  How would you even know the commenter's religion HAS a concept of hell?

       I don't know the Bible, I'm talking logically here. If you wish eternal damnation on another person, you're a shitty person regardless of faith. Religious people (christians in particular) seem to revel in the belief that other people are going to "burn in hell".

       I don't disagree.  Once, I was talking to two girls at a bar I KNEW were extremely liberal, which I had no problem with.  For one reason or another, we got into the topic of abortion, and I said, VERY jokingly, "well..lI'm not the one that's going to burn in hell".  To me, the notion of never-ending suffering seems silly.  I also found it humorous that they were aghast at me, because neither was religious or believed in hell anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree you shouldn't harbor negative resentment, but that alone doesn't make you a "hateful" person.  That's a VERY strong word, and makes it sound like someone is dripping with venom.  You can't expect every person to feel all sunshine and roses about every other person on the inside.

       Only because that person chooses to go to hell - give them what they want, and that is comforting.  They are usually God-haters, and from who I've spoken with, would rather spend an eternity in hell than to be near God, therefore, it is comforting that they receive their wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with hating someone, in this case (maybe in your example, but not in this case).  It is actually the opposite, loving them to see their wish fulfilled.

       What proof is there, besides non-scientologists alleging crimes? And, if they are alleging crimes, why are they not suing for restitution?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, until an actual court case or a suit is brought up, nothing is going to happen besides their name being tarnished. For example, look at Bill Cosby who most recently had to go through the public tarnishment of his name, and has suits against him. That makes sense for government to escalate the investigation, or to start taking things seriously. Until a case is brought up though, what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       do you think the government is going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientology in particular, has never had a good relationship with the IRS/FDA and other agencies so if they go based upon public opinion only, it's going to stink pretty badly since Scientology has already been raided before. Granted, they may be something wrong, if so, I'd much rather there be a big manhunt once there's blood in the water.

       There have been court cases. And it's not non-scientologists saying this, it's ex-scientologists. Again, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath goes into great detail about this.

       Calling Congress and demanding an inquest into a religion is not going to move any needless. Even if there were theoretically an avenue forward, no politician wants to run the risk of a First Amendment scandal--especially when there's not much public outcry. At least, not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       A much more effective approach would be to lobby specifically against Scientology's beneficial tax treatment. Their deal with the IRS is potentially much more vulnerable than anything Congress could easily touch, and given that Scientology seems to care more about its revenues than its members, potentially a much more effective target.

       Awesome mindset seemingly.  Has a lot of potential to destabilize a government though so I can see why I'm communist China they react extremely.  It's sad that they can't even think about what they want.

       We can never truly have religious freedom so long as the Powers That Be continue to fog and cloud our skies and thus our view of the great cosmos.  We do not have religious freedom on this planet.  So many truths are being withheld from us.

       You see, it isn't in the government's interest to crack down on cults.  Why?  Any system of intense control is useful to them.  Any system of control is exploitable by them.

       This is so silly...if you're on this page, undoubtedly you know about numerous things going on right now in the world, grand Injustices being perpetrated against humanity as a whole...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet somehow you want to infringe on the important tenant of religious freedom to stop such a relatively small, dare I say stupid, Injustice. Yes their practices are horrible, but even for a religion, look at the Vatican and pedophilia or how the Saudis and a few others are using 'Islamic law' to allow the rest of the world to condemn the entire religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like what you're suggesting is almost like saying we need to correct flat Earthers more than we need, say, 9/11 truth...it's just silly.

       Can we please agree that religions having words for "us" and "everyone else" (gentiles, kuffar etc) is tribal as fuck, and a clear sign that these various religious leaders understood some psychology and abused that knowledge to manipulate?
