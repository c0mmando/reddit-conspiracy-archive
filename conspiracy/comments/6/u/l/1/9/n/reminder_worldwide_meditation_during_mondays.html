         Meditation is a mental shutdown but for people who are new, you can also visualize a Utopia on Earth while being disconnected from the real world by closing the eyes in a comfortable position.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At the very least, a 2-3 minute meditation during the eclipse itself is necessary. The eclipse should run for about 2 hours. Longer periods are better for those who enjoy it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The eclipse should run between about 2-4 PM EST this coming Monday.

       Does anyone remember "Project Gotham Shield" (sounds like another word for an eclipse) What ever happened to that? And why wasent the media discussing this eclipse many months in advance if its a once and a lifetime experience? Perhaps something big will come on Monday that is manufactured. The start of the beginning.

       Sounds like a hokey new-age cult to me.  What Zen masters advocated meditation?  I can find several who speak out against such mind cults.  The Ancients couldn't help but tell you to sit down and think about it, but alas, no one could have predicted the sheer quantities of dullards.  Forgive me, I don't intend to hurt feelings, but these generally fun for all chain-mail initiatives, lack critical thinking. If we can't shoot down simple religious propaganda, how do you expect us to sort through literally thousands of fake news stories?

       I understand your sentiment, but what about meditation implies anything to do with religion? Meditation is tapping into your unconditioned state of being, so it's a literal aspect of existence. It is to step away from the conditioned, rather than conditioned one's self even further via something like the false guidelines of religion. I don't know what Zen masters advocated meditation, but they certainly advocated letting go. Meditation introduces one to the experiential sensation of letting go. It brings one closer to one's truest self. The difference between meditation and religion is that one is conceptual, and the other is a literal state of being. I feel that you already know this, so maybe I misinterpreted your concern.

       I understand you to ask how meditation and religion get linked.  In the context of this solicitation for a group mediation during a solar eclipse, it seems to me that OP wants to pray to the sky for peace in a group. You don't think meditation equates to prayer, and I hear you, but let's not get into that can of worms right now. I don't think Zen masters advocate letting go, but certainly one could consider it. I recognize a lot of your points about meditation, so we could call those regurgitated beliefs.  That sounds an awful lot like conditioning to me. I have a concern about mind pacification, that spreads into mass hypnosis. I think people would regret meditating during a rare chance to walk around during an eclipse. Plus, they shouldn't feel guilty for not taking advantage in a peace awareness exercise if they choose not to do so, should they?  You raise some good points, I hope I honored your intent.  Basically, it does make sense that people do less damage when they stop moving around so much, so you could make the case that these meditation groups make very cheap prisons for honest workers.  I don't intend to keep people who enjoy the cognitive calming effect of meditation from enjoying it, I intend to keep those people from spiritual advancement or psychological health claims, without providing some evidence.  How does that sound in response to your comment?
