        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the flooding in India. To the tides acting up in chile, and brazil. From the recent 6.6 east of brazil, to the volcanic eruption in Nicaragua...</p>

<p>Maybe add a 8.0-8.5 earthquake to nepal 9 day warning. As well as a potential 6.0 west of the puget sound basin...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uf9qw/potential_for_earthquakes_following_eclipse/">From my last post...</a></p>

<p><strong>The recent spaceweather update here:</strong>
<a href="http://www.solarham.net">M-class activity is being confirmed today</a> <em>as slightly expected</em></p>

<p>What I worry about is a light subduction slip on the juan de fuca. <strong>No</strong> &#39;not the big one&#39;- but a &#39;big one&#39; all the same. </p>

<p>Just stay safe if your near the coast within 72 hours of the eclipse. Just in case your planning a trip to the beach.</p>

<p>The tidal charts are haywire globally. (So just a heads up ya)...</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t my standard post and I am not trying to scare you or anything; It&#39;s simply just something I consider; Which in turn &quot;I think you all should consider&quot;...</p>

<p>Cheers and enjoy your weekend&#39;s. Get glasses for the eclipse, and remember these are just my thoughts. </p>

<p>Again, not to be confused by how my standard forecasting operates...</p>

<p>Just a bad feeling about it is all. So, please pardon my being human-</p>

<p><strong>Take care and special thanks to the users that reached out to me today!!! All my love reddit!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I go out of my way and place my reputation on these posts as they certainly affect my posting history, and credibility;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;I don&#39;t write these for popularity, nor to scare my fellow users&quot;...</em></p>

<p><strong>I&#39;ve never done so many large quakes in such a short timeframe.</strong></p>

<p><em>Something just seemed relevant between the mentioned factors and data. So please just consider this as a humble opinion piece...</em> <strong>nothing more, and nothing less</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update from comments 2 hours ago</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.5 - 8.5</strong> activity. <em>(Next 9 days)</em></p>

<p><strong>Areas to watch...</strong></p>

<p>Brazil (east coast again). 6.5+</p>

<p>New mexico 7.0+/-</p>

<p>Chile 7.0+/-</p>

<p>California 6.0+/-</p>

<p>Pugetsound 6.0 +/-</p>

<p>East coast japan 7.0+/-</p>

<p>Nepal 8.0+ </p>

<p>Turkey 7.0+/- </p>

<p><strong>Thats pretty much what I consider a bell ringer-</strong></p>

<p><strong>notes:</strong>
These are vicinity&#39;s not locations. </p>

<p><em>Other vicinity&#39;s to consider: Ecuador afganistan, Tonga and New Zealand.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Tl/dr</strong></p>

<p><em>I basically am projecting a seismic shitstorm between now and August 27th 2018.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update 1 hour ago</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2017-08-19-02-00-52-utc-6-4-538">6.4 outside tonga just now</a></p>

<p><strong>With inclusion to the reported 6.6 off the coast of brazil;</strong></p>

<p><strong>2 earthquakes have already taken place.</strong></p>

<p><em>Just sayin-</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries...</p>

<p>To me its more so the funneling of solar plasma via the combined gravitational forces of earth and moon enacting on the sun that&#39;s to trigger anything of cataclysm. </p>

<p>Not my usual posting algorithm. </p>

<p>More so a general consensus of the possible, and potentially probable... Not to say it with any sort of authority. Its basic speculation of the factors I consider to be worrisome. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its theoretical and I&#39;m attempting to create a computational poc. In <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a></p>

<p>These posts are primarily a poc. To stimulate the production value; Ive theorized a relevant way to prove my theory using australias array. </p>

<p>No ones made a bid or anything, and I&#39;m pretty poor at this time. So its sort of a work in progress?</p>

<p>Think in debt holding onto life by your fingernails poor. 
Thats me. Only worse...</p>

<p>I imagine it is capable, as my constant posts indicate a correlation between the context of solar to seismic response. My system may prove very beneficial to our species so I assumed its a more honorable, and lucrative career path to take then my relevant options jn employment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just describing the shadow of the moon moving across the landscape.  Imagine watching the earth from the sky while this massive shadow as wide as a state slowly creeps across the globe, and you realize there is a huge mass tugging on you from space.  </p>

<p>Imagine if everything was silent and the only thing you could hear was a Titanic rumbling from the forces of earth and moon pulling against each other.  What if you had a sense where you could hear gravity and feel the bass in your chest like you&#39;re at a concert  but there is only bass lower than you can hear.  It&#39;s all in your chest, in your lungs.  It disturbs your breathing and cripples your ability to speak.</p>

<p>If you could astrally project yourself out into space and find that point of gravitational balance perfectly situated between the earth and the moon.  In alignment with earth moon and sun while a deafening roar of waves pass through your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newton on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance#Newton">gravity and &quot;action at a distance&quot;</a></p>

<p>&quot;It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro&#39; a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers.[5]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matthew 24:</p>

<p>3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</p>

<p>4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 <strong><em>All these are the beginning of birth pains.</em></strong></p>

<p>9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</p>

<p>If the shaking persists over 4:30 conaecutive minutes. Move inland (to high ground). Wait for any emergency updates from emergency services. </p>

<p>Quakes in this duration (or longer) are capable of causing tsunamis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tthe entirety of the post is based on seismic activity based on past eclipses. This post links to my first post showing a correlation to past instances of seismic upticks following these instances. However this specific eclipse follows a vextor which hasn&#39;t reciprocated in 100 years. 
In terms of a difference. </p>

<p>Usgs considers there to be a 3x greater risk of heightened seismic activity during these instances as well. </p>

<p>Your area consists of most active earthquake zones. </p>

<p>The quake you&#39;re claiming as a hit in your &quot;Tonga&quot; claim was actually much closer to Fiji</p>

<p>There have also be 2.0 quakes in new Mexico and California... No 7+.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6.4 at Tonga was at a depth of 538.6km.</p>

<p>&quot;Earthquakes occur at depths from near the Earth&#39;s surface to about 700 km deep. (See Determining the Depth of an Earthquake.) Below that depth, rocks are too hot and ductile, so they tend to bend and flow rather than break in a brittle manner. The strength of shaking from an earthquake diminishes with increasing distance from the earthquake&#39;s source, so the strength of shaking at the surface from an earthquake that occurs at 500km deep is considerably less than if the same earthquake had occurred at 20 km depth. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarily outside of the statistical chance, but that determination would be more complex. There were 12 locations chosen, so the odds of getting a hit would involve summing the total of quakes in all 12 of the regions divided by a period of time, accounting for a large radius. For example, this quake hit Fiji, which isn&#39;t Tonga but still nearby. Fiji has had 8 earthquakes in the past 10 days, so getting an earthquake there in this timeframe would be expected. There have been 5 6.0 quakes in Fiji and Tonga, in the past year, so let&#39;s say 1 every 75 days. Picking a 9 day period from that gives about a 12% chance, or 1 out of 8, of being in a statistical guess for a mag 6.0+ quake in that window. You would then do that for each region to come up with a total chance of getting 1 quake right across 12 regions for a 9 day window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, my mistake for saying the &quot;statistical chance of picking Tonga&quot;. I meant to say something entirely different.  Perhaps the better way to phrase my last statement was, if OPs theory is correct this depth gives more credence to his theory. Yes, I understand that it&#39;s simply conjecture to argue off of unproved fact but in Bayesian theory it does add a little more confidence into OPs theory and not the selections of OP.</p>

<p>I also have some questions/things to add to your comment. I think your logic is sound for the most part but evaluating under a different context.</p>

<p>While I admit my knowledge of this subject is limited, I was under the impression that Fiji&#39;s earthquake was due to the Tonga plate shifting as all research i&#39;ve done shows that it is the only plate near Fiji. That would actually mean instead of checking for statistical quakes on land masses like Fiji you&#39;d be more so looking at activity of that plate I think; bringing up the amount of earthquakes occurring under a time-frame.</p>

<p>Furthermore I think it&#39;s incredibly hard to argue for the merit of OPs theory and therefore the selection of their locations when OP has not spoken on how he achieved his results. He has only stated that he used a complex model that is not written down and is manually calculated in their head. Any valuation of merit would simply be us projecting our own analysis and understanding of the subject.</p>

<p>Lastly, it really depends on what context you&#39;re analyzing the situation which means for us to value OPs prediction&#39;s merit we would need to know OPs model. In my opinion, judging the merit of OPs theory by the statistical chance of his selections hitting is wrong whether you are for something happening, apathetic, or don&#39;t think something is happening. You&#39;re trying to prove a negative which is much harder than proving a positive.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response :)</p>

Earths solar winds are currently holding speeds double its standard. <a href="http://solarham.net/regions/2671.htm">2671</a> is a beta gamma sunspot with a uniquely complex magnetic banding. Harboring Potential for an additional m or even x flare. 
The kp index is already off the charts. With 3 additional C-Class flares arrising off the sur lens; as is slowly makes its way towards, the active solar lens. </p>

<p>Seismic charts already appearing to show various dissettlement. So its a bumpy week as assessed.</p>

<p>Not looking too good in spite of my personal theories.

<p>As a service announcement, you can meditate from now through Monday here and there with a particular mass visual meditation at 11:11 am PDT (everyone at that moment globally taking into account their own timezone to sync up to 11:11 am PDT). </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth as a life long meditator, I will do my own program that day and that particular visual meditation (imagining the world you wish to see alongside visualizing pillars of light above and below you) at 2:11pm (EDT syncing up with 11am PDT).</p>

<p>Never forget you get to participate in this world in whatever way you choose, and I appreciate your seismic data and notices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesnt. Not in 99 years it hasn&#39;t. Yes in alternative regions and periods of tine I&#39;d agree. However the usgs themselves admit a 3x higher chance of seismic activity in these events. So the science like it or not is supooeted by various independant and professional experts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. Speeds reaching as high as 800km/s. </p>

<p>Thats 7.3-8.6 territory. </p>

<p><a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png</a></p>

<p>The top chart is the bz componet .  what I assess is happening within this data is the seperation of the magnetosphere magnetic field lines. These instances allow protons amd additional cosmic matters to reach our inner field &quot;the earths &#39;flux&#39; tubes&quot;. </p>

<p>As the absorption occurs, this causes electro magnetic induction, which essentially makes the speed of their interior increase. Those increases of speed cause earths sub level magma systems to become geo active. </p>

<p>Swollen pockets eventually cool off leaving cavities which collapse and this leads to the escalation of a P wave. </p>

<p>The P wave makes its way to the surface of the earth creating S waves as the energy os dispersed upon the surface. The process typically takes anywhere from 2 - 12 hours. Athough by my observation additional activity can prolong the process. </p>

<p>Eitherway. </p>

<p>I concur...</p>

Solar Activity Now Moderate
Solar activity is now officially at moderate levels. New region 2672, now turning into view off the east limb, produced an M1.1 flare at 01:52 UTC (Aug 20). Image below is courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additional flaring may be possible as the active region continues to rotate into Earth view.

<p>Yes. 
Look at top graphic. That is the bz componet. The expansion signifies material from the sun penetrating the magnetospheres magnetic field lines. During this process materials from plasma induct the earths inner field. The magnetic flux tubes. As these flux tubes absorb electrons (in theory). Their velocity increases, as these tubes convey within the planet. I theorize this process causes magma expansion via heat exchange. I feel this inducting upon the planetary core influences seismic activity. <em>I also feel we can extract past data sets which correlate to this function.</em></p>

<p>So whats going on is the bz is opening up now. Energy is being transfered and eventually a very sizeable quake will follow. By my estimation a 7.0+ and Near 8.0. </p>

<p><em>Its smaller then I assumed it would be originally</em>; yet will stimulate a large amount of seismic activity in a heightened intensity globally as it manifests. Likely more so in the 5.8- 6.9 intensity range. I expect most the locations to show correlation to this trend. Hence them being on warning. I hope to see an 80% or a more then identifiable relationship. As we typically do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had an m. Flare west limb. A c2. An m1 a c8 and a c4. All that traffics following the lunar pull. I was hoping to see a higher M flare. But it may take a couple days. This puts us at the lower ranges of the assessment. </p>

<p>Over the next 48 hours seismic activity will gain in intensity. Eventually a 7.0+ will take place. Mpst of the named zones will have 6.0&#39; intensity events over the next 5-7 days tops. Thats generally what our weeks going to look like. </p>

<p><em>That is, the normal annual variation in gravitational force during the course of a year is more than 10 times as much as the change due to the position of the moon during eclipses.</em></p>

<p>As I said, any events that happen within the time frame of the eclipse will be purely coincidental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its theoretical and I&#39;m attempting to create a computational poc. In <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a></p>

<p>These posts are primarily a poc. To stimulate the production value; Ive theorized a relevant way to prove my theory using australias array. </p>

<p>No ones made a bid or anything, and I&#39;m pretty poor at this time. So its sort of a work in progress?</p>

<p>Think in debt holding onto life by your fingernails poor. 
Thats me. Only worse...</p>

<p>I imagine it is capable, as my constant posts indicate a correlation between the context of solar to seismic response. My system may prove very beneficial to our species so I assumed its a more honorable, and lucrative career path to take then my relevant options jn employment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. Speeds reaching as high as 800km/s. </p>

<p>Thats 7.3-8.6 territory. </p>

<p><a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png</a></p>

<p>The top chart is the bz componet .  what I assess is happening within this data is the seperation of the magnetosphere magnetic field lines. These instances allow protons amd additional cosmic matters to reach our inner field &quot;the earths &#39;flux&#39; tubes&quot;. </p>

<p>As the absorption occurs, this causes electro magnetic induction, which essentially makes the speed of their interior increase. Those increases of speed cause earths sub level magma systems to become geo active. </p>

<p>Swollen pockets eventually cool off leaving cavities which collapse and this leads to the escalation of a P wave. </p>

<p>The P wave makes its way to the surface of the earth creating S waves as the energy os dispersed upon the surface. The process typically takes anywhere from 2 - 12 hours. Athough by my observation additional activity can prolong the process. </p>

<p>Eitherway. </p>

<p>I concur...</p>

<p>Not looking good at all...</p>

<p>August 20, 2017 @ 16:54 UTC
Solar Activity Now Moderate
Solar activity is now officially at moderate levels. New region 2672, now turning into view off the east limb, produced an M1.1 flare at 01:52 UTC (Aug 20). Image below is courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additional flaring may be possible as the active region continues to rotate into Earth view.

<p>The lines may be falsely closed now. However if they aren&#39;t, then the events I assessed should be taking place within 24 hours time...</p>

<p>The thread outlines the activity from start to finish. We are merely in the transition of events.</p>
