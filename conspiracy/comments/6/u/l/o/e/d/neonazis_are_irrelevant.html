       28 People have died due to gunshots in Chicago this MONTH. It is the 18th.. Neo-Nazi's are crazy and irrelevant yet this is the new story.. This is the narrative. The attempt to tie alt-right (far right?) to a crazy, minuscule, irrelevant subset of our population is a direct attempt to shift the balance of public opinion left.

       The Alt-Right is full of Nazis, white supremacists, fascists, and white nationalists so they are right in their claim that Nazis are tied to the Alt-Right. This recent push against them is a significant step in the right direction. People are uniting against racism, hate, and Nazis. Theres no conspiracy here.

       It's not illegal for me to discriminate against you. I can call you whatever the hell I want, deny you access to my private groups, and in business dealings. Sure, it's immoral, but not illegal. Are you an American?

       Yes, I'm an American, are you?  Because it is illegal to discriminate based on race,sex, religion, etc. when it comes to business dealings or how the government treats you.

       You do not get a choice. That is called life. Even if they have ways to vet people for racism, people can just lie. Once again, that is life. If you're looking for a Utopia here on Earth, you'll never find it. You might as well just go live out in seclusion.

       You never told me you were an American living in America. You said you were polish with distant Russian releavtives.

       And yes it is illegal. I know this from personal experiences because I used to work in the real estate world and had to deal with law suits.

       And no one is taking about some racism detector or vetting. It's about preventing racial discrimination from happening in the first place by first acknowledging that everyone is a bit racist in some shape or form, and then learn how to reduce racism and discrimination against others as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I heard an interview with a black police officer who thought racism and discrimination against black people from police was almost non existent. Until he learned that after some reflection, he realized that even though he's black, he treats black suspects much worse than white suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called implicit racial bias, and it's something that we can do to reduce its effect on others.

       That's because statistically Blacks commit more crime. He's a smart man, for realizing that, even though he himself is Black. Hard pill to swallow.

       Yes. They are irrelevant, or they were, until certain groups chose to build them into a bogeyman and whip the country into an outrage panicked frenzy with the full cooperation of the msm and political hacks .
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? To get the public to embrace an idea that they would otherwise reject flatly: the loss of freedom of speech, specifically on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not something that could be forced on Americans, the trick was to make them beg for it in a morally indignant outrage, and 'nazis' were the perfect trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazis are irrelevant. Freedom of speech is very relevant. And you are losing that freedom right now.

       A lot of Americans died fighting Nazis during the 40's. Now, in 2017, we had a group of people shouting their slogans, saying "heil Trump" and other nonsense, running around with torches like the KKK and running over a crowd of people.
