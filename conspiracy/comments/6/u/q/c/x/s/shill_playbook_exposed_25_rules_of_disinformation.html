        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reason people like Soros or Clinton hire shills and send them to all the social media outlets is because they are trying to suppress the truth or sway opinion. The reason they are trying to suppress the truth is because if the people found out the truth about many of our rulers, those rulers would be forever buried like Hillary Clinton was when we all found out that she was a seriously evil, selfish monster. </p>

<p>Most of the shills don&#39;t really believe in what they are saying nor do they really care but what they do care about is their $15-$25 per hour job. It&#39;s a tough economy and they need the money. They don&#39;t want to lose their jobs so they hold the con the entire time even though they know its all bullshit. </p>

<p>Note: I am posting a tldr at the bottom of each of the 25 rules of disinformation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don’t discuss it — especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it’s not reported, it didn’t happen, and you never have to deal with the issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Keep your mouth shut. Loose lips sink ships. Don&#39;t let the people find out what we are doing to them or else they will march on us and remove us from power. </p>

<ol>
<li>Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the “How dare you!” gambit.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; As soon as the truth surfaces, become annoyed and give them your &quot;How dare you!&quot; face. How dare you speak against &quot;American Hero&quot; John McCain. How dare you speak against Zionism? Whatever it is, avoid talking about the truth and attack the truth teller. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such “arguable rumors”. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a “wild rumor” which can have no basis in fact.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Quickly dismiss all facts that are harmful to the deep state &quot;rumors&quot;. </p>

<ol>
<li>Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; You can&#39;t find truth head on. You have to find some weaker element of the arguement and attack that. For example, if someone says, &quot;Soros funded Antifa on the rainy day of August 12.&quot; It was raining on August 12 so they will attack the truth agent for &quot;lying&quot; about the weather and avoid talking about the real truth of Soros funding Antifa. Note: The Truth telller may have innocently mistaken the weather patterns but the shills will attack him for it claiming he intentionally tried to mislead the public. The idea is to sway the readers from the Soros/Antifa connection onto the weather. </p>

<ol>
<li>Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Shills basically attack the truth teller in hopes that it will deter the public in supporting that person lest they be called names as well. This is a classic bullying tactic. </p>

<ol>
<li>Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism reasoning — simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent’s viewpoint.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; This means that shills occasionally make wild accusations against truth tellers but when the truth teller confronts them, they simply don&#39;t reply because they don&#39;t have an argument to back up their claims. </p>

<ol>
<li>Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could so taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.</li>
</ol>

<p>tlrd; Shills gaslight and manipulate the truth teller to get off the topic of the truth. (Anything to NOT talk about the truth I guess since the truth decimates the deep state and their shills). </p>

<ol>
<li>Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough “jargon” and “minutiae” to illustrate you are “one who knows”, and simply say it isn’t so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Shills will simply pretend to be people who they are not to win the argument. They will say, &quot;I know because I am a scientist!&quot;. &quot;I know because I studied political science!&quot; &quot;I know because I live there, I worked there, I taught there, ect...&quot; It&#39;s all a bunch of bullshit though. They will say anything to win an argument and cover for the deep state. </p>

<ol>
<li>Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues with denial they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Shills are taught to ignore any evidence no matter how good the evidence is. If we show them a video of Soros eating a baby, they will call it fake. If we show them Soros himself in the Antifa crowds, they will say he just happened to be walking by on that same street (pure coincidence). They will say anything to cover for the deep state no matter how stupid it sounds. </p>

<ol>
<li>Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with. Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually them be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues — so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Shills will call anything outside of breaking news &quot;old news&quot; as if we are supposed to forgive and forget the older crimes against humanity (ie Clinton Foundation). </p>

<ol>
<li>Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the “high road” and “confess” with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made — but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, “just isn’t so.” Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later. Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for “coming clean” and “owning up” to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tlrd; When caught red handed, shills have no other excuse but to admit that they may have been wrong although they know they were wrong from the very beginning because they are paid shills trying to spread misinformation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to loose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: Basically shills will say the matter is to complex to solve (there isn&#39;t enough smoking gun evidence, too many moving parts, ect..). Basically they want us to give up on the investigation claiming we will never get anywhere with it anyway. </p>

<ol>
<li>Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards with an apparent deductive logic in a way that forbears any actual material fact.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; This is nothing but a gaslighting manipulation technique designed to confuse the mind. </p>

<ol>
<li>Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best for items qualifying for rule 10.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; The shills will ask for all the details of in investigation upfront although they know investigations are ongoing. When the investigation is finally solved, they will call it &quot;old news&quot;. </p>

<ol>
<li>Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place.</li>
</ol>

<p>tlrd: The shills will change a few facts from the investigation to change the final conclusion. The idea is to defend the deep state at all costs because the deep state is paying them money. </p>

<ol>
<li>Vanishing evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won’t have to address the issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: Basically the shills may have some evidence that will help our cause but they won&#39;t bring it up unless the truth teller does. </p>

<ol>
<li>Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can “argue” with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; Clinton did this well. When topics such as her Wall Street paid speeches were brought up, she derailed the whole topic and spoke about something else altogether especially something that will cause an argument. Manipulation at its finest. The truth doesn&#39;t work for the deep state and so they need to use non-stop, exhausting mental acrobatics to survive.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: The shills are instructed to bully the truth teller rather than discuss the truth and once the truth teller becomes defensive, they can attack the truth-tellers character as being too sensitive. Just more mental acrobatics which luckily exhaust the shills. </p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the “play dumb” rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon). In order to completely avoid discussing issues may require you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: This instructs the shills to deny any and all evidence as being garbage even if its smoking gun truth. Instead, they are instructed to ask for proof that doesn&#39;t exist. This way, the truth teller won&#39;t be able to come up with the proof and the shill can claim they won the argument. Even if we show them a video of Soros eating a baby, they will claim its a fake. Nothing will ever please the shill. </p>

<ol>
<li>False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: Basically, the shills often use false evidence to win an argument. </p>

<ol>
<li>Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed an unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict (usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim) is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr; This has more to do with court cases and hiding the truth from the jury.</p>

<ol>
<li>Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: Call some old man off the street and claim him to be an authority figure on the discussion topic. Pay that old man to say some lies and confuse the public into thinking that old man was an authority figure (IE scientist) but in reality, it was just a big manipulative lie. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: When all else fails, create false flags to distract the public from the truth. </p>

<ol>
<li>Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by proper intimidation with blackmail or other threats.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: High level shills at the level of Soros are willing to kill, arrest, blackmail, ect.. giant truth tellers in the public to silence the truth.</p>

<ol>
<li>Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen.</li>
</ol>

<p>tldr: When all else fails, the shills are instructed to disappear from society to protect themselves. </p>

<p>This shill playbook needs a truth teller playbook to counter it:</p>

<p>Truth Teller Playbook:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Always speak the truth in as much detail as possible and let the chips fall where they may. 90% of the time, the truth teller will come out victorious because the truth destroys shill arguments. </p></li>
<li><p>Never get mad at the shill. They feed off anger. No matter what they say, don&#39;t get mad or take it personally. They have nothing personal against you. They are only doing a job and trying to keep their job and their money. The thing is one of the main jobs of the shill is to enrage the truth tellers. When they fail at this, they get enraged and frustrated themselves which renders them exhaustion. Tired shills can&#39;t pull as many mental acrobatics.  </p></li>
<li><p>When in the middle of an argument and you notice the shill exposed themselves for being a shill in the very last comment, end the conversation so that the reads will see that final comment and realize the shill was a shill all along. </p></li>
<li><p>We often pretend to be talking to a real person when we speak to shills. That is OK, but don&#39;t be afraid to drop some hints that you know the shill is a shill. The shill will catch the hint and know what you are talking about but if the shill asks you if you are accusing them of shillery, don&#39;t respond. Let the conversation end and the readership will know that this person was a shill all along. </p></li>
<li><p>When suspecting shillery, the first thing to do is to look at the account age. Most shills have new accounts that were mustered up just for a short term shill project that may last a few weeks to a few months. </p></li>
<li><p>Anytime a shill responds to you, respond back with an answer plus a &quot;redpill&quot; for the public. For example, a shill may ask for proof that Soros funds Antifa. Respond to that question and add, &quot;He also funds Black Lives Matter btw.&quot; This way, the shill will be afraid to speak to you because every time they ask a question, you answer but you further redpill the public which is a very bad thing for shills. The truth destroys shills and if one is responding with more and more and more truth, the shills become enraged and confused. They are unable to communicate and if they can&#39;t communicate, they can&#39;t spread disinformation. </p></li>
<li><p>The shills are always exhausted because they are constantly trying to play some heavy duty mental acrobatics using techniques such as manipulation, lies, deralement, ect... The truth tellers are always fresh and energetic because it literally takes no effort to tell the truth. When the shills run their exhausting games, constantly respond with the truth regardless of what they say (ie: Show me smoking gun proof!) We all know what the truth is here and speaking it decimates the shill argument. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s OK to be mistaken occasionally. That happens and is natural but when mistaken, admit that you were wrong without shame. </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t argue on every matter with a shill. When a shill is right, they are right. It is OK to agree with a shill when they are right about something. </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t let the shill take you on a wile goose chase. Sometimes, the shill will ask you to explain this and that endlessly in an attempt to waste your time. If you suspect the shill has you on a wild goose chase to run research projects for him or constantly bugs you for more evidence, just confront him with the truth which is that you don&#39;t have time to run around posting together research papers for the shill and recommend that they do their own research. </p></li>
<li><p>The most important thing is to tell the shill what you believe to be true. If you believe the Clinton Foundation is dirty without smoking gun proof, then so be it. Don&#39;t pretend to have any other opinion just because a shill produces false evidence against it or when they claim you don&#39;t have proof. If they call you a liar, just tell them that you are not lying and this is in fact what you personally believe. You could be wrong but that is what you believe with all the current, existing evidence. Nobody can argue with you or try to twist your arm to stop believing your own truth. You wouldn&#39;t be saying what you were saying unless you believed it. You can even admit &quot;I could be wrong and you can be right&quot; to the shill but the shills arguments are so weak and pathetic that woke people don&#39;t really fall for it. </p></li>
<li><p>Be calm and natural. There is no need to exhaust yourself with mental acrobatics. The easiest thing to do is to tell what you believe to be the truth. It takes no energy at all. </p></li>
<li><p>If you ever change your belief, then admit that you changed your belief. (ie Maybe you didn&#39;t trust Trump before, but now you do or vice versa). Our belief system changes as new evidence is poured into our minds on a day by day basis so there is no shame in admitting this. </p></li>
<li><p>Try your best to upvote any post or comment you find valuable. The shills are not only using downvote bots to supress the truth but they are also downvoting manually. Actually, if you look at the downvoted posts or downvoted comments, you can see what the shills don&#39;t want you to know. </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to unmask the shill. When a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing is unmasked, everyone can see the wolf and nobody likes a wolf. Unmasking the wolf for being the wolf will help others identify them and protect themselves from them by keeping their distance. An abusive wolf needs to trick the goy into thinking he is a sheep in order to abuse them but once the goy realize the wolf is actually a wolf, that wolf loses all of his power. Don&#39;t outright call them a shill but don&#39;t be afraid to confront them on their mental acrobatic techniques. </p></li>
<li><p>Bonus: As the old saying goes &quot;Evil wins when good does nothing.&quot; It takes very little effort to expose truth when one sees shillery. When everyone puts in a little bit of work, we move mountains.</p></li>
</ol>
