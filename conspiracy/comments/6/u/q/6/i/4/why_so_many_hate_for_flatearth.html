       I became interested in FE when I tried to debunk it. With all my might.  The movement has grown considerably I  the past decade.

      <p>
       Look into Flat Earth Asshole on youtube,  the *FEA vs... " series particularly do a good job exposing the weak arguments of ball believers. 
Jeranism and The Morgile are 2 other recommended sources.  Avoid anything by the Flat Earth Society,  they are just clowns that cloud up the debate. 
Out of curiosity,  what are the flaws in FE you are referring to?

       The two phenomena ice never seen properly explained by FE are gravity and why the constellations are a different hemisphere in Australia than in America. If you have any videos by FEA or another source that answer these problems with the theory, please post them.

       Flat Earth Society is controlled opposition, not serious Flat Earth theorists. If you go through thousands of hours of YouTube Flat Earth videos, you won't find anyone who genuinely thinks "gravity" is because Earth is flying up at 9 meters per second. It's just as crazy as saying Earth is flying 2 million miles per hour into vacuum (the common mainstream science theory taught in schools).

       You have built in sensors, which are extremely sensitive and accurate: your body knows when it is tilting, moving, right-side up or upside down, or staying still. You can go outside and look up at the sky and see that you and everything around you are stationary. You know that you are not moving 2 million miles per hour because you have no real reason to believe it. You only doubt your own senses because you are instructed to. "Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?" they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 million miles per hour and yet the night sky never changes, with stars in such predictable pattern that people have played the same connect-the-dots game for thousands of years, with most of the drawings still used today because the stars have
       <em>
        never moved.
       </em>
       But we do, 2 million miles per hour. When common sense comes up, such as human sensations of movement and clear lack thereof, the perpetrators of this heliocentric model must move the stars impossibly far and impossibly large to make up for the fact that there is no observable parallax. Even though we must
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       tilt toward Polaris in our orbit around the Sun, the arc of the Sun through the sky does not change from low in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere in one month and high in the sky 6 months later as you should see once the Earth is around to the other side of the sky.

       How is their theory crazy? There is nothing sane about it.

       You know what you have been told is not sane. Study the history of astronomy. The size of celestial bodies and their distances were much smaller until saner minds started asking questions. They were increased in size and distance to "correct" the obvious problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw there is nothing special about Polaris, other than it being the current North Star. The stars could still have shifted over a flat Earth. Their relative unchanging positions suggest that Earth is not moving 2 million miles per hour. See also scientific experiments proving lack of motion, back before governments put a stranglehood on science, such as Sagnac, Michelson/Morley, and Airey's Failure.

       You made the claim that "stars never move" which I debunked. And it makes sense to me that objects light years away wouldn't move very much in the short time that humans have been able to record them.

       It does but the distances involved are so large it doesnt appear like much. It would be like hiking 2 miles to a mountain in the distance, taking a step forward and proclaiming you arent moving because the mountain appears the same.

       Hey friend. Seriously,  those are the exact questions I was asking incredulously 5 years ago.  I can assure you,  I am a sane, well read educated 50 year old dude and there are today hundreds of thousands of people that disbelieve the proposed model.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not have time to debunk all the points you enumerated,  but can assure you they all have been solidly debunked, many many many times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       For pure entertainment, go on YouTube and watch all the "Flat earth asshole vs..." that you can find.

       Jeranism,  and The Morgue are not as funny,  maybe more technical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 3 are my preferred sources. They are honest and very smart dudes that are not afraid of debating anyone on this topic.  Look at their subscriber numbers,  they have gained  lots of traction over the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will come to realize soon  enough (if you invest some time on the subject)  that there is literally no proof apart from those fake nasa pictures that earth is a ball.

       I looked, there's nothing disproving GPS other than some easily-disproveable claims that it's land based (which makes no sense at all -- it would be easy to detect that the GPS positioning message was never changing).

       How did you come to believe we are on a flat earth? How do you think gravity works? Do you think that every satellite since Sputnik was a lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever looked for the international space station? There's an app to tell you when it's overhead. You can see it with the naked eye, and it follows
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the trajectory predicted by orbital physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth isn't curved, why do pilots fly in great circles? Wouldn't every pilot have to be in on the conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain the moon's phases?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to attack you. I am legitimately curious how you explain all of these things, because a round Earth is the most obvious and simple way to explain all of these things, plus it fits with our understanding of gravity as a whole (which has been proven, since we can predict the positions of planets). And it doesn't require a massive conspiracy of literally every major government in the world, and every U-2 pilot, and astronaut, and GPS engineer. I honestly just don't understand how someone believes these things.

       I understand your position.  I used to hold those exact same beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch "The Morgile" and "Jeranism" clips.  They answer all your points,  and then some. I recommend you look into some of their earlier clips,  too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, gravity is a theory and is not proven.  No one knows what gravity is. We can measure it and that is about it. Newton,  sure,  was a genius,  in the same sense Shakespeare is a genius. His equations merely describes gravity,  what cause the force or even where it comes from,  no one knows.

       The earth being a spinning ball is

       I believe in pancakes.  Want to hear me go on and on about pancakes for a couple of years?  Because I love them.  You don't love them?  Well, that's your loss and you are oh so wrong.  How could you not also love pancakes?  My favorite are blueberry.  Anyone else who doesn't agree with me is an idiot.  Blueberry (with real blueberries) is the best of all.  I also like when their is a sourdough taste to the pancakes.  Want to hear about making a culture so you can have sourdough of your own?  It's a little bit nasty, but everyone should do it.  Pancakes are the best, and that is all there is to it.

       I didn't see how he measured ocean curvature at all other than stating that a water drop curves. Lasers are inaccurate because the beams of light begin to spread at the distances needed to measure curvature, and there are videos showing results of flat water or even concave. The Bedford Level experiment and others like have shown there is no curvature (I'm aware of their damage control experiment later, but their motives show an agenda, and agendas show bias and any result unreliable).

       Please show me the slightest bit of evidence for flat earth and I'll consider it. Otherwise everything I've ever learn and seen points to the fact that the earth is a spherical rock floating in space. Amateurs can no go buy the equipment needed to float a go pro up high enough to easily see the curvature of the earth

       Although I have come to believe that we live on a flat plane, I've discovered major weaknesses/flaws in the 'Dome Flat Earth' model. Perhaps it is meant as a divide and conquer strategy between two obviously wrong models (globe vs dome)?

       Hey friend. Seriously,  those are the exact questions I was asking incredulously 5 years ago.  I can assure you,  I am a sane, well read educated 50 year old dude and there are today hundreds of thousands of people that disbelieve the proposed model.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not have time to debunk all the points you enumerated,  but can assure you they all have been solidly debunked, many many many times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       For pure entertainment, go on YouTube and watch all the "Flat earth asshole vs..." that you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeranism,  and The Morgue are not as funny,  maybe more technical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 3 are my preferred sources. They are honest and very smart dudes that are not afraid of debating anyone on this topic.  Look at their subscriber numbers,  they have gained  lots of traction over the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will come to realize soon  enough (if you invest some time on the subject)  that there is literally no proof apart from those fake nasa pictures that earth is a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
