       Liberals in the media and all over twitter are calling the Boston Free Speech Rally a White Supremacist Rally. Protesters are literally shouting "Nazi" at the people in the free speech rally.  So I guess every rally with conservatives is now going to be called a "white supremacist rally"?

       They literally hate freedom of speech and want to be authoritarian dictators.  If they don't like the constitution they are free to leave the country.  But, if they did, it would be to another predominantly white country.  They are the true, hypocritical, racists who project themselves upon others.

       The freedom of speech rally was a thinly veiled white supremacists rally. 3 of the 6 scheduled speakers were linked to white supremacists. White supremacists have an agenda based on revoking the rights of others.

       See right there? That's called talking out of your ass. Let me explain
      </p>
      <p>
       Black leader gives speech about right.. it's called civil rights protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       White guy gives a speech about right.. it's called white domination
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead though.. this is how 1776 happened. Large group oppressing smaller group through means of being marginalized

       Dude I live in Boston. This was supposed to be a free speech rally, nothing more and nothing less. There was another one a few months ago that I attended, Im not a white supremacist and there were no other white supremacists there. In fact a black marine gave an awesome speech at the end of that march, guess he was a white supremacist too...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since that lunatic ran over people in Virginia, this event has been targeted by the media and the alt-left, labeling it to be something that it wasnt supposed to be and attacking the people who wanted to attend. Stop spreading your pathetic, lazy disinfo.

       Yes, there is a Capitalist problem. That doesn't mean that I think that Marxist Socialism is the answer. I'm no economist. But neither of those systems work, and both sides who believe in those systems think that whenever it's NOT working, that "that wasn't really marxism", or "that wasn't really capitalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching a Molyneux vid today that made we want to reach and slap him through the screen. Listening to to An-Capitalists wax philosophical might be as painful as listening to the Communists.

      <p>
       Economic Centrism is the only way to do right by both the nation as a whole, and for each individual. Socialism is good for individuals and bad for the larger nation, whereas capitalism gives an inanimate national institution all the fuel it needs to keep moving, but is bad for individual people working people. Both sides are wrong, and taking either one to it's logical extreme will hurt the Nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only political ideology that ever found the right middle ground between these two poles was NatSoc. It's too bad that there is so much other baggage involved there, because purely as an economic system, nothing has ever been more effective. It made such headway in 6 years, that Britain and France were forced to bring total war on them for economic and geopolitical reasons, they feared that Germany would become something that they could not control, something more powerful economically than they were.

       People need to realize that NONE of these social/political/economic ideologies will work in any given nation unless a large majority of its citizens buy into it.

       At the rate we're going with all this civil unrest, the US will never achieve this level of confidence.

       Nothing about nationalism requires being a racist. It's easier, dare I say, to promote social cohesion along visible/genetic lines but it definitely isn't a required tenet.

       People conflate identity politics/stereotypes with actual policy.
If I were to post red pills in T_D,
would I get downvoted to oblivion?
Alt right and clinton fans are both brainwashed
in different ways. I've tried to wake people up:

       Yeah, they also pushed the "sexist bernie bros" meme too.
Bernie and alt right people could have united since they both want jobs, some agree with universal health care, anti-globalism, anti-clinton, etc.

       I'm afraid the bigger fight is getting people to realize the two party system can't be trusted (the partisan tradition is hard to kill it seems). 
At best, Trump is doing 4D chess stuff and the establishment isn't making it easy. At worst, everyone got played. I think it's virtually impossible to reform the two party system, it's too far gone to the deep state, military industrial complex, etc.

       It seems like this is just miscommunication.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a glance it looks like the 'free speech' rally originally had invited some alt-right speakers, but they dropped out for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's unlikely that a group of 40,000 suddenly decided to go out today and march in direct response to this tiny rally. (I might be wrong - how far in advance was this planned?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more likely that the anti-nazi rally is in response to the events in Charlottesville from last week, and if people were incorrectly yelling 'nazi' at non-nazi conservatives, then it's more likely that they thought the group was associated with the Unite the Right folks and didn't understand they were simply conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the other bit is that white supremacists have tried to enjoin themselves with republicans, and the leader of that party isn't interested in denouncing them or distancing himself from them, so yes that does make the distinction between "pro trump" or "conservative" and "white supremacist" blurry.

       No, what I said was that if the free speech folks today weren't nazis but they are being called out as such then people probably thought they were associated with the Unite the Right group. Not unreasonable since the nazis were out in force last weekend, so it's at the forefront of everyone's mind to want to protest what went down.

       Trump has had a history of strong hesitation when he's asked to denounce white supremacists, and when he did it on Monday he read from a pre-written script sounding like a hostage. Pretty easy to tell he wasn't being honest with himself, and no white supremacists actually interpreted it as a denouncement, which is the important part.

       Denouncing from a script someone wrote for you isn't denouncing when it directly contradicts the off-script statements and emotions you sandwich it with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a statement that comes an hour after he criticized the protesters might have been scripted by the comms department of the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unclear how often Trump personally types tweets onto his phone and sends them out, it's also pretty reasonable to think that even his personal twitter account is shared amongst people, if you look at the device tags on his tweets, there are several.
      </p>

       It's birddogged. If you think that these protests are grassroots, then you are still slightly behind. These aren't just angry people naturally going out to protest, these people are going where they were told to be. Antifa is directly controlled by the same forces that control the MSM and Establishment parties all throughout the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state knows that they can't crackdown on free speech while retaining credibility, so they have indoctrinated these Leftists to crack down on it for them, and then they can call the Leftist "protests" 'free speech'. It is managed, not organic.

       I can't speak for this one in particular but all of the notable ones that I've seen this year (women's march, march for science, several smaller kneejerk protests) have all been visible to me via friends sharing the Facebook invite to the event, and we are all "just angry people" that decided to go out and organize that just needed to know when and where to be. There was certainly an administrative group doing advertising, coordination, getting permits, and all of that, but the quantity of people comes from normal people that want to be heard.

       Free speech goes both ways. The counter protesters have every right to exercise their freedom of speech just like the white nationalists do. If the message of love is louder then that of bigotry and racism, then this is free speech in action.

       But I think the problem here is ... Misappropriation of nomenclature. This relatively.minoscule rally for free speech was labeled a Nazi group by the media..so now 10k ppl think they are going to a Nazi rally to drown it out.. but that's not what it ever was.

       That's the problem, they aren't there preaching "love". There there preaching hate for the hateful, it's so hypocritical. There's no conflict resolution taking place at these counter-protests. Just a bunch of fear mongering and virtue signaling.

       That being said, both groups should indeed maintain their right to be there, and say whatever they please, just so long as no laws are being broken.

       Hate towards the hateful? How is the "Nazi" (read: White Conservatives) side hateful? They don't want to colonized by foreign peoples and foreign cultures. Were the Native Americans who fought back against the White invaders Hateful Racist Nazis? Were the African people who fought back against White colonial settlers Hateful Racist Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       NO. They weren't. What is hateful is aggressively stealing someone else's land and culture. They are coming to North America and Europe and colonizing our land, our culture, and our politics right out from under us, and we are STILL RIGHT HERE. Resisting is moral and right to do, there is nothing hateful about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone invades your house and your force them out, would you listen to their argument that you were just "Hateful" towards them and that's why you didn't want to let them into your house? That you're "burglarist"? Wanting our country to remain our country, and to not have it stolen from us by foreigners who hate us, and hate our culture and our history is now Hateful?

       If one side's free speech prevents the other side's right to their free speech, their expression, then that is not free speech. That is action. Your rights end where my rights begin. Leftists saying that their protest is free speech, while using that protest to shut down other citizens' free speech is an oxymoron. That's not how that works.

       They have not. Google has a TOS that you agree to when you use their service. They can do whatever they want with their search results. That doesn't infringe on any of you rights. Antifa protesting doesn't infringe on your rights either. I'm sorry you don't understand how the Constitution works, but that doesn't change anything.

       I completely understand how the Constitution works. It limits what government can do to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I see on here so often is people raising hell because a private company censored its users somehow (YouTube, specifically). It's the company's right to do business as they please. It's your right to take your business elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're a baker in Oregon who doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, you're actually charged with a crime of infringing on someone's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       If infringement on rights is purely the government's domain, then people can't sue or call the cops when it's merely a private person or company doing it, right? Or are you saying that it only applies to free speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, a private person can infringe on my right to life by murder or my right to property by theft, but they will also be punished for it. Can someone not be punished for preventing me from speaking?

       Sure, if they murder you to do it. That's never the case though. If an organization decides they decide that your image is toxic and they don't want it associated with their brand, and you still make them accommodate that person, then
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       rights are being infringed upon.

       They were charged for breaking the law(not to discriminate based on sexual orientation), not for infringing on rights. They agreed to follow the law when they opened their bakery and then broke the law. They are free to move to a state that does not protect sexual orientation if they desire.

       The pass was not in place when they opened their business, so no, they did not agree to it when they opened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the law (actually, a city ordinance) was put in place to protect the rights of consumers. Therefore, the city saw individuals and private businesses as potential violates of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       In their case though, they denied one item of their services based on their personal beliefs; they didn't deny general services to the couple. Nor did they prevent says couple from shopping elsewhere, which is still their right.

       My apologies on that oversight. It does not, however, matter that they opened their business first. Businesses must comply with laws passed after they've opened. It doesn't matter if it is a law banning certain chemicals or a nondiscrimination ordinance.
       <br/>
       You can argue it however you want, but the reality is that they broke the law and were punished accordingly.

       Nope. Free speech is the right to voice your opinion or protest without government censorship. No government censored anyone today.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your free speech is so offensive to people that literally thousands of people will march to let you know they don't want to hear it? Well, that's your problem.

       That's actually not what free speech means, although that is a very common canard that people use, so I don't blame you for thinking so. There is a constitutional expectation for something called "functional free speech". The constitution guarantees not just your right to say what you want without a police state dragging you away, but the right to say what you want, and to have the opportunity to be heard. The Constitution is not just a legal document, but an American philosophy, it is as much up to each citizen to respect each other's rights, as it is up to the state to enact them by force.

       If the purpose of the larger message was to prevent the original message from being able to be heard, then those people are infringing on the first group's Free Speech rights. One person's rights end where another person's rights begin. Using your speech to make sure that someone else is unable to use theirs isn't free speech, that is purposefully trying to prevent someone from being able to use their constitutionally guaranteed right to Free Speech.

       Would you say the same thing if this were happening in reverse? What if there were 100 Leftist anti-racist protestors, and 15,000 Nazis encircled them, preventing them from sharing their message that they came to share. Would you be defending it, or would everyone be talking about "silenced voices", and bullies who want to shut down legitimate discussion? I think we all know what people would be saying if this was reversed.

       See, right there, I'll call you on your liberal nonsense. No shit opposing Nazis is not far left. Both sides agree with that. The only ones who don't are Nazis, and that's a very small portion of those on the right. But the left likes to try and make anyone on the right out to be a Nazi. And calling that out doesn't make me a "right winger" or a white supremacist.

       no, just the actual nazis, the ones that support them, and the the ones who refuse to denounce them. If someone sits by and quietly agrees with the nazis then that makes them a little bit of a nazi. You don't have to wave a nazi flag or sieg heil salute in the middle of the street  to be a nazi sympathizer.

       Agreeing with the Nazi's right to free speech in no way makes someone a Nazi sympathizer. Very few people actually support them, however, you and the rest of your "team" keep loosening the qualifications for what makes someone a Nazi or a Nazi sympathizer. It's such a pathetic and dangerous tactic to limit the scope of the conversation to "you're either with us, or your a Nazi".

       There's a picture of the terrorist marching with vanguard, dressed in the white and khakis (the prearranged uniform), holding a shield with the vanguard logo. I'm not going to bother sourcing it, its easy to find on google.
      </p>

       Of course Vanguard is saying he's not affiliated with their group, their almost certainly being investigated right now.

       And how does marching with them prove that hes a member? Theres a difference between a lone wolf and a group-sanctioned attack. I suggest waiting for an investigation if any group is responsible for a terrorism, or if its just an isolated incident, e.g. timothy mcveigh, anders breivik

       No, its not. Anonymous isn't an actual organization. Its more like wearing a boy scouts uniform and going to a jamboree.

       Again, why waste your time typing things like this. You keep on saying things that don't mean anything or have any relevance to the point. You were making an arguement that their isn't enough evidence to associate this guy with the alt-right groups that planned the events, but there is. He was obviously involved/affiliated/communication with the groups beforehand, as he knew what wear. Its obvious what side he was on, they were wearing fucking uniforms. He drove a car into the group of people that were protesting the alt-right.

       Please don't take this as an insult because it's very sincere, but you should really let the people your replying to know that you have a severe learning disability with some sort of disclaimer. Its very frustrating trying to communicate with someone on your level when you aren't aware of their issues.

       "There was even an asian man that marched with them for chrissakes, and he even wore khaki pants ... so according to your logic hes a member of a white supremacist group"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I'm talking about. Over the course of multiple comments I've outlined several reasons why I think he's associated with the white supremacists group, none of them were "because he's wearing khakis".
      </p>
      <p>
       If that Asian was wearing khakis and a white polo, carrying a shield with a vanguard logo, and drove his car into a group of counter-protesters I would accuse him of being a member of a white supremacist group. I write something, provide my justification for it, then you respond and completely ignore my justification, then accuse me of jumping to conclusions based on something I never said.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is irrelevant though. The real issue you here is your inability to make a point and defend it. I took your initial comment as an indication that you think the attacker wasn't associated with the alt right. You then confirmed that was your opinion in the first paragraph of your last comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You were making an arguement that their isn't enough evidence to associate this guy with the alt-right group"
      </p>
      <p>
       You responded: "That we know of at this point in time. How hard is that to understand, or do you always jump to conclusions?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently pretty fucking hard, because later you wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "yes he is associated with them we agree on that"
      </p>
      <p>
       Im genuinely embarrassed by this exchange. If you weren't trying to gaslight me I suggest you have an adult help you the next time you're writing comments.

       FFS do you know the meaning of the word associated? Its a broad fucking term and it doesnt necessarily make him a member which is why a clarified it so special people like you could understand it.

      </p>
      <p>
       Then you said that we agree and he was associated.

       I haven't looked into it, but they probably mean his actions in no way represent the organization or the views of other members. It's like when a Muslim commits an act of terror, we don't go round saying the actions of one individual represent the group as a whole. Can you imagine if antifa started turning up at mosques? I would hate to see that happen and I worry that we might end up there.

       I didn't say that, and thats not what he's saying. He's saying we don't know if he's even associated with these groups. He's trying to cast doubt on his link to the alt-right, for some reason trumptards are taking all the Nazi hate personally...

       Yeah, but opposing people that definitely are NOT Nazis because you THINK they ARE Nazis, is DEFINITELY far Left, Liberal nonsense. There was literally one Swastika flag at Charlottesville, and it was creased and fresh, it was fresh out of the bag. A real Nazi didn't need a buy a brand new flag, they already had one. These people were State-planted, Leftist Birddoggers. There were less than 10 people out of 1,000 in C-Ville doing the Roman Salute. Calling every White Conservative who is against mass migration, against the deletion of our national culture, and against Marxist Globalism a NAZI is ridiculous.

       Wrong again. And the problem is the people AROUND them who are supposedly not white supremacists not opening their fucking mouths when people are yelling "Heil Hitler", "Heil Trump", calling people the N word, chanting "Blood and soil", calling people fa*****, chanting "Jews will not replace us",  etc.

       It's like, if I'm a Cavs fan and go to a "cavs rally" and all of a sudden Warriors fans show up and take over and start becoming the majority and chanting "lets go Warriors!", I would leave that rally. It's no longer for me.

Real people have been outed as nazis and white supremacists and are being shunned by their families and losing their jobs. Or you can just keep thinking literally everyone there is an actor.

       Scroll all the way down to the very last paragraph of this email. He says:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler. This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously right, and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say, “That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say,” or “You certainly do
remind me of Adolf Hitler.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire Nazi thing is a Media creation because they are losing control of the narrative, and the Nazi card is the one they've been saving for decades, it is the hard reset that they can use whenever they need to re-circle the wagons and regain control.

       The "don't fall for the Left/Right divide" thing is a "shut it down" meme to try and prevent people from resisting against Antifa and Corporate Statist Marxism that is taking over. When they tell you don't get caught up in it, don't fall for it, they are really saying, let them keep doing what they are doing, and don't present any resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those people are either deeply blue-pilled, or actual shills. Never let someone convince you that standing up against the Marxist Progressive Globalist Corporatist Left is "falling for their scheme", or that "thats exactly what they want you to do". Cause it isn't. It's exactly what they DON'T want you to do.

       The entire American Left is Marxist. Is it possible that you don't know what Marxism means? Lots of people think it means Economic Socialism, but the true meaning of Marxism is playing Have's and Have-Not's against each other for the purpose of fomenting a revolution. I highly recommend reading Marx's work to learn about this, as well as Saul Alinsky's book, Rules for Radicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some of the more influential Marxists that brought the ideology back into the public mindset by basing modern Social Justice off of it (agitating Have Not's vs Haves) were Slavoj Žižek, Herbert Marcuse, George Soros, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire Antifa and BLM platforms are Marxist through and through, both revolutionary movements based around dispossessing their "Oppressors", so that after they are gone, Egalitarianism can be put into place. That is literally what Marxism means. I looked through some of your posts, you literally call yourself a Communist. Are you unaware that Communism is Marxist?

       It's both dingus. Socialism is what Marx calls the transitory period between capitalism being overthrown and communism, though it's not a term he invented.

       Those are two mutually exclusive revolutionary theories. Marx treats violence cavalierly, Alinsky recommends protesting like a lame hippie democrat.

       No. There are no statistics on antifa's ideological demographics, but a damn good chunk of 'em are anarchists who'd damn near slap you for calling them something so gross. I highly doubt marxists are more than a small minority, like they are in the rest of the country.

       First of all, what I wrote was longer than the Reddit post limit... sorry for the novel, but this is going to be broken up into two parts. This is PART ONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't think that Communism, Socialism, Anarchism and the like are all Marxist, then you are deep in the Leftist echo chamber. Communism in its final form as envisioned by Marx, Engels and Lenin was an Anarchic Social Voluntarist system. But they also knew that you couldn't just pull that system out of thin air. They believed that Capitalism was a necessary stage the followed Feudalism, and that Socialism would follow Capitalism, and that Communism in it's final form would follow State Socialism. And they pictured that final form to be Stateless, Egalitarian, and Voluntarist.  All of Anarchism, Socialism, Communism, Democratic Socialism... Marxism is upstream of ALL of them as they exist in their current forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure, as a self-avowed Communist, that you know that the ultra-rich elite destroying Western Civilization are the Globalists and the Neoliberal Capitalists. You have traitorous European 'royalty' like the House of Windsor, you have the Council of 300, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, DynCorp, etc, along with the source of money, the network of central banks run by the IMF and the Bank of International Settlements, and the World Bank. Down to the local branches like the US Federal Reserve. This cabal is a Globalist Technocracy, that sees national borders, national identities and local autonomy, etc., as arbitrary boundaries to the movement of resources and capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marx resented these people, and rightly so. He resented the state of the world, and the way that the industrial revolution reduced a class of human beings to no more than labor slaves. Marx resented the 'Bourgeoisie' (the middle class) and the Capitalists (the upper class who controlled the means of production). Marx believed that by exposing the working class of countries all around the world to his ideas, "Marxism", there could be a worker's revolution worldwide, overthrowing the middle class, the Capitalists, and the entrenched traditions and values which were in the way of social justice, aka "The West".
      </p>
      <p>
       Marx and Lenin and Engels envisioned a utopian world, a worker's paradise. But they were all acutely aware that they couldn't build this vision of theirs directly on top of pre-existing civilization. They knew that civilization was a glass that was full. Before they could fill that glass with their own ideology, they needed to empty out what was already in it. The method that they chose to achieve their goal was revolution, triggered by the awakening of Class Consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Class Struggle was Classical Marxism, Marxism 1.0. It was Marxism's first big try. But the working class voted for Hitler. That wasn't supposed to happen. Stalin, who rejected the classical principles of Marx, Lenin, and Engels, was adored by his people, even as he purged the Marxists as they fled to post-World War 2 Germany, where they regrouped as the Frankfurt School. That wasn't supposed to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       After decades of trying, the Marxists eventually conceded that people seemed to care more about their identity than their class. Trying to get the poor of the world's nations to turn against their middle class violently, just wasn't working. But in this, they realized that people
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       fight for their identity. Cultural Marxism or Social Marxism attempts to agitate and provoke the minority, or, "social have-not", against the majority. This means turning homosexuals against heterosexuals, racial minorities against White people, athiests against the religious, women against men, and hell, you can still mix in the classical Marxist class struggle, as long as their is a revolutionary attitude or context for it to exist within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are they doing this? The ideology is a poison injected into foreign cultures to weaken them from within. Once nations are "demoralized" (morals/values/customs erased) and "atomized" (radical individualism), and enslaved (wage slavery/tax farm/dependent on the state), the aggressor merely has to take up the slack of the reins to gain power. It truly is a genius system that lets you peacefully take control of a foreign civilization, the tradeoff being that it takes multiple generations to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cultural Marxist SJW and Antifa Left, and even the Progressives, think they are "speaking truth to power". They think that they are the resistance, and the revolution. They don't realize that they are the very tool that the ultra-rich Elite use to destabilize the world so that they can reap the benefits. Just as many of the Communists of the 20th century did not realize that. These people are the storm-troopers of the establishment. And it's a tragedy that they can't see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what make them "puppets" and "useful idiots", as Yuri Bezmenov would have said. Don't you see? They don't even know that they are the militant wing for Globalism. Let me try to explain. Globalist power has solidified around Cultural Marxism, or what has become modern Leftist social culture, and Neoliberal economics, basically unregulated international Capitalism, and "free trade".
      </p>
      <p>
       They know they are fighting that last part, the international Capitalism, they have just enough foresight to see that much. What they can't see is that the same group who runs the word financial system is also the purveyor of their social ideology. And their social ideology is the very thing that is breaking down social norms, national borders, the family unit, ethnic demographics, political blocs, and more. It is a directly corrosive ideology to anyone around it, and that is on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did rich Wall Street bankers fund Lenin, and Trotsky? Why did America bankroll the Soviet Union? Why after World War 2 did we give the Soviet Union half of Europe? And even half of Germany, letting them encroach into Western Europe? General Patton knew he could take Berlin, but the US Establishment refused, and then after weeks of inaction, let them Soviets take half when they arrived? Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism has been a tool used by the Corporatist/Globalist elites for decades, with a dual purpose. On one hand it erects enemies in foreign countries for their Military Industrial Complex to go knock down. While simultaneously serving the purpose of taking the West nonviolently through education (indoctrination). But either way, the end result is the nation, whether a foreign body, or our very own, ending up under their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Post-Modernists didn't reject Marxism. They rejected the Class Struggle. The
difference here for us is one of language. You perceive Marxism to BE the Class Struggle. This is where you are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they realized that even the poor would side with their people when push came to shove, they gave up on the Class Struggle as the most likely or useful means of triggering the revolution. And so they chucked it. Since Economic Marxism had failed, they redirected their efforts into a Cultural Marxism. If the Poor wouldn't turn on the Rich, then maybe the Blacks would turn on the Whites, the Gays would turn on the Straights, the Atheists on the Religious, the Left, versus the Right. They realized that rich or poor, if people share one identity, they will act together. They realized that the smart way to trigger the revolution was to break apart people's solidarity by breaking their shared identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was always the point. The post as Marx saw it was to trigger mass social change, to galvanize the have-nots of the world against the haves. He perceived this struggle through the lens of class. But the notion that one should agitate a class or group of people against their host or against their larger civilization, for the purpose of triggering a social sea-change, is Marxist to the core, whether it's using class-victimhood to agitate, or whether it's using a different victim status to agitate. And it's working.
      </p>

       No. Go check wikipedia, get your chronology straight, and maybe I'll consider reading the rest of your manifesto. Marxism is

       I said, "in their current forms". Trust me that there is a twist in there that will be worth getting to. I go on to make the distinction that the current versions of these institutions were influenced beyond a doubt by Marxism, and now today are a product of it. I really don't believe that you will be disappointed if you read on, even if you disagree. There is food for thought in there.

       PART 2
      </p>
      <p>
       We now live in a society where Marxism has been fully co-opted as an organic movement by Statist, Neoliberal Capitalist, Globalist reasons. We live in a society that uses Far Right economics, but Far Left social propaganda. We get the whole LGBT, omni-racial, transgender, feminism package along with Capitalist economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, we have to be clear about WHY Neo-Liberal Capitalist economics and Post-Modernism (the euphemistic term that people use today for Social Marxism) go hand in hand. On the surface of it, they should be opposites. They should disagree. Neoliberalism essentially means unregulated big business. It's basically Corporatism. The State carves out a big space for the Corporations and is then hands off on them, while regulating small business that's on the way up. Whereas the Marxists, if they hadn't been co-opted by the Feds and the MSM, would be completely against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the reason this unlikely couple pair up, is because the Neoliberals weaponize the Post-Modernism to break down boundaries that the Neolibs don't want to be there. In the same way that a spider injects a poison into its prey, and then slurps out the liquefied remains, rather than munch through the hard exoskeleton, the Neoliberal Corporatists inject Post-Modernism and Cultural Marxism into Nations, so that they can then effortlessly clear out the weakened remains and establish themselves as the dominant power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my personal belief that Communism is the ultimate trap, the ultimate lie, laid by the Capitalists. They knew, for a fact, that they expansionist Global Capitalism would cause a negative reaction around the world. From all of my research, it seems to me that it was an ideology seeded into working communities by agent provocateurs from elite intelligence communities. It served the double purpose of directing the negative energies caused by their global expansion of power into something that they controlled. And then also using that controlled negative energy in the masses that they themselves, the Capitalists, caused, to tear apart the distinct cultures and national borders and existing social and political institutions, leaving nothing but easy pickings for Globalist Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism is a tool used by the Finance Powers to redirect the resentment they create, and to channel it towards their purpose, the breakdown of the nation-states. To me, Communists can't see that they are the jackboots of the international stage of the Capitalist plan. Soviet defector Yuri Bhezmenov called them "useful idiots", as they were made to believe that it would be them, and not the Capitalist magnates, who would have power after the revolution. And I'm not saying this was the case at Marx's and Lenin's time, I'm saying this is the case in 2017. You're following a Fed movement that is backed ideologically by the MSM, by every big celebrity, and the big corporations like Facebook and Google. Didn't you see that Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio and and those type of guys are defending Antifa right now? Are you blind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism and Communism are part of the same scam created by the international financiers, and each of them were designed to work towards breaking down nation-states, one from the bottom, and one from the top. The purpose was always for them to meet in the middle as 'Global Government'. But they were always a two-pronged approach controlled by one master hand. Antifa think they are fighting against Capitalism, but when they march, shouting "Fuck Deportation! No Borders! No Nations!", they don't realize they are doing a Capitalist Establishment Jackboot March. The only reason all this migration is happening, and nationalism is being portrayed as evil, is for financial reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see empty space in Europe and USA and Canada. The entire Western half of the USA is basically empty. They envision masses of people cramped together into super-cities, where no one has any small business, there is no Mom and Pop Shop for a Wal-Mart to have to bust up or anything. Everyone lives as a consumer hamster in a big cage, works a menial job for credits, and then is let loose into the corporate uber mall that makes sure that to get food, water, clothes, medicine, ANYTHING, that you get it through them. And they could care less about languages, or cultures, or ethnic groups, or national boundaries. In fact, they actively despise those things, because they get in the way of selling products to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe for example, to market a product, you need advertisements in a dozen languages. They see the US, and how there is one currency, one language, covering thousands of miles. They covet that. They actively want to break down the European languages and borders and traditions and cultures and ethnic groups, specifically so that they can have THAT. And then they look ahead, and even then, they will want to break down the differences between every bloc, between the West, between Asia, between Africa. All so that they can advertise and propagandize in one core language, suppress the low-IQ of the world with one state-sponsored "religion", even if it's a civic religion with no spiritual faith, control everyone's lives by controlling the one and only remaining currency, control the source and distribution of power and food, so that anyone who dissents can just be "turned off".
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa and the Communists can't see that all of their actions, all of their beliefs lead to THAT. So you ask me, what is the answer? What do we do? My goal is to try and galvanize everyone who is against Global Finance and their attempt to take over the World, while also securing the existence of my people and my civilization specifically, White European Western Civilization will survive all of this, if I have any say. But the real key is getting all of the Leftists to understand that just as the State is the bulwark against the domestic Corporation, the Nation is the bulwark against International Finance. And everything that Leftists do that breaks down sovereignty, breaks down national individuality, mixes up groups in such a way that there will inevitably be conflict, delivers us into this future stateless Global Capitalist human farm that we are heading towards, with Antifa as the Catalyst. Our only hope is that a true, pure form of Fascism rises up across the world, and spits in the face of the Globalists and ends their disgusting project by mutually balkanizing the world again, putting it out of reach of the elite Central Planners.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a war between Capitalism and Communism, this is a war between Nationalism and Globalism. The trick was getting the Communists to believe in "passive Globalism" while the Capitalists moved towards "active Globalism". Passive Globalism is the idea that if you break down on all national boundaries, and ignore all 'arbitrary' differences, then by default, all that will be left is one, unified world. From this point of view, the national boundaries are artificial constructions that separate the natural Globalist state of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what the idealistic and naive Left doesn't realize, is that after they do they job, the Capitalists will just turn on the Active switch, and will have a whole world to control. They don't realize that the plan was ALWAYS to reveal themselves as the masterminds at the 'bridge', before destroying the Leftists. It's the same thing they do with stock market crashes. They cause a panic, everyone sells before they 'lose everything', and then the Capitalists 'consolidate'. They buy up everything for pennies on the dollar, and take over massive amounts of capital without firing a shot. Communism's "world revolution" is their engineered panic, the 'crash'. And they will be the last one's standing, over the ashes. This was ALWAYS the plan. Anti-Nationalist Leftists have a lot to explain when they are accidentally pushing George Bush Senior's agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society is unraveling, and as traditions and ethnic solidarity decline, consumerist Neoliberalism increases inversely. This is because the traditional ways of life, the national borders, the strong family, these are the main things that stand in the way of expansionist Capitalist Globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Neoliberals, in a stroke of GENIUS, agent provacateured these Leftist movements, and tricked entire generations of Leftists to do all the dirty work and the heavy lifting to pave the way for Global Capitalism, and then after the culture was busted, after the demographics were busted, after the values were busted, the Capitalists just stepped in and picked up the slack. I probably used to be somewhat like you, but when I saw Yuri Bhezmenov, KGB defector call Leftists "useful idiots" who were actually just paving the way for what they thought they were fighting against, I was never able to unsee it.

       No one is saying don't stand up to people who incite violence. They are saying stop picking "sides" and joining in some sort of tribalism pissing contest. People can call themselves whatever they want but it doesn't change how blatantly full of shit they are for using political ideology as an excuse for violence. This "Nazi" craze will die out just like all the other propaganda efforts of our shit government.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, saying "don't fall for the left right divide" is saying stop bickering amongst ourselves and focus that anger on the people who deserve it. The politicians and "Elite, TPTB, Deep State" whatever you want to call it. Joining in the violence won't help shit though. This is exactly what The Powers That Be want. Everyone so wrapped up in a pissing contest between ideology that we don't focus on the real criminals in our government.

       And what you don't realize is that the criminals in our government, and in the MSM, and from Multinational corporations, brainwashed Leftists to do their bidding for them. They are aligned on every single state/media/corporate stance. They are anti-nationalist, anti-racist, anti-free speech, anti-history, anti-tradition, pro-mass immigration, pro-multiculturalism, pro-censorship, and progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think they are some kind of resistance, but they are just the ground troops of CNN, and of our corporate overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the White people who founded this country and have been here for over 350 years are being COLONIZED to the tune of over 1,000,000 people every year, having our history erased, our statues taken down... we are having entirely new peoples and cultures being superimposed on top of what we already have here, we are being COLONIZED.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that people who care about that are "Nazis", or that White people will suddenly STOP caring about the fact that during the 2040s, White people are going to lose political control of the USA. You think we're going to stop? You think we're going to give up? If we DO give up, that's the end of our nation. If minorities and Marxists inherit the USA, do you think our Founding Fathers will be remembered kindly? Or as slave holders? What will they do with Mount Rushmore? Where will our people live? What random foreigner will be our President? They can't just steal our country from us, while we are literally still right here, and expect us to take it laying down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says "don't fall for the Left-Right divide" is someone who is playing right into their hands, what they would really like is an uneventful ride to 2040 so that we can be minority, and so that their takeover will be complete, because once we are minority, we can't even win it back with the vote. No, we have 20 years to act, or else it will be too late. And the same thing is happening in England, in Germany, in Sweden, in Italy, in France.... If we don't act, then plain and simple, Africans, Hispanics, and Islamists inherit Europe and North America, and White people have their historical homelands colonized. If you are alright with that, then you are a bad person.

       Do you not agree that the Left is currently aligned with every single State, MSM, and Corporate Stance? Do you deny that the Left have become the groundforce for the Elite positions they are spreading from their media?
      </p>
      <p>
       What this is going to become, is a divide not purely of Left and Right, but of people who watch the MSM, and people who don't. And that will become the new Left and Right after the paradigm shift. Left will be people backed by the State, by Celebrities, by the MSM, by all the corporate voices like Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. And Right will be people who are in opposition to the Corporate takeover of America. That will be the new paradigm.

       That sounds a lot more accurate :). Still we all were unaware until we found the courage to question our government. They are definitely trying to radicalize the left to attack people who believe in right wing ideology. Still, understanding and compassion work to a degree. However, I agree that people need to be prepared to defend themselves from violence from indoctrined folks as well. There will always be some who will cling to the system no matter what. But that doesn't mean you can't try to show them a better way first.

       I agree. My only fear is that I personally have been trying to show a better way, trying to erode people's faith in CNN, in MSNBC, in FOX NEWS, in all of that for so long. I've been pointing out the multinational corporations and the financial elements that are behind globalization, behind mass immigration, and that this migration isn't for humanitarian purposes as they claim, but for economic purposes. I've been pointing out that this financial element has actually been in control of our government for more than 100 years now, since the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. It is no coincidence that World War 1 started the very next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       NO ONE CARES. NO ONE LISTENS. The few people who do listen apparently think I am a Nazi. As far as I can tell, these people are utterly unwilling to critically analyze any evidence, ask any questions. If CNN or MSNBC said it, it's true. And before they were just indoctrinated loons. Now they are becoming violent, mass organizing, tearing down our statues, becoming openly and virulently anti-White racists. I really do not believe that they are just going to say, "Hmm, I guess I was wrong". Because admitting that would be admitting and confronting the fact that their entire worldview is a LIE, everything they have been told by their authority figures is a LIE, that THEY are actually RACIST against Whites, they THEY are actually unwittingly pushing Capitalist Corporatist Globalization down the tracks by breaking down unique and individual national and cultural identities, clearing the way for Corporate-State control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be just black-pilled, but I do not believe that they will listen. I think it may be too late for that now.

       I agree. I don't know what else to say in response to such hypocrisy.
Unless the people who still say dumb generalizing hive mind terms like "THE LEFT" "THE RIGHT" "THE LIBERALS" and especially the partisan morons who say
"THEM LIBTARDS", etc. etc.
didn't get the memo or something. But if they agreed not to push divide/conquer, and still push it, then it's intellectual dishonesty.

       Trump didn't denounce them until a few days after.  He played dumb, and if he honestly didn't know about the alt-right or what they stood for, then shame on him.  I am generally a Trump supporter, but he DID fuck up by not denouncing them outright.

       This is not the first time Trump has had "trouble" denouncing white supremacists.
      </p>
      <p>
       From February 2016:
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN's Jake Tapper asked Trump, "I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke who recently said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage. Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump replied, "Just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, ok? I don't know what you're even talking about with 'white supremacy' or 'white supremacist.' So, I don't know. I mean, I don't know, did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that i know nothing about."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tapper replied, "But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump dodged again. "Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group up that I know nothing about. I'd have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow them if I thought there was something wrong. But you may have groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair...
      </p>
      <p>
       Tapper interjected, "The Ku Klux Klan?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump continued, "So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know."

       Does this logic also apply to black supremacists that shout 'death to white people'? Or are they sort of magically excluded from logic?
Absolutely serious question.

       The organisers were expecting the kkk and other white nationalists to show up even though they did not want them there. Im assuming most of the counter protestors also thought they would make an appearance. Its pretty clear what side the kkk is supporting, and thats the side counter protestors are protesting.

       If you expected something and it doesn't turn up, you go away; you do not shout made up crap at the rest.
But then I have no hope about the common sense of these so called 'liberals' that aren't liberal at all...

       If you expected the president to be someone that he isnt then you should stop supporting him, you do not shout made up crap at the rest.

       Yes, you're correct. The far-left are trying to paint anyone who attends a protest or rally for a cause they don't like as Nazis/KKK/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way it's "justified" to silence them by any means necessary, commit violence against them, doxx them because they're the equivalent of the Nazis or KKK. Meanwhile antifa are the ones running around concealing their faces, go figure.

       Scroll all the way down to the very last paragraph of this email. He says:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler. This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously right, and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say, “That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say,” or “You certainly do
remind me of Adolf Hitler.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire Nazi thing is a Media creation because they are losing control of the narrative, and the Nazi card is the one they've been saving for decades, it is the hard reset that they can use whenever they need to re-circle the wagons and regain control.

       You don't seem to understand that all that symbolism isn't actually used by real people today. No one says heil trump or hell hitler with any seriousness. Even actual neonazis.
