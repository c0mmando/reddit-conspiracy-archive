        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;re all aware of the violent showing last weekend. We&#39;re all aware a young woman was murdered by some moron who believes his skin color makes him superior (I realize this is up for debate).</p>

<p>We&#39;re all aware of the fallout from that. The increased calls for censorship. The acceptance of violence in response to violence. We have watched as GoDaddy, CloudFlare, and Google removed the DailyStormer from their services. </p>

<p>Yet there&#39;s a piece of scary information, buried down deep in some (very few) news articles about Google and the DailyStormer. Most seem to want to ignore it. I don&#39;t because I think it&#39;s the most important piece of information to come from this whole shit show (minus the loss of life). </p>

<p>From the EFF&#39;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/fighting-neo-nazis-future-free-expression">article</a> on the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google also placed the dailystormer.com domain on “Client Hold”, which means that Daily Stormer’s owner cannot activate, use or move the domain to another service. It’s unclear whether this is for a limited amount of time, or whether Google has decided to effectively take ownership of the dailystormer.com domain permanently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, to me, is far more worrisome than a few hundred racist shitheads. It&#39;s far more worrisome than a few hundred violent leftists. </p>

<p>The precedent being set here is fucking scary. Why does a private entity, a monopoly really, have the power to seize control of a private citizen&#39;s property? A domain name is property. It is owned by the person who purchased it. Google has no legal claim to the domain name. </p>

<p>And nobody is talking about it. It&#39;s being swept under the rug, in favor of praise for Google (and CloudFlair, and GoDaddy) for not hosting Nazis. I&#39;m not sure they deserve praise for that (defending free speech should be praised, not curtailing it). However, it&#39;s their right as a private business to shut down any user they want. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t that though. This is theft. What&#39;s next? Can the government now demand Google seize control over an anti-Trump domain name? The precedent is now there. Can they demand Yahoo seize control over a political opponents emails? </p>

<p>Is this true? From all the research I&#39;ve done, I&#39;ve found the EFF to be mostly correct -- the domain is unusable until Google releases the clientHold. </p>

<p>This is validated for me when you whois dailystormer.com, it&#39;s still registered under Google. If DailyStormer.com was usable, why wouldn&#39;t they just move it? Why have they now been forced to try other TLDs? (.ru, .lol, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what the EPP code means. I used to do domains &amp; hosting for a living when I was younger so I know how it should work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s something more going on but just clientHold isn&#39;t proof of this. You&#39;d expect to see clientTransferProhibited.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that they lied about &quot;Jewish hackers&quot; taking down the site, so they could be leaving it there to make it look like Google are holding it whilst they find someone who will do business with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. They could be lying. </p>

<p>As I said, everything I found in my research looking into that code made it seem like the domain name becomes unusable. Maybe that&#39;s not the case here, it&#39;s just what I&#39;ve found when researching EFFs claim. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, does it matter if it can be transferred or not? If it can&#39;t be used, it&#39;s dead in the water. I get it would matter in terms of language accuracy, but it wouldn&#39;t practically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s a difference.</p>

<p>clientHold means the domain cannot be resolved so it&#39;s non-functional. The registrar doesn&#39;t want to provide them with service.</p>

<p>clientTransferProhibited and you can&#39;t transfer it to someone who will provide service, the domain isn&#39;t behind held by the registrar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There absolutely is a debate about if the guy they arrested was the guy driving the car. A lot of evidence says he wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the debate about if he was pushed to that point by our IC. Wouldn&#39;t be the first time. </p>

<p>Are we to just accept the official report even though there is evidence to contradict it? I happen to believe he was the driver but I also won&#39;t discount that the car he drove looks nothing like his car, or that the driver looks nothing like him (this one is easier to explain as it&#39;s a potato quality pic)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I see it too, basically it does seem to me that governments, corporations, and various think tanks are coming up with the strategy to limit the flow of information that is going around and are doing so by infiltrating groups wishing to speak on issues and then hijacking that group so that any valid concerns are washed away in a sea of vitriolic rhetoric and nonsense. It should be noted this isn&#39;t a &quot;left&quot; vs &quot;right&quot; thing either. </p>

<p>The Anti-Fascist group most likely has been corrupted and taken over by neoliberal groups and government and corporate think tanks to align people who wish to fight fascism with people who loot and destroy and incite violence everywhere they go and most likely BLM has also be destroyed and taken over. I&#39;d also imagine that the Free Speech group on the Right has been corrupted and taken over just like the Tea Party before it. It&#39;s now being lumped in as some Far Right group like the Nazis which point blank I don&#39;t believe is the case.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this is how the TPTSB (Shouldn&#39;t Be) are going to destroy the people rights to protest about how they feel, destroy the people&#39;s rights to say what they feel is wrong and most importantly destroy the Internet and thus limit what informs they deem is to &quot;offensive&quot; to others or to be more precise, information that shines a light on phony &quot;left&quot; vs &quot;right&quot; paradigm and expose the bullshit on all sides. While I dislike the white nationalist and white supremacist of the Christian and Alt Right, they have a right to say what they feel just as I have the right to call them out on their bullshit. Rather then arguing and using buzzwords, or skewed statistics that bunk as fuck and cherry picked to show a certain narrative, I point to history as my weapon and show what I feel is wrong with what they are saying if I feel something isn&#39;t right. </p>

<p>I&#39;d urge any fellow advocates of Multiculturalism or Social Justice to do the same. Don&#39;t cry out and act violent, state facts and historical points to showcase if something is amiss, and if you cannot find anything good, hear your opponent out and consider their criticism. Maybe you might find a bridge to walk on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The argument is they didn&#39;t &quot;seize&quot; it, they just rendered it unusable. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true, for one. For two, it&#39;s a distinction that&#39;s silly to make. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the difference between stealing your car keys and slashing your tires (while you have the inability to replace the tires)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope so. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d win (I don&#39;t trust our justice system to hold corporations accountable), but it&#39;s a fight that needs to be had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why monopolies are dangerous to everybody.  It is much easier to control information (look at the news media) and other large-scale companies that people rely on for information (Google / YouTube, Facebook) when the competition is either dead or bought out.  The amount of information stored by Google is staggering, and they have full access to all of it, can delete what they want, change what they want, etc.  Amazon is on that boat too now.  </p>

<p>I know that everybody loves the argument &quot;it is a private entity, they can do what they want&quot; but what we are seeing here is why there needs to be SOME sort of safeguard for us, the consumers, as well.  Companies should not have the same rights as citizens, and I think the court ruling of Buckley vs Valeo was a mistake.  When it comes to information, i think that private entities need to be held to some level of regulation not unlike how food companies have to meet regulation standards.  The first amendment needs to be protected, and i think the scope of it should extend beyond what was initially set back when it was made by our founding fathers.  Disinformation campaigns committed by corporations should probably be illegal because of the sheer influence it has on the population.  </p>

<p>Sorry for this being a rant, but i felt the need to throw this out there.  I also welcome debate for/against this as well.  Obviously there is no precedent for this, but it makes sense that laws in respect to this should favor the individual over the company, not the other way around.  Companies having this much influence on us is a globalist&#39;s wet dream.  </p>
