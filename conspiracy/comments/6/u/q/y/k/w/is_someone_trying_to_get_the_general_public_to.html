       I swear I didn't even know some bullshit was going down today in Boston, and I am too busy rolling my eyes to goggle-up on it.  But a quick scan of headlines tells me there was a pro-Free Speech rally in Boston, held by 20 or so of the bad guys du jour (nazi's, alt right, pro-southern pride, and what have you), and they were surrounded by 5,000 people with anti-racism and anti-hate signs? And when the Antifa contingent marched in the crowd applauded them? God these people are so fucking dumb! The messsages are scrambled, their brains and sensibilities are all scrambled. Just stay the fuck home. Or everyone have their own fucking rallies. And I will be fucked if I am ever stupid enough to cheer for fucking Antifa

       Why the fuck would you even go? Who the fuck even cares about KKK and white nationalists and Nazi's?  There's about 2 fucking thousand of them in the whole country and 25% of them are undercover FBI. They're being used for something else. I am not sure what exactly but they got 15,000 fools in Boston to show up frothing at the mouth and drunk on self-righteousness.  Now THAT'S something to be concerned about.

       David Duke got 59000 votes in 2016 running for Senate. Sure it's only 3%. But that's a large number.

       What?!?!  Holy shit! You're right dude. I was underestimating.  Bigtime.  Thanks dude.  And I didnt even know Duke was active in politics still.  I think last time I googled him 5 years or so ago he had a web-radio show, maybe?  At that time I concluded (on my own with no further research or data) that he is fed enough money by Dems and Dem related groups to keep his lights on and food on the table, so they can march him out every election cycle and be like: "Hey everyone! This dude was totally the super grand wizard of the KKK and he's totally voting for (insert Repub name here)!"

       Many thanks to your family tree for fighting the good fight. They did what they had to do when they were called to do it.  I think we all need to do a better job of identifying what the good fight is now.  Who or what should we be railing against TODAY to preserve our freedoms?  Is it 24 feeble-minded dregs with confederate flag stickers on their jean jacket vest?  Are they a threat to our rights and freedoms?

       Bullshit. Neo-nazis and white supremacists just love to hide behind free speech to espouse their horrible views and then act outraged when they're fired for their horrible fucking views. Free speech is alive and well, on both sides. Free speech doesn't protect you from counter protests or people thinking your an asshole.

       Its absolutely amazing you don't see the hypocrisy between your statements.  When an idea you dont like is at issue, you state that its Google's right to do what they want as a private company.  When an idea you dont like is at issue, you have no problem suppressing their rights as a private company with the point of a gun (government).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the whole problem with "protected classes".  Equality under the law for all people should be the goal.  Once you start passing laws for different, arbitrarily created groups you ensure that equality under the law is impossible.  We had (and have) an equality and an institutional discrimination problem in this country.  The answer to that problem isn't to codify our perceived differences into law, its a recipe for disaster.

       He isn't equating them. He is trying to teach about what the concept of free speech actually means. As in you can't oppress groups you don't like then pretend you still have free speech.

       GoDaddy and Google didn't stop The Daily Stormer from existing, only not to do business with them. TDS could be set up on a home computer and hit with an IP address. Then they're free to continue their hate speech and spreading about how the Jews need to be stopped. Could take a non-retard 5 seconds to set up. Idk if they have that man power, but it's possible.

       Yeah TDS could do that. But i'm pretty sure a cheap setup like that can be easily knocked out by DDoS attacks. Which is the emerging way for governments to censor websites they don't like without making it too obvious. Along with delisting them from search results. Remember the anti-free speech stuff your cheering today could be used against you tomorrow.

       Are you saying the first amendment was designed to protect the American people or the principle of free speech? Just trying to clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't necessarily agree with the idea of a time when all Americans loved free speech, the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed way back in 1798. During the civil war an anti-war Democrat was arrested and prosecuted for disloyal speech. Another sedition act was passed during WWI. First amendment rights have been abridged multiple times in our past.

       corporations like Google and GoDaddy do not have to provide people who use their service with free speech. Thats simply not how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if the government provided all domain registrations, then it would be a very different story. But then the government is controlling access to the internet so thats fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why do people get so hung up on defending other peoples rights to be complete fucking pieces of shit? Have you read any of the shit on thedailystormer? Whether you are liberal or conservative, it doesnt matter, they push pure hate. Regardless of social or economic opinions, they spew vile horrible things that should not be said about fellow human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why should they have that right? What are they to providing society that society must provide them freedom?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we have to allow malicious, hateful, vile shit, we might as well just have complete anarchy and let everyone do whatever the fuck we want. Lets see if we all feel safe and provided for in our homes when that starts.

       They have that right because NOBODY should have the ability to determine what is acceptable speech and what isn't. That is the entire point of all this. The easiest way to get the passive public on board is to start by using the absolute worst kinds of speech so that most people will agree to pass the first baby step of limiting free speech. But what's next? How long is it until the dangers of speaking badly about the government becomes the focus of the media?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that so many people are so short-sighted about all of this is what's most terrifying. You're literally playing right into the hands of TPTB.

       Ok, so if your creepy uncle start's rambling graphically about yacht orgies at your son's eighth birthday, you wouldn't tell him to shut it or get out? Different speech is appropriate at different times, you have literally zero chance of changing that cultural norm.

       It really is though. You wouldn't let your uncle tell lustful tales at a child's party, leftists don't want to let fascists commit terroristic threats in public. Social mores will always limit where or when it is acceptable to express certain opinions or discuss certain topics, and there is nothing wrong with that.

       Yelling anything fascist is yelling a terroristic threat. It is a threat to the scapegoats of your particular sect. It's a hate crime

       That's a false equivalence, most depictions of the president getting murdered are likely satirical. Fascism is all serious, the satire in no way resembles it. They all mean it, the threats are credible.

       Antifa and protesters are not the government. They're just the public telling nazis to stop and leave. That's not interfering with any of their freedoms except their freedom to make terroristic threats in public, which nobody is particularly interested in protecting.

       Call it what you want, but we're attempting to push racism underground, as it can't be fully extinguished. Care to guess what happens when you push groups like these underground? Also consider the post December 2nd gun sales paired with anti-gun talk to fuel those sales. It's no mystery that .GOV is trying to pit the people against themselves, so I wonder why you're so eager to combat negativity with negativity. I could guess your motives for that, but oh well.

       You're saying you don't like the way someone thinks, yet you're one person, so you have literally no idea how other people think. Someone who hates but doesn't physically do anything to anyone has a human right to be protected from you trying to hurt them for ANY reason. A racist who hurts someone will be lawfully tried in court. You're not the judge and jury by yourself, so cut that notion out right now. You remind me of most racists.

       I meant more like fired from their job or ostracized, and end up with a shitty fucking life like the losers they are. You obviously interpreted it as a death threat. Glad I could clear that up.

       It ranges from being ostracized, to losing your job, to being punched, to worse. There aren't many benefits to being a bigot in this age. The single benefit is that they are granted the same protections as everyone else, which you seem to wish to take away from them. "They deserve what they get" is broad, not limited to non-violence. You wouldn't need to mince your words later if you chose them more carefully.

       I never said I wanted to take away any protection from them. That's a blatant lie. You interpreted how you wanted to make it fit your narrative, good job pushing the narrative you wanna push, regardless of how much you have to lie.

       You can't bash my character with your accusations all you want, but I never lied, and you're changing your stance every thirty seconds, so I'm not sure what you expect from continuing your fit. Adults learn from their mistakes. Take that any way you like.

       Which makes you pretty racist yourself... All people who call people racist even when their not deserve whatever shit they get. I really do care.

       Seek help, seriously.  It is incredibly unhealthy to be seeing nazis everywhere.  The media has you in a tizzy and you quite obviously are not thinking straight.  Seek professional help.

       People like you who don't admit there is a very large portion of "social-justice" protesters that absolutely despise free speech and want to overturn the 1st amendment are either ignorant or lying.  They don't hide the fact that they oppose free speech.

       Well then your not fine with counter protests then. Since when they decide to show up on the same day, and bring weapons it kind of inherently fucks with free speech for obvious reasons. It's ok though. We saw a lot of these intimidation tactics being used during the election. And it probably only got Trump more votes. So not sure what these genius's are trying to accomplish.

       It's become a catch-all label just like everyone who disagreed with things Obama did was labeled "racist". Sometimes, if they're wearing a Nazi uniform, carrying a Nazi flag, and calling themselves Nazis, then yes, they're Nazis. Other times, it's the left trying to silence the right simply because they're conservative or don't espouse leftist views.

       This is to justify the push of the corprocrats to the right. The actual leftists/liberals (however they identify) will once again be pushed out. This is the continuation if Clinton's failed campaign strategy of bringing the party to the right. The rank and file don't know it because they're fighting "them". Do long as "they" are the enemy to be pointed at the left isn't noticing the party elite step further to the right. This longterm strategy is outlined by Mussolini in his Third Way doctrine ushered in by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, was condemned by FDR, Henry Wallace, Jeremy Corbin and Bernie Sanders. DNC (not necessarily rank and file) are literally fascists.

       There may have been a few skinheads in the crowd when are usually federal agents anyway. The rally was to protest removal of confederate statues/monuments which is currently being carried out all over the place with no real voting on whether it should be done. Anyway who disagrees with the state of this action is labeled a White supremacist, and or Nazi. And after this it will be the same thing when they start trying to remove statues of the founding fathers.

       The rally had nothing to do with statues or monuments.  It was to support free speech.  They were carrying BLM signs because that's a big part of free speech nowadays.

      <p>
       Doesn't matter: 40,000 idiots protested them anyway.

       I was in Boston today, and the only conflating going on here is the shit you are trying to pull. That rally was sponsored by the KKK and Neo-Nazis. The 2 dozen or so people that were there, were only their to show their support for White Nationalism. "Free Speech" was just a bullshit excuse for those Nazis to hide behind.

       Okay, that's good feedback.  Thank you. I saw a headline with Free Speech in it, and the story had all these protesters going crazy, including cheering for Antifa.

      <p>
       But just so we're clear, I am not trying to pull any bullshit, so fuck you for saying that. I think KKK and racists are idiotic losers and dregs.  I dont want the media and the left to start down this path of saying Free Speech is bad.

       While I agree people with white nationalist views should be able to speak, I really think they were hoping for a bad reaction from the counter protesters - I mean, after what happened in VA last week, what did they expect?

       Actually, this guy is dead wrong.  The free speech ralliers were carrying BLM signs and the organizer explicitly rejects white supremacy of any kind because white supremacists do not extend free speech rights to non whites.

       No one would even care who they were if no one showed up to protest them. They'd just be a bunch of dumb rednecks in a park that no one wants to talk to. They have no political or military power. They're a joke, and literally the only people that don't see this are neo-nazis and the people who protest them.

       The ones stupid enough to publicly call themselves nazis aren't the threat. It's the ones smart enough to know you at least have to use the proper dog whistle terms and attempt to hide your disdain for non-whites to get that moderate vote that's just not smart enough to see a conman when he's selling you a fucking wall to your face.

       I didn't see any Nazis. I watched the 20 or so people enter at the police checkpoint and none of them had swastikas, confederate flags etc. Not all of them were white as well.

       Plus - you couldn't hear anything they were saying if you were behind the barricade. I believe the speech was cut short as well.

       I have shown many examples of non peaceful action @ the event. When a hostile angry mob seeded with violent actors such as antifa screams or attacks to drown out a single or small group to prevent them from speaking it is not

      <p>
       If nazi, KKK or other hate groups such as the new black panther party etc. speak then IMO few to no cameras &amp; counter crowd is a wiser tactic that gives them little to no energy while giving them free speech without a spotlight that can make them less dim. Allowing them to speak also provides room for them to put their own foot in their mouth or to make non legal threats that cross a  line of what is legal.

       </strong>
       applied to any expression of legal speech is a fear based violent mindset TPTB want. If individuals expression of speech crosses a legal line then laws &amp; not a fight applies in a civilized manner. I think haters such as black &amp; white separatist types should be provided with areas to speak. It is legal to hate others. I also think areas of self rule would be the wisest path to explore to give separatist what they want to shut them up in a peaceable manner on their own terms.

       Well done!  Except that the organizer has nothing to do with the KKK and in fact explicitly rejects white supremacists of any kind.  They actually planned to physically separate themselves from anyone espousing white supremacy.  Hell, some of them were carrying BLM signs.

       They are trying to equate worrying about your culture and heritage being destroyed right in front of you to being a nazi. They call you racist if you question why only western nations must bring in millions of immigrants, so many that they start to out breed the native populations. They shut you down and bury you in insults if you dare to share the same concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this vitriol undeserved? Not entirely, there are many who share my concerns that are unquestionably racist, who demand an ethnostate and yearn for fascism (usually shills anyways), but there is nothing morbid in wanting your culture, your history and your nation preserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks here must understand that the people behind and in ANTIFA want to see all borders abolished, they want all cultures destroyed, they don't hide the fact that they would prefer a one party rule. I fear them far more than I fear neo-nazis or the Klan, because the later don't get their crimes ignored by the media and don't get praised by politicians.

       Removing the statues isn't white washing history, these men will remain in the history books as the traitors to America that they are. You are pushing a false narrative and attempting (and failing) to act as if removing these statues is an attempt to erase history. Why are you pushing this false narrative?

       I've been wondering why after all these years this is such a heated view point right now? Serious question. Not trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experience is that right now and over the last few years people want to and need to be offended about something. If it's not one thing it's another. I see this on the macro level on twitter/social media/news and at a micro level in personal interactions. The micro level isn't even political/social usually, it could be a simple comment about someone's glasses or sports ability and them getting all offended about it.

       Because we're in a time in our country where there's a large push from "alt-righters" and there's a very large vocal minority of the right side of the political spectrum which is openly racist. They are getting louder, whether that's because technology allows them to be louder or their numbers are growing is up for debate. I'd guess both since being louder also allows them to recruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to gain a backlash from the portion of the population that hates and detests racist assholes. Change takes time, I think a lot of people are upset with the current politics. But things escalate, sometimes there's a catalyst. I might guess that the rise of the alt-right and Trump has a lot to do with people wanting to push back against racists.

       I agree that there's a small portion of racists on the right, but tbh there are many racist people all over. To varying degrees and of all colors, but they're there. I've seen it first hand being a POC and with family and friends of various ethnicity. The big difference is the megaphone of the media. Wherever that is pointed is what gets the most attention. For instance, if they pointed it at Chicago for a week strong, that would be a huge issue (which it is and should be), but it's barely mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think that the media and a small but very VERY vocal group on the left is trying to group many on the right under one umbrella in order to vilify them?

       Okay, that's fair. I don't agree with that because I'm seeing it in the media and on social media. Racists support Trump therefore Trump is racist and if you support Trump then you must be racist as well.

       Really? I don't appreciate when you put words in my mouth like that, where did I imply that the immigrants themselves were evil or negative? Where did I say immigrants were only coming into the west? I said we are taking in an extraordinary amount, more so than any part of the world. This isn't a necessarily surprising fact, the western world is the best place to live so naturally we'd have more immigrants than any other part, but the inflow is becoming far too much for many nations to handle, and its getting to a point where parts of Europe are no longer majority European. Why do western nations have to be these hotbeds of diversity? Why is it only western nations where leftists want everyone to be the same race, for us all to mix and abandon our cultural traditions and heritage?

       Pretty much the tone of your entire post. But your whole post, and this follow up, is pretty rambling and honestly rather crazy. So I'll just say I hope you have a good day and hope someday you can learn not to fear immigrants.

       I don't know, a lot of people I've talked to on here agree with me, they don't see my comments as rambling or crazy, they in fact see much of the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's not coming across to you? Are you just too indoctrinated to understand? Do you not see the issue with the current zeitgeist steering us towards a one-race, one-state, one-culture society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, cut it with that typical lefty drivel. I don't "fear" immigrants. I have not said any negative comment towards immigrants anywhere in my posts, in fact if you look at my prior comments, I even support immigration, the issue I have with our current system of immigration I've said above.

       But then he had to say some silly stuff after it implying you think immigrants are evil, and you neglected to answer the actual point, which was about protecting culture, and it devolved into the two of you insulting each other.

       This right here. The problem is that the media is clearly pro Communist, and is giving them a total pass. It's amazing to watch actually. For them to totally, and openly reveal their hand in this way by throwing the current President under the bus. It also just goes to show that Trump was definitely not a part of the globalist game plan.

       Censorship is an attack on free speech. If you're trying to argue that freedom of speech is not being attacked at all right now, then you seem to be the only one who's confused.

       It's not the counter protesting, it's the violence that people are saying is an attack on free speech. You have a right to protest, you do not have a right to physically attack someone, because you disagree.

       I'm confused...
      </p>
      <p>
       So antifa are attacking people, therefore, it's an attack of freedom of speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       so if nazi's attacking people that means what exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious so how exactly you do expect the world to change do you think it's going to happen solely by being a keyboard warrior? I'm just confused because I feel your logic is warped, because in reality your logic would essentially be a blanket statement for all forms of violence.  So at what point in time is violence justified?

       I am surprised you have to ask.  But I denounce Nazi's 100%, in all ways, at all times.  As far as police, I used to be more anti police than I am now. Now I have mixed feelings.  I don't denounce them.  I'd like to see each city police dept have a once weekly meeting with outside opponents to dialogue on whats good, whats bad, what the rules of engagement should be, how they/we can be better tomorrow than we were yesterday, etc.

       Tribalism and the act of having to represent a side in some sort of fake battle (this Antifa and Nazi stuff doesn't leak into modern day relationships with our neighbors and so on). I should be able to share my opinion on the protests without being equated to a Nazi because I've seen too many videos of Antifa attacking people and throwing rocks and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't have to denounce groups to speak an opinion, and I shouldn't be generalized into a group for not representing yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see what I'm saying? This only creates derision, we are adults and we can have a meaningful conversation over controversial topics online without all that, and we have for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they want us to literally ignore eachother as soon as we hear that we are on opposite ends of the aisle politically. These guys aren't trying to defend Nazis, they are trying to say be wary in the overreach with groups like Antifa, who have burned free speech signs and have bullied others into silence before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying, I can say Antifa is overreaching and violent, but that doesn't mean I support literal Nazis. I don't support Nazis, and honestly I really don't care about Confederate monuments, that should be a state decision anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying this whole political situation has robbed from us the ability to connect with the other political groups, and we are too busy seeing eachother as a political enemy, instead of dealing with this white supremacist situation responsibly without creating hysteria.

       I've seen more upsets and issues arise from the left/right paradigm over the election than I've seen issues of racism divide families and friends personally, but maybe I just don't see it as much. I should though, I'm right in the hot bed of it.
      </p>

       That's fine, usually I view most left leaning people as slightly misguided, but that's only because they are usually unfamiliar with my southern reality like I'm not familiar with theirs.

       That kinda answered your question without addressing the extremes of your question, but if you feel that people aren't aligning themselves with these "movements" without apply labels then that really comes off as ignorance.

       Well, of course, man because you can be left or right and still be racist? A lot of people are almost more complacent in regards to racism. If the whole nazi thing isn't making that obvious than i don't know what to tell you.

       Because left and right is separate from Antifa/Nazi in my opinion, the fact that they are generalized together is where I get frustrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa is not moderate left and Nazis aren't moderate right. We shouldn't have to answer for the petulant children on both sides, but that's all everyone wants us to answer for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it took me all of three days to figure out how they were picking and choosing these rally spots. If we spent more time focusing on the actual power players in those groups we could easily expose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not apart of a movement by the way, I'm just a guy with immense amount of southern guilt and empathy who wants the world to know he doesn't support Nazis, I just have to end it on "I don't support Nazis" since no one is interested in solving systemic racism through community policing, police reforms, and reforms on corporate control on issues such as jury selection and so on 🤷
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just frustrating that it's all generalizing online at this point and it forces us to fight instead of finding solutions, at least that's how it feels to me. Especially with all these groups fighting for the front page.

       Between Antifa and Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd honestly say neither, Nazis like the ones putting on the rallies will look more like people from my neck of the woods. My big issue is that I'm in Arkansas and I should be surrounded by Nazis. Racists are here, but they are everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say right now a large majority is leaning towards Antifa, based on the memes and rhetoric of my social media friends. Everyone has made it this issue of "you're either against Nazis, or a Nazi" leaving no room for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which I get their point, but doesn't make it an appropriate debate tactic to silence your opposition. Most people want their oppositions words out in the open, because it's easier to dispute. Nazis are by far the easiest people to dispute, it's literally a joke if you've seen their numbers online and especially at Boston today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally just saying "I treat all races equally" disputes their whole belief since it's based on a master race.

      <p>
       The world will change by the open and free discussion of people, not by beating people because you disagree. Have a rational conversation, not an emotional outbreak of violence. The former is the civilized adult way of doing things, the latter is the barbaric childlike way.
      </p>

       If you disagree with someone, open a dialog with them. Explain in a rational matter why they are wrong. Violence is the absolute last thing to do when all other options have failed. It appears certain groups have skipped rational discussion and jumped straight to extremism and violence.

       I don't think you can justify attacking someone for any reason when it comes to them acting out on their rights. Now on the other hand self defense and defense of others from physical harm is always reasonable and in many situations is your responsibility. I don't agree with the Nazi narrative nor do I agree with antifa and BLM narrative. Even though I don't agree with their ideas I don't go protest them because they are exercising their First Amendment rights and I support that. Interfering with the exercising of rights is wrong in my opinion and extremely inflammatory. So like in the case of Charlottesville you have people that are congregated to exercise their rights and have applied to do so in a completely legal way and you have people that are trying to stop them from doing so. Which do you think were right?

       I feel they're both right in the sense that they're free to protest. I don't support nazi's though so their protesting being drowned out I dont care or their platforms being removed considering no one but them has to support their beliefs. They can say, organize to their hearts end that doesn't mean anyone has to just let them do it without opposition.

       But when you oppose them while they are exercising their right to be heard you aren't protesting their ideas but their idea to speak. Black Lives Matters was in Charlottesville along with Antifa counter protesting. As for political correctness I don't give a fuck about it. We have the moral obligation to speak as we think in my opinion. As for moral superiority? I think I am morally superior to many people but that doesn't make me better than them. It just gives me a greater responsibility to teach others through the way I live my life. You on the other hand even though you seem to think it is wrong to be morally superior see no issues with pointing out how I support "police brutality" and how I am supposedly afraid of the "black" in black lives matter. The Nazis were there because they wanted to espouse the idea that their race was superior. I don't see a lot of difference in Black lives matter.

       No you are using the threat of calling people politically correct in order to throw people off base and get them to say something stupid so that you can call racism. Actually yes the black does scare me just like when the kkk calls for white whatever scares me. Doesn't mean that I will back down from my ideas that no race is superior. Also doesn't mean I will keep either group from acting out their right to free speech. Rights shouldn't be infringed upon by the government, social groups, or individuals. As for police brutality? I guess that depends on the situation police must be brutal in response to brutality... does that mean I support every shooting or beating by the police? Of course not. Just like you shouldn't be against police being brutal in every situation. As for victim complex I don't have one. I generally defend myself when necessary but don't take the violence, verbal or physical, any further than necessary.

       Except there are tons of people in the BLM movement that are pushing out white people, jews, and even Asians now. When I say pushing them out I mean not wanting them to march in solidarity with them. Authority in my opinion is a necessary evil but we shouldn't be comfortable with it. We should chafe at authority to keep it from becoming to all encompassing so we agree with that. They didn't stop freedom of speech? There were speeches planned that were canceled due to the violence that occurred. The violence only occurred because the other groups came to protest. I wont point fingers and say who threw the first punch cause I wasn't there. It is a shitty situation and one that I wouldn't doubt that both sides were looking for.

       Except that this wasn't about white nationalism, the organizer explicitly rejects white supremacy, and the rally was carrying BLM signs.

       If it was truly a Freedom of Speech rally, I'd see your point and "wake up". However, it doesn't take much research to see who actually organizrs this group and their past rallies, like back in May. Kyle Chapman (based stickman), Augustus Invictus, Oathkeeper’s founder Rhodes, Proud Boys MA, and the Leadership Institute (who I consider to be a Lock conservative activist training group) all promote this "free speech" organization and were speakers in May and this in this month's. A couple dropped out this week, because of their connection to Charlottesville. A lot of the group's fans wanted to get Richard Spencer to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The KKK publically announced they would be attending this week and instructions provided by groups supporting this rally specifically called out skinheads to dress as normies, to prevent negative media optics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see why people would organize to counter-protest racism. Also the group is self-deceived as pro-Trump, and antifa people counter all pro-Trump stuff (I guess they see him as fascist, I think they like the press).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, if Westborough stand on a corner yelling about free speech, I don't consider counter-protest to be protesting against free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I think both sides are manufactured by TPTB to distract us. Wake up!

       No, it wasn't. Milo had no protected right to be a speaker at Berkley, he still had a legal right to go stand on a street corner and say whatever stupid shit he wanted. So no, it wasn't anti free speech. Again, you are just trying super hard to conflate the issues so the people against Nazism are the "bad guys."

       If you want to stick ideas and words in other peoples mouths then thats entirely up to you; i'd say your head is in the sand as much as any other. I like that you used the word "literal", it's so telling. Akin to someone repeating the word "indeed" over and over. 
At the other event I saw people holding the flags and wearing uniforms and then something terrible happened. Someone that i couldn't see, whose motives i couldn't discern, with tinted out windows and a suspicious number plate decided to ram a crowd of people. I'm glad that such a terrible event did not happen this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly find their words the worst that they do then i am sorry for you. I believe in free speech because i believe if an idea is so idiotic or foolish or downright unacceptable then it should be fine and even easy for you to argue and persuade against it.
From as far as i have got into understanding what national socialism means it has nothing to do with car ramming or race hating and just because these people held flags and wore uniforms and even spoke "racial hatred" does not mean they embody it.  Just as those who declare themselves followers of Islam then blow themselves up do not embody the religion more than those who do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to scream your head off over a word then i find that somewhat funny. What i find more interesting is how a potential presidential candidate got so close to the presidency and remained in office as secretary of state for so long when so many of the actions of this person could be described as "war engineering".
      </p>
      <p>
       But please, with the media trying to convince us that nuclear war is brewing and congress trying to push sanctions on Iran and Russia hoping to create conflict, please tell me that i'm burying my head in the sand by pretending i don't understand exactly what speech they're so worried about becoming illegal.

        Nazism subscribed to theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race.[2] It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum, and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or "inferior" races. The term "National Socialism" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of "socialism", as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of class conflict, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the "common good" and accept political interests as the main priority of economic organization.[3]

       No, he doesn't have a legal protected right to speak at Berkeley. I'm sorry this revelation is coming as a shock to you. Also an invitation from a club isn't some irrevocable part of the constitution, this seems to be where the bulk of your confusion is.

       Sorry if the confusion is you think he wasn't allowed to go stand on a sidewalk at Berkeley and scream if he wanted. He could have, nobody was stopping him from doing that. Berkeley has absolutely no legal requirement to give him an auditorium.

       The angry violent mob outside was very much stopping him from doing that. He was evacuated from the campus by security for his own safety. That's not because the students used their freedom of speech to counter-protest peacefully against him, that's direct censorship through violence.

       From the ACLU link he provided:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q: The First Amendment prevents the government from arresting people for what they say, but who says the Constitution guarantees speakers a platform on campus?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: The First Amendment does not require the government to provide a platform to anyone, but it does prohibit the government from discriminating against speech on the basis of the speaker’s viewpoint. For example, public colleges and universities have no obligation to fund student publications; however, the Supreme Court has held that if a public university voluntarily provides these funds, it cannot selectively withhold them from particular student publications simply because they advocate a controversial point of view.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, public colleges and universities are free to invite whomever they like to speak at commencement ceremonies or other events, just as students are free to protest speakers they find offensive.
        <strong>
         College administrators cannot, however, dictate which speakers students may invite to campus on their own initiative. If a college or university usually allows students to use campus resources (such as auditoriums) to entertain guests, the school cannot withdraw those resources simply because students have invited a controversial speaker to campus.

       Are you trying to make the argument that Berkley had the right to not let Milo speak because because of fear of violence?  Even if the violence were to only be directed at Milo?

       I do believe Berkeley has far more responsibility to the safety of their students if the threat is real. If Milo wants to come back Berkeley will allow him, he is not banned, he is not being persecuted. But Milo is completely irrelevant right now except for people trying to claim the erosion of free speech.

       I didn't attend Berkley /Charlottesville /Boston/ etc., so i can't say with certainty what transpired, but it is my understanding that law enforcement stepped in when violence erupted which is the correct thing to do since violence isn't protected free speech. Certainly, you aren't suggesting that a group or individual be denied the right to attend a protest or state their beliefs simply because they appear to be what some may deem "intimidating"?

       I'm going to be honest and tell you I didn't listen to the story, but if someone has a rally to promote free speech and one group comes to say they are superior to others, than certainly another group can come and state a differing opinion. Seems to me two opposing groups being able to state their beliefs is exactly what a really promoting freedom of speech should be celebrating.

       This didn't happen.  The group that rallied here in Boston explicitly rejects white supremacists from free speech, because white supremacists deny free speech rights to others.

       I don't know if there were any actual white supremacists.  After all, it's a march, anyone can show up.  However, statements or signage of white supremacy were explicitly banned by the organizer and they planned to physically separate themselves from anyone who advocated white supremacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know if other racial supremacists were banned.  I suspect not, because several of the ralliers were carrying BLM signs.

       It really was just a free speech rally.  Not a rally for Nazis, nor any other shitheads espousing white supremacy.  Just free speech.

        What has the government got to do with it?
Well, considering the government is the entity that writes and enforces free speech laws in the US, I'd say that it has a lot to do with free speech. The government allows individual/group A the freedom to express their opinions without fear of reprisal from the government. It also allows individual/group B the freedom to express their opinions in opposition to the views expressed by individual/group A without fear of reprisal from the government. Group B's opposition to group A's opinion isn't opposition to free speech. It's opposition to the views expressed by group A. There is a major difference there.

       I'm sorry, but who are you against then? You don't like antifa because they speak out against nazism/white supremacy, but you support the rights or nazi/white supremacists to speak their minds exposing their beliefs that non whites should have less rights than whites? It appears to me that both groups are allowed to say how the other group sucks and that seems to be free speech.

       I don't like antifa because they use violence to intimidate, silence and shut down people they don't like. I don't like it when anyone else does that either, including white supremacists. I am against violent morons who don't respect the value of exchanging words over exchanging blows. Why are you pretending that antifa are just docile pacifists who want to have a chat?

       Against people who want to kill others(extremists) there is no point in letting them express their views or tolerating their actions. Against violent racists being neutral is not enough and you have to be antiracist.

       I guess, although I think hating non-whites is a terrible thing and maybe not as bad as being an actual nazi, but it's extremely racist.

       Being a racist doesn't make you a nazi. But being a nazi makes you a racist, it's part of the ideology.

       You'd have a point except this rally had nothing to do with extremism.  In fact, they explicitly reject white supremacists and were carrying BLM signs.

       Forget the headlines; there was a Free Speech Rally in Boston today, attended by a dozen or two right-wingers (not going to assume their specific groupings) and a few thousand counter-protesters. They were both exhibiting their freedom of speech and without any notable acts of violence I would consider the rally a success. I don't see anything today to get butthurt over.

       Yes, pretty much, but it's not just anyone who's pro-Free speech. The far-left are trying to paint anyone who attends a protest or rally for a cause they don't like as Nazis/KKK/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way it's "justified" to silence them by any means necessary, commit violence against them, doxx them because they're the equivalent of the Nazis or KKK. Meanwhile antifa are the ones running around concealing their faces, go figure.

       They passed a law to make boycotting Israel illegal, I think.

       Then they passed a law to make it illegal to criticize Muslims, last year.

       They did all that, but they also outlawed many of the Israeli Apartheid rallies and speeches at Canadian universities. Talking critically of Israel's human rights abuses became hate speech.

       Just like criticism of Islam is hate speech. Saying anything factual is considered hateful. It's amazing that people don't see it.

       I think it's more that white supremacist groups are trying to use positive messages like Free Speech and History to defend themselves, when they don't actually care about those things, and their motives are to start fights with left leaning activist groups and make themselves out to be victims fighting for a just cause. Then the President who needs their votes to maintain his position can come on and defend them, and normalize their position, further dividing the country by distracting people from the issue of the white supremacists coming together to hold rallies, to something banal like defending the first amendment. The first amendment is not under fire, the neo-nazis are, they recognize this and are trying to use terror tactics ("they're trying to take your freedom of speech away") to convince people to agree with them, and take their side.

       No. It's a common and well-known tactic white supremacists/Nazis employ. They organize political rallies and platforms with flashy names like "free speech rally," appealing to moderates and a broad base, but in actuality these events are secretly Nazi propaganda spreading in disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of many dishonest tactics the Nazis use to spread their agenda. Read up on how they infiltrate Internet discussion boards just like this one too.

       It seems like you're trying to conflate being anti-White Supremacy with being anti-Free Speech. I stand

       their right to free speech, but

       the contents of that speech. This gross generalization of all liberals as censorship fiends who "hated Nazis so much that they became them" needs to stop.

       An interesting aside is how it's not the authorities overtly attacking free speech... they've managed the average person to police their neighbors.  There is an existential void that people are filling by joining the cause of social control.  On the surface it looks like a good intentioned thing, but that's hardly the case.  Ignorantly, these SJWs are acquainted only with their motives on a superficial level.

       No, there's isn't a push by "someone" to do that. It's just that a vast amount of people below 25 right now were raised by imbeciles and don't understand the danger that comes with censoring a group of people because you don't agree with what they have to say. In their mind, Nazi ideology is evil and society as a whole can agree on that, so it makes it OK to shut down free speech for these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even a lack of logic or reasoning in the sense that they're aware that they're trying to shut down free speech for a particular group, but they just don't care and don't believe that everyone should have the ability to say whatever they want. They don't understand that it's hell of a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're the same people who believe in safe spaces and value political correctness and inclusivity above all else. They're the people who are filmed shouting at the top of their lungs at university professors because they think the university campus should be a home to them and that, as such, they should be protected from any ideas that make them uncomfortable, or seen screaming and wailing like autists at the news of Trump's election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm heavily left-leaning, but the political party that represents that in the US is rotten to the core and the kids that now associate with it are retarded and apparently completely unable of critical thinking.

       What about the rioters that destroyed private property, started fires, and assaulted people? What legal right do they have to do those things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't the Mayor owe the citizens of that city a guarantee that they are being served and protected by their police force? Why tell them to stand down? Or can he pick and choose who gets protection from tax payer funded civil servants?

       Always love when they get to the point where they run out of ideas and just start throwing out the insults and the catch phrases, I've noticed it a lot when arguing this issue here, and funny enough its almost always with the new accounts that almost exclusively post in this sub and always comment on about the same issues.

       And your tactic is to comment in this thread as much as you possibly can to make people think that whoever disagrees with yoh is a "homicidal nazi," your words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek help, seriously.  It is incredibly unhealthy to be seeing nazis everywhere.  The media has you in a tizzy and you quite obviously are not thinking straight.  Seek professional help.

       This is the organizer.  Explicitly rejects Nazis and white supremacists.  Actual march was carrying BLM signs.  But go ahead, keep believing the narrative.

       I get it. You don't like antifa. But, by denying them their right to speak out against Nazism/white supremacy, aren't you in fact being anti free speech as well?
