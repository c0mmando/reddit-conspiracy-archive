       Scientists who reject the belief of global warming or of human caused climate change are being cut from funding and work for having their own beliefs which go against the agenda being pushed by big science and government. By controlling the belief of climate change, government is able to write rules and regulations that affect the people by banning things like modes of transportation, foods, an even the amounts of electricity and water we can have access to/use. The same is also being done with the theory of evolution. Science pushes their agenda, making people believe the theory as fact when it is still unproven. Totalitarian actions to force this belief is done to deter the religious communities and direct their faith from a god and instead to a government. More and more atheists are worshiping government instead of a god. Government funding of science is slowly controlling the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pushing an agenda through science is causing more people to believe the things scientists say as fact, rather than researching for them selves. In realty most of what is being said, is only done so because the scientists and their institutions are so reliant on that government cheque.

       So you dont believe in evolution or climate change and you believe that the science that attempts to prove them is fake to push political motives? How convenient for you....

       I don't believe in human cause climate change. The earth is naturally warming, but not by human causes. As for evolution i think there is more to it then what we have. My quarrel is that government funding of the sciences is creating these things to be pushed as fact when they are still only theories. I would call it "bad science." It is akin to that of the catholic church's control over science in the renaissance era. The government is telling us what we can believe through heckling and regulation.

       I will link you the graphs and charts later when I have the time but don't be so sure on what they say. If it means they'll have a job and funding from government and other big corporations, then they'll say it.

       You don't go to school to learn;you go there to be told.....It's common knowledge that people get held down by the debts of life &amp; that includes scientists.

       The problem with all these professions are they are compartmentalized like most every other profession &amp; they will protect their lively hood even if it that means keeping half truths in the herd mindset.

       You have to use discernment to see when a science is being lead or held back....&amp; smart phones are dumbing down a generation so i wouldn't go using technology that is being held back &amp; abused as an argument......all the greatest people that have come before are those who challenged the status quo,now people that go against the herd lose everything &amp; simplifications like yours are part of the problem.

       Dont be so quickmto poopoo science.
Science works because it finds cause and effect and so predicts the future. Evidence is found when technology works in the future as it was designed in the past......like the week it took your phone to ship from China...an eternity of time from an electrons POV

       I'm not shitting on science but the control over it &amp; the fact that it has taken the place of absolution that the spiritual side of life once had...it has now become a religion in it's own right &amp; has forsaken the non material world to it's detriment.

       It hasn't become religion and hasn't taken the place of spiritualism. Science (or better, the scientific method) answers questions that spiritualism and  religion
       <em>

       It has become a religion &amp; i said it has taken the absolution part that the spiritual/religion side once had,ie.science thinks it is the end of the road fact just like the church once controlled the absolute facts.

       I agree, religion did the same until just a few hundred years ago. Today religion shouldn't answer questions like how old is the Earth, how does it look like, or where did humans come from, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method is not a scam, it's the system of critical thinking. And of course there are questions that science can't answer today, like what is the soul, what is beyond our observable universe or what happens to us after death.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why they are complement each other.

       Agreed,Religion should not answer questions like how old the earth is but the Texts from the past should not be confused with the religious institutions that cropped up to corrupt those texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is not a scam &amp; has done great things for us but it is now hampered by a society that is hampered themselves because of imaginary debt,politicians that strip freedoms &amp; education that fosters non thinking consumers over imaginative minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to question in the science community has always been met with unwarranted aggression from supposed great minds of a time &amp; they nearly always end up eating their words but usually years later after deaths of 1 or both of the minds at odds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been granted the time to study freely for the last few years in all field that interest me &amp; have a wider view of subjects then education would ever let. I seethe corruption in all fields &amp; the blindness of people to the mistakes that play out generation after generation.....science at the moment has it's nose up it's own arse &amp; combined with the education system will lead us to a dark world.

       If it keeps the money rolling in they will say it. This is why we will never see a cure for aids or cancer, etc. Why make them pay one price to cure it all when you can charge them for pills to keep it subtle.

       I look towards modern humans for this. We have so many things left on our body that we say are useless. So if that is the case why haven't we lost them in evolution? If pinky toes and body hair are supposedly useless then why haven't we lost them? If the theory applies to every other creature except modern humans then there is surely something we are still missing.

       What makes you think humans are currently at a perfect end state of our evolution where every outdated feature has to be removed? These not-needed body-traits are actually a sign that we did evolve from a state where our ancestor species did need them.

       You have the polluters funding organisations like the Heartland Institute to produce journals that have no scientific validity which are supposedly peer reviewed by the likes of Lord Monkton.
Who would you rather believe, scientists would produce work that is peer reviewed by experts in their field or the big energy companies pouring millions into stopping any action on man made Global Warming.

       You have to use discernment to see when a science is being lead or held back....&amp; smart phones are dumbing down a generation so i wouldn't go using technology that is being held back &amp; abused as an argument......all the greatest people that have come before are those who challenged the status quo,now people that go against the herd lose everything &amp; simplifications like yours are part of the problem.

       I'm not shitting on science but the control over it &amp; the fact that it has taken the place of absolution that the spiritual side of life once had...it has now become a religion in it's own right &amp; has forsaken the non material world to it's detriment.

       It has become a religion &amp; i said it has taken the absolution part that the spiritual/religion side once had,ie.science thinks it is the end of the road fact just like the church once controlled the absolute facts.
