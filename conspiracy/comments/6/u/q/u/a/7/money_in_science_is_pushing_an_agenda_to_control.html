        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Scientists who reject the belief of global warming or of human caused climate change are being cut from funding and work for having their own beliefs which go against the agenda being pushed by big science and government. By controlling the belief of climate change, government is able to write rules and regulations that affect the people by banning things like modes of transportation, foods, an even the amounts of electricity and water we can have access to/use. The same is also being done with the theory of evolution. Science pushes their agenda, making people believe the theory as fact when it is still unproven. Totalitarian actions to force this belief is done to deter the religious communities and direct their faith from a god and instead to a government. More and more atheists are worshiping government instead of a god. Government funding of science is slowly controlling the populace.</p>

<p>Pushing an agenda through science is causing more people to believe the things scientists say as fact, rather than researching for them selves. In realty most of what is being said, is only done so because the scientists and their institutions are so reliant on that government cheque. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in human cause climate change. The earth is naturally warming, but not by human causes. As for evolution i think there is more to it then what we have. My quarrel is that government funding of the sciences is creating these things to be pushed as fact when they are still only theories. I would call it &quot;bad science.&quot; It is akin to that of the catholic church&#39;s control over science in the renaissance era. The government is telling us what we can believe through heckling and regulation.</p>

Science works because it finds cause and effect and so predicts the future. Evidence is found when technology works in the future as it was designed in the past......like the week it took your phone to ship from China...an eternity of time from an electrons POV</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, religion did the same until just a few hundred years ago. Today religion shouldn&#39;t answer questions like how old is the Earth, how does it look like, or where did humans come from, etc.</p>

<p>The scientific method is not a scam, it&#39;s the system of critical thinking. And of course there are questions that science can&#39;t answer today, like what is the soul, what is beyond our observable universe or what happens to us after death.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they are complement each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed,Religion should not answer questions like how old the earth is but the Texts from the past should not be confused with the religious institutions that cropped up to corrupt those texts.</p>

<p>Science is not a scam &amp; has done great things for us but it is now hampered by a society that is hampered themselves because of imaginary debt,politicians that strip freedoms &amp; education that fosters non thinking consumers over imaginative minds.</p>

<p>The power to question in the science community has always been met with unwarranted aggression from supposed great minds of a time &amp; they nearly always end up eating their words but usually years later after deaths of 1 or both of the minds at odds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been granted the time to study freely for the last few years in all field that interest me &amp; have a wider view of subjects then education would ever let. I seethe corruption in all fields &amp; the blindness of people to the mistakes that play out generation after generation.....science at the moment has it&#39;s nose up it&#39;s own arse &amp; combined with the education system will lead us to a dark world.</p>
