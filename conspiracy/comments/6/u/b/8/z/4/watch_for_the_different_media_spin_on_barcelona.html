       There are a lot of anti-Trumpers around here who still think they're getting straight news and no bias when they watch the news or read "respected" newspapers online, so this should be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch how the media covers the Barcelona attack compared to Charlottesville. They will play down this latest attack as often as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will say it's an isolated incident, and that you shouldn't panic or jump to conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will tell you how you're more likely to be killed by your own bathtub than a terrorist attack (a CNN specialty that they conveniently forgot to mention after Charlottesville).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they will spin this story in the complete opposite way that they did with Charlottesville.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit: Updates below from ~12 hours after the first attack - it's still early, but it's already taking shape. Like I said in one of my replies to a comment: wait until the "breaking news" part of the story cools down, and then they will come out with their prepared spin as always. But at this point it looks like they're going to basically ignore the whole story in favor of statue talk.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         CNN: Wolf Blitzer wondering if it was a copycat of Charlottesville, despite vehicle attacks being so common around the world recently. He tries to be clever and almost attempts to phrase it as a question (that nobody is asking):
         <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/898283533029982208">

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Twitter: 12 hours after the first terrorist attack, the top trend is about Tina Fey doing some kind of anti-Trump stunt on SNL. Very shocking stuff. Fascinating... SNL and semi-celebrities talking shit about Trump. They're so brave. More interesting and timely conversations abound in the 2nd most popular trend: #BadThriftShopNames. 3rd: a football player did something with a football. 4th: #NewEmojiMeanings. 5th: #ProjectRunway. 6th: #InsteadOfGettingMad. 7th: Cambrils (the location of the second terrorist attack).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         New York Times: 6 tweets in 1 hour about people who have a long commute to work each day (yes, really). Too many to bother counting that are about statues and whatnot. Article about leaders from Germany,
         <strong>
          Iran
         </strong>
         , Israel, and so on, attacking Trump for how he condemned the Charlottesville attack:

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Washington Post: Again, endless talk about statues. Something about Captain America punching Nazis (yes, the comic book character). Two tweets over 10 hours about the terrorist attacks in Spain. One is a bland statement of deaths/injuries, motive unclear, etc. Other tweet comes 6 hours after that, about an "apparent attempt at a terror attack in Cambrils." No hysterics. No tears. Just a sterile recollection of police reports.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Politico: More statues. People condemn racism. Trump's mental health. Pointing out that no White House officials have resigned over Charlottesville (not sure why they thought they would, but okay). Scrolling down... "Catalonia has declared three days of mourning". Again, bland, sterile, completely lacking in hysterics. Bannon and Breitbart stuff. Scrolling down again... only the 2nd tweet in 8 hours about the terrorist attacks in Spain: "In Barcelona, 13 people were killed and more than 50 injured. Police "are treating this as a terrorist attack." You get the idea by now, right? Quotes from police. Numbers. No tears or hyperbole.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Hill: Statues. People condemn racism. People condemn Trump. Michael Moore saying Trump is going to get us all killed. A dating website banned a white supremacist. A Democrat thinks he's going to get Trump impeached. Jimmy Kimmel reads mean tweets (more brave, innovative stuff). More statues. Al Gore thinks Trump should resign. A couple of bland, lifeless tweets about the terrorist attacks in Spain. Scrolling down... the cycle repeats as they repost the above (more statues too).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Daily Kos: Only one tweet about the terrorist attack, which leads to their article attacking Trump for condemning the terrorist attack. No other tweets about it from this "news" website.

       I bet they will cover it as a separate attack by different people for different reasons in another country. They probably won't even mention Soros.

       Of course they'll skew it differently. What intrigues me here is that so many different factions have resorted to the same tactic. Unless there's some third party that's decided to do this in excess. Or it's an MKUltra plot being triggered.

       "Would" is one of the key words here. "Watch for", "they will", are some others. This implies I'm making a prediction, based on past events.

       The point is that they weren't making comparisons like this for Charlottesville, were they? Less than 2 months later and they completely forgot about all of the murderous bathtubs lurking in your homes. That's literally the whole point of this post... the difference in the spin they put on events. It's not about whether bathtubs technically do kill more than terrorists or not.

       It's not like I'm predicting earthquakes here, but okay... do I  need to put a time limit on it, then? Three days. Obviously I think it will be less, because in three days they won't even be talking about this (unlike Charlottesville), but I'll give myself some extra time because I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: the point of mentioning the CNN killer bathtub story is that they made no such comparisons after Charlottesville. They wouldn't dare try to deflect attention from such a prized story with comical alternate death scenarios like that.

       They do say that, but they still make the comparison when they wouldn't dare put out a headline like that for Charlottesville. It's not a great example though. I will come back to this later and see if I can find the other examples I was thinking of. That's the one I immediately found.

       3 days after 7+ terrorists killed and injured citizens from 34 different countries in Spain... and what is more important in the news today? Charlottesville, where 1 person killed 1 person over a week ago.

       That isn't the prediction you made. You can't just change it to be more generic after the fact. You made very specific predictions, that the MSM would play it down as an isolated incident, that they will say that there is no reason to panic over it and that you are more likely to die in a bathtub. This hasn't happened, they have widely reported on the organized terrorism behind the attack, they haven't tried to claim it as an isolated incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you are basically saying that "They will talk more about Charlottesville than this". Well duh, of course they will. US media will always talk more about US incidents. Read papers from Europe and the roles are reversed. In fact, look at a current example. 1000+ people have died in floodings in India, Bangladesh and Nepal over the last few days but all US media is reporting on the Houston floodings, nothing about Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you really meaning to say that you predicted the US media will talk more about US events than events in other countries?

       And I was never being specific to US media. Around the world they were talking about statues and Nazis more than they talked about what happened in Spain. Just yesterday, the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris had a cartoon of "Nazis" drowning in Texas as their front cover.

      <p>
       I updated the original post 12 hours or so after the attack with some examples, so you can see a little bit of what was happening already at that time. I won't be going back through 10 days of old news now to find more examples for you of how the MSM creates their own narrative, hypes some stories while letting others slide, just to further their own agenda. You're just going to need to pay attention.

       That was not the prediction that you initially made and that I objected to. You said that that the MSM would play it down as an isolated incident, that they will say that there is no reason to panic over it and that you are more likely to die in a bathtub. What you are now claiming is something you said later and I never objected to. You broadened it to say that "in three days they won't even be talking about this (unlike Charlottesville)". There is a good reason why I didn't even bother responding to the claim: It is so vague and broad that you can use litteraly anything to say that you are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You predicted X and are now trying to claim that you simply predicted Y (which, you did also, later. And no one objected to that prediction). It is like saying the moon is made of swiss cheese and when people challenge you on your claims, you say it has a lot of craters. Then claim that you are right all along. You made specific predictions in your post which none of your edits even attempt to validate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you are probably the worst I have ever seen at providing examples. First your bathtub story which completely went against your own narrative that the media wanted to downplay terrorist attacks (ffs, have you even read the article yet) and now this? Charlie Hebdo is a satirical magazine, it is not a news source. Look at for example BBC and search for "Charlottesville" and "Barcelona". The latest article about Charlottesville was a week ago, Barcelona is still being discussed. But none of this matter; it is not the prediction you made, so stop trying to muddy the water.

       You're a very literal person, aren't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The prediction was all about what kind of spin they would put on the Barcelona story compared to Charlottesville. It was never about quoting exact phrases they would use in the future. Just a general "atmosphere" of reporting, so yes, of course it was vague. Like I said, I'm not predicting earthquakes here.

      <p>
       I'm afraid you may have bought in to the Nazi hysteria, and you may even side with Wolf Blitzer in the example provided. In that case, there's nothing you could see that would change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think back to the Dallas police shootings last year. 5 dead cops and 9 injured. Did the MSM dig deep in to that story? Did they go on and on about how Micah Xavier Johnson explicitly stated that he wanted to kill white people? Did they talk about his connections to "Black Power" groups and BLM in particular? Did they endlessly replay videos of BLM activists chanting about killing police? I don't think they did any of that...

       Fake news, fake politicians, fake virtue-signaling idiots, fake anti-fascists, will not make one mention out of this because it collapses their whole narrative.

       These people live in an artificial, inverted-reality that bends the truth to fit their narrative and anything that goes against it is castigated, ridiculed, and then marked for censorship and eventually complete removal.

      <p>
       This is real. More than a dozen people have died. It's not happened to deter focus away from other situations and will be reported in the media as it should be - a disgusting terrorist attack.

       It was both sides! We saw an armed brawl between two rival groups. Both sides are clearly responsible for this political violence. He called out the lone individual who took it too far. No different than what Obama did everytime this happened.

       Stopping Nazis by attacking journalists, women who wear "Make Bitcoin Great Again", white men because they "look like a white supremacist", and innocent people with bike locks to the head. Stopping Nazis by being violent towards people who had a legal right to protest, no matter how vile their ideas are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stopping Nazis using funds that come from a literal Nazi. Stopping Nazis by setting fire to Berkeley. Fighting fascism by using violence against political ideas they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep telling yourself that their violence is okay. I'm going to keep laughing when you're dumb founded that the violence is only escalating.
