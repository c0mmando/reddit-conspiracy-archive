       It's the liberal left  vs the "white supremacists and Nazi apologists" now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might ask, what makes you a nazi or a nazi symp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a conservative.  Being white.  If you lean more right politically.  Not agreeing with Michael Moore.  Not loving all the celebs coming out and crying and telling us what to think.  FOR SURE if you support our President Trump...you are a mega nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legit, if you have opinions and can think for yourself...it's over.  You are a nazi. They said so.  Guilt by association.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also need to point out that they are using a poison the well tactic and calling for THIS SUB and anything that isnt left to be shut down.  They point out that some posters on this sub have racist views and or are white supremacist.  I hate to break it to the children here, but people get to have any opinion that they want.  You can stop ideas.  You cant stop 'mean things' from existing in reality.  This nut-bag fantasy will not work.  We should shun racist views and just ignore them.  No need to shove it everyones face and go out of your way to find the WORSE in people and show it off all day.  If you are a nazi, piss off.  Ignore them.  We need to build a better society and it starts with us at the individual level.

       It's such a weird hypothetical.  If I walk down my street waving a Nazi flag people are going to think I'm a Nazi.  If I walk down the street waving a Texas flag they are going to think I'm Texan.  If I walk down the street waving a Roman flag my neighbors are going to have to Google that shit.  Pretty simple.

       OP is not whining. Conservatives are being labeled as Nazis. Also, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube are banning Conservatives just for supporting Trump.

       When they start to ban and censor you, then you will understand. Until then, you won't wake up.

       I'm not trying to be mean, but he must be playing dumb.  No way you can not see whats happening.  Its actually great when everyone has their own perspective on things.  That's how we discuss and learn from each other. We don't all have to exactly agree...but that is why the left is getting...weird.  They are basically saying "you are with us...or with the terrorists"

       I think Facebook responds to reports a bit heavy-handedly, and I certainly wouldn't use a social media platform expecting never to be censored, but they did apologize and unban her.

       I don't use facebook. The only reason they apologized was because she was a well known, popular figure for Conservatives. But they ban regular people all the time, and don't unban them, all for supporting Trump. That is just wrong.

       If this is true, I shouldn't be able to find any Trump supporters on Facebook right?

       Or is it possible that many people are banned from Facebook each day due to Facebook's ridiculous community standards rules, and some of those people happen to support Trump?

       Anyone who doesn't go out of their way to discourage and separate themselves from Nazis is getting labeled a Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nazis feel comfortable coming to your rally, then you are a Nazi sympathizer. It's easy to figure out. If conservatives want to distance themselves from Nazis, they need to actively keep them out of their rallies.

      </p>

       This is incredible. Let me break it down for you again, since you don't seem to be very good at this: My
       <em>
        explicit
       </em>
       point was that your
       <em>
        implicit
       </em>
       point was a straw man. Then you turn around to imply that I somehow stumbled into your point as opposed to explicitly calling that point out as a diversion from the comment above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to summarize:
       <strong>
        Nobody was saying that there are non-racist Nazis.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the hell did you write this:

       There are only two possibilities here. Either you are having a legitimate failure at the level of ~4th grade logical faculties, or you are trying to slip away after deliberately twisting this thread. I lean towards the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will break it down for you anyway. You know how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares? It's almost like that. All Nazis are racist, but not all racists are Nazis. This is all he said. He said that Nazis stand for more than just racist views. As in, yes, they stand for racist views, but they also stand for
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       , such as using fascistic government power to achieve racist goals. To say it another way, standing for racist views is not the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       defining characteristic of a Nazi, because Nazism is a whole political ideology that
       <em>
        includes
       </em>
       racist views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's try it with math: The Nazis are a proper subset of the racists. There's nothing controversial about this.

       The democratic media complex has said Trump is supporting nazis through dog whistling . CNN and Reddit have compared everyone who was on the side of keep the statue as Nazis. r/pics said these guys fought nazis without a permit. Your answers are dismissing everything going on in MSM and onlkne

       Don Lemon amongst multiple pundits. Maxine Waters , 3/4ths of r/politics are calling Trump and his supporters Nazis or White supremacist.
      </p>
      <p>
       How have you missed multiple media sources claiming President Trump did not disavow the white supremacist? How have you missed people being doxxed as racist for being for the statue. r/pics had 34k upvotes when i saw for a picture of the beaches of Normandy and it was titled these guys fought nazis without a permit (comparing them to the protesters against the statues. Throughout the msm and online communities peolle are called white supremacist or nazis because they are standinf up for historical monuments.

       I don't have cable. And I don't live or die based on op-eds about Trump. I go outside sometimes.

       Anyway, that's not calling Trump a Nazi, that's asking why he didn't denounce Nazis.

       You'll have to be more specific, I've seen all kinds of doxxing in the past week. From 4chan/this very sub doxxing an innocent kid from Michigan for the attack, to then claiming the attack was a Jewish plot when the kid turns out not to have committed the attack, to doxxings of white supremacists who marched in public in support of white nationalism. You'll have to narrow down which doxxing perturbs you.

       don't be obtuse, they may have claimed it about the statue, but then they walked around chanting nazi propaganda slogans and calling for ethnic cleansing.

       if you JUST cared about that statue, and were NOT a white supremecist, wouldn't you GTFO once you realized you were surrounded by people chanting "blood and soil," "jews will not replace us," and LITERALLY waving nazi flags?

       Which investigation? Are you still looking forward to Jason Chaffetz next investigation to prove she did nothing wrong? Your guy won, congratulations, and every day he embarrasses himself and this country more and more.

       I don't know what the fuck you're talking about but the nut job is the one still on about Hillary's investigations when they investigated her multiple times and found no wrongdoing. Regardless, she lost last November, she is no longer relevant. There is no "script" here, only facts, and if facts upset you that much maybe you should take a good hard look at yourself.

       Well in this last week the President of the US has failed to outright condemn Neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Hillary Clinton's political career is also over seeing as how she lost the election 9 months ago and is irrelevant. Now if you have some new information feel free to enlighten us, otherwise I don't see why she's being brought up.

       You sort of give a shit, you responded.  If you can't see that he was using Hillary as a counter to Trump, as a point of comparison, then I don't know what to tell you.
       <br/>
       Michael Moore says that if I support Trump, I'm a racist.  He supports Hillary, so why am I not allowed to bring that up in response to that specific remark?  Do you honestly fail to see the logical argument there?

       There is a world outside of politics and I'd advise you do your best to see it. You are clearly frustrated over some random comment on the internet that wasn't directed towards you. Between being First Lady and Secretary of State she hasn't been given nearly as much power as a senator or president, so the logic is extremely flawed there. But keep trying!

       Oh I completely understand how when the current president has turned out to be the biggest embarrassment this nation has ever seen, we want to point fingers and say "but but but her emails! She was under investigation!" But the election is over, Hillary Clinton lost. She is no longer relevant to the current state of US politics, including but not limited to Trump's inability to distance himself from Neo-Nazi's and white supremacists. This sub used to have good content before it turned it T_D Jr. and it's because of people like the original commenter I replied to adding nothing. Instead of engaging in a conversation on the topic, they're bringing up Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton as if that is somehow relevant and/ or disputes the original post. Clinton was a terrible candidate, I didn't want to vote for her, but she was infinitely better than the shitshow Trump has become only a few months into his presidency, and nothing Hillary did is relevant to the fact that Trump's presidency and lack of leadership have allowed white supremacists to march in our streets, chanting anti-Semitic messages and brandishing Nazi paraphernalia. And whether you like it or not, if you continue to support Donald Trump, you support the racism and xenophobia that he is encouraging (whether it is directly or indirectly.)

       McCain is a serving US Senator and currently relevant to our political system. Hillary Clinton lost the election and is irrelevant. He supported Hillary. Hillary is no longer running or relevant. Regardless you're allowed to say whatever you want and everyone else will laugh at you for continuing to bring up a failed presidential candidate that hasn't been relevant since November 7th of 2016 instead of a substantial argument. If you wanted to say "well Trump did call out the Nazi's and white supremacists, but you just don't like how he went about it." That would be substantial because it is actual relevant to the topic at hand.

       Why do you even care enough to make more comments that say:

       "Why is everyone still talking about Hillary"

       I get to see this exact 'girl in the red dress' image on this board til the end of my days. It's like people can't fathom that the two most unpopular candidates surprisingly have a lot of staying power when they turn their campaigns into hate filled grudge matches, which literally had articles saying how this election was breaking up families and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is anyone surprised anymore?

       Ludwig Von Mises makes a pretty damn good case for it.  I know it's an inconvenient set of facts for people in the present time who are seeking similar policies.  And that isn't to say that all Socialism is literally Nazis, that would intellectually dishonest.  However socialist policies DO tend to remove certain protections of individual liberty as deemed necessary for any collectivist society to function, the individual must be devalued against the whole.  And further down that road you are a step closer to actual fascism which then only needs a populist movement or a critical shift in balance of the political forces acting upon the society for public sentiments to allow for the "losing side" of that balance to be subjected to a feedback loop of ever increasing marginalization and eventually legal oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's easier to just point and laugh at such arguments than to do any actual reading or self reflection.

       Just did some quick back-of-the-envelope math, and it looks like whoever made the posted image didn't include Hispanic in the 'White' statistic, which the FBI does.
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers in that, except for the black-on-black violence, are a bit off. However, I don't think reposting a single infographic makes one a disseminator of fascist propaganda.

       The numbers were off by 500 percent, as the other poster pointed out. And the infographic was created and spread by an openly neo-Nazi, so yes it most certainly is a case of Donald Trump spreading white supremacist propaganda

       Seems to be a bit ignorant to think that, either that or you're just projecting.  Regardless you can find countless evidence to support the fact that poverty breeds crime, and thats without adding our corrupt penal system and the racist war on drugs on top of that.

       Yes I agree it's a very nuanced issue, but the graphic Trump shared was neither well-sourced nor accurate. In fact the numbers were all totally fake, exaggerated by 1,000 percent in some instances.

       how exactly do you determine who is a nazi?  Self identification only?  Or is it anyone who questions how affirmative action is working, people who support school choice, people who support little to no limitation on speech.

       The people marching in Charlottesville were
       <strong>
        literal Nazis
       </strong>
       waving Nazi flags, wearing Nazi regalia, making Nazi salutes and repeating Nazi slogans like "blood and soil".

      <p>
       It's beyond dispute that they're Nazis; the only question is how far can the mental gymnastics of people like you extend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you go educate yourself; the people marching in Charlottesville were openly Nazi, and it's logically consistent to label them (and their apologists) as Nazis.

       The left isn't associating white supremacy with the right. The white supremacists are associating themselves with the right, because so many of their ideas, no matter how extreme, align with the less extreme ideas of the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason that they feel so safe under the same umbrella as trump supporters and the rest of the right. And it's because the president himself has been so extraordinarily weak in opposing nazi's and the like. Sad.

       The media is sowing those divides for the most part. Trump is just not precise with his language and appears not to be aware of the various ways his words can be spun around when he's saying them. His ego is too big, so he won't allow everything he says to be put through a filter. He needs a team of people to reword all of the shit he thinks up. That's politics 101. If the media don't like you, they can put you through a gauntlet. It's best not to give them any room to interpret your speech in a way that allows you to boost ratings.

       I think Trump is smart and everything is on purpose. Not condeming the Nazis is the same as when he didn't say "Jews" on holocaust day and took heat. There's a strategy to paint these Zionists as the opposite.

       Trump has been disavowing the KKK, David Duke, etc over and over over. He disavows them on Twitter, he disavows them at Press conferences, he disavows them on TV. I'm not recomending that you read through Trump's twitter (seriously, don't), by the problem here is that you very likely have not checked to see if the media is misleading you. When they say "Trump has not disavowed X, Y, and Z," they are lying to you.

       I don't watch mainstream news, nor do I read it. My opinions are based on my own merit. I've lived in a small rural town my whole life, I've seen racism. I hear white use the N word like it's a comma all the time. And while trump isn't dropping the n word in his twitter feed, he still exhibits racist tendencies through his actions, or inactions rather, involving helping race relations in this country. He wants only division.

       Your entitled to your own opinion.  Ill disagree.  You had a personal experience with the story.  You heard white use the n word, but that doesnt mean shit. The ONLY thing yoou can take away from that would be that the small area your from has racism.  Or rather that group at least found it okay and acceptable to use the n word.  They probably also used a lot of fowl language all together.  But again it means nothing.  You told that story only as a leg up in the conversation and as ammo to help the case that Americans have a racism problem.  I completely disagree.  America is the MOST accepting of all cultures.  Period. And the comment about trump is guilty of being racist because yoy can tell he"exhibits racist tendencies through his actions or in actions" is insane. Thats not a thing.  Unless you have professor x mind powers, how the hell can you spew that nonsense.  Yoy can be guilty of precrime.  This aint minority report. Insane. You might as well say trumps a witch and we have to burn him to find out if were right...

       You have a point. Trump is for the white man and hard working legal Mexicans , his actions don't really seem to reflect a president that wants true equality and freedom of speech and true American values , but however,
What president has been a true patriot to the American people?
Seems like for a long time we've been sold down the river over and over. Trump had some semblance as a outsider  that might change business as usual , seems to me he hasn't still getting into fights and the war on drugs , etc.  MAYBE he's misguided , but I doubt it. 
The left seems to want to kill freedom of speech and they blanket all speech as hate speech  and that fucks with me heavy. 
I feel as if the right isnt gonna fuck with my guns (if And when i own one) and they arnt going to blanket call my speech racist and want it banned , if we don't defend the despicable speech then who will defend your ideas when it becomes despicable. 
I'm just worried I'll be living in 1984 more than we already do.

       Using terms like "THE LEFT" "THE RIGHT"
is just helping the elite crush us all into predefined boxes that they choose....which they have done with the Democrat VS Republican false dichotomy.
We are not give minded.
There is NO "the left" "the right".
These are made up entities.
To say "the left" is implying Bernie supporters,
because Clinton is a false leftists, a NEOliberal anti-worker warmonger.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't the only problems.
But left vs right is as simplistic as
big gov vs small gov,
tax vs no tax.
If you simplify everything like this, 
you only fuel stupidity/low IQ discussion in the population and keep forcing divide/conquer propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is NO "the left" "the right".
Saying something like "Clinton supporters",
fine, that's tangible.
But she's not a left winger, she only pretends to be.

       I don't like Trump for many reasons. It's not because think 'the wall is racist'. It's not because I am 'against protecting borders'. It's not because I want 'unrestricted immigration'. It's not because I am 'a globalist who doesn't care about putting your own country first'. It definitely is not because I am a 'libcuck Hillary shill who thinks what the LAMEstream media tells me to think'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to be able to like Trump, but his policies are garbage, the Republican party had garbage policies. None of the policies make sense when you consider the objectives they want, and they have fucked up priorities when it comes to what they consider 'real issues'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like Trump for many reasons, but policy is, and will always be the first one. Every sentence I have mentioned here that started with 'It's not because...' I have been called what followed in quotation marks when I criticise his policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you think only the 'left' over-labels people for their views, just remember that when people try to discuss cost vs benefits of this wall over alternatives such as going after people that hire illegal immigrants, the 'right' accuses these people of calling the wall racist or accuses these people of not caring about illegal immigration.

       Yeah that's not true.  I am pretty left of centre when it comes to social issues and no lefties i know struggle with the difference between the fascist fringes and those on the right who just are not acknowledging them.. it is why they end up calling conservatives idiots... because in their minds you are ignoring the vile creatures in your midst. White supremacists have always been around of course but definately in this election cycle they have been accepted back into the right mainstream.

       The media is pushing them back into the mainstream. They've been around and had their rallies forever and up until recently people mostly ignored them, because they are a fringe group of weirdos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now though, the media has such a hard on to discredit Trump that they are willing to give fucking nazis and white supremacists air time just to make Trump and his supporters look bad.

       The media in general tell their customers what it is they want to hear about the world.  If it is not doing that then you will find a new news source, this is the true power and weakness of a free press and is why events will follow a totally different narrative for the two of us.  The true issue with the media as far as I'm concerned is that people are not really taught how to use it responsibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump used in no way veiled rhetoric during the campaign that people accross the spectrum including those who explicitly study nazis said was dangerous and could empower white supremacist factions. As a customer of the media outlets i use i wanted to know about that and would have moved to using a different news source if they had not told me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he is president i want to know what is going on with the white supremacists because that is of great concern to me and again the news sources i follow are happy to oblige.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going after the media is a red herring is what i am saying, if you want people to shut up about nazis then conservatives need to convince liberals that they need not worry about it. At the moment the message felt by many is that conservatives hate liberals more than they hate literal nazis so the 'they side with nazis' narrative is an easy one to accept.

       No.  If you disagree with disagreeing with the nazis, you're taking the side of the nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of room between the "not siding with nazis" threshold and the left.  I think it's pretty reasonable that most people on the right should pretty easily find a home there.  And if you do, you won't get called out for "siding with nazis".
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you're defending overt racism.  Because that's what it was.  Everybody around the world could see it for what it was.  Practically the only people (in significant numbers) who couldn't were Americans, and more specifically, Trump-voting Americans.  You're unique in that regard.  You're the only significant group of people who are defending it.  As if it were a full-time job.  And it's fucking disgusting to EVERYBODY ELSE.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're asking us to overlook that and NOT point out you're justifying the obscene.  Just ignore it?  Yeah nah - go fuck yourselves anyone who thinks they're owed that.

       I've been dealing with this for quite a while now.  As a white straight male in the US I can't say anything to disagree with any group without being labeled racist, misogynist, homophobic, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I agree with them, but I can totally see how the extreme right wing groups have surfaced to take on the fight and gaining in popularity.  Suppress a group's right to speak their opinion long enough and there will be revolt.

       I'm not trying to be mean, but he must be playing dumb.  No way you can not see whats happening.  Its actually great when everyone has their own perspective on things.  That's how we discuss and learn from each other. We don't all have to exactly agree...but that is why the left is getting...weird.  They are basically saying "you are with us...or with the terrorists"

       Don't conflate liberals with leftists. Pro-individual liberty is not what Marxists, Communists, and Socialists stand for, they are for the absolute power of the state and the tyranny of the majority.

       Anyone who doesn't go out of their way to discourage and separate themselves from Nazis is getting labeled a Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nazis feel comfortable coming to your rally, then you are a Nazi sympathizer. It's easy to figure out. If conservatives want to distance themselves from Nazis, they need to actively keep them out of their rallies.

       McCain is a serving US Senator and currently relevant to our political system. Hillary Clinton lost the election and is irrelevant. He supported Hillary. Hillary is no longer running or relevant. Regardless you're allowed to say whatever you want and everyone else will laugh at you for continuing to bring up a failed presidential candidate that hasn't been relevant since November 7th of 2016 instead of a substantial argument. If you wanted to say "well Trump did call out the Nazi's and white supremacists, but you just don't like how he went about it." That would be substantial because it is actual relevant to the topic at hand.
