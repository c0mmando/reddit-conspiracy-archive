<p>You claim psychic ability and the right to think and react for others. Despite the car being shows attacked literally before acceleration, and despite the prior damage to the car as it enters the video.</p>

<p>You are eager to blame despite contrary evidence of reasonable doubt. Your narrative is what is important to you. </p>

The Nazi term is meant to be pejorative. These people seriously believe they are better than others completely due to their race. If you didn&#39;t see the VICE news episode I recommend it. They sent a blonde girl in to follow the American white supremacists. They advocate for violence, they want violence but they can&#39;t start it.</p>

<p>&quot;Terrorists&quot; is just a loaded political talking point, anyway.  It&#39;s a tool used by manipulators, to demonize their opponents.  Sure, some terrorists are real, but the label is overused, to the point of being meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to argue with them. They are a very small portion of America who can do very little damage. What can give them power and allow them the ability to do significant damage? Counter-protestors attack them. A group who claims to be against fascism yet attack anyone who disagrees with them. Associating everyone who protests removing a statue or changing a school name ($50,000-75,000 in Oklahoma which has no money to spare), or even just wants to let a guest speaker speak at a college campus makes them appear to have numbers and power. The best way to get your point across (I&#39;ve said this for BLM aswell), is don&#39;t become the violent group. Don&#39;t burn down half the city in protest. It&#39;s only a matter of time before some Antifa get shot in self defense by someone whose car they attacked, or who was there to simply oppose the removal of a statue of a historic person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are wrong. If this had simply been a bunch of nationalists / nazis protesting the removal of a historical monument, it would have been tasteless, sure, but peaceful. The leftist nazis initiated the violence. These people, the white supremacists, have been here all along. From time to time they march, but they have not, for the most part, been violent. BLM, and ANTIFA, however, have existed only a short time, and have been extremely violent and destructive.

<p>honestly people like you just make me really sad, i pray for people like you everyday, whatever it was in your upbringing that made you racist, maybe it was your parents, maybe it was a teacher or coach, maybe you were always scared of learning more about others cultures and it was just easier for you to shut yourself off, whatever the reason i pray for people like you everyday, one day you will be forced into a situation you dont want to be in with people that you dont &quot;like&quot; and i hope you come out on the other side being just a little more sympathetic to others, you know all those problems you have in your day to day? we all have them too, ALL OF US HAVE THEM</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be a one or the other. Stop trying to get people to pick sides with two groups they don&#39;t want to be sided with. I personally don&#39;t like either group and think both they&#39;re actions were deplorable. Baseball bats and bike chains to a &quot;counter-protest&quot;? No they came to fight. Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be shouting &quot;punch a Nazi&quot;. And the neo-Nazi group showed up with guns, shields, and some melee weapons too. Nobody in either group came there to &quot;peacefully&quot; protest. They came to fight.</p>

<p>People have the right to assembly and can legally go about protesting and get peaceful stuff done rather well, and it has been done rather well in the past. However, this shit is littered with all kinds of stuff going wrong. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t choose either side, I pick my own team. Which is the side of individual&#39;s rights that I don&#39;t want taken away from anyone for selfish reasons of not losing my own. </p>

<p>So instead of trying to win some ideology battle, why not just use the law like an American?</p>

<p>What? I saw people with bats looking for and finding a fight. You exhibit the warped logic sweeping this country right now. Evidently since the alt right brought shields (which they obviously were correct in predicting they needed them), the Antifa people were forced into hitting them with bats (even though their main political slogan is to assault &quot;fascists&quot;). So the Antifa people are the real victims, right?</p>

<p>I get it. You really hate the alt right. I don&#39;t like them either. But it&#39;s quite amazing the pretzel logic being engaged in here. </p>

<p>prop up the straw man that the Right is violently assaulting and killng innocent people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it a strawman, when a group of people carry arms and engage in hate speech directed towards fellow citizens?</p>

<p>As someone who appreciates the ACLU&#39;s defense of a neo-nazi&#39;s group&#39;s right to march, I believe we all have a right to our views.<br/>
But they were carrying arms, and even the ACLU can&#39;t get behind that.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t a strawman, and I say that as someone who quit the democratic party last year, and agrees that the media has been corrupted and is biased.</p>

<p>In this case, the response from the general public is genuine and legitimate, and no one should stand behind armed hate groups.  </p>

They assaulted women who weren&#39;t even facing them.  They assaulted people who were unconscious on the ground.  <strong>They</strong> are the ones bringing violence into our political debate.</p>

<p>Yet it is a <strong>tool</strong> for violence.  You can&#39;t build houses with a gun.  You can&#39;t fry an egg with a gun.  It has only one purpose.  And if you carry it on a city street, you also aren&#39;t using it for hunting (unless people are your game).</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t taken a stand on gun-issues.  But if you don&#39;t think that people feel threatened when they see angry men with guns spouting hate speech, I don&#39;t know what planet you are on.</p>

<p>Look, as someone who voted for Stein and quit the democratic party last year, I completely understand your frustration with the media&#39;s coverage of <em>anything</em> this past year.  It&#39;s been propaganda, as far as I can see.</p>

<p>But, when men carry guns and spew hate, you can&#39;t spin that.  Many of us are having reactions to that event <em>despite</em> the biased media.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s because I don&#39;t defend the use of violence to stifle their free speech.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t justified the behavior of Antifa, and don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>But if we are going to talk about what humans typically do in certain situations, the alt-right group needs to understand that their embrace of hate and their use of guns is going to <em>attract</em> a response from people with passions that are equal to their own.</p>

<p>If a group decides to behave in a provocative way during an incendiary time in our history, a fire might get started, and then it will be hard for either side to put it out.</p>

<p>Well, they tend to respond to your group.  They oppose what your group does.</p>

<p>So, if your group stopped arming yourselves and preaching hate, maybe the situation would de-escalate?</p>

<p>If your group feels that you must be able to preach hate with your guns, then this will escalate.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t deny your own responsibility.  It&#39;s easy to point fingers and blame others, but it takes a big person to take responsibility for their actions and to acknowledge the impact of those actions.</p>

<p>The street battle is meaningless other than to show the weakness of the collective &quot;alt-right&quot; and their faux-macho idea of manliness.

<p>Rights are a condition of government. They have no rights in reference to my beliefs or actions. If they claim fascist ideas, they have made themselves a target. It is that simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>faux-macho</p>

<p>In my experience the females associated with the anti-fascist actions are more &quot;macho&quot; than the alt-right crybabies.</p>

<p>The United States is not a safe-space for cartoon frog fascists and dread-locked KKK members. My advice would be to suck it up and admit that that leftist queers and women have put the alt-right into their place.</p>

<p>If you think you can assault fellow citizens based on their beliefs alone you are no better than what you claim to oppose. </p>

<p>Again with the macho crap. The few videos I saw showed young men attacking people with bats and sticks. I saw one old man get beaten while he was down, by a young man. I saw lots of fist brawling. </p>

<p>Nothing to be proud of. Might does not make right. </p>

<p>I&#39;m frankly shocked so many mainstream people are adopting the idea that street justice is noble. </p>

<p>Which is why the Nazis can&#39;t be allowed to attack and intimidate people without an overwhelming response. When they march in the streets with their torches, Nazi flags and guns, they will be confronted, opposed and exposed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>street justice is noble. </p>

<p>Not about nobility, just fucked up fascists.</p>

<p>The street is not a safe space for fascists and racists. When they bring their bile to the public forum, the public will react. </p>

<p>We the People will oppose fascism by all means.</p>

<p>This includes the idiot cartoon frog children as well as the idiot racist President. </p>
