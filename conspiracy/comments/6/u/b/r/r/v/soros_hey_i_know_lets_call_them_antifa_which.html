<p>What people like Soros do is take that name from a benevolent group and then use that group for evil while fooling the people into thinking they are a benevolent group. </p>

<p>For example, imagine if someone started a group called the &quot;12 apostles&quot;.

A guy like Soros would use that to his advantage by created an evil group and calling them something friendly like the &quot;12 Apostles&quot;.

Come on dude.
If you can&#39;t see the divide/conquer formula, you&#39;re dangerously asleep.
And again, even if this sensationalist corporate media narrative
was organic (yeah sure) it&#39;s still
foolish to believe their narrative that implies
&quot;everyone who is anti-fascist, an anarcho-communist, anarchist, etc.
are violent thugs, because CNN proved it to me&quot;. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why people are downvoting.....NEOliberal Soros
is bankrolling these violent protests.
People still can&#39;t see through this formula?
Some people are still stuck in the retarded Democrat VS Republican
false dichotomy. Liberal VS conservative is not what the majority of people
think it means, they get 100% of their knowledge about politics
from corporate media, conservative websites, GOP/DNC websites, etc.
Start from scratch on politics, don&#39;t make dumb assumptions
like &quot;all left wingers are feminists&quot; and believing the corporate media&#39;s definition
of liberal and conservative.</p>

<p>WAKE THE HELL UP.
Also.....even if they weren&#39;t bankrolled, just because
one group that calls themselves X, doesn&#39;t mean
they represent all people who call themselves X.
Shills and idiots are holding us back
by willfully following corporate media narratives.</p>
