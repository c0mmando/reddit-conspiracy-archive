       It's obvious to most that a race war is being pushed. The McGregor/Mayweather fight could be used as a catalyst for such. Mayweather has already planted seeds by calling McGregor racist (even though Floyd referred to Pacquiao as a little yellow monkey).

       Today an ad was found on Craigslist looking for crisis actors in Vegas. It's been up for two weeks. A friend called, and the dates these "actors" are needed is Aug 25th - Aug 27th. Awfully coincidental, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful ya'll, remember to let your love and light shine above all else.

       I wouldn't be so pessimistic. We have made an insane amount of progress since 9-2016. We are still making massive amounts of progress. The amount of people who are finally awake is staggering compared to what it was in 2015.

       Honestly, if this trajectory continues, we might see a massive breakdown of the cabal by end of year. They are like a dam with holes in it. It is going to break at any moment.

       Does seem like a good event to keep an eye on. Having been to many major fights in Vegas, they sure do pump the crowds up. Gang affiliation is pretty big as well. Usually spills out to afterparties at various venues.

       Actually it did... Well not sure what happened.

       First time I opened the page it had a different layout. Had dates and a QR code to scan. Then I saw this comment and went to look again cause I swear I saw some dates. Now there aren't any dates and no QR code. Obviously they didn't just update the posting in these few minutes. Page says last updated 11 days ago.

       Anyone happen to see the page like I did? I haven't look at craigslist for months so I know it's not from something else I happened to look at recently.

       The firm sells services that allow clients to simulate a celebrity lifestyle. Its “Celebrity Shopping Experience” is a trip through town in a luxury car, with cheering fans and paparazzi at every stop. The service was the subject of a “Good Morning America” piece in which a correspondent pretended to be a king while he went through a shopping mall with a paid entourage.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
       The company also carries out publicity stunts for companies and public relations firms using actors.[5]

       Just before the November 2012 election, company founder Swart said that the company was considering a request by a candidate for a staged political protest.[2]

       I expect to see one of these ads before any major event anywhere from here on out. 4chan LARPers will make then because it is ridiculously easy to and places like here where scrutiny should be paramount are compromised and will just eat up every one, forgetting them until one event has an incident than shrieking about "false flag!"

       It's sad how much critical thinking is despised on this sub, hell most people aren't even questioning this post when it has such obvious flaws like the claim of calling the ad when no phone number is given.

       Part of the problem is that being a 'conspiracy theorist' isn't just something people do, it's a hobby, it's part of their identity and it defines them. Deciding something isn't a conspiracy is not fun, it's boring and it's lame and it's what all the sheeple do. That's why everything is a false flag, and anything the MSM says is automatically a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also partly the fear of being a fool. Much better to not believe anything you're told and assume it's all a ploy, then believe it all and find out it was a ploy later.

       But why not assume that the creation of the conspiracy theory is a ploy?   Someone could be regularly planting ads around the country to use as evidence of a conspiracy.

       This is what gets me... if this was actually happening they wouldn't be recruiting randoms through a public Craigslist ad. If I was a billionaire it wouldn't be hard to recruit some full-time crisis actors that aren't going to spill the beans and wouldn't require me giving away my plan by posting on Craigslist.

       You are on the right track. There will be the high paid ones not from Craigslist. Those that talk to the news reporters. Those that instigate the violence. 
The Craigslist ones are just to increase the numbers to make context for the very few actual troublemakers.

       That's what I don't get. How long are they hired for? Six hours for one day of crisis acting? So that's like $120?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not a lot of money, and you're expected to do what for it? Keep your mouth shut forever about this fake terror attack you were a part of?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd You're an organization that has seemingly unlimited money and power, why pay people to act? Why not just hire one maniac to shoot a bunch of people? Or convince some radicalized lunatic to drive his car through a crowd?
      </p>

       I don't understand the needlessly complicated methods of creating these things when the alternative is to just put the means in the hands of the capable.

       Go beyond that even. How are they paid? Is it cash under the table? How do you prove you were there? Are there taxes deducted, T4s (or whatever the American equivalent is), record of employment?

       The reason they don't just hire one lunatic to get the job done is because that would be a one time thing.  Instead they're laying a foundation of riots, one building on top of the other, each one becoming more frenzied, more explosive each time, until finally it becomes too big for local government to contain and suddenly swat teams are everywhere walking the streets, every city has a curfew and now we're on lockdown. That's the end game.

       You see hiring thousands of actors and hoping they all stay silent as

       I see your point, and maybe you're right. But what would be the purpose behind it, if it were the psyop?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, maybe they don't care if the actors stay silent. Who would carry the interview of a paid agitator? MSM? Likely not. Reddit? We just talk to each other mostly.  Alex Jones? Everybody laughs at him.  But sure, the word would get out eventually, so if we don't find someone soon who can prove they were on the payroll, I'll be more inclined to your way of thinking.

       Who would carry the interview? Here. This community. It'd be proof of exactly what they're proposing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And still silence. I believe, because it's not what's happening. This wouldn't be like the Manhattan Project, where they separate people to hide the true events. These would be people who trained for a specific scene. They'd need context for their actions, they'd see themselves on the news, they'd have to sleep at night.

       Nope. The theory about Sandy Hook is that the people in the crowd we're crisis actors hired to play heartbroken parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that means that for Charlottesville, they'd have to have hired enough to form a parade, one big enough to crash a car into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever done any hiring? Casting? How do you hire hundreds of people pile this in total secrecy? And how do you maintain total secrecy and silence? Pay them off? Imagine the cost. Threaten them? How much research and muscle and money would that cost?

       Sandy Hook and Charlottesville are two different animals.  I don't think we can equate the two for the topic of crisis actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crisis Actors and protests:
      </p>
      <p>
       Main body:  local, random citizens moved to protest.  Silent and vast majority.
Hired body (protest crisis actors):  not local, usually given some accessory; sigh, flag, costuming.  usually given a vague script and assigned a group.
Local agents:  veteran protesters who lead groups of crisis actors and coalesce the main body.
       <br/>
       Hired agents:  not actually hired, per se, but pro and not necessarily local.  Leads the violent local agents (generally unpaid, in it for the power rush) and media contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overlap between Sandy Hook and Charlottesville is likely at the hired agent level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring yes (exhausting, I follow you).  Casting no.  The rest of the questions rest on assumptions I don't follow.

       It's called  a non-disclosure contract. Also, if these are real, I would be they would carefully vet their actors thru social media to ensure smooth complicity for their acing positions.

       Can someone please sign up and get hired for one of these? And we can put to rest the speculation already. I can take out an ad on CL right now for whatever I want, I don't have to follow up with it or talk to anyone I can just post the ad.  We need info from someone that was actually hired for one of these.

       Agreed. See my post above asking for the phone number. Hoping OP delivers with it. I am a little confused with how his friend called them since they don't list a number in the ad. But maybe he reached out through the ad to get the number? Will just have to wait to hear back from OP.

       Good idea, I did it too. I have no acting experience so I don't know if they'll contact me but I gave it a go. It occurs to me now that I applied like it was a for real job. I should have lied about acting experience. dumb.

       I just don't understand how this is evidence for shilling in your mind. Some people genuinely enjoy debate and think it is a productive use of their time. I pretty much only read and comment on a few subs; the rest are either gigantic eco-chambers or don't have enough activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have zero doubt whatsoever that vast sums of money are spent to influence public opinion on the net in general and reddit in specific, both by private entities and governments, including our own(U.S. bias itt). At the same time, so many shill accusations that I see are the product of being completely incapable of conceiving that someone could disagree with a given position. This is a toxic mindset, the ultimate expression of divide and conquer. Complete balkanization of believe, to the degree of denying the humanity of anyone who does not share your world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact opposite of what we need right now. We need to work as hard as we possibly can to understand those who disagree with us. When you understand where someone is coming from, so many of the imagined differences between you evaporate. What is left is a fertile field in which productive discourse and mutual growth can be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a final aside, while shills are certainly used, this whole propaganda system is designed to get real people to internalize ideology, which results in them defending those ideas as if they were their own self. Think Agents taking over people in the Matrix. You really just can't distinguish shilling from useful idiots(I apologize for the derogatory term, it runs counter of the message I'm trying to get across here, but it is a useful term to know for googling and understanding how this all works). For this reason, I think it is so much worthwhile to try and engage with suspected shills from a position of understanding, brotherhood, and optimism. I always try to plant seeds, there might be another person behind the account and you never know when conditions will be just right for something beautiful to flower. Additionally, on a public forum like this the positivity of your exchange can inspire others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light begets light and darkness begets darkness. You can't dispel darkness with more darkness, it must be through the light of love and understanding.

       But why was "political activist" the only thing listed that isn't essentially faking something? Even Brand Ambassador just means a Street Marketer, aka a Real-life Shill. So they're looking for an actor with experience it Performance Acting, Street Shilling and... Political Activism? One is not like the others, or is it?

       get a bunch of people together for a protest where they're all amped up but peaceful?

       Toss in a few instigators into the crowd who's job and intention is to rile up the crowd from the inside and start violence.

      <p>
       It's like herding sheep at that point. Once you get a few of those "peaceful" innocents riled up and joining in with the true instigators you now have a flash riot with a bunch of people who were played and are now just cannon fodder ready to be sacrificed.

       What's gullible is believing the shill's strawman argument; that the paid crowds are part of the false flag attacks. They are there to exacerbate the aftermath of false flag attacks, or give the illusion that more people care about protesting something that the pedophiles care about than actually do.

       Vegas on fight night is "Big America on Steroids."  Money, Testosterone, Laughter, Pussy, Consumerism, Aggression, Partying, Coke, Capitalism, Sex, Sin, Fun, etc, etc.  If Antifa tries to fuck with people's Vegas experience, people are gonna be like, "Nah, bitch!"  And blacks and whites and rich and poor and gays and straights will join together in unity and kick some bitchy little Antifa ass like its their damn job!

       Yes this has been on my mind for a while. Big mma and boxing fan and no doubt the race issue is being pushed. Mostly by Mayweather.
      </p>
      <p>
       He recently stated he felt Mcgregor said some racist remarks Mcgregor said "dance for me boy!" at a press conference. Conor also remarked about Floyd's gym being like the one in Rocky where it was a circus. He said something about "dancing monkeys" which mayweather thought was racist. Mcgregor has denied that what he said was racist, but now Mayweather claims he's doing this fight for all the black people in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny little tidbit, the referees name in this fight is Robert Byrd. Obviously not the same guy who was a senator who was in the KKK but I just find it odd they pick someone with that name. Especially when the fight has racial tension in it.

       That's not the point, the point is that Mayweather is trying to incite a racial element into it and insinuate that Mc Gregor (and therefor his supporters) are racist towards black people and that every black person in the world should get behind him when he attempts to beat this racist white man for all the black people in the world. That's irresponsible beyond belief.

       Yes, this was his intent, and going by the news bulletins which attempt to interview the people who attend these antifa, BLM rallies, there are a lot of unintelligent, vulnerable, easily led people who will be drawn in by his false accusations.

       I'm going to play devil's advocate.  We're all here because we have questions, right?  Feel free to pass this by.
      </p>

       I can't see the ad from here...  but let's say it's what you think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're going fake an attack on the street with probably the most pedestrian traffic in the country, but certainly in the western US.  I don't know if you've ever walked the Vegas strip on an ordinary summer night, but it's like the mall at Christmas time.  It is the most crowded outdoor place I have ever been except maybe in front of the stage at an outdoor concert.  And we're not talking about any August Saturday night, we're talking about the night of the biggest fight of the year (at least).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There will be HUNDREDS of witnesses.  You can't just park a truck on the sidewalk and run in some people with fake blood.  It WILL be seen, and in this day and age, it will more than likely be filmed.  How is that handled?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If they are going to fake a terrorist attack in the above environment, it is going to be pretty hard to keep quiet that it was fake to start with.  So they advertise for actors on Craigslist?  I don't care if they have them sign NDA's out the wazoo, when it shows up on the news and those people know what is what, somebody is talking.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I have been concerned about attacks in Vegas for a while (real ones), I don't see how you can fake one there unless it's the slowest day of the year and on a far end of the strip.

       Blacks kill whites at a much higher rate than the other way around.  I don't get where you get the little scenario in your head from, probably too much TV but it'd be the opposite of what you described if anything.

       There are real drills going on all the time where people are presumably needed y'know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these ads have also become a tactic to discredit opponents. I've seen it done for at least 3-4 different protests to date, as well as fake ads offering retainers for paid protestors and fake sites like
       <a href="https://www.demandprotest.com">
        https://www.demandprotest.com
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a common tactic now. It's not very clever or convincing. I suspect the ad for Charlotte was one, but the person making it was too stupid to get the city right.

       Their website looks like a Wix botch job. A company that can afford to pay for what they say they do would have a presentable website, no? A few thousand can get you a decent website and while they appear able to spend thousands regularly, they can't spend more than a couple hundred on a website? Where do they get their money?

       Man, slaves were like $500,000 in today's money, iirc. With how history is jacked with, I wouldn't be surprised if not many families did. I think most people lived like, you know, homestead style, with a mess of kids to help things along and tip the odds against all that dying.

       not Charlottesville, VA. About 4 hours away by car/coach. However

        people on Twitter

       claim crowds of protesters were bused into Charlottesville. One user
       <a href="https://archive.fo/jjxb8">
        posted this
       </a>
       implying it it shows bussed-in Trump supporters but if they are paid protesters that changes things.

       For what it is worth Crowds on Demand (CoD) does

        We caught up with Adam Swart, the founder and CEO of Crowds On Demand - a business that pretty much does what it says on the tin.
Swart filled us in on his typical booking: 'We specialise in getting our clients lots of attention. 'The right kind of attention through crowd based action.' Detailing his typical customers, Swart added: 'We work with companies conducting PR stunts,
        <strong>
         politicians looking for supporters (or protesters against their opponents), interest groups and individuals.' Swart confirms US politicians have used his services

       Not sure if relevant but there is a letter from him on the FCC's site on behalf of the National Association of African American-Owned Media (NAAAOM).

       NAAAOM’s mission is "to eliminate racial discrimination and secure the economic inclusion of truly 100% African American owned media through fair contracting and equal treatment practices."

       Anyway, we already have proof that DNC operatives are prepared to send paid protesters and agent provocateurs to sabotage rallies and events by inciting violence.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two top Democratic strategists have exited the presidential campaign after explosive undercover videos showed them discussing voter fraud and
        <strong>
         their roles in planting paid agitators at campaign events
        </strong>
        for Republican candidate Donald Trump.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert Creamer, founder of Democracy Advocates and the husband of Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky, Illinois Democrat, stepped down from the campaign Tuesday, a day after Scott Foval was fired from his post as national field director of Americans United for Change.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first video shows Democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators — including union members, homeless people and the mentally ill — to incite violence by provoking Trump supporters on camera at campaign stops.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       DNC operative Scott Foval says in the video: "When they’re outside the rally, the media will cover it no matter where it happens.
       <strong>
        They key is initiating the conflict
       </strong>
       by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off. It’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt.
       <strong>
        Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you
       </strong>
       .

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "If you’re there and you’re protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies. That’s what we want"

       Apparently the last two "terror attacks" have people actually worrying about the safety of the Las Vegas Strip. Even with bollards though, once a vehicle passes through, getting on the sidewalks via the sloping concrete slabs at intersections and low curbs make an "attack" still plausible.

       Check it out; when an elite military stages a mission, let's say someone like Delta Force..they have a saying; "stay frosty". It means stay cool, and keep on your toes. You know how you do that? By observation and situational awareness and being alert to what

       </em>
       happen.

       <strong>
        nothing
