       I pray that most of these Nazi accusations are coming from paid shills and bots and not real people. It was Russia non stop for months then boom that is given up on and now anyone on the right is a Nazi. How low can the democrats go in trying to make us fight each other. Everyone was 1000% sure the Russians hacked the election but now that the story has completely fallen apart its 1984 time to rewrite history and move on. Once the Nazi angle stops working they will find something else. I was one of the biggest Bernie supporters to walk the earth but even he has gone off the deep end. Fucking sad state of affairs we are living in.

       It took a while for them to roll it up to Nixon.  This is a completely different situation.  Nobody thought that Trump had a chance at winning.  It was not until after he did win that this became an issue.  It is sour grapes.

       More like if the store owner left without turning out the lights and didn't lock up and someone intending on vandalizing the place walked through the front door, took a dozen photos and then walked out and left the photos on the sidewalk so we'll never know who took them but we arrest the guy down the street because he said something bad about the store keepers mom.

       The accusation of "hacking the election" comes from the DNC's and Podesta's email hack. Most of the intelligence community attributes this hack to Russia. There's also the massive counterintelligence operations they conducted through the spreading of actual fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both these things are well documented and for someone who's trying to "son" people on the internet about the investigation, you should be able to answer what is a pretty basic question central to the investigation.

       Why are Trump defenders always so confused about what's going on with the Russians? Do you really think that the reason there is an investigation is because the "Russians hacked the election"? No one thinks the russians "hacked" the election. What they think is that the Trump campaign was working with russian intelligence to gain information on hillary clinton, in order to win the election. It was a concerted effort by Trump and the russians, to spread misinformation on the internet as well as to spread illegally gained emails from hillary's campaign. Once again, no one, NO ONE, thinks the election was hacked. That is not what collusion means. This is what collusion means:

       The polls consistently indicated that Hillary would win by a large margin.  If the fantasy these people believe in was true, then the polls would have been affected at a certain point in time that corresponds with the release of the "misinformation".  I do not see this point in time.

       She insulted people, then turned around and expected them to vote for her.  Fuck that.

       The MSM is more bullshit than most want to accept and not as fake as others suggest. But if you want to convince someone of something you have to use sources they trust, so it's not about the person sharing the link so much as the person they are sharing the link with.

       You can't be serious that no one thought the election was "hacked."  CNN had entire panel groups discussing Russia "hacking" the election, and even going so far as to say they hacked actual voting machines.

       I meant, no one who's sane. They could have said that, I wouldn't know because I don't watch msm. Maybe you could supply some links of them saying "The investigation is about russians hacking the election" because that's not what they're investigating. Maybe that's what you think, but that's not real. The investigation is over collusion, which I've already explained and defined.

       "The media coverage blew this incident out of proportion"
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't refute his point. Many, many people didn't believe in Watergate.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It took a while for them to roll it up to Nixon. This is a completely different situation"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually the exact same situation, thats what's happening right now and is precisely the reason why the investigation is taking so long. Everyone around Trump is being interviewed/investigated. Its well documented and I'm sure your aware, it seems like you're being intentionally dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nobody thought that Trump had a chance at winning. It was not until after he did win that this became an issue. It is sour grapes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Most polls were giving Trump at least a 30% chance of winning the election. The hack was being attributed to Russia before the election. It's not sour grapes, the reason the speculation picked up after the investigation is because
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       Trump team members were caught lying about meeting with Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Besides, why are we not investigating the people who are responsible for making sure the elections are not hacked or manipulated? "
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to do more research into the investigation, nobody is insinuating that the election itself was hacked or manipulated. Obama meant you couldn't hack the results of the election, and as far as anyone knows that's still the case. Again, thats not what the investigation is about.

       I was asking in another thread about the alleged Russian manipulation.  Where is the affect on the poll results?  Hillary was consistently winning in the polls, which is not what would be expected if misinformation was being released.   Did Hillary's poll numbers dip because of Wikileaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary had an 85% chance of winning on election day, according to the NY Times.

       are we arguing the same thing? i don't buy the russian stuff.  i was trying to highlight the discontinuity of Team Clinton wanting to drive the US to war over russian hacking but not letting a fed agency verify the claim.

       The poll numbers were never influenced.  We both see that, but these other people are still convinced the Russians did it.

       The investigation continues under it comes to conclusion. This can take years, for example 2 years for Nixon, or Benghazi which was still drawing money till the end of 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latest perspective seems to be ramping up. A Grand Jury was convened, and tidbits were found about questionable meeings with Kushner, Sessions statements have proven misleading as meetings were moved to Trump Tower with Russians last minute. These investigations always take time, and this one is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just have to await Muellers statement on completion, but even then investigations don't always stop. For instance, there were 8 seperate investigations into Benghazi, one costing tax payers over $10 million. Bureaucracy.

       It should be opened if there is new information, just like Comey did when new emails showed up.

       I read quite a few of the emails, I don't have the time to read them all. Most of the ones I read were political intrigue and basic operations.

       Excuse me? Did the criminal investigation end or something? Last time I checked, Mueller impannled a grand jury and Manaforts home was raided by the FBI. You guys keep saying the Russia stuff is over as if the criminal investigation will just go away if you say it enough times.

       The emails don't paint the Syrian government in the best light as they relate to the west; which just so happens to be good for Russia's interests in the country.

       Ah, so Russia, which is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, is tangentially involved in one leak, while the US is the sole subject of the over half the leaks. That is definitely balanced coverage.

       So English language publication employing native English speakers distributed to an English speaking audience is at fault for not publishing more Cyrillic? Your argument is equal to demanding more coverage of North Korea from The Guardian to prove their credibility. This is just silly.

       Meh, people who think trump being president is a bad thing, aren't looking at the big picture. Trump is the catalyst for progressiveness we needed this whole time. He's forcing people to wake up to the inherent corruption in our system by just being himself, after trumps out so much change will be ripe to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why you call a political move, 'a coward', it was strategic, feigning is a war tactic. Survival isn't cowardly. As far as lying goes, I've never seen one thing he's lied about. Care to enlighten me? Because the only thing I've seen is that someone said they sent him a document and he didn't publish it, but after that, they never published the document themselves, so It's obviously not real.

       So every politican in history is a liar and a coward then. Because every single politican in history has said one thing and done another. Every single one. I agree but you aren't looking at the big picture of the fact he'd die if he turned himself in.

       And no ones going to kill him. We aren't Russia. Had he remained an anonymous coward out in some shack in Sweden or something, maybe. But he's a hugely public figure so he's not going to be assassinated by the US government at this point.

       Giving control of constitutional rights to monopolies is what Mussolini encouraged his government to do. Identity politics is how it is accomplished without the people realizing their rights are being taken away because they are actively fighting in ways that weaken their control over their rights.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fascism, which is the very antithesis of Individualism, stands as the nemesis of all economic doctrines and all economic practice of both the capitalistic and the communistic systems. Fascism holds that:
1)The economic life of man cannot be abstracted and separated from the whole of his spiritual life. In the words of Mussolini: “The economic man does not exist. Man is integral; he is political, economic, religious, saint and warrior at the same time.”
2)The economic life of man is influenced, if not actually determined, by idealistic factors.
3)True economic progress can derive only from the concerted effort of individuals who know how to sacrifice their personal egoism and ambitions for the good of the whole.
4)Economic initiatives cannot be left to the arbitrary decisions of private, individual interests.
5)Open competition, if not wisely directed and restricted, actually destroys wealth instead of creating it.
6)The wealth of a community is something intangible which cannot be identified with the sum of riches of single individuals.
7)The proper function of the State in the Fascist system is that of supervising, regulating and arbitrating the relationships of capital and labor, employers and employees, individuals and associations, private interests and national interests.
8)Class war is avoidable and must be avoided. Class war is deleterious to the orderly and fruitful life of the nation therefore it has no place in the Fascist State.
9)More important than the production of wealth is its right distribution, distribution which must benefit in the best possible way all the classes of the nation, hence, the nation itself.

        non-elected form of state officializing of every interest into the state was professed to reduce the marginalization of singular interests (as would allegedly happen by the unilateral end condition inherent in the democratic voting process). Corporatism would instead better recognize or "incorporate" every divergent interest into the state organically, according to its supporters, thus being the inspiration for their use of the term totalitarian, perceivable to them as not meaning a coercive system but described distinctly as

       Successfull Fascism convinces people, through very appealing terms, to surrender their personhood to the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       FDR on the matter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Surrendering Congressional and Judicial oversight to private companies to circumvent constitutional law and getting people to actually ask for it. It's the Third Way.

       There is actually no evidence of that. If it were true your response to this comment would be a link to WaPo or NYT, but it won't be. You're going to link to The Verge or The Daily Dot. Because there are basic and apparent questions that any quality reporter and editor would ask. Like, "how do we know those emails were even given to WL?" - the inconvenient answer is that we don't know if they ever were.

       You're pointing out, and rightly so, the fact that it's simplistic and wrong to paint a large group with a broad brush, then in the same breath you're doing the same: "How low will the Democrats go?" If you can see that they're wrong about most of you, consider that they're wrong about most of us as well.

       People are just going to throw insults around. However if you're getting hit from a lot of different angles without a consistent theme other than shutting you up, there's a good chance you're on to something. Extremists on both sides just hate the gray area in the middle, but that's exactly where the truth is.

       it's not like the Russia investigation has stopped, there just hasn't been any recent leaks about it and Congress is in recess, so no hearings.

       People still think the Democratic party is the root of all evil or something? They are NOTHING. These "parties" are just fronts for the same, homogenous death cult, where Trump and the GOP are gleeful members. How anyone can believe that there isn't a one party system almost everywhere on the planet is beyond me.

       The nazi accusations are being made by celebrities, pundits and people who are too stupid to think for themselves. People who didn't study. People who legit don't know history. The much smarter elitist/communist left wingers are encouraging them to use this nazi rhetoric because it offers no compromise. If I call you a nazi, you can't come back from it and since you're a nazi, I won't agree with you on anything. They're using useful idiots.

       Labelling you as Trump supporter only gets the hardcore left angry. Labelling you a Russian enemy of the state can get all Americans angry. Labelling you a Nazi can get the whole world angry. It's an insidious strategy of completely dehumanising the opposition.

       Fake small news bits blown up out of proportion, or inflamed by insurgents, is fine for corporate media, but real news that can affect or ruling class, gets demonized as supposed "fake news"
