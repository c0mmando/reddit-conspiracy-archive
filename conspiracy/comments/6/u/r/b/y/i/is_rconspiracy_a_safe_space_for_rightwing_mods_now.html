        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Amos_Quito has begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uqnbp/free_speech_who_needs_it_thousands_of/">deleting comments</a> to make a point. It&#39;s a silly point that misunderstands both the facts of the event and the arguments he&#39;s trying to suppress, but he&#39;s preventing any discussion of that as well as suppressing the comments that offend him.</p>

<p>No rule has been broken. These deletions are because he wants to make a point, and his mod powers let him do that. He&#39;s justifying it by saying that (a) the deletions are &quot;temporary,&quot; (b) he&#39;s making a point about the heckler&#39;s veto, and (c) he&#39;s &quot;not the government.&quot;</p>

<p>These are all bad reasons, but we can&#39;t discuss that--Amos Quito won&#39;t allow it.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;ll pat himself on the back and preen that causing outrage must prove his point. A point he can&#39;t make with rational, reasonable arguments, so he feels compelled to make by silencing critics. </p>

<p>To be clear, this is not analogous to the Boston rally to me. The right wing ralliers&#39; speeches and signs are magnified rather than suppressed by the increased attention on the event, and their speech rings out louder than it would have without the protests. But can we even discuss that, if mods don&#39;t like where the conversation goes? </p>

<p>I think the users of r/conspiracy are entitled to at least an explanation from the mods: can we expect further deletion of comments to make ideological points? What are the limits of mods&#39; powers to delete comments that break no rules?</p>

<p>Is r/conspiracy going to become a safe space for right-wing mods now?</p>

<p>Edit: AQ has restored the deleted comments and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uqnbp/free_speech_who_needs_it_thousands_of/dlutg0z/">added a sticky comment</a> explaining what he was trying to accomplish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you don&#39;t like Reddit? Generally popular opinion wins out, especially when it is rewarded in an upvote/downvote system. Most subs you refer to don&#39;t ban dissenting thought, which doesn&#39;t make them a safe space (people downvoting unpopular opinion is not the same thing, and to fix that would be to change the very nature of Reddit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and the world has the complexity of a children&#39;s cartoon.</p>

<p>Its hilarious hearing this style of talking point. Where you drag everything down to the level of a 5 year old and then pretend thats the argument I am making.</p>

<p>No. Thats the level of simplification that you dragged it down to because you cannot handle responding to the actual real world, serious, complicated reality of the propaganda website you are currently pretending is just</p>

<p>&quot;People voting for popular opinion man, all is normal&quot;</p>

<p>Do you even realize how insulting it is to try to pretend I havent been on this website for years, paying attention, and know exactly how this website was transitioned into its current form?</p>

<p>&quot;Its just reddit bro, just regular people voting dude, thats all it is&quot;</p>

<p>I dont have further time to waste on your nonsense or to hold your hand through adulthood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes far beyond Boston. It&#39;s the ever increasing regressive PC/SJW culture. People yelling for others they disagree with to be censored and shut down. However, when they get censored and shut down, they cry oppression! It&#39;s moronic hypocrisy, and a dangerous one at that. It&#39;s basically persecution complex, which is a mental illness.</p>

<p>What we are seeing on the left is not equality or egalitarianism, it&#39;s disguised supremacy against certain groups who they feel are the oppressors. What you are seeing on the right, is a push back against this. Every action has a equal and opposite reaction. I&#39;m seeing more radicalism coming out of the left, than I&#39;m seeing coming out of the right. </p>

<p>When a university decides not to associate itself with a speaker for other reasons, though, that&#39;s not censorship (either the literal version or effective censorship when the university is private). It&#39;s the freedom of an entity to choose whether or not to be a venue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, I just think that writing off and enabling Antifa will only embolden them (radical leftists). It&#39;s a building up of more radicalization. This is what happened in the 70&#39;s with the Weather Underground. The same people behind that group/ideology are the very people funding, educating, and encouraging a new generation of radicals on the left. People like that have far more influence in academia and the media, than any neo-Nazi or KKK group. Those two groups are highly fringe, whereas the former are saturated in colleges, MSM, and HollyWood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. Here&#39;s what I posted over in his censorship thread.</p>

<p>So, is your point that no one should be allowed to ever counter-protest?  If there was a 9/11 commemorative event with media and politicians watching, it would be wrong for us to go with signs stating we&#39;ve been lied to and gov is in on it?
If there was a pro-hillary parade, it would be wrong for people to show up and protest that she&#39;s &quot;evil&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The culture here has already changed in a very negative way with the very circle jerky rightish culture that has developed. I say rightish because it seems to be acceptable here to hate on the left, or to hate on both, but generally not to hate on the right (despite their poorer voting record in modern history and the greater number of lies coming from them) </p>

<p>The people trying to change the culture (whom you push back against so hard) just want to be able to have honest discussion here (for or against anything), not be constantly flooded with posts from the right/at-right, and not have conspiracies that go against the same; constantly downvoted in the new queue, suffer constant low quality attacks to try to discredit, or get suppressed by the mods. They aren&#39;t trying to stop any kind of post completely or to have this subreddit look like r/politics, but there should be some proportionality. </p>

<p>I get that it sucks when a subreddit culture moves away from being filled with people you agree with, but that&#39;s just how it goes. If you want to force the culture in a conspiracy subreddit, do it in your new conspiracyright safespace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to start an argument but the T_D and Clinton fans are both brainwashed in different ways, serving almost the same agenda (NEOlib/NEOcon)
Mike Pence is worse than Trump but the Zionist ass kissing and lack of critical thinking in T_D is saddening to me. I saw a top thread there saying something like &quot;every Trump supporter I&#39;ve spoken to is 100% behind the prez&quot;
(sounds extremely cultish)</p>

<p>I&#39;m just thinking, is it a Zionist echo chamber with shills or what?
How are they so confident that  Trump is playing 4D chess against the establishment??
Seems more likely T_D is a controlled hangout and Trump is an Israel firster.
I&#39;m open minded to different sides of the story though.
If the smoking gun is something about pepe meme magic, I&#39;m not really convinced lol.</p>

<p>Am I supposed to not believe any right wing shit because it&#39;s all partisan traps but the left wing stuff is just fine with no trap?</p>

<p>And taking down corruption in government to me is not about assigning the government more power over even more parts of my life, like national health care and national education.  I want a small government, that&#39;s why I&#39;m conservative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m partisan against fucking Trump, whom is a conspiracy gold mine.</p>

<p>But I criticize both fucking parties because both of them are corrupt and do evil shit, and it&#39;s beyond naive to think otherwise.</p>

<p>The way the DNC and the MSM treated Sanders is a prime example of corruptness that resides deep in our politics. </p>

<p>Just like how the RNC and the MSM treated Ron Paul years ago.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t say you can&#39;t believe anything right wing. I&#39;m talking about people who purposely and and mislead in order to push their propaganda.  And it&#39;s not just right propagandists who do it. It&#39;s obvious there are left wing propagandists who lie and mislead as well.</p>

<p>To me, these folks are involved in a conspiracy that I want to get to the bottom of, becase there is a propaganda of lies war that is happening right now that is being paid for by different organizations.  CTR is the most obvious one right now, but it&#39;s naive to think there isn&#39;t conservative CTR propaganda machines as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone should know who this OP, Kolyin is.  Here is a reply he made to me in a thread regarding vaccines:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rzrbv/vaccines_are_toxic_mega_dump/dl950kh/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rzrbv/vaccines_are_toxic_mega_dump/dl950kh/</a></p>

<p>In this reply he refers to an article he wrote:  <a href="https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/11/22/why-anti-vaxers-hate-the-nvicp-and-just-what-is-it-anyway-by-colin-mcroberts/">https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/11/22/why-anti-vaxers-hate-the-nvicp-and-just-what-is-it-anyway-by-colin-mcroberts/</a>  You&#39;ll notice that he identifies himself here, I&#39;m not the one doing it.  You can see the article referred to is authored by &quot;Colin McRoberts (@Kolyin) is a Texas attorney and consultant&quot;</p>

<p>When I originally searched for information about this individual one of the first results that came up was a gofundme page that he had started.  It appears he has since deleted it, probably a wise move on his part.  The gofundme page was raising money to attend the &quot;Conspira-Sea cruise&quot;.  The language he used implied that all conspiracy theories were comical and that he was attending the cruise to see what made those nutters tick and to gather material for his book on crazy conspiracy theory believers.  He described himself as an &quot;attorney and consultant in the field of negotiation and persuasion&quot;</p>

<p>Here is an article someone has written on him: <a href="http://www.waronwethepeople.com/colin-mcroberts/">http://www.waronwethepeople.com/colin-mcroberts/</a></p>

<p>Please read it, quite interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He acted as the senior adviser directing a cell of pro-vaccine propagandists blogging for passage of California bill SB277, the controversial mandatory vaccination bill vacating philosophical exemptions to forced intoxications. We call such bloggers “PharmaTrolls.” McRoberts’ cell published to combat enemies of the vaccination industry. Their success, coupled with political payoffs called “campaign contributions,” voided previously legislated religious and philosophical exemptions to the risky, sometimes deadly, medical (mal)practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is named in this ABC news article as contributing to an &quot;intelligence report&quot;: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82969&amp;amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82969&amp;amp;page=1</a></p>

<p>His job is public relations for big pharma, possibly he is also works in intelligence.</p>

<p>This is the sort of person the sub would probably be better off without.  He posts here often and it would probably be a good idea to constantly call him out on his past and intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa. I guess the lesson here is, if you criticize a mod anybody can try to dox you.</p>

<p>This is junk. I&#39;ve never worked in PR, for pharma or anyone else. (Do many lawyers do PR?) No one&#39;s ever paid me for writing anything online, except for one magazine article and miniscule ad revenue from a blog. I don&#39;t work for &quot;intelligence&quot; or run an assassin squad, which the people who wrote that article also accused me of.</p>

<p>I guess this is the mods&#39; idea of free speech? This commenter has tried to dox me before, but mods have always deleted the comments. Until I criticised AQ; now u/mastigia approves it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, from your gofundme page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m an attorney and a consultant in the field of negotiation and persuasion. Fringe beliefs and their believers fascinate me. And for the past few years, I’ve been thinking a lot about how the outside world relates to those beliefs. I’m writing a book, tentatively titled “The Good Fight: Engaging Irrational Ideologies.&quot; It looks at how and why people come to believe irrational things like, well, like all the beliefs that will be represented on the Conspira-Sea Cruise. I’m also explaining how to engage with someone who believes in things like that, either to understand them better or to try to help them see why their beliefs are irrational. (Since that requires understanding them and their beliefs anyway, understanding is the critical step here.)
To better understand people who believe things I can’t believe people believe, I’ve interviewed some very interesting people for the book. I’ve also done a lot of research on the people who wouldn’t or couldn’t grant an interview. That’s been educational, but the Conspira-Sea Cruise is an unprecedented opportunity. When else will so many prominent believers in so many strange beliefs be gathered together for the explicit purpose of explaining themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes far beyond Boston. It&#39;s the ever increasing regressive PC/SJW culture. People yelling for others they disagree with to be censored and shut down. However, when they get censored and shut down, they cry oppression! It&#39;s moronic hypocrisy, and a dangerous one at that. It&#39;s basically persecution complex, which is a mental illness.</p>

<p>What we are seeing on the left is not equality or egalitarianism, it&#39;s disguised supremacy against certain groups who they feel are the oppressors. What you are seeing on the right, is a push back against this. Every action has a equal and opposite reaction.

<p>The people trying to change the culture (whom you push back against so hard) just want to be able to have honest discussion here (for or against anything), not be constantly flooded with posts from the right/at-right, and not have conspiracies that go against the same; constantly downvoted in the new queue, suffer constant low quality attacks to try to discredit, or get suppressed by the mods. They aren&#39;t trying to stop any kind of post completely or to have this subreddit look like r/politics, but there should be some proportionality. </p>

<p>I get that it sucks when a subreddit culture moves away from being filled with people you agree with, but that&#39;s just how it goes. If you want to force the culture in a conspiracy subreddit, do it in your new conspiracyright safespace.</p>
