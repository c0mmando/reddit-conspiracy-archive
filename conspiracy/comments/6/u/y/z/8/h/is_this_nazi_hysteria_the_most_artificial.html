        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve still only seen a picture of <em>one person</em> at the charlotsville rally holding a Nazi flag (the man in the green shirt), and no more than that.  And yet the media acts as if Nazism is actually a problem and a significant movement. It&#39;s the most bizarre thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Even the narrative of &quot;Antifa vs Nazis&quot; is totally wrong as there are hardly any Nazis at all. </p>

<p>Again: ONE PERSON at the rally was holding a Nazi flag. While I disagree with the aims of the rally in general, to even call it a &quot;Nazi rally&quot; was highly disingenuous and not descriptive of reality. But one picture of a person holding a flag is alll it takes to whip a country into mass hysteria</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. It&#39;s a mass media hysteria. Race relations are not as a bad as the media is portraying it.</p>

<p>I work with a mix of people. We get along great. Although I live in a smaller town, there is definitely a wide range of people here. We never have these race problems. Everyone is chill and polite.</p>

<p>Been selling eclipse glasses to random people, who contacted me on FB, all day long. A mix of people. Not a single problem. Actually some of the best interactions I&#39;ve had were with people that were a different race than me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking crazy. It&#39;s almost as if you get out and interact with people, then shit isn&#39;t really as bad as you&#39;d think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m disagreeing mind you but small towns are a different kind of living. I grew up on the beach in NC and never saw but maybe a few black people until middle school. I&#39;m mid 30s. I&#39;ve lived in NYC, New haven CT, Dallas. Tensions are out there on many fronts. They&#39;ve been playing us against each other for centuries now. The internet has increased the reach of many ideas. In small towns though you get to know people on a personal level. In cities it&#39;s mainly everyone for themselves apart from loved ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh that&#39;s way bigger than I thought. Still not big enough to have racial tensions though. I grew up with like maybe 10,000 during the winter. That would quadruple during the summers. But yeh it&#39;s not that Nazis and kkk wernt always there. I do believe the msm is just trying to get ratings firstly. I just think Trump has given these people, in their mind, the OK to just go out there and be proud. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much it.  He took too long and his first speech they seemed to like.  At this point for Trump even if his next speech was just &quot;Go fuck yourselves Nazis&quot; they&#39;d be like...<em>wink</em>...we understand Heir President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. I&#39;ve seen &quot;Trump has emboldened these individuals&quot; several times over a few posts in the last 10 minutes. Trump hasn&#39;t done anything to embolden these people and has never supported them yet there are still people claiming it&#39;s his fault. You people claiming that could at least back up what you say with some evidence maybe? The mainstream media is emboldening these people a million times more than Trump is. They&#39;re the ones trying to convince the general public that Trump is one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets really bad in metropolitan cities with hundreds of thousands because when you see so many strangers on a daily basis, you assume that you basically have anonymity/&quot;can get lost in the crowd&quot; hence it is really easy to be an asshole to people and just escape from the consequences. It is pretty dehumanizing sometimes. When you&#39;re in a relatively small town, if you are an asshole it will come back to you eventually. If you&#39;re in a big city, you can be a grade-A fuckwad and it&#39;s very unlikely you&#39;ll ever bump into the same people again. </p>

<p>Yes, it is ironic that the little Nazi ratbastard outlined just how the future Nazis would react to being called Nazis - with lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well... u/Putin_loves_cats repeated a common misquote. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Goebbels.27s_use_of_the_expression">Here is what Goebbels actually said:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence. Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness. The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>And Goebbels statement was likely drawing on the following, which appeared in Hitler&#39;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; [emphasis mine]:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Hitler.27s_use_of_the_expression">Begin Wikipedia Quote</a></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>But it remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood</strong>, and their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown a superhuman will and energy in his effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. By placing responsibility for the loss of the world war on the shoulders of Ludendorff they took away the weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility</strong>; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and <strong>thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods</strong>.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.</strong> Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. <strong>For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, vol. I, ch. X[1]</p>

<p><strong>Thus, according to Hitler, the &quot;Big Lie&quot; was a propaganda technique typically used by &quot;the Jews&quot;.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>[End Wikipedia Quote]</p>

<p>The misquote that Putin_loves_cats repeated is actually a paraphrase of a statement from a psychological report on Hitler prepared by the US OSS (predecessor to the CIA):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Usage_in_Hitler.27s_psychological_profile">Wikipedia again:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;[Hitler&#39;s] primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; <strong>people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>History is a funny thing in that it can be (AND OFTEN IS) manipulated and contorted by those in power to mean the exact opposite of what actual happened or was said. </p>

<p>This is a fine example: Most people have been led to believe that Hitler and the Nazis <strong><em>promoted</em></strong> using the &quot;Big Lie Technique&quot; for the purposes of propaganda, when in fact, they <strong><em>accused</em></strong> &quot;the Jews&quot; <em>(Hitler)</em>and the British <em>(Goebbels)</em> of using these techniques.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi was a German National Socialist. The only place you could actually have Nazis, is in Germany. It was a German Socio-political movement and ideology of the German/Aryan people being the superior race. White Nationalism has nothing to do with Superiority or Supremacy, merely a preference of one&#39;s race/ethnicity/cultural, over another, and the desire to preserve it. Preference does not equal hate or supremacy. A preference is a preference.</p>

<p>Being that historically, people of the same race, ethnicity, and cultural, have lived more happily, safely, and prosperous, throughout history, gives credence to why people tend to agree with the ideology. Multiculturalism, does not work in the long run, hence why we are seeing what we see in the US, versus what&#39;s going on in say Iceland, the Nordics, Poland, Switzerland, etc etc. Supremacy would be ruling over minorities, White Nationalism would be having a homeland and trading/commerce with all. That&#39;s the difference.</p>

<p>Certain terms, like &quot;white nationalist&quot;, are not defined by &quot;opinions&quot; but by the very definition of the words used in the phrase. This is why no one needs to define an exclusive racial designation, &quot;white&quot;, or an socioeconomic indicator like &quot;nationalist&quot;. </p>

<p>Individual citizens have no reason to respect the hate speech of Nazis. &quot;Free speech&quot; is an aspect of government only. Fascism is an aspect of government as well. This is why punching Nazis was just a pastime recently. Now it is an imperative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think that skin color is a meaningful way to differentiate people, and furthermore, you want to live in a space that no longer has anyone other than white people who have very similar views on race - is that person a white nationalist or a Nazi? Sounds to me like both. It&#39;s all born of hatred and low self-regard, it all seeks to spread its vile poison wherever it goes. A white nationalist is someone who is obviously a Nazi but thinks as long as he doesn&#39;t say certain views in public those believes are anything other than petulant. The only people who think there is a difference are Nazis desperately trying to rebrand themselves as if branding was the problem. No one is fooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi was a German National Socialist. The only place you could actually have Nazis is in Germany. It was a German Socio-political movement and ideology of the German/Aryan people being the superior race. White Nationalism has nothing to do with Superiority or Supremacy, merely a preference of one&#39;s race over another. Preference does not equal hate or supremacy. A preference is a preference. </p>

<p>Being that historically, people of the same race, ethnicity, and cultural, have lived more happily, safely, and prosperous, throughout history, gives credence to why people tend to agree with the ideology. Multiculturalism, does not work in the long run, hence why we are seeing what we see in the US, versus what&#39;s going on in say Iceland, the Nordics, Poland, Switzerland, etc etc. Supremacy would be ruling over minorities, White Nationalism would be having a homeland and trading/commerce with all. That&#39;s the difference.</p>

<p>Gay pride came about kind of in the same way.  All these gay people realized there&#39;s other gay people, and figured out that if they made a group or whatever that they could end the hatred against gays.</p>

<p>White pride though, I&#39;m not sure what to say.  I think if there wasn&#39;t that whole Jim Crowe period after the civil war, and I think if the KKK never was a thing, then maybe it could have been a successful thing.  If it was as simple as &quot;We&#39;re all white and we want to show our community that we&#39;re the best by making improvements that benefit the entire community&quot; then it could work.

<p>Race is a pretty meaningful way to differentiate between groups of people, especially when you look at a multiracial society like the US. You might disagree and say that genetic differences don&#39;t play a role in the disparities seen, but the topic is not settled.</p>

<p>In the US, identifying as &quot;white&quot; is most realistic since many people are a mix of different Europeans. </p>

<p>I disagree with your assumption that a white nationalist agrees with everything a &quot;Nazi&quot; believes. Just look at Jared Taylor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To give a little bit of perspective, white nationalists and black nationalists can agree basically entirely on what they want. Both groups feel that they would do better without having multiple cultures &quot;clashing&quot; and ruining their &quot;unity&quot;, they each think that the other group is &quot;holding their race back&quot;. </p>

<p>Is this sort of tribal thinking good? I don&#39;t think so at all. It does lead to conflict. However I can&#39;t say that either movement is equivalent with <em>supremacy</em>, it seems like the arguments start on the basis that the &quot;costs&quot; of multiculturalism aren&#39;t worth it, rather than that their race is better than the other race. It&#39;s certainly implied (ie. &quot;we would be better off without &#39;them&#39; dragging us down&quot;, for either tribe) but unless they take the step of blaming their problems on specific races themselves rather than the societal idea of multiculturalism (which is a very recent idea, hence it isn&#39;t quite so crazy to think some people would disagree with it) then they&#39;re still somewhat different. </p>

<p>Hence it is basically always a bad idea in practice, but from an idealist perspective it isn&#39;t so crazy (just like communism or something). So it&#39;s better to pick apart their argument by bringing up the unfortunate reality of how such an ideal would need to be implemented (which would be quite inhuman, deporting people based on race) rather than assuming that they only think such a thing because they&#39;re a hateful racist. They might just be naiive, since it&#39;s really easy to sell people on the negatives of multiculturalism - it also doesn&#39;t help that there does seem to be a weird agenda behind it](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5lHRxN-Do0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5lHRxN-Do0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a>). </p>

<p>So from my perspective, they aren&#39;t wrong that multiculturalism is an ideology to be critically considered at least. Does that mean we should end it? God no, that would be very inhuman. But not wanting to ramp it up even more isn&#39;t such a wrong thing either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, American history is filled with a long line of racists, eugenicists, slave-owners, those who committed genocide against natives, and some &quot;traitors&quot;. Basically all of their statues are dedicated to people who were flawed in some way. That&#39;s the way history works, trying to erase it doesn&#39;t help you overcome it. </p>

<p>America is a mix of cultures, hence I don&#39;t believe &quot;white people&quot; are any sort of a collective group (they are many totally different subcultures) and any arguments trying to lump white people together is usually either trying to declare them all evil or all superior (good ol&#39; American eugenics theory). So naturally, when the notion that they are all evil gains a lot of support, many will disagree and over-react and start thinking they&#39;re all superior instead. It&#39;s two sides of the same coin, and that terrible coin is the idea of treating &quot;white&quot; like it means anything. Whether you&#39;re calling &quot;white&quot; good or bad. </p>

<li><p>Nation of Islam is founded on the principle that white people have no souls and were made by an evil scientist named Yakub (I can&#39;t make this shit up) - they also believe in Dianetics and are partnered with Scientology. Some of the most popular African American figures like Louis Farrakhan and Malcolm X are from this movement. They had a march of 400,000 to 800,000 people on Washington DC in 1995. That isn&#39;t trivial support. </p></li>
<li><p>Most humanities programs at Universities teach this kind of Marxist logic of intersectionality and racist ideology. They judge everyone by skin colour and Whites are the most evil because they have been the most successful (ergo they must be suppressing all of those who are not as successful). </p></li>
<li><p>Very prevalent writers can spout this sort of blatant racism and get no backlash - see <a href="https://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/03/24/teen-vogue-writer-all-white-people-are-evil/">Teen Vogue writer</a> for example. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to be fair Critical Race Theory places more blame on society than white people themselves. Probably not the best example. However, it&#39;s still <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2012/03/critical_race_theory_a_cult_of_anti-white_resentment.html">not exactly neutral</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in law school, Barack Obama told an audience, &quot;Open up your hearts and your minds to the words of Professor Derrick Bell.&quot;  Bell is the same man who famously said, in a recorded television interview, &quot;I live to harass white folks,&quot; and proudly advocated what he called a &quot;radical&quot; ideology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again the more radical elements of &quot;Social Justice&quot; are really easy to find. There are a lot of people calling for &quot;replacement&quot; and saying that White people shouldn&#39;t have kids because that is perpetuating racism. I don&#39;t wanna be all tinfoil hat &quot;white genocide&quot; but the tone of the most extreme &quot;progressive&quot; types seems to have blatant implications that it isn&#39;t just the behaviour of white people that is the problem, it is the fact they exist at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? No, he endorsed someone who had thoughts like these </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory came around in the 1970s and ’80s as Bell and other law professors and activists became disillusioned with the results of the civil rights movement. Though blacks had supposedly gained equality before the law, they pointed out that whites continued to wield disproportionate power and enjoy superior standards of living. <strong>Classical liberal ideals such as meritocracy, equal opportunity, and colorblind justice, they said, actually served the white elite by cloaking and reinforcing society’s deep structural inequalities</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he&#39;s arguing that meritocracy is racist, equal opportunity is racist, and colorblind justice is racist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying racism is OK, I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t make someone a racist to disagree with people who don&#39;t believe in meritocracy and equal opportunity. If you want to know how deep their flawed assumptions go...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Derrick Bell and other legal scholars began using the phrase “critical race theory” in the 1970s as a takeoff on “critical legal theory,” a branch of legal scholarship that <strong>challenges the validity of concepts such as rationality, objective truth, and judicial neutrality.</strong> Critical legal theory was itself a takeoff on critical theory, a philosophical framework with <strong>roots in Marxist thought</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as objective truth or rationality, they do not believe it is possible for the law to be neutral, and they believe in these things because they are Marxists. </p>

<p>These ideas are not &quot;white people are evil&quot; but they basically imply it. They imply a system of equality isn&#39;t possible and that every injustice is because white <em>society</em> is evil. It&#39;s a non-coherent and philosophically void ideology, but disagreeing with it doesn&#39;t make anyone a racist, however obviously some people will go overboard and see it as an attack on their foundations of society (which isn&#39;t exactly wrong, that&#39;s what Frankfurt School tactics are all about) and then use it to justify racism instead. </p>

<p>But again my main point is that it is an ideology that doesn&#39;t believe in equality, hence it is fine to be a racist Critical Race Theory follower, why wouldn&#39;t you treat people based on their race? Since it is impossible to have equality, why wouldn&#39;t you treat white people differently than everyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m saying it is an <strong>extremely</strong> prevalent academic notion and that it goes as far as the President of the United States believing in such an ideology. Nobody should dislike anyone based on race, however insane Marxists like this want everyone to be in conflict (good ol&#39; Frankfurt ideology, destroy society through relentless criticism) and view everything in the lens of race (because treating people the same no matter what colour they are is racist). </p>

<p>Hence, when something this stupid gets extremely popular and is threatening the core values of our society, it is not a surprise that there is a reactionary ideology which uses it&#39;s own tenants against it. Both of those are stupid, racist movements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhh what about it is crazy? It&#39;s 100% founded in actual fact, do you have any idea about his history? Have you read &quot;Dreams of my Father&quot; and how much he loved Frank Marshall Davis (a registered Communist), he attended the April 1983 Socialist Scholars Conference  (100th anniversary of Karl Marx&#39;s death), he says of his time at school &quot;Barack Obama sought to prove he had not &quot;sold out&quot; to the system, so he consciously sought out the Marxist professors on campus&quot;, he was close with Bill Ayers, he gave public praise of Derrick Bell, he was close to Reverend Jeremiah Wright.... I mean is that just all a coincidence? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like Marxism isn&#39;t a common thing in Universities. <a href="https://www.academia.org/self-identifying-marxist-professors-outnumber-conservatives-as-college-professors/">18 percent of social scientist professors are self-proclaimed Marxists</a>, not including those who hold those beliefs privately. </p>

<p>Blaming it on &quot;omg black president&quot; is a bit disingenuous. Obama is a drastic departure from what is normal for US politics and was seeking to emulate the Swedish socialist model (no, not Communism). It&#39;s not racist for a significant part of the country to be drastically opposed to that, because it is not something seen before in American politics. So if you can explain why Obama <em>isn&#39;t</em> a Marxist even though he was inspired by Marxists, studied under Marxists, had close relationships with Marxists, and employed a brand of politics which was a spitting image of Marxism, maybe that&#39;d help me understand more. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a Communist. But he&#39;s certainly a Socialist, and that isn&#39;t the norm for US politics. A few decades ago, Marxism was the US&#39;s existential enemy. Expecting there <em>not</em> to be a public backlash against that and blaming it all on racism shows that you ignore policy and facts and only focus on race. Stop projecting your bigotry. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t join racist groups like the Alt-Right or the Republican Party and people won&#39;t call you a Nazi.

<p>How do they do that if they&#39;re not centralized? This is where we&#39;re having a disagreement. Alt-Right is a blanket term that encompasses a wide variety of political thinkers, not a defined group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahahaha that is literally the official story.  They had to dig deep into the group to get about 80% of the plane. Haahhaha you seem to not remember that the reason they claimed this was possible was because the soil was extremely soft because there used to be a mine there. They said the rest of the plane that didn&#39;t go underground broke off the went into the woods. Nice try though.</p>

<p>This is seriously the most basic common knowledge of the official story. You were wrong but people are wrong all the time but what is absolutely hilarious is that you thought nobody claimed the plane burried itself underground because you know it sounds absurd. </p>

<p>Go research the official recovery of flight 93. You were wrong and almost 3/4th of the plane supposedly burried itself underground hahaha</p>

If you did any research at all you&#39;d see that the incident was from Berkeley when people who wore all black, waved anarchist flags and called themselves anti-fascists tried burning the town down. But I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t Antifa.</p>

<p>You cant provide any evidence of antifa doing something good in the US other than fighting neo nazis in VA. You have nothing while I have 100+ hours of them causing violence on video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A one in a billion chance is still a chance though, isn&#39;t it? I doubt many of us can claim to be actual experts on what happens when an airliner blows up and what happens to everything that was inside said airliner. I realise it&#39;s an unlikely proposition, but the fact there&#39;s even intelligent life on this planet is an insanely unreasonable proposition, unlikely shit happens all the fuckin&#39; time. Could be that there&#39;s something fishy going on here, but when people point to that example as CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF COVERT FUCKERY it&#39;s definitely a bit of a reach.</p>

<p>As long as you have basic understanding of what happens when an airplane explodes then you basically know that there&#39;s  a million different variables. An expert can&#39;t tell you how the materials and luggage will fall. But a passport that is most likely in his bag or in his pocket is extremely unlikely to fall onto the sidewalk. Statistically the chances are insane.</p>

<p>But also the chance that we&#39;re  the ONLY life in the universe is 1 in 60,000,000,000 so if anything you shouldn&#39;t be surprised life exists.

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that there are a million variables, but i&#39;d say that makes it more likely that something that unusual would happen. We&#39;l never know what happened on that plane, perhaps he had his passport in his pocket but it fell out in some kind of altercation as they attempted to take over the cockpit (if that happened) or any other number of things. </p>

<p>Of course, the people who believe that it was some sort of plant may be completely correct! My issue isn&#39;t with people who think that may have been the case, rather people who refuse to entertain the notion that anything else happened, ya get me? </p>

<p>Many of the eye witness accounts of the (legitimate) people on the street suggest a missile rather than a plane. Also, when you look into the engine components themselves, with image comparison, they have been proven <em>not</em> to be parts that American Airlines used (IIRC the engine shielding is from another engine design).</p>

<p>Grouping the &quot;no-plane&quot; theory together with Alien energy weapons has been the real problem and the true dis-info. Aliens? That&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>No planes? If you think about it, it would make the execution of 9/11 orders of magnitude easier to execute on as a real life operation. No planes means no need for real physics, which would explain a lot. Further more, no dead passengers, no need for terrorists and must less to go wrong. I would also add that hitting to buildings directly in the center was technology that the US openly had in 2001. Missiles. No Alien weapons required.   </p>

<p>I guess my point is that the theories are not mutually exclusive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were definitely commercial airplanes that flew into the two main towers, I didn&#39;t watch on TV but saw it with my own eyes. </p>

<p>Focus on tower 7 and why the twin towers actually collapsed, they were built to withstand this exact scenario. They didn&#39;t collapse from the plane crash, that I am certain of. Someone was pushing buttons to drop those buildings. That&#39;s what it looked like to me. What happened after those planes crashed is sketchy at best. </p>

<p>One thing I will never forget is how they had been working on the towers for months leading up to this attack. The whole summer half the building seemed to be blocked off or full of workers. I thought &#39;sweet they&#39;re finally doing a proper overhaul&#39;... Oh yes. A proper overhaul indeed. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Soil">okay</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The slogan blood and soil is an English translation of German: <em>Blut und Boden</em>, <strong>a nineteenth century German idealization</strong> of a racially defined national body (&quot;blood&quot;) united with a settlement area (&quot;soil&quot;). By it, rural and farm life forms are not only idealized as a counterweight to urban ones, but are also combined with racist and anti-Semitic ideas of a sedentary Germanic-Nordic peasantry as opposed to (specifically Jewish) nomadism. The contemporary German concept Lebensraum, the belief that the German people needed to reclaim historically German areas of Eastern Europe into which they could expand, is tied to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not aware of Trump defending Nazis, what&#39;s your source on that?
I watched his controversial press conference and it seemed that he said, yes, there were bad people at that protest and that there were also more normal people who were there to protest statue removal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really agree that &#39;white supremacism&#39; is a defining feature for Trump and I look on these attempts to paint him like with suspicion. I think first and foremost he&#39;s a Trump Supremacist and he&#39;s going to try and do what he can to stay in power. This idea of &#39;political correctness gone crazy&#39; is a vote-winner for him so it doesn&#39;t surprise me that he&#39;s slow to condemn elements of the right. Again - I doubt there are that many actual <em>Nazis</em> in the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa are mostly anarchists, in which case they have no political goal except to stem the tide of fascism, which has been a historical past time. Not sure if you&#39;ve noticed but anarchists don&#39;t typically engage in our political system. Or in the case of paid instigators, they&#39;re there to rile up tension among the population to divide and conquer.</p>

<p>Fascism is unacceptable, history has extensively exhibited it in all its bloody light and racial bigotry has no place in society. It is primitive and destructive. It chills me to the bone that folks like yourself would likely not extend these same moral passes and courtesies to communists given the opportunity, and America has historically favored fascism and done its utmost to exterminate communism.</p>

<p>I wonder how you would&#39;ve reacted to the Pinkertons. Or the beatings and murders of trade unionists and labor leaders. How about that Night of Long Knives? This is all fascism entails. Violence and hatred, whether against working people or people with more melanin. Or do you think they&#39;re going to be kind to black people or Jews if they get a hold of power?</p>

<p>did you even <em>bother</em> to UTFSE and google them, maybe find out something about them <em>other than</em> what <em>you&#39;ve been told</em>? No  Of course not; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism isn&#39;t a genocidal ideology, though it&#39;s bad enough to have caused some genocides in the past.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that a Nazi rally is by definition a demonstration in favor of mass violence. I don&#39;t pretend that there&#39;s violence only on one side, but just because two sides have some nonzero amount of violence doesn&#39;t make them comparable. I am trying to relativize violence, and I&#39;m pitching advocating mass-murder of millions of people against a black rights movement that is largely non-violent. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying violence on any side, but Nazis and white supremacist are in favor of violence and it&#39;s ridiculous to chastise anti-Nazis for being violent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. What happened was that the President wanted there to be &quot;many sides&quot; that he could blame for being bad, instead of just one. So he took the alt-right and flipped it so that he could blame the left that they&#39;re as bad as the right, while in fact, they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Alt right is a term coined a few years ago by Richard Spencer. Spencer operates altright.com, which by the way currently has enlightening headline &quot;The Alt-Right And Antifa Are Exactly The Same&quot;. There are zero leftists who call themselves alt-left, though. The alt-left is a movement that doesn&#39;t exist. You&#39;re telling me now that it exists because Trump used the term and it&#39;s kinda convenient for you guys to have an equivalent other side that&#39;s just as bad. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t exist. SAD!</p>

<p>It would be good if more people know of white supremacy websites. That way they can&#39;t pretend not to know that they&#39;re much worse than leftist movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thread&#39;s title is about how Nazis are a manufactured narrative. One of the major differences between Nazis and the alt-left is that Nazis exist. No matter how manufactured you think the Nazi &quot;narrative&quot; is, the alt-left is a narrative literally made up by the government. Talk about manufactured.</p>

Tweeting blatantly anti Semitic comics, pretending not to know who David Duke is, not immediately saying anything about literal nazis when he has no problem talking shit about ANY OTHER PERSON OR GROUP. Of all the times for Trump to not be aggressively vocal he chose the worst one and they love it. They interpret it as a serious revival and they think they have political influence. And who knows, with the way that people refuse to hold their politicians accountable maybe they do if they can keep people in power who keep signaling to them through inaction. He has advisors and investigators who are telling him to blatantly disavow nazis because his actions embolden them. He is the president and what he does affects people. It is not unreasonable to want him to firmly distance himself from these people in every way when their leaders say unambiguously that they believe D Trump to be their rise from the ashes. That is not an unreasonable request. It&#39;s what his own advisors and political allies want. It&#39;s what you should expect at the very least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s actually kind of strange the way two distinctly different groups of horrible bigots are being conflated. National socialists hated Jews because the Jews had been scapegoated for the economic failings of Germany at the time. On the flipside, you have the Confederates from the Civil War. They fought for their states&#39; rights... specifically their right to own chattel slaves. </p>

<p>And the media&#39;s goal is to conflate these two historical groups with modern racists. The only thing is: nazis genocided Jews, Confederates enslaved Black people. What have Trump supporters done? Have Trump supporters committed genocide? Advocated genocide? Kept slaves? Advocated keeping slaves? What has Trump done on that level? That&#39;s the problem: Trump is a racist without a doubt, but he&#39;s nowhere near as terrible as the Nazis or the Confederates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One person was murderer and one person murdered her. Both groups might be violent, but on that day in that place only one group committed murder, only one group was lethally attacked. It&#39;s not weird to take that into consideration and to demand for the President to make that distinction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think (left or right) anyone is in any real confusion about what happened: Trump is not a Nazi but Nazis are (so far) loyal to him. He made a calculation, a bet that the grief he would take by not singling them out was worth the consolidation of the base. That by remaining ambiguous, he would keep more votes than he&#39;d lose. I don&#39;t think he gives a flying fuck about white nationalism, or militant antifa radicalism. He&#39;s not racist or anti-racist, he&#39;s a Trumpian and that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>I would also note that, so far, every time he has done such appallingly cynical calculations, he has been right. Spot on each and every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no fan of Trump either. He&#39;s a horrible human being who deserves prison for the crimes he&#39;s committed. Both crimes before being elected and war crimes since. But that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a Nazi and it doesn&#39;t mean people who like him are Nazis. Even if a very small amount of assholes who like Trump actually are neo-nazis like some of those folks in Charlottesville really are. Most of the people who voted for Trump were just trying to stop Clinton from winning. If Trump only had neo Nazis and such scum on his side, he probably wouldn&#39;t even crack 1%. </p>

<p>By the way, there aren&#39;t many who deny the atrocities committed by the Nazis altogether either. I&#39;ve been a regular contributor here for over a year and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve EVER seen anyone &quot;glorify Nazis&quot; either. Got a link to someone glorifying Nazis and not being immediately blown the fuck out for it? Most &quot;denials&quot; are just people saying that fewer people were killed/mistreated than are claimed by popular sources, and if you look at independent resources, there is good reason to believe that it&#39;s possible that far fewer people were killed than is claimed. That doesn&#39;t mean the Nazis didn&#39;t commit genocide, their crimes are documented and obviously many were treated inhumanely and murdered, but when the media is known to lie for political reasons, it would be foolish to accept their claims without extreme scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were quite a few more than 1 giving Nazi salutes. There were others with Nazi tattoos. There were many chanting &quot;blood and soil&quot;. There were other flags of other white supremacist groups too. I&#39;m not sure whether the number of actual Nazi flags is terribly important in this context. Yes, there is hype and outrage, because it&#39;s fucking Nazis and Klanners marching around, apparently newly emboldened to spread their message of hatred. What disturbs me almost as much as that is all the apologia, deflection and distraction floating around in response to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is. I think there are definitely opportunists out there taking advantage of the situation, but concern is also legitimate. Quietly, without a whole lot of politicizing off of it, white supremacist organizations have been steadily growing for about a decade. Their being emboldened is partially due to media highlighting them, but some of it is organic too. The number of online platform controversies involving this type of content has grown a lot recently and really imposed itself on companies (I&#39;m not defending all of the behaviors of all of these companies, just to be clear).</p>

<p>And many of these groups like Trump, rightly or wrongly. Political sociologists have observed a pretty common phenomenon. Groups with violent tendencies will act more violently when they feel the leadership is behind them. They believe, rightly or wrongly, that they can commit these types of crimes with impunity. We see it with Islamists targeting religious minorities, we see it with racial hate groups, and we see it with Hindu nationalist attacking religious minorities in India. It really isn&#39;t surprising to see these groups come out into the open and act more boldly in the United States. It&#39;s expected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t true. There was a steady increases from the 1999-2012, a brief reprieve, and a spike in 2015. The Southern Poverty Law Center is one organization that publishes this. Granted, they are biased political hacks. But their data isn&#39;t bad. They lump in a few non-hate groups into the mix to discredit them because of political difference, but deleting those cases wouldn&#39;t ruin the general trend. You also see similar patterns when you just look at KKK groups.</p>

<p>And if you look at these groups, it isn&#39;t just older people. There is been a wave of rather explicitly racist political candidates gaining power throughout Europe. These parties do not succeed without young voters. Looking at the most racist elements of the alt right in the United States, you see a lot of young activist involved with them. </p>

<p>To say &quot;only one guy&quot; there was a nazi is incorrect, however I agree that this whole thing has been blown out of proportion, especially considering the mindfuckingly high ratio of antifa protesters to the small group of far-right demonstrators.</p>

<p>5,000. They couldn&#39;t fill out a hotel event room for a meeting if they wanted to.</p>

<p>They have 0 political power. They have 0 social power. They don&#39;t have power to do much of anything really. They obviously preach a bad message, but for what it&#39;s worth they don&#39;t even seem to follow through with their hate speech. There hasn&#39;t actually been any notable or measurable white supremacist acts of crime, outside of Dylan Roof and the recent car ploughing. </p>

<p>There simply is not an epidemic of Nazism in America like the media portrays. It is one of the most smallest, ineffective, powerless groups in America.</p>

<p>Meanwhile illegal immigration crime, the opioid epidemic, ISIS terror attacks abroad, healthcare, North Korean belligerency, and Antifa anarchy packs vandalising the streets are all completely ignored by the media and take a back seat to some imagined, fake, powerless Nazi enemy.</p>

<p>Them priorities. Let&#39;s remove American Civil War monuments, and promote white loathing in the media, and attach the President to racism as much as possible. When the Left doesn&#39;t hold political power in the 3 branches, they whip racial tensions to epic proportions because social power is all they have left and they will use it to dethrone their political opponents.</p>

<p>Someone died. People are talking about it because a member of the group committed an attack on American soil and killed a person, in the name of that ideology.</p>

<p>Sometimes I read posts on this subreddit and wonder if you&#39;ve ever actually put any thought into the word &quot;news&quot;. People are talking about it because it just happened. People aren&#39;t talking about Russia because there&#39;s something bigger to talk about and there&#39;s a lull in Russia news as the investigation continues (there have been similar low news fortnights in the past, but people probably kept on Russia because there wasn&#39;t anything else breaking).</p>

<p>Sure, it all makes sense if you think Hillary is in her evil lair with her henchmen pulling levers and creating scandals for Trump. It also makes sense if you just... think about it for a second? People want to talk about new shit that&#39;s happening, so shit will dominate the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To say that only because organized crime and gang culture is not a recent development, that it should be disregarded and underreported is a little silly. It seems some people associate social justice and it&#39;s associated violence as if it is above the law. Crime is crime, although I do believe innocent until proven guilty. But not vigilant civilians being judge jury and executioner. So that begs the question why is one crime over sensationalized and the other under reported?

There are 10s of thousands of people who subscribe to these groups world wide. In the US there are around 950 separate white based hate groups some with hundreds of members each.  No, actual &#39;nazis&#39; probably aren&#39;t a threat but in the last 10yrs the rise in white hate groups has grown faster than any other time since the civil rights era. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you arbitrarily get to decide what a hate group is.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the &quot;About the NSM&quot; <a href="http://www.nsm88.org/aboutus.html">page</a> from the National Socialist Movement of America&#39;s website, while keeping in mind that this like probably all other self-proclaimed &quot;Nazi&quot; parties is an FBI honeypot (even Richard Spencer is an op and he doesn&#39;t even call himself a national socialist, just a &quot;white identitarian&quot;):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NSM&#39;s core beliefs include defending the rights of white people everywhere, preservation of our European culture and heritage, strengthening family values, economic self-sufficiency, reform of illegal immigration policies, immediate withdrawal of our national military from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation, and promotion of white separation. </p>

<p>The current two-party system is flawed, one in which each party in turn works to dismantle the work of the party formerly in power — and the cycle goes round and round, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars.  Progress is brought to a virtual halt as the two major parties spend most of their time bickering, rather than putting their country first! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, what vicious hatred! White people deserve the same self-determination as we encourage and enthusiastically cheer for literally other ethnicity? Those evil bastards!</p>

<p>The two party system is flawed? We should end the wars in the middle east?</p>

<p>What bitter hatred!!! They must be stopped!!! Makes me sick to see these hateful sons of bitches getting away with this! It&#39;s annudah Shoah!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not publicized as much, but do you remember the Bundy standoff?  Part of the reason there were very few convictions, especially for the ringleaders, is that the FBI sent more informants to the park than the Bundy&#39;s had in their inner circle, and that was just a minor group.  </p>

<p>Those mysteriously vanished from the face of the earth when they were unsuccessful in derailing Trump.  Predictable.</p>

<p>Then Trump was a tax cheat.  A tax cheat and when they finally DO get a hold of his taxes  it&#39;ll be impeachment time!  And...that fizzled out. </p>

<p>After that it was Russia.  The left suddenly hated Russia and now Trump and his friends and family were all Russian agents.</p>

<p>Now, if you can&#39;t get rid of Trump painting him as a Russian you get serious and play the only card left in the deck, you call him a Nazi.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is all within a single year.  And every time they&#39;ve done it the left has bought whatever the attack de jour was hook line and sinker.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people are getting tired of it though.  They probably lose a good chunk of people every time they accuse Trump of being something else unbelievably horrifying.  Really, Nazi.  Where do you go from there?  You guys are all in now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you think the Trump grope story was the first &quot;false narrative&quot; of the last decade only proves my point that you have the attention span and memory of a gnat.</p>

<p>And the rest of your post just proves your true agenda for making the original post; you&#39;re way more interested on defending Trump and bashing liberals than trying to present any kind of legitimature argument to your asinine as fuck claim. Are you new to the news media? Or the year 2017? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>op, it wasn&#39;t just that there was one person holding a flag, they were chanting neo-nazi memes, some holding KKK shields, some doing nazi salutes. It&#39;s not that there was one bad nazi and the rest were OK. They&#39;re all pretty much bad. </p>

<p>That said, you&#39;re right. A few hundred scumbags can exist in a population of 320 million without those scumbags ruining everything. I never interact with neo-nazis in my everyday life and most of you can probably make this claim too. Because neo-nazis make up something like .000001% of the population. They don&#39;t fucking matter, but the media loves pretending like they do. </p>

After all, imagine if US corporations will get more and more control of the government they will start acting more and more like those of nazi germany. Plus the imigration and artificial devision of the groups in the devide and conquer strat, means they need to artificially differintiate the idea of evil axis power and what they are doing.

All they would have to do to shut a lot of people up is just release one GOD DAMN clear video of a plane hitting the pentagon. THAT&#39;S IT!

    <div class="md"><p>So I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, OP. All it takes is one swastika flag.</p>

<p>Swastikas aren&#39;t just scary, they summon demons and spirits. They are far scarier than inverted pentagrams. Not even <em>Satanists</em> use swastikas, that&#39;s how demonic swastikas are. Swastikas are the most evil, evil, evil, evil shape in the entire universe of geometric shapes.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a swastika and slept soundly through the night? No, you haven&#39;t. Nobody has.</p>

<p>Anybody hauling out a swastika like that is opening a Pandora&#39;s box of demonic national socialist ghosts from 1939, and those are the scariest, most demonic forces the earth has ever known. You don&#39;t even want to know what those ghosts did back when they were living. It is unspeakable. I&#39;m not even going to speak of it. And you don&#39;t even want to know what national socialism is. I know what it is, but I&#39;m not going to tell you. It is unspeakable.</p>

<p>Most of antifa and BLM are just a bunch of screaming pussies that do nothing. But it was Heather Heyer that manned up had the good sense to be in the middle of the street - simultaneously stopping cars and racism. It is unfortunate that a man possessed by the demonic spirit of literally Hitler rammed his car into the antifa and BLM crowd - but if it wasn&#39;t for Heather Heyer putting her body between the car that was rammed and the car ahead of the car that was rammed, certainly more lives would have been lost.</p>

<p>So there is no doubt the man with the swastika flag unleashed the demonic spirit of Hitler, and that spirit invaded James Fields&#39;s body. But we can all count our blessings Heather Heyer was there to put her life on the line and stop the demonic forces of national socialism. Too bad she died.</p>

<p>Not only will James Fields get life, but the man with the swastika flag will probably get life too, as he is responsible for unleashing the ancient national socialist demons with his swastika flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about this topic in the US, but here in Europe, Nazi groups have been arround for a while and no-one gets particularly outraged by them. People simply don&#39;t pay attention to them, and therefore these groups are not that popular. The only thing that keeps them alive is Nazi-Antifa conflicts. As long as one of those groups exists, the other will also exist.
As an example, you can find many Nazi symbols and Antifa stickers posted in big cities, but nobody pays attention to them. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case as well in the US but instead media gives them a lot of coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is when you put 10 Nazis in front of a thousand peaceful sensible people who happen to disagree with you and use that as an excuse to brand everyone who you disagree with on anything as a Nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you&#39;re saying is just because nazis are vile you&#39;re more willing to ignore the fact that they harm your cause far more than they help it just because...actually I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re point is. Obviously people are complex and can share perspectives and opinions. That has nothing to do with anything I said. Just because I agree with a nazi that public parks should be maintained doesn&#39;t mean I want any of them to wave swastika flags and chant nazi chants at my community event to clean the park. That&#39;s bad optics and distracts from your message, and paints you as a nazi sympathizer. Any sensible person would at the very least move away from the nazis or refuse to march until they were gone. The fact that they didn&#39;t at a pro confederate statue rally was really really bad optics and now people are tearing down confederate states left and right. So no, siding with terrible people that people pretty much universally hate isn&#39;t excused because they happened to share their beliefs. I stand by what I said which was they should have told them to fuck off. </p>

<p>The GOP should thank their lucky stars you aren&#39;t head of the RNC. Not that it would make much of a difference at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even as a liberal and a Trump hater this whole thing makes my bullshit detector go off. I have listened to some interviews and seen some pictures and videos that do provide a good deal of evidence that AntiFa actually started the violence in Charlottesville. I would never defend any Nazis or white supremacists or their ideologies but at the same time I think AntiFa and the radicalized portions of BLM are fucking disgraceful. I listened to an interview with an innocent bystander lady who was in a resturant right where the shit all went down. She said how they saw a half dozen charter busses pull up outside and BLM and AntiFa people poured off them and immediately started rioting and attacking the white supremacists in the area. She said they were throwing bricks, plastic bottles filled with concrete and condoms and balloons filled with feces. She said that prior to the busses arriving there were black and white people from both sides in the resturant she was in and they were discussing the removal of the statues and were doing it perfectly civilly. As soon as the busses of counter-protesters showed up is when the situation turned violent. She actually thought the AntiFa people were neo-nazis because she had no idea what AntiFa is (and you must admit they certainly look the part). The people from the resturant were evacuated out the back door and an old man who was with his 7 year old great granddaughter got his arm broken by a flying brick. The alley that the resturant patrons were evacuated to was the alley where the death occured. She said they saw the guy in the Charger get told by police that he couldn&#39;t get through that way and he said, &quot;I&#39;ll get through&quot; and tried it. He hit some people and couldn&#39;t get through because of other vehicles blocking the alley. He then tried to back up and hit some more people. The lady said she saw numerous people be injured by the car but also saw a few people slam their hands on the car and lay down on the sidewalk and fake injury. The  lady who was relating the story was totally traumatized by the whole incident and she and the other resturant patrons were trying to leave the scene because they wanted no part of it and had kids with them but the police kept them trapped there because they were trying to contain a riot and made no distinction between the rioters and the innocent people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her tale sounded pretty horrific and she was crying periodically in the telling of it. I think about if I was in a similar situation as the dude in the car and I have to admit that if I was suddenly set upon by a violent mob who outnumbered me 50-1, I might run a few of them over in my attempt to get the fuck out of there. It sucks that that woman got killed but the reality of it is that she was not a hero. She was not a peaceful protestor. She was part of a violent mob bent on fucking up some Nazis. So as much as I hate Trump, and I think he should have denounced the Nazis immediately because it&#39;s a no brainer, he then could have denounced the AntiFa idiots because the actual fact is that THEY started the violence. What Trump said about there being violence on all sides was technically correct even if it did come off like he was supporting the white supremacists. I am becoming increasingly embarrassed by the left because they are resorting to the same tactics of &quot;spin&quot; and &quot;alternative facts&quot; that the right wing dipshits have been using for twenty years. I find it insulting to my intelligence when they do it and I am even more insulted when my own side resorts to the same ridiculous tactics. When Nazis and KKK assholes exercise their rights to free speech and peaceful protests the thing to do is roll your eyes, shake your head and yell &quot;fuck you Nazi shitheads!&quot;, not start a violent riot and attack them. I say fuck stupid Nazis and fuck stupid AntiFa as well. People keep saying that you can&#39;t equate the recent violence done by radical leftists to all the violence that has been done over the years by Nazis and KKK assholes and I agree. You cannot equate the two... not yet at least, but they are moving in that direction. More violence and disregarding the right to free speech is not going to make anything better.</p>

<p>This is the interview with the lady who was the eyewitness. It was from r/conspiracy so if you look at that thread it is all about how they think the BLM/AntiFa/KKK/Nazis all came on the same busses and started a riot as a false flag operation but that is not what I think happened. I think the lady just does not know about AntiFa and was mistaking them for neo-Nazis and she was confused by all the chaos and trauma she experienced. There were a few pictures from a twitter that got taken down but I saw them before it happened since I was in that thread from the beginning and they showed BLM and AntiFa  people getting off the busses but not any KKK or Nazis so I think the lady was just confused. Since I am a liberal and a skeptic I am usually getting called a shill in that sub just for being a voice of reason but I think they are on to something even though I don&#39;t think it was all a false flag concocted entirely by George Soros and the (((joos))). The lady&#39;s account of the situation does certainly conflict with the official mainstream narrative. I really don&#39;t see how these people on the left think BLM and AntiFa are somehow just benign peaceful protesters. You don&#39;t dress up in riot gear to go protest peacefully. All liberals are not gentle, pacifist, snowflake cucks. I know this for a fact since I grew up as an angry punk-rock anarchist kid who has beat the fuck out of my fair share of Nazis. At little punk rock shows I would go to sometimes some Nazi punks would show up and start brandishing their tattoos and sieg-heiling in the pit. There was no security guards so we would stop the show and drag the fuckers outside and beat the shit out of them. I don&#39;t feel the least bit bad about it. Stomping a Nazi in the face feels fucking great and I highly recommend it. I have a good friend who spent 18 months in prison for beating a Nazi half to death with a baseball bat. If I were 20 years younger I would probably be right there alongside these AntiFa idiots dressed in black and throwing molotov cocktails with the specific intent to injure or kill some Nazis. I fucking hate Nazis but facts is facts and it sure looks to me like AntiFa started the violence in Charlottesville.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nazi hysteria is created by the media to try and negatively smear white identitarians from having their views heard by the public. The white nationalists have some legitimate concerns about the anti-white discrimination that they are seeing within society. With the communists/anti-fascists movement being a clear example of the problems white people face, with their anti-white sentiment and hate for white history and the white establishment (trump). </p>

<p>The jews have encouraged a narrative since ww2 that white nationalism is the evil racism that must be defeated in the world. When in reality, white nationalism is a reaction to anti-white communism. Similar types of anti-white people as anti-fifi murdered 30 million white russians, including the monarchy about 100 years ago, not very long ago. So when white men try and get together to speak about this existential threat to white culture and heritage, it at the least deserves the right to be heard without being attacked and being labelled genocidal maniacs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve still only seen a picture of one person at the charlotsville rally holding a Nazi flag (the man in the green shirt), and no more than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a bit disingenious to think that the swastika is the only Nazi (or fascist) symbol or iconology.</p>

<p>First of all, hundreds of the white nationalists were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIpE1B7BTvk">chanting &quot;blood and soil,&quot;</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Soil">literal Nazi slogan</a>, the night before the main events the next day, so we aren&#39;t talking about just Nazi swatika flags here. Second of all, many different <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3407239.1502598317!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/fields13n-6-web.jpg">fascist symbols</a> (the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VmQCzYu4rI/hqdefault.jpg">fasces</a> is popular <a href="https://nyheteridag.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/charlottesville-fascister.jpg?ver=1502728139">among white nationalists</a>) were <a href="https://cdn01.theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/08/free-speech-rally-charlottesville-1502633619-feature-hero.jpg">present</a> on the <a href="https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/nazi-flags-charlottesville.jpg?quality=100&amp;amp;w=650">flags</a> and <a href="http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/64/70/42/13863047/3/1024x1024.jpg">shields</a> of the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/charlottesville-2ndld-writethru-9681e7b6-7f7c-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e.jpg?w=620">white nationalists</a>, including the <a href="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/08/RTS1BJNT/lead_960.jpg?1502658819">National Socialist Movement</a>, which shows the use of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_Volksdeutsche_in_Croatia.svg/2000px-Flag_of_Volksdeutsche_in_Croatia.svg.png">Othala or Odal rune</a> instead of the swastika by some Nazis to avoid the negative connotations of the swastika. </p>

<p>Of course, many white nationalists still prefer to use <a href="http://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Charlottesville-Fascists.jpg">the Confederate battle flag as their white nationalist symbol</a> of choice.  </p>

<p>BTW, the NSM or <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/klcc/files/styles/x_large/public/201708/Flickr_RodneyDunning.jpg">National Socialist Movement flags</a> were <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2017/08/white_nationalists_in_Charlottesville_Virginia_170812_insert_by_Charles_Butler.jpg">all over the place</a> at the rally, so, yes, the Nazis had a strong presence there. The problem is that most people don&#39;t know what to look for when they see these images.</p>

<p>You can see a lot of the above in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GzXY902hbo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GzXY902hbo</a></p>

<p>As it is, <a href="http://www.occupy.com/sites/default/files/field/image/shdpkvp.jpg">fascists from all over the world</a> use different iconography than just the swastika as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the narrative of &quot;Antifa vs Nazis&quot; is totally wrong as there are hardly any Nazis at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t true. Did you even try to do any research on the groups that were present there, or watch any interviews with any of the organizers? Because you seem ill-equipped to make a judgement on the white nationalist groups that comprised the Unite the Right rally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again: ONE PERSON at the rally was holding a Nazi flag. While I disagree with the aims of the rally in general, to even call it a &quot;Nazi rally&quot; was highly disingenuous and not descriptive of reality. But one picture of a person holding a flag is alll it takes to whip a country into mass hysteria</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand the reality that was on the ground in Charlottesville, and I feel as if you are doing spreading disinformation here to deflect away from events that happened in Charlottesville. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the &quot;About the NSM&quot; <a href="http://www.nsm88.org/aboutus.html">page</a> from the National Socialist Movement of America&#39;s website, while keeping in mind that this like probably all other self-proclaimed &quot;Nazi&quot; parties is an FBI honeypot (even Richard Spencer is an op and he doesn&#39;t even call himself a national socialist, just a &quot;white identitarian&quot;):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NSM&#39;s core beliefs include defending the rights of white people everywhere, preservation of our European culture and heritage, strengthening family values, economic self-sufficiency, reform of illegal immigration policies, immediate withdrawal of our national military from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation, and promotion of white separation. </p>

<p>The current two-party system is flawed, one in which each party in turn works to dismantle the work of the party formerly in power — and the cycle goes round and round, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, American history is filled with a long line of racists, eugenicists, slave-owners, those who committed genocide against natives, and some &quot;traitors&quot;. Basically all of their statues are dedicated to people who were flawed in some way. That&#39;s the way history works, trying to erase it doesn&#39;t help you overcome it. </p>

<p>America is a mix of cultures, hence I don&#39;t believe &quot;white people&quot; are any sort of a collective group (they are many totally different subcultures) and any arguments trying to lump white people together is usually either trying to declare them all evil or all superior (good ol&#39; American eugenics theory). So naturally, when the notion that they are all evil gains a lot of support, many will disagree and over-react and start thinking they&#39;re all superior instead. It&#39;s two sides of the same coin, and that terrible coin is the idea of treating &quot;white&quot; like it means anything. Whether you&#39;re calling &quot;white&quot; good or bad. </p>

<p>I am skeptical, not sure how that huffpo article or video actually implicates O&#39;keefe though.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t make it false that Bob Creamer, a top democrat official who visited the whitehouse on the reg, was on under cover video talking about plans to incite violence at political rallyd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hate all of muslims and I think the war on terror is bullshit but your statistic is wrong and the news makes it up.</p>

<p>They said there has been more deaths by far right wing extremists. The problem is they don&#39;t include deaths like the pulse night club shooting into their statistics. They don&#39;t consider that terrorism.</p>

<p>If you include the Pulse nightclub shooting then that one event alone has killed more than &quot;nazis&quot; have in the past few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting your numbers from an outdated and cherry picked article.  I know because I&#39;ve researched it the last time it came up.  It leaves out 9/11 for some strange reason and is also too old to include things like the Pulse shooting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and can barely acknowledge the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not publicized as much, but do you remember the Bundy standoff?  Part of the reason there were very few convictions, especially for the ringleaders, is that the FBI sent more informants to the park than the Bundy&#39;s had in their inner circle, and that was just a minor group.  </p>

<p>Just because they&#39;re not as loud as you want the gov to be doesn&#39;t mean that nothing is happening.  </p>
