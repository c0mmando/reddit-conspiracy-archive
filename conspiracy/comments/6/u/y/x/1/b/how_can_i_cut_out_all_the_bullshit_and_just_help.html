I only did a little thing, but his look of genuine appreciation and shock has brought tears to my eyes several times today. His hug was more authentic than the one from the &quot;friend&quot; who is totally blowing me off to get laid tonight.  ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot control others. You can only control yourself. Being the change means living differently, than those that are unjust. A peaceful resolve, can stand as a more powerful role model, than any Superman.</p>

<p>Smile through hardship. Embrace suffering. Practice humility and charity. These are all parts to the truth, but are not close to the whole.</p>

<p>In the end, we must understand our personal power and ability, and use each according to the purpose of life.</p>

<p>The purpose must survive. The light is the truth. The truth is in you. The truth is you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly suggest living in this world, whle not being of this world.</p>

<p>&quot;This world&quot;, in that statement means the earthly or lowly aspects of humanity. Of course I do believe we are of this world, and really what that vaguely spiritualist sounding advice means is to make a suggestion that will help people live a life that is happy. It seems true happiness cannot be forced, and is based on what the body/self truly wants. We are more than the aspirations of our mind (actualization). The body wants food, shelter, a future and survival of a group, etc. When we do not do these things, we become unhappy, and many people are so distracted that they do not even realize who they are and what they need or want. They are decieved from birth to follow pre-made tracks in their minds, their activities, and their chosen functions. </p>

<p>The key to life is to have imagination. The power of the will is greater than we are at first aware of. Everything depends on the will of the individual(s). When we choose to be happy, our world seems brighter. We percieve things differently, when we are not constantly on guard; we have the ability to percieve instead of judging only. Judgements should be temporary and can be tools for communication, which serves as a means of learning. </p>

<p>Where was I? In truth, not any man can tell you how to live. I can tell you that many people have lived in many very different ways,  and at a time in history when many only see two colours of faces, truly there is as much wonderful diversity in life than most are aware of.</p>

<p>Life is not lost, when we act as stewards of our earth and each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t drop bombshells all at once. Just give them one major indicator that the world has a parasite on it that is sucking the 99% dry. </p>

<p>For example, you can just say that the federal reserve is a parasite setup by deep state cabal members to eventually bankrupt America and that they have almost accomplished this goal. That is why the economy fell apart since 2009. This touches home because nobody wants to struggle financially yet everyone is. </p>

<p>Let them think about that for a few weeks. 1 major bombshell is enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest questions have the most difficult answers. What motivates you to help others? Can you help others when you are broken? Should you make small steps, or use your knowledge to work for a greater, more global Change? Perhaps it&#39;s just a passing dream.

    <div class="md"><p>We are most effective within our sphere of influence. Our sphere of influence begins with ourselves, and extends out to our family, our friends, our local community, and then into the wider world. We are most effective at helping and changing ourselves; if we aren&#39;t in a good place where our needs are being met, it&#39;s difficult to be effective in helping others. </p>

<p>We generally have the best understanding of ourselves, our family, our friends and our community and this is where we can be most effective. A North American who suddenly uproots themselves and moves to India or Africa or Afghanistan and tries to enact positive change is likely to encounter unexpected barriers, such as differences in culture and language, and different economic realities. </p>

<p>Look for local community food security groups or outreach; if you aren&#39;t satisfied, you can start your own community group. Work to make your own community more resilient to disaster, and help to support those who can not support themselves. </p>
