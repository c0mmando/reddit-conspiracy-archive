       That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Need is the mother of motivation. Once your needs are met, there's nothing else to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a million different fields of study, thanks to need.

        Will only take you so far. We
        <em>
         might
        </em>
        have philosophy in a socialist state, but that's about it. You can forget about big screen TV's, Nvidia GPU's, and canned whip cream.  You can forget about ANYTHING which will allow you to be a pink flamenco.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Where does this communist theory come from? Is it from the incredibly distorted belief in "primitive commune"? Which isn't even remotely proven to have taken place. You can also forget about empires, and buildings reaching into the skies, and you can definitely
      </p>
      <p>
       People barely get an education as things are right now. Yet, you think if we make it EVEN EASIER on them, they somehow will?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me: what do we do with all the property in existence when socialism comes to town?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we burn down all the mansions, heck, all the houses to insure one persons isn't bigger than the others? Perhaps one person has a tree in their yard, where another doesn't, yet they want fucking trees too? I could sit here all day, and list the many ways in which socialism WILL NEVER WORK.

       99th percentile is out of all the population. People who take the GED test are no different than anyone else. Might be some socioeconomic differences, but that isn't relevant. In other words, it translates.

       I would even argue that it's harder for the brightest students to make it through school, just as a result of the rigidity of education verses the roundness of knowledge. I always saw my teachers as oppressors. Here:

       There's no motivation to get a higher education in a socialist system. Therefore, you won't have the high technology sciences. It may be an ugly thing, but need is indeed more motivating than curiosity, and it creates a wider field of study and professionalism because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It differs from socialism because it is the
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       of capitalism, as capitalism is literally the power of capital. Governments run on capital, you can't have them without it. You can have a tribal government, but again, no technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you believe that if you work hard, you deserve to be compensated according to what you put in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Business owners don't get anything for free. This is one of the most silly things ever posited. Starting a business is incredibly hard for most people. Most businesses fail because of this. It's an enormous risk, and a significant investment, and it constantly requires a different kind of work than what the workers do, but it's work all the same. It's a two way street: the business owner makes a profit, the worker takes home a check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people in America are employed by
       <em>
        small
       </em>
       business owners, not huge corporations with disgusting fat cats riding to work everyday in a limo. That's only a small portion of business owners, literally the 0.01%. That's the people we have a problem with. There's no need to upset the balance of the 99.9% of the population
       <em>
        just to punish them
       </em>
       . It's just a trick to get us to descend into Marxism.

       Just to answer your question about property, there wouldn't be any private ownership of land or collection of rent or mortgage intrest. All the types of jobs and incomes we have now would still exist EXCEPT for income that is not the result of any time of labor, so no more interest, rent, stocks etc.

       Don't worry dude, the country wouldn't collapse if we made the elite actually earn their money like the rest of us by working.

       That's you. but there are people who are different than you. If you want to live on the poverty minimum And hang out in the woods and fish all the time there are plenty of ways to do that in the existing system. And yet people still want to learn stuff and do amazing things with their scant time on earth. Sounds crazy I know.

       I wouldn't do it either- I'd be amassing an army to overthrow whatever military the socialists had. Would some units have rainbow flags on your side, I wonder?

       Personal fulfillment can exist without economic (capitalist)  incentives. Many reasons can exist beyond employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing keeping me from additional education is economic pressure to maintain my current income/lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flexibility in employment is a benefit. We know that industries rise and fall, become obsolete or replaced by newer technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reducing the burden of acquiring education would improve the ability of the workforce to shift with these changing demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside perspectives can provide unique insight to other industries, a well educated workforce will have freedom to find work which suites their personal preferences and be more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely a worker with little or obsolete education will be limited to low paying low skill work and would have little opportunity to improve their education without assistance.

        But it wouldn't create half as many fields of study as we have. It our current economic climate, people have to search far and wide for ways to set themselves apart from the crowd, and that forces us to be more creative, because our basic needs are met. I seriously doubt that basic needs will be met in a socialist system- it doesn't have any money, it doesn't even have roads and cars.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It is our class based society that allows us to have colleges, roads, hospitals, cars and PlayStation's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Class based society allows us to have dangerous jobs that pay more than others (fixing power plants, etc). When one job pays more than another because of the risk involved, those workers have nicer houses.

      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How do you even get to work? Taxes pay for roads, and schools.
       </strong>
       Socialism doesn't have any capital, capitalism has nothing but capital.

       Governments literally run on capital.

        Who pays for your schools? Who built them? Who pays for the text books, and how do people get back and forth without roads?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Remember, education is free in a socialist system. All needs are free, and they don't collect taxes. They can barely make payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not imaging a socialist system, you're imagining a mixed government, and guess what? I agree with your sentiments, but I will not support getting rid of my free will, and living for the group. I think socialism is disgusting in the sense that it treats humans as though they are a group organism. One big squirming maggot.

      <p>
       The perfect form of government is a blend of capitalism and socialism.

       You are just wrong about the motivation to get a higher education piece. It's jut an ignorant non starter argument. If people wanted to live at the poverty line and not work they would do so now and we still have plenty of people studying.

       99th percentile is out of all the population. People who take the GED test are no different than anyone else. Might be some socioeconomic differences, but that isn't relevant. In other words, it translates.

       I would even argue that it's harder for the brightest students to make it through school, just as a result of the rigidity of education verses the roundness of knowledge. I always saw my teachers as oppressors. Here:
