        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If we make transgenderism a social or civil rights issue, then we are going to fight for it to be accepted and funded. This is going to roll out lots of new bills about the way to treat transgender, transgender in practice, and its subsequent medical implications. </p>

<p>When the Trans Movement becomes more normal, we now push for people who identify as trans to seek the ability to fulfill their wish to transition and with that will be an issue of funding. </p>

<p>The people who identify as trans and want an operation will need some way of funding that since it&#39;s going to cost thousands of dollars to do and probably even more to support post-surgery. With this being a civil rights issue, Democrats will more than likely push for funding for transition surgeries and life post-op. I only say Democrats because that is the party who is associated with those kinds of concerns. </p>

<p>Socially, we will fight about whether or not being trans is natural or a product of their environment (because clearly that matters right?). But with the advent of the Political Correct and anti-hate movement, we have actively removed critique. Turning yourself into another gender is not natural by any stretch of the imagination. You have actively defied nature by deciding that the gender you have was not at all the gender you were supposed to have. When there is an assertion of gender dysphoria being a mental health issue, we’re told it’s not usually. Even worse, to say that you think it’s a mental health condition is to be <em>transphobic.</em> </p>

<p>Anything you speak out against with regards to the transgender movement is transphobic. </p>

<p>Now, consider that maybe transgenderism is a &#39;nature&#39; thing but no more a nature thing than having cerebral palsy or some other neurological abnormality. Meaning - it’s basically possible for it to exist but statistically far below average. Honestly, what evolutionary advantage does this play at all? Who does it benefit to feel like you&#39;re born in the wrong body? Yet people say it&#39;s not a mental health issue. Okay, so now we turn to the case of nurture: </p>

<p>You&#39;d have to be naive to proclaim that the expression of any popular movement doesn’t affect people on a psychological level. If that weren’t the case, the movements wouldn’t exist as they&#39;d have no impact. With the push towards “acceptance” we now are able to inject transgender imagery, reference, allegory and character into any medium we want and to <em>not</em> to do that is, again, to be transphobic (or at best, non-inclusive). People actually don’t realize how much they are influenced subconsciously. I argue that while gender dysphoria does exist, our society is unnaturally progressing it forward. </p>

<p>So, why would the government do that? Well I have a few reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Transgender patients now become consenting government research for transhumanism. </p></li>
<li><p>Massive wave of sterilization. </p></li>
<li><p>Another way to push people to get invasive surgeries they don’t need (plastic surgery being the first), further fueling the medical business which will subsequently fuel the plastic surgery business. And if you can make people out of plastic AND change their genitals on a whim, you’re one step closer to creating the cyborgs you want to optimize the human race with. </p></li>
<li><p>Once the transgender patients are out of surgery, they essentially become a time-series sample point into a huge study the government is secretly doing on the psychological effects of sex-changes and how they can improve their efficiency. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>But of course, all of this conjecture is transphobic. </p>

<p>Question: How can gender be a social construct but gender dysphoria not be? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good thing you went with <em>Noetherian</em> rings for your username, because the nonsense in this post doesn&#39;t appear to satisfy the descending chain condition.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: it&#39;s really, really simple to explain why we transition: because it provably by both statistics and anecdote makes us happier. No conspiracy is necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But with the advent of the Political Correct and anti-hate movement, we have actively removed critique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize that a party that openly rejects trans people wholesale currently has unchallenged control of the US government, right? There&#39;s a difference between &quot;people will, rightly, think you&#39;re a dick if you just start ranting about how someone isn&#39;t a Real Man<sup>TM</sup>&quot; and &quot;you are literally unable to be critical&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turning yourself into another gender is not natural by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...says the abstract mathematician on the internet. The only things that are natural are shitting in the woods and dying of cholera. Everything past that is artificial and we should be grateful for that every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have actively defied nature by deciding that the gender you have was not at all the gender you were supposed to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nature is not a person, and does not intend things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything you speak out against with regards to the transgender movement is transphobic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean...yes, actively opposing trans peoples&#39; acceptance and legitimacy is transphobic. That&#39;s literally what the word means. What&#39;s your point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, what evolutionary advantage does this play at all? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evolution, as a theory, does not say anything about what someone <em>should</em> or <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> do. All it does is state a tautology: things that reproduce more will have more offspring and therefore their genes will be present more often in the next generation. That doesn&#39;t imply any sort of moral imperative to reproduce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who does it benefit to feel like you&#39;re born in the wrong body?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again: nature is not a consciousness and does not intend things. There does not need to be a benefit to a thing for it to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People actually don’t realize how much they are influenced subconsciously. I argue that while gender dysphoria does exist, our society is unnaturally progressing it forward. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like that over the past few years, we&#39;ve gone from &quot;no one&#39;s really trans, chemicals in the water are doing it&quot; to &quot;well obviously it&#39;s a real thing but somehow it&#39;s still eeeeeeevil!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another way to push people to get invasive surgeries they don’t need (plastic surgery being the first), further fueling the medical business which will subsequently fuel the plastic surgery business</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total money to be had from SRS every year is considerably lower than the total cost of toothpaste in the same period. And yet there&#39;s a remarkable lack of conspiracies about Big Dental making up cavities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But of course, all of this conjecture is transphobic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d have just gone with &quot;silly&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Question: How can gender be a social construct but gender dysphoria not be? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For one, &#39;gender is a social construct&#39; usually refers to gender <em>roles</em>, not gender <em>identity</em> (for which we have good evidence of a physiological cause).</p>

<p>But let&#39;s set that aside for a second. &quot;Social construct&quot; does not mean &quot;nonexistent&quot; or &quot;meaningless&quot;. Lots of social constructs - like, say, money - are important to perfectly rational and healthy people. If someone&#39;s depressed because they&#39;re in severe poverty, that&#39;s a normal and accepted, if perhaps not wholly healthy, response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trans can&#39;t even define wgat they really are, just because it can be doesn&#39;t mean it should philosophically be done. Intelligent trans-people should by definition be the most trans-skeptical since it&#39;s literally their skin that&#39;s on the line. Ultimate realization that physical change is not required is the best way to escape the existential dilemma of trans dysphoria, not because their condition is not real, but because the minimalist skeptical approach is the most illuminating of all: &#39;All is flux, nothing stays still&#39;--yet, to make it literal outside ourselves is to distract ourselves from a true understanding of this profound insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several:</p>

<p>One, Napoleon Guy has a clear and persistent misunderstanding of material fact (that is, a delusion) because he is unaware of the fact that Napoleon is did. A trans person, on the other hand, knows perfectly well what anatomy they do or don&#39;t have, they simply don&#39;t like it (and preferences by definition cannot be delusional).</p>

<p>Two, Napoleon Guy probably cannot demonstrate some sort of material similarity to Napoleon. Trans people can, as gender identity does indeed appear to be at least partially biological. A <a href="http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract">few</a> studies <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418">show</a> patterns <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289">typical</a> of a trans person&#39;s identified gender in their brain, certain conditions <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;amp;pg=PA52&amp;amp;lpg=PA52&amp;amp;dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=jDzI2rtV5S&amp;amp;sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&amp;amp;ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&amp;amp;f=false">like PCOS</a> greatly elevate one&#39;s chances of being trans, and cases like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer">David Reimer</a> that assumed that gender identity was formed and not born ended pretty badly. There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022236">this study</a>, which found that boys who were reassigned as girls at birth due to extreme deformities of their penises had a better than 50-50 chance of &quot;declaring themselves male&quot; by their mid-teens (one imagines some others will later).</p>

<p>Three, Napoleon Guy either generally does not function properly in his day to day life, and humoring his delusion generally does not help him be any better off. Trans people, on the other hand, are demonstrably <em>much</em> better off post-transition: among other things, hormones treat dysphoria-related depression much more effectively than do actual antidepressants. Here are a few studies on that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract">Colizzi et al., 2013</a> found a p &lt; 0.001 elevation in the stress hormone cortisol for trans people pre-transition, which undergoes a p &lt; 0.001 decline during transition and ends up in normal ranges.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168">Gomez-Gil et al., 2012</a> found highly significant (p-values in the .001 to .03 range) differences between transitioned and un-transitioned trans people, including a 50% lower rate of anxiety and a 75% lower rate of depression. It&#39;s worth noting that 75% less depression is more than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0087089/">literal anti-depressants do</a> in normal cases.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract">de Vries, et al., 2014</a> studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls. No elevation in suicide rate or attempts whatsoever.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19359705.2011.581195#.Vb1Tkvmsj0E">Meier, et al. 2011</a> studies FTM transitioners: &quot;Results of the study indicate that female-to-male transsexuals who receive testosterone have <strong>lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress</strong>, and higher levels of social support and health related quality of life. <strong>Testosterone use was not related to problems with drugs, alcohol, or suicidality.</strong> Overall findings provide clear evidence that HRT is associated with improved mental health outcomes in female-to-male transsexuals.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461468">Ainsworth, et al. 2010</a> finds that &quot;[t]here [i]s no statistically significant difference in the mental health-related quality of life among transgendered women who had GRS, FFS, or both&quot; relative to the general female population, but that &quot;[m]ental health-related quality of life was statistically diminished (P &lt; 0.05) in transgendered women without surgical intervention compared to the general female population and transwomen who had gender reassignment surgery (GRS)&quot;. In other words, surgery closes the gap in well-being between trans people and the general public.</p></li>

<p>Turning yourself into another gender is not natural by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently learned that with male to female sex change surgery the fake vagina is in reality an opened wound that will naturally heal, if not dilated with dildo devices almost daily for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>I feel they are being taken advantage of for the surgery is a goldmine to doctors &amp; insurance wants in on the big money action. The money factor likely reduces chances of reluctant council to have them avoid surgery &amp; increase chances for recommendation. </p>

<p>I think cosmetic surgery is often botchery to beauty. </p>
