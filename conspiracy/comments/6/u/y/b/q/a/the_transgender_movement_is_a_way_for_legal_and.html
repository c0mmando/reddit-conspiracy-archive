       If we make transgenderism a social or civil rights issue, then we are going to fight for it to be accepted and funded. This is going to roll out lots of new bills about the way to treat transgender, transgender in practice, and its subsequent medical implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Trans Movement becomes more normal, we now push for people who identify as trans to seek the ability to fulfill their wish to transition and with that will be an issue of funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who identify as trans and want an operation will need some way of funding that since it's going to cost thousands of dollars to do and probably even more to support post-surgery. With this being a civil rights issue, Democrats will more than likely push for funding for transition surgeries and life post-op. I only say Democrats because that is the party who is associated with those kinds of concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socially, we will fight about whether or not being trans is natural or a product of their environment (because clearly that matters right?). But with the advent of the Political Correct and anti-hate movement, we have actively removed critique. Turning yourself into another gender is not natural by any stretch of the imagination. You have actively defied nature by deciding that the gender you have was not at all the gender you were supposed to have. When there is an assertion of gender dysphoria being a mental health issue, we’re told it’s not usually. Even worse, to say that you think it’s a mental health condition is to be
       <em>
        transphobic.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything you speak out against with regards to the transgender movement is transphobic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, consider that maybe transgenderism is a 'nature' thing but no more a nature thing than having cerebral palsy or some other neurological abnormality. Meaning - it’s basically possible for it to exist but statistically far below average. Honestly, what evolutionary advantage does this play at all? Who does it benefit to feel like you're born in the wrong body? Yet people say it's not a mental health issue. Okay, so now we turn to the case of nurture:
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to be naive to proclaim that the expression of any popular movement doesn’t affect people on a psychological level. If that weren’t the case, the movements wouldn’t exist as they'd have no impact. With the push towards “acceptance” we now are able to inject transgender imagery, reference, allegory and character into any medium we want and to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to do that is, again, to be transphobic (or at best, non-inclusive). People actually don’t realize how much they are influenced subconsciously. I argue that while gender dysphoria does exist, our society is unnaturally progressing it forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why would the government do that? Well I have a few reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Transgender patients now become consenting government research for transhumanism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Massive wave of sterilization.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another way to push people to get invasive surgeries they don’t need (plastic surgery being the first), further fueling the medical business which will subsequently fuel the plastic surgery business. And if you can make people out of plastic AND change their genitals on a whim, you’re one step closer to creating the cyborgs you want to optimize the human race with.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once the transgender patients are out of surgery, they essentially become a time-series sample point into a huge study the government is secretly doing on the psychological effects of sex-changes and how they can improve their efficiency.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       But of course, all of this conjecture is transphobic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: How can gender be a social construct but gender dysphoria not be?

       Transhumanism will be like cell phones, and the internet, it wont have to be forced upon people, it's adoption will be organic.

       The transgender movement is about gaining unearned social power. (Insert Brett Farve clapping here) That power works for a while, then the backlash (*rump elected) occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transhumanism leads to transcending "god" like powers, which will render the old paradigm as incomprehensible as Egyptian hieroglyphs are to the average person.

       Transgenders are a PSYOP "they" are using people who suffer from obvious mental illness to draw attention from the public to the "need" to institute a Government Sponsored and Mandated Eugenics Program.  In the past people such as transgenders would have been properly treated and cared for in State Mental Hospitals and via Outpatient Care when properly medicated.

       The total money to be had from SRS every year is considerably lower than the total cost of toothpaste in the same period. And yet there's a remarkable lack of conspiracies about Big Dental making up cavities.

        Question: How can gender be a social construct but gender dysphoria not be?

      <p>
       For one, 'gender is a social construct' usually refers to gender
       <em>
        roles
       </em>
       , not gender
       <em>
        identity
       </em>
       (for which we have good evidence of a physiological cause).
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's set that aside for a second. "Social construct" does not mean "nonexistent" or "meaningless". Lots of social constructs - like, say, money - are important to perfectly rational and healthy people. If someone's depressed because they're in severe poverty, that's a normal and accepted, if perhaps not wholly healthy, response.

       Trans can't even define wgat they really are, just because it can be doesn't mean it should philosophically be done. Intelligent trans-people should by definition be the most trans-skeptical since it's literally their skin that's on the line. Ultimate realization that physical change is not required is the best way to escape the existential dilemma of trans dysphoria, not because their condition is not real, but because the minimalist skeptical approach is the most illuminating of all: 'All is flux, nothing stays still'--yet, to make it literal outside ourselves is to distract ourselves from a true understanding of this profound insight.

       There are several:
      </p>
      <p>
       One, Napoleon Guy has a clear and persistent misunderstanding of material fact (that is, a delusion) because he is unaware of the fact that Napoleon is did. A trans person, on the other hand, knows perfectly well what anatomy they do or don't have, they simply don't like it (and preferences by definition cannot be delusional).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, Napoleon Guy probably cannot demonstrate some sort of material similarity to Napoleon. Trans people can, as gender identity does indeed appear to be at least partially biological. A

       Three, Napoleon Guy either generally does not function properly in his day to day life, and humoring his delusion generally does not help him be any better off. Trans people, on the other hand, are demonstrably
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better off post-transition: among other things, hormones treat dysphoria-related depression much more effectively than do actual antidepressants. Here are a few studies on that:

         found highly significant (p-values in the .001 to .03 range) differences between transitioned and un-transitioned trans people, including a 50% lower rate of anxiety and a 75% lower rate of depression. It's worth noting that 75% less depression is more than

       I recently learned that with male to female sex change surgery the fake vagina is in reality an opened wound that will naturally heal, if not dilated with dildo devices almost daily for the rest of their lives.

       I feel they are being taken advantage of for the surgery is a goldmine to doctors &amp; insurance wants in on the big money action. The money factor likely reduces chances of reluctant council to have them avoid surgery &amp; increase chances for recommendation.

       I think cosmetic surgery is often botchery to beauty.
