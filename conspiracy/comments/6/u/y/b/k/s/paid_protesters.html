    <div class="md"><p>First or all, fuck the elite. You don&#39;t know me. I&#39;ve been involved in protesting our government since I was a little kid. I don&#39;t just sit behind a keyboard blaming &quot;the Jews&quot; and accusing people who actually go out to defend people from white supremacists as being paid actors. Talk about praising the elite how many people in this sub love to praise and even vote for billionaires? I think all billionaires are fucking scum. Anyone who would be that rich in a world with so much suffering makes me sick and they actively work to make the world worse so it is easier to control. When the did I praise the elite? And if you consider asking someone to provide one scrap of proof for their claims as being out of line you&#39;re not interested in the truth. Isn&#39;t that what this sub is supposed to be, people who want the truth? I literally had a guy share a parody account as evidence of Soros paying protesters. That is a problem no matter which side you&#39;re on. We can disagree about how to react to the truth but we should all strive to be reacting to facts and reality instead whatever headline or YouTube clip fits our previously held beliefs. And the whole Reddit age thing is such a red herring I had a different account years ago, took a break, lurked for a while and then made a new account but what really matters is that I&#39;m not spreading disinformation and propaganda I&#39;m voicing my personally held opinions. That&#39;s more than I can say for a lot of &quot;people&quot; here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for actually having something. These billionaire fucks have their tentacles in every inch of everything and it&#39;s disgusting. This is why I hesitate to join preexisting groups even though there is power in numbers.i know from on the ground experience that the vast majority of people are at these events real people with a wide variety views. i guess this is why it&#39;s important to go to genuine grassroots events and organize locally. I do think the connection is vastly overblown in the imaginations of many. The fact is millions of unpaid people protest and some old fuck throwing money around shouldn&#39;t be used to invalidate their voices. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s easier to create a postdated Craigslist add, and then 1 day after the event take a screen shot of the post dated add that also fall&#39;s with the time line. 
Explain how to create a Craigslist Add and post date it. What is the point of going through this exorbitant amount of work. What is the endgame. 
The other hand, government, by hiring and staging the protest gets ;
More funding for war
Separation politics (us vs them) redirects focus of the real issues. 
Sensationalism to justify governments spying 
Restrictions on, protesting, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom to protect one&#39;s self, and mostly because of mass media and corporate owners obvious undermining the PoTs and creating a narrative of desensitization. </p>

While I can&#39;t say I know exactly I feel that delegitimizing protesters has always been a move by those that oppose change. I personally feel that a lot of people who bought in to trump&#39;s phony populism aren&#39;t bad people at all and agree with the left on a lot. Ending wars, taking down banks and crony capitalism not propping up the saudis and Israelis, cannabis legalization etc. But anyone calling for the extermination or criminalization of a group of people based on their race, gender or sexuality is making a direct threat of bodily harm against my people and they will be treated as an enemy.  I know that the government fakes and stages things but am the vast majority of the people out at those protests are real Americans exercising their constitutional rights and they must be supported rather than dismissed. </p>

Not any picture as several have been linked but one you agree with.  Because of Craigslist add tampering with date befor taking a postdated Archive photo because. ....... .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, knock it off with the pithy little jabs like &quot;find the right politician.&quot; stop trying to assign qualities to me that you&#39;ve been told everyone on &quot;the other side&quot; has.(But kudos on being able to simultaneously employ a straw-man and ad hominem, efficient!) I&#39;m not looking for a politician I distrust those who seek power. 
I can admit a possibility of something without assuming that it definitely happened. It seems like you&#39;re confusing George Soros and the federal government. Who exactly are you accusing of a false flag? If the evidence of this event being false is a craigslist ad screenshotted after the fact and one teen on YouTube I have no reason to buy into that narrative. You act like presenting a link and calling it evidence is the same as proving a case. Do better. Be vigilant against your own desire to believe in certain world. </p>
