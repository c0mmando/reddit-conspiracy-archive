<p>Grow up everyone, don&#39;t fall for the blatant stupidity. Respect our neighbors and our enemies because we can solve this through discourse and empathy.</p>

<p>&quot;We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it&#39;s our job to invent something better.&quot; - Chuck Palahniuk</p>

<p>Also, we should quit pretending like there even is an innocent side after everything that has happened in the past year. We should be more ashamed that it actually reached this point.</p>

<p>A couple things wrong here. I refuse to ally myself with radical, violent communists to eliminate Nazis. I don&#39;t strengthen evil to eliminate other evils.</p>

<p>Second, this is the wrong way to eliminate Nazism. If you don&#39;t think the Charlottesville rally strengthened Nazism if anything then you aren&#39;t paying attention.</p>

<p>The ones in Germany in the 30s and 40s were. These ones are just stupid people that believe hateful things. The only one in the US that actually killed someone at one of these rallies is in jail, and I&#39;m happy about that. I also think the ones beating people up should be in jail. But supporting people that committed war crimes without actually committing a crime yourself is not a criminal act. If it was, any communist would have to be a criminal as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophiles shouldn&#39;t have rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. They shouldn&#39;t have rights to be pedophiles. As far as all of the other rights everyone else has, they should have them until they act on their disgusting desires and then they should be put in prison.</p>

<p>This stuff isn&#39;t hard. Until you commit a crime, you have the same rights as everyone else.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Several problems with this. The first one obviously being that the hard left is labeling a large number of people that aren&#39;t actually Nazis as Nazis.</p>

<p>The second one being that this is a slippery slope. If you start with this it isn&#39;t unconceivable that whatever unpopular thing you believe may be outlawed in the near future. We have rights so people can believe whatever they want and the government cannot stop people from believing things. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous to believe banning beliefs can be used as a political weapon in the future.</p>

<p>This idiotic fighting isn&#39;t stopping them. It&#39;s only making them stronger because they get a lot of more reasonable people to side with them when they notice that a lot of people that are not actually Nazis are being violently attacked by this group (antifa)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to side with a group of evil violent extremists only serving to make the other group of evil violent extremists larger because they say they&#39;re going to stop the other group.</p>

I just fundamentally think there is something else going on with this apparent nazi resurgence (and I&#39;m more willing to believe the narrative that the resurgence is exaggerated by media) but if there really is a rising of nazis and they are emboldened for some reason to speak out it just needs to be crushed outright.

<p>I think this is true.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, fighting them in the streets isn&#39;t helping, as much as you think it might. It&#39;s only making it worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You really don&#39;t want to live in a country where the nazi party actually starts getting votes and spaces to debate in primaries etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual views are horrible. Let them debate. People will reject their ideas. The only way they get support is if you attack them and people decide to support them to unite against another force. That&#39;s why Antifa isn&#39;t helping. They are making a tiny fringe group grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we can&#39;t hear them out or recognize their rights just do anything and everything to stomp it out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absurd. The rights are spelled out in the Bill of Rights to explicitly protect people with unpopular, sometimes terrible views. There would be no point to the First Amendment if it only protected speech people like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude, cops have to not be involved in shootings. That&#39;s an individual issue in every case that should be investigated properly, which based on the state of most police departments is usually piss poor. What is a solution that can guarantee or greatly mitigate shootings? I&#39;m all for police reforms.</p>

<p>Rid the world of hatred, because that&#39;s just something that everyone can do. Every person stomped by life, beaten by genetics, rebellious to education, and just plain cruel get exiled from our country (hell, some of those people are in high positions). We are expected to just be civil with one another, which I thought we were and if you chart the racism of 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s, 90&#39;s, and early 2000&#39;s television and movies you can see a progression. Albiet it is slow, it is astronaumically different now than it was pre 2010. </p>

<p>We are seeing the rise of the 9/11 generation. The damaged generation who were openly sold hatred in droves, through blind patriotic heirlooms of our enemies faces on toilet paper or clever t-shirts about finding Osama. I get it, I grew up with it too and dispised how easy it was for hatred to take over. We are still in that war too, to endlessly remind us of what will slowly siphon off our future.</p>

<p>We can also try and rid that terrible disease of the mind where people get duped into cults like Scientology. Since it&#39;s insanely common for people to be so broken they reach to whatever&#39;s available in terms of perceived salvation.</p>

<p>Cure mental illness too and we could get pretty close to a Utopian society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think both are examples of extreme echo-chamber and naivity.</p>

<p>For antifa, what the hell could possibly convince you that there is a rise in KKK, nazi-ism or whatever else retarded thing you could see psuedo-ironically talked about on /pol/. When has burning a flag ever looked good? When have black and red masked people ever seen as the good guys? How do you fight for peace thru violence. You can just look at the videos of the statues being taken down to see there are some very unhinged retards that are an embodiment of the hate they claim their enemies are made of</p>

<p>For unironic real life klansmen, what is the endgame? How are you going to ever get anything good while having those symbols that are synonymous with hate. I can sympathize that the media can easily lie and paint them as &quot;supremacists&quot; but there are still people giving salutes and holding nazi flags. Its too much for me for all of them to be falseflaggers, theyre just stupid</p>

<p>Too much internet with people who think exactly like you is always going to be a bad thing. Thats why i only browse /po/ for my current political and oragami affairs</p>

<p>The rise in photographs and videos of people wearing swastikas and other white supremacist symbols, and doing the sig heil.</p>

<p>Also, the rise in vocal white supremacists all over the internet who flash white power symbols for their user pics.</p>

<p>Good post. Antifa are like reactively angered hornets, white supremacists, on the other hand, are seriously, chronically, programmatically, too often murderously, mentally deranged, i.e. evil.</p>

<p>Yep, good thing the neo-nazi scumbags are so rare that they actually don&#39;t fucking matter at all. Unfortunately, however, there are TONS of young lefties triggered by this gaslighting from the corporate media who would gladly go out and punch nazis. That&#39;s a problem, because all you have to do is convince those people that group X are actually Nazis and those violent reactionaries will go out and do violence against their neighbors. </p>
