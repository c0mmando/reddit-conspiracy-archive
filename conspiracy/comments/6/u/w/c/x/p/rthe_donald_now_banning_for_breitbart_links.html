       Steve is gonna go nuclear and they are gonna have to outright ban any Bannon stuff. This won't go well for them.

       Breitbart is going after Javanka, McMaster and everyone else who is not America first. They are choosing to protect Ivanka and ban links related. Last i checked she was a registered democrat....

       People register based on what is the critical race to vote in during prumaries. For instance. In 2004, a lot of Republicans I knew registered Democrat because that's the race they wanted to decide the outcome. People knew bush was the nominee for the republicans. Most people will say they are independent these days.

       After Firing Bannon I bet Trump's base will lose a large chunk probably around 50% more or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I predict in the following two weeks Trump's approval poll rating will drop to the mid 20s or high teens. His base is going to shrink so fast because of Bannon being fired.

       It's not going to be good when Breitbart starts laying out the truth, and Bannon has all kinds of insider information to throw out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody likes or cares about Jared or Ivanka....... Nobody elected them. All they care about is money and power, because they're globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is left? Everyone is gone. It's just the Trump family left, and that swamp is filling up. I knew it as soon as Trump started hiring people from Goldman Sachs to fill his cabinet, put the sister of Erik Prince ( Blackwater mercenaries ) in his cabinet, hired Wilbur Ross and Carl Icahn.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have there right now is a globalist, corporatist administration that's being run by Wall Street.

        After Firing Bannon I bet Trump's base will lose a large chunk of supporters probably around 50% more or less.

      <p>
       Nah.  Bannon didn't come on board the Trump train until something like September of last year.  Trump's base was solidified well before that.  Trump's base ain't going nowhere.

        Therefore I predict in the following two weeks Trump's approval poll rating will drop to the mid 20s or high teens, maybe even lower.

       More likely they are getting rid of people that they can't trust.  Scaramucci is not trustworthy and was unprofessional.  Priebus, Bannon, Flynn, etc all had ties that are not on good terms with NATO or any of our current alliances.  It is possible they are removing people slow and steady that have bad ties.

       It's very telling that T_D turning on Breitbart already.  It appears that they know something is coming that the rest of us cannot yet confirm, although it's been suspected.

       Any possibility that Roger Stone is involved in some level? His AMAs indicated that he might have been involved in some capacity in the online battle for public opinions.

       They're not banning people for posting Breitbart links, this is another bullshit post by gaslighters.  This thread is filled with "totally normal" T_D posters with sanatized accounts trying to sew discord.

       They're freaking out that Bannon is back in the media fight so they're trying to spread as much false dissent as possible.  It's another lame shitpost about T_D.

       No it's not. Here is my ban for simply posting a breitbart link. I used their title as well:
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been banned from participating in r/The_Donald. You can still view and subscribe to r/The_Donald, but you won't be able to post or comment.
Note from the moderators:

        https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6uw8hr/nyt_bids_bannon_good_riddancerelief_americafirst/dlvto7r/

       Rule 2 + 6

       That's not the correct framing of how I feel about it. I'm so beyond livid that I saw this cominga few weeks ago. The firing, the shift in the sub and what will follow is the shift in the presidency.

       I've been aware of the blind bias, just like the left, but to start attacking their own base, especially after to news of Bannon, makes me wonder what they hope to gain.  Clearly it's not logical, but still interested in hearing why the mods think it is.

       Clearly, but I'm curious how they think they are changing the base if they aren't replacing it, only alienating it.  Still interested in the mods logic, even if it's not logical to us.

       well they arent hoping to alienate it id guess

       they probably hoped the base would just jump on with the new party line, and if they ban dissent they can certainly give the impression that they are doing that

       I'm curious about this as well. Are the mods so absorbed with maintaining order that they don't realize they are alienating their users.  Look at OP, he's livid and sure as shit has a reason to.  If r/conspiracy mods started banning people for pointing out flaws in a conspiracy, I'd be pissed as a member of that community.  I'm more shocked by the users who feel the need to defend the rule, rather than question the actions and repercussions of a rule that was designes to protect the community which is now being used to break it apart.

       that rule is indefensible. it made some sort of twisted sense during the election, but now that hes ruling a rule that bans criticism only serves to allow the president to do what he wants with no backlash. He is in power, to not be able to criticize him is some scary authoritarian shit.

       Just letting folks no. The action item is to wait out and watch the show. Bannon is gonna be turning it up 1000%. The mods won't be able to seal the echo chamber. It'll probably get as bad as

       Not all, friend. There are PLENTY of people like me who still visit that sub regularly but rarely post, and have learned never to post anything critical of their narrative. I rec'd private messages calling me a cuck and a concern troll.  I guess you could say I am part of Trump's base, but not part of T_D's base.  I used to visit r/politics, but stopped going there due to the echo-chamber mental illness that pours out of your screen when there.  I'm not saying T_D is nearly as bad, but its clearly not open to healthy debate.

       Sorry if it came off like I was referring to Trumps entire base, I was referring to the user base of T_D.  And yes, I agree both r/politics &amp; T_D are both echo chambers.  To anyone else who reads this and feels the need to point out one's a fan page and the other isn't, I'm well aware.

       I cut T_D a little slack because Trump has caused so so many on the left to legit lose their sanity, so T_D is probably CONSTANTLY bombarded with mental case lefties, and more organized Share Blue type opposition. Its sad, but in reality they probably have no choice except to have mods working around the clock deleting comments.  r/politics would be more palatable if their sidebar said something like: "we really only welcome hard left myopic views.

       They are prisoners of Trump now? You really need to relax a little. T_D is a circlejerk for Donald fans to wank to. You get bans for breaking the jerk. It's not hard to understand or a conspiracy, they are quite open about it.

       Whatever. I'm just saying no need to bother getting worked up over T_Ds overbearing moderation. There's plenty of places you can criticize Trump to your hearts content. It's quite impressive they haven't been banned outright for pissing off spez really.

       Once again your trying to insinuate I'm getting 'worked up' or I'm not relaxed, neither which are true.  I'm trying to have a discussion about the working of T_D's mods and understand why they would alienate their base.  Although I'm constantly wondering why so many people find the need to marginalize the discussion.

       That's this sub. I was critical of a mod, bam I broke a rule. It's irrelevant. Nice of you to go looking through my posts though, nothing like a little friendly snooping to attack me with. I have no problem with you discussing it, I'm just saying you're getting worked up over nothing.

       I'm not trying to marginalise you. Nice nerve calling me a pussy after that little hissy fit though. Yeah, I've complained about moderation. Did I ever say you shouldn't, or couldn't? I just said you're getting worked up over nothing, much like I was that time. Keep up the creepy snooping though, engaging someone on what they are actually saying is no way to have a conversation, wasting your time digging up dirt is much more productive.

       The mods are complete shite. Remember when the Seth Rich story was gaining traction and the mods conveniently decided to have their day of silence right when they had the chance to make some noise? That sub is a world away from what it was during the election.

       I'm a T_D user and I am upvoting you. I have given up what the T_D mods' agenda is. They certainly brook NO DISSENT that's for sure. I consider myself part of Trump's base but have grown lukewarm on T_D. Setting up the sub? Brilliant idea! Initial roll out and first few months? Fun, wild, informative, celebratory. Now? Mind your manners soldier! Or the repurcussions will be swift!

       Exactly, my conspiracy seems to be, was this done by design?  I noticed all the mods over there are 3 months old or younger, was there a coup and now they are destroying their own user base by using a rule designed to protect them?

       From day one there has been numerous factions within the Trump administration jockeying for position.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what it appears you have here is that the T_D sub is no different, it's controlled by one of these factions, most likely one loyal to Kushner and/or McMaster if they're starting to ban links to Breitbart.

       Thank you for giving me some more insight to T_D's moderators.  What's up with all the moderators being less than 3 months old?  Was there a type of coup that went down?

       Its been one of the most organized and active subs not just on Reddit but the entire internet, and Trump himself has been known to at least view that sub. My guess would be that there are some really big players pulling the strings behind the scenes at that sub, and this makes it look like it's not the Steve Bannon camp. There is someone very influential involved in that sub, I'd bet money on it...... I've seen some really organized, creative and extremely tactical shit originate from that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll be really interesting once Bannon starts opening up on Breitbart to see how different Trump loyalists react. I can't see Trump responding nicely when Breitbart starts attacking Ivanka and Kushner, who by most accounts are Trump's most trusted advisors....... Battle lines are going to get drawn.

       No..... They're not going to risk that. But it's pretty easy to see that whoever is calling the shots there is someone with deep knowledge of political strategies, and there is definitely a high level of coordination with other wings of the Trump media apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump himself has posted memes lifted from that sub to his Twitter account, so at the very least he's aware of it.

       I think if you read Roger Stone's AMA you'll get a sense of what I'm talking about.

       I guess for the very same reason the other sub is banning people. It doesn't go with the topic of the sub.

       That's still not a conspiracy, it's a complaint.
The sub in question has been banning people forever. The rationale has always been that if the topic is perceived as anti trump, it's removed and the person is in risk to get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the topic of censorship is brought up and TD is used as an example, everyone comes out of the woodwork saying they do not hide their bias and anything anti trump is removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it all of a sudden a big deal and why is this the sub people feel should any type of feeling about how another sub whose rule are clear, decide to run the sub, especially when it wasn't a big deal before?

       I take 2 issues, first we can debate the rules and what the spirit of those rules were and how they are now being used against Trump supporters (hence this post).  Also the fact that most of the mods who are now enforcing those rules and attacking their own supports are all less than 3 months old.  Maybe there was conspiracy with in T_D mods and there was a take over of the sub, which could be why it seems they are attacking their own base.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd: This sub, r/conspiracy is a sub that has discussed reddit moderation for a very long time and most the mods here will tell you they are pretty hands off.  I now there are examples where posts have been removed (I'm aware of it, I didn't like it), but it's very rare for the most part.  It's not taboo to comment and say this isn't a conspiracy, but it is frustrating to see people try to stifle a conversation and question the validity of the post on a sub that I'm proud to say still operates much like the original r/reddit.com.  The rules are loose here and we should be able to talk about whatever subjects we like without having to have a debate if it should even be here.  The best part of this sub is also it's Achilles heal, but we're still here dealing with nay sayers on a daily basis.  Cheers

       Do the mods not rotate regularly? I am 83% sure in another discussion about their mods it was brought out that the mod rotation was not an abnormality. As that argument was brought up a couple times already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, this is what? The third TD exodus? Every shake up in the administration causes their base to shift. That is hardly unusual. Once the demo shifts, those who do not keep up would be purged if they question the administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       TD is seemingly about the unwavering devotion to Trump. If you find yourself questioning him, you are officially going against the spirit of the sub, making you not apart of their base. Of course that will lead to ruin, but that's another topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, the whole thing seems routine. Which is probably why the topic is questioned.

       I agree with a lot if what you said, but I feel like your missing my point with that comment.  This sub is allowed to discuss anything they choose to for the most part.  So having a bunch if people claiming a post is invalid because they don't think it should be here is a mute point, so all it's doing is being a disctraction.  If you look I've been having conversations with past T_D users and learming more insight about their community.  I question why someone wouldn't want a topic discussed, I dealt with T_D users all day yesterday saying the samething you are.  I understand why they don't want it discuss, but I'm having a hard time understanding why you would take issue with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, I'll always be civil (until someone isn't), in fact I still abided by the old school redditquette of reddit and don't downvote comments who I disagree with.  In fact I haven't downvoted any of the comments in this thread.

       What alot of new users can't comprehend is this sub for the most part is free to discuss any topic you choose.  It's like the old r/reddit.com and it doesn't have to be a conspiracy for it to be posted here.  Maybe it's a tid bit of info from an AI tech development that someone else may find interesting... It doesn't matter.  That's why all the crying and nay sayers I take issue with.  Bunch of back biting cry babies in my opinion.

       I far as I know, I've never been banned form T_D, don't think I've posted there either... Maybe during the Podesta leaks.  I've been banned for other stupid reasons from other subs, so yes, I've been affected like OP, and understand... Now my question is why would the mods choose to start attacking their own user base, the rule was clearly to protect them from poltics and enoughTrumpspam.

       This IS a conspiracy because most of T_D users DONT know that the Mods there insta-ban people since they ban you quickly. Most T_D users don't even realize the mass censorship over there. This is a T_D conspiracy where they pretend everything is hunky dory like Trump's approval rating is 100%. They like to their users like nobody else.

       This is the day that

       officially dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods already opened the floodgates from the_sewer with the "WELCOME IDIOTS!" post the last time the mods of that sub had a cry, and now this place is the last safe space for government bootlickers and white supremacist cowards to congregate and circlejerk about how unfair everything is for them without their stupid, hateful rhetoric being drowned out Boston style.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll obviously hang around to drink the sweet tears of a dwindling neo-Nazi movement dying as it's backed into a corner, but I will always feel nostalgic for the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that was exposing the deep state instead of being used to distract from it with banal bullshit about Hillary Clinton and John Fucking Podesta.

       Context is everything with that quote. When he says "trump" he means what trump campaigned for. So anyone who gets in the way of that he will go to war with....mainly McMaster, Ivanka, Jared, RHINOs, democrats....

       Congress will remove.  Mueller is involved in the investigation and presenting the case to congress.  Congress will then decide to impeach or not.  Most likely, Trump will resign before any of these proceedings.  It is in the hands of congress.

       This. He stated that the trump presidency that got his elected is over. And that this is a new presidency. So him going to war form trump is him going to war for his campaign promises. Ivanka and jared were not what Americans voted for.

       I'm curious about this as well. Are the mods so absorbed with maintaining order that they don't realize they are alienating their users.  Look at OP, he's livid and sure as shit has a reason to.  If r/conspiracy mods started banning people for pointing out flaws in a conspiracy, I'd be pissed as a member of that community.  I'm more shocked by the users who feel the need to defend the rule, rather than question the actions and repercussions of a rule that was designes to protect the community which is now being used to break it apart.

        That's still not a conspiracy, it's a complaint. The sub in question has been banning people forever. The rationale has always been that if the topic is perceived as anti trump, it's removed and the person is in risk to get banned.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I take 2 issues, first we can debate the rules and what the spirit of those rules were and how they are now being used against Trump supporters (hence this post).  Also the fact that most of the mods who are now enforcing those rules and attacking their own supports are all less than 3 months old.  Maybe there was conspiracy with in T_D mods and there was a take over of the sub, which could be why it seems they are attacking their own base.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd: This sub, r/conspiracy is a sub that has discussed reddit moderation for a very long time and most the mods here will tell you they are pretty hands off.  I now there are examples where posts have been removed (I'm aware of it, I didn't like it), but it's very rare for the most part.  It's not taboo to comment and say this isn't a conspiracy, but it is frustrating to see people try to stifle a conversation and question the validity of the post on a sub that I'm proud to say still operates much like the original r/reddit.com.  The rules are loose here and we should be able to talk about whatever subjects we like without having to have a debate if it should even be here.  The best part of this sub is also it's Achilles heal, but we're still here dealing with nay sayers on a daily basis.  Cheers

       I far as I know, I've never been banned form T_D, don't think I've posted there either... Maybe during the Podesta leaks.  I've been banned for other stupid reasons from other subs, so yes, I've been affected like OP, and understand... Now my question is why would the mods choose to start attacking their own user base, the rule was clearly to protect them from poltics and enoughTrumpspam.

       FYI Most of the T_D mods are younger than the majority OG Trump supporters like myself who have been there from the start. They will insta-ban you for the slightest bit of critique on anything. They ban you faster than Communist China. Seriously. Total Censorship.
