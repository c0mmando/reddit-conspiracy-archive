       I've always wondered if there was a way to make change without pallets full of money, but what if you did have pallets of money? What idea's or things would you do to stop the corruption? How would you conspire to make the world a better place?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would personally create a new media platform devoid of the propaganda efforts of my government (USA) so that folks can be informed of the multiple topics that have been manipulated, and "conspiracy" culture can be brought up without the manipulation of the truth. Seeking the truth is a noble cause worth fighting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot smarter people who frequent this board than me and its just we talk about problems so much that I feel thinking up solutions can be beneficial too.

       The powerball styled games are, especially with people noticing issues with the live drawings. Scratch offs are more about chance and some people have worked out ways to make some cash back from them VIA saving up and buying large amounts at the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best bet is to not buy lottery and either:
A) Save
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Look into buying and selling online.

       I've just given you 50 billion dollars.  What could possibly make this country stop its steep descent?  Scholarships?  IMO, there is nothing that can turn back the hands of time and right this country.  As Carlin said, we took this pristine country, and turned it into a shitty shopping mall.  Our leaders are corrupt and have been for decades.  The one time we had a decent human being in the oval office, they blew his head off.

       Not scholarships, think more indoctrination. You just gave me 50 billion? I'll now proceed to start my own studio and air a children's show online, for free, offering advertisers are chance for product placement to recoup money spent. I'll hire recognizable names and have them to guest appearances with the usual cast. From there I'll simply use some simple, subtle cues and wordplay to promote the messages I want to the children watching it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children are the future. If you want to change the course of a country, get the children on board. It's sad to say you have to be just as dirty, to some extent, to fix things due to those currently in control.

       Children's shows won't stop the impending ecological catastrophe we are facing with over 7 billion on earth and rising.  Children's shows won't stop the military industrial complex and the entrenched fellow billionaires that have other, differing plans for the rest of us.  No matter how much you indoctrinate young people at this point, this country is doomed.  It's best days are long over.  We can't even have decent health care for our citizens, and have been at war for nearly two decades with no end in sight.

       You are too nearsighted. If you want to change things, to get the next generator involved. If you want to lessen the population, you find a way to do so by promoting something beneficial with kids. Millenials are probably one of the most liberally inclined generations, can't put it all the parents, however if you looked at the programming they watched and what they were taught at schools you'll see a trend.

       It takes time and money to fix things, especially a country. The US wasn't subverted or turned into its current state in a year. It took decades.

       There is no time for the changes you envision.  Empires rise, have a golden age, then fall, and we are witnessing the fall.  No amount of "education" of young people will stop it.  Nothing can be invented to save the environment to carry billions of people in an ever-rising rate.  Resources are dwindling.  Co2 levels will soon rise as methane is released.  We'll be lucky to have about 50 years on planet earth.

       Who said about stopping it? You don't try to prop up the rotting foundation of a house. You raze it and replace it. You educate the next generation to build something better in its place. You want to save a country? You'll want to raze it and rebuild it.

       We'll have to agree to disagree.  I can't blame you for wanting to have an optimistic outlook, but optimism won't save us.  "A country becomes great when old men plant trees, whose shade they know they will never sit in."  A quote that make a lot of sense to me, but we don't have old men planting trees, and haven't for generations.

       Even lottery money isn't enough to make meaningful change. The state takes half. And after you give all your relatives a big check, buy the new house and cars you won't have any to spread around. You'll need to put a huge chunk into investments in order to make sure you have income for the rest of your life. You might still have millions but even that won't go as far as you might think. 1 million dollars will buy 10 100k houses. So you can help some families. Not change the world. I suppose you can start some business and hire the poor but then you are just making sweatshops.

       The State only takes half if a person claims the jackpot. But if the winner created a charitable foundation in a state with no income tax and claimed the prize as that foundation, the tax liability would be much much lower.

       While I'm not trying to dissuade you from being generous, there is no scenario where you will avoid paying taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charitable contributions are limited to 50% of your income.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you claim your prize, the states are obligated by the IRS to withhold 25% for taxes. You are responsible for paying and additional required taxes, or for claiming any refunds. But since you can only claim 50% of your income as charitable contributions, you will end up paying at least 25% of your winnings.

       Well it depends on the jackpot, how much the lump-sum cash prize is, how much taxes removed and where I am in the country. Then, obviously, I'd have to take care of my own (family...etc) first and ensure that I can build up a decently built homestead away from the cities with adequate supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it all depends on what you think can fix the country. Do I support or fund a candidate who'd align with what I'd believe to be proper goals or do I start up some sort of tech company that'd rival currently popular services? I'd need to find a way to make the money work for me first off, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could always borrow a leaf from the book of the Soviets and start a series of children's shows in order to control the future VIA the leaders of tomorrow, or... endless possibilities. It all depends on what slice of the pie you want and what you can do to knockout the others who want it too.

       Children's shows won't stop the impending ecological catastrophe we are facing with over 7 billion on earth and rising.  Children's shows won't stop the military industrial complex and the entrenched fellow billionaires that have other, differing plans for the rest of us.  No matter how much you indoctrinate young people at this point, this country is doomed.  It's best days are long over.  We can't even have decent health care for our citizens, and have been at war for nearly two decades with no end in sight.

       Not a single state in the US will allow a corporation to claim a lottery win. Every single state requires that a "real and true" person or persons claim a lottery win.

       If you give 100% I think you can be tax free.

       While I'm not trying to dissuade you from being generous, there is no scenario where you will avoid paying taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charitable contributions are limited to 50% of your income.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you claim your prize, the states are obligated by the IRS to withhold 25% for taxes. You are responsible for paying and additional required taxes, or for claiming any refunds. But since you can only claim 50% of your income as charitable contributions, you will end up paying at least 25% of your winnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like they thought about this already.
