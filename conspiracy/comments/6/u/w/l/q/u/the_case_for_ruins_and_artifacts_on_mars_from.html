<p>Recently a congressman made headlines and subjected himself to media ridicule when he brought up the possibility that advanced civilizations had once lived on Mars.</p>

<p>Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., asked a panel of space science experts testifying before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on Tuesday if it&#39;s possible there was an advanced civilization on Mars in the past.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsjs.com/url.php?p=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/338374/dana-rohrabacher-asks-nasa-about-martians/">http://www.newsjs.com/url.php?p=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/338374/dana-rohrabacher-asks-nasa-about-martians/</a></p>

<p>Speculation about possibility of intelligent life on Mars is nothing new, of course, though the notion was dismissed by NASA after the Viking mission. Not everyone who worked on the project agreed with the official conclusion, however. Starting with those early orbital images of anomalous features in the Cydonia region, a growing number of scientists around the world have been challenging the idea that Mars is a barren, lifeless desert, asserting instead that there was once a thriving civilization on Mars that left behind giant structures that have long since fallen into ruin. This post will attempt to make that argument featuring a number of the clearest examples of anomalies yet photographed by NASA on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system.</p>

<p>First things first, let&#39;s examine the definitions of pareidolia and pattern recognition according to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to an image by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists. Examples of these would be seeing shapes in the clouds,or the face of Jesus in a tortilla chip.</p>

<p>Pattern recognition (in psychology as opposed to computer science) describes a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information retrieved from memory.</p>

<p> Let us begin with an anomaly imaged on the surface that is NOT an example of pareidolia:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NSULKCY.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NSULKCY.jpg</a></p>

<p>Another view of the same object:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/FBUvZ5Q.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/FBUvZ5Q.jpg</a>  </p>

<p>Three lines of equal length forming a pattern I&#39;m sure you all recognize, an equilateral triangle etched into the surface of a rock, the base of which is in parallel alignment with the ground. There can be no argument for pareidolia against a simple geometrical figure, a thing either has the shape of a circle, square, triangle, cube or sphere etc. or it doesn&#39;t. The question then becomes, how did it get there? The In order to fit in to the current model according to NASA, the rock would have had to have been formed with the triangle already there, any natural process that could result in such a symbol etched into stone would require a much more dynamic collection of forces, having these forces come together to form even a simple geometrical symbol by wearing away the surface of a stone in such a specific way is so far outside the realm of probability that there can only remain one simple conclusion, namely, some intelligence put it there.</p>

<p>Game over, in other words. There was intelligent life on Mars, and may be there still. And yet, the existence of artifacts and ruins on Mars does not necessarily mean that the beings who created them were aliens. The simplest, most probable explanation is that they were us, humans. When you consider the rapid growth of technology that enabled us to go from heavier than air powered flight to landing on the moon within a single lifespan, the idea that human culture had once colonized our solar system before being wiped out by natural disaster (or war) seems quite plausible. In light of the evidence, this scenario is perhaps the most comforting to consider, without triggering the fear of hostile alien invaders from Mars that has been a part of western culture for over a century.</p>

<p>Some more examples of trianglular anomalies from the rover pictures.</p>

<p>Now that we are clear on the difference between pareidolia and pattern recognition, let&#39;s begin with some other examples of anomalies containing simple geometric features in a way that would be very difficult to explain as a result of natural processes.</p>

<p>90 degree right angles cut into stone blocks that form vertices. Many of these seen in the rover photos, just a few sampled here.</p>

<p>Letters, numbers, symbols. This is where things get interesting. I don&#39;t care to speculate about how these symbols match some western cultures on earth but it&#39;s impossible to think about without imagining all sorts of science fiction tropes like time travel. At this point, however, no theory can be dismissed as ridiculous, every possibility should be open for debate, at least until the authorities step in and tell us what to think again. One thing&#39;s for sure, there are some fans of ZZ Top on the red planet. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised about that.</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<p>There once existed a thriving technological civilization on Mars, sometime when the planet had oceans, a very long time ago.</p>

<p>Mars currently has water, vegetation, wildlife, and people. Not human beings like us, but people nonetheless.</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible for NASA to not know this. There is good reason to think that they are using image processing software to paint over the best artifacts. Whatever happened to Mars apparently created a massive, possibly planet wide debris field, artifacts are plentiful and difficult to conceal.</p>

<p>So the American government lies to the people of the world again, this time about the most important discovery in recorded human history, knowledge that will turn everything we took for granted as the truth about ourselves and render it the quaint backwards notions of a primitive, developing culture. I can&#39;t blame them for keeping such a powerful secret, how many of us are truly ready to confront the truth of our existence on a heretofore unimaginably cosmic scale? There exist similar anomalies elsewhere NASA has looked in the solar system, including Luna (Earth&#39;s Moon), Venus, Pluto, Phobos, Eros and Comet 67-p. We may not the big kids on this block, and almost certainly aren&#39;t the most developed species in our local neighbourhood. We aren&#39;t even the smartest species on our own planet. Cetaceans have highly developed brains that dwarf ours in size and capacity, and they have no technology at all, yet their languages are much more sophisticated than what currently passes for language among humans. We need to get over our collective sense of the human race&#39;s self importance.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that there is definitely a race of tiny humanoids living on Mars. How is the arrival of their neighbors from the third planet going to affect them? What&#39;s the most likely thing to happen, given that our civilization currently is a plutocracy ruled by a feudal cabal of ruthless psychopaths? Will they be given any say at all with what happens to them? If our leaders view the people of our planet with a range of feelings from indifference to contempt, how will they feel about a race of Lilliputians? </p>

<p>The history of Mars is intertwined with the history of Earth. Has to be. The meaning of Cairo can&#39;t be just coincidence. I&#39;m not up to speed with the hidden history side of this story, but I&#39;ve seen and heard enough. Not that I don&#39;t have my own opinion on these matters. Some expertly qualified professionals have opined that the cataclysm that ripped away Mars&#39;s oceans (and reduced the fifth planet to what is now the asteroid belt) happened 65 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were extinguished on Earth. I may be just a self educated layman, but judging from the condition of the artifacts uncovered, this seems like too long an estimate. Ten thousand years or so seems more probable, considering that many of these objects are lying in the open and are still recognizable. Assuming there hasn&#39;t been several civilizations that have risen and fallen in the meantime, which is starting to look likely.</p>

<p>The world as we know it is on the cusp of disappearing forever, and it&#39;s about time, we have a much needed, better one to create, for the sake of all, not just humankind. It&#39;s time to put on our grownup pants and start dealing with the mess we&#39;ve made.</p>

<p>This collection was gathered mostly from Facebook groups on the subject as well as online. I have had a few issues with getting the entirety of the collection onto Imgur to share, the program crashes frequently during large uploads and is very difficult to sort and organize. New photos will be added to this folder as I get them.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/GN4wQ">https://imgur.com/a/GN4wQ</a></p>

<p>Every time I had to delete my folder to properly upload, everything got doubled in my profile. Currently my collection stands at about 1900 images, my profile has over 4500. Opening via mobile redirects to the app.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge all of the Mars rover anomalies can be verified on the gigapans, the most interesting formations have been marked in the snapshots.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not particularly interested in having a debate about the meaning of these images, but encouraging debate and raising awareness is why I&#39;m doing this. I&#39;m sure many of you will have an extremely negative reaction to the idea presented here, by all means feel free to analytically slice me to pieces. I&#39;m confident that most people are able to ascertain the truth when they see it with their own eyes. You would have a better chance convincing me that the great pyramid of Giza was a natural formation than some of the objects in these photos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have this longstanding theory that we are planet hoppers. I&#39;ve always imagined that one of the outer planets (say Pluto) was close enough to withstand life (and they&#39;ve been moving outward ever sense) and that&#39;s where it all began for us. Then over the course of time, when the outer planet was drifting too far outside the suns orbit to sustain life and people start dying off the people looked to their next closet planet, Neptune, to colonize (essentially starting the cycle over and resetting a advancements back to zero except the knowledge and few things you were able to take with you). If that theory holds up at all, then we should be looking to Venus to colonize next, not Mars. It&#39;s currently uninhabitable due to its noxious atmosphere but in about 800,000 years that should be a different story. Maybe Mars can be our placeholder in the meantime. Earth is on its way out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story behind that photo was more interesting than the object itself. On the original raw image of this anomaly you can see a solid object high in the air by the platform. Then the rover had some sort of malfunction that required a full restart that took several days to complete, and when it was back online the object had changed appearance to a large flat triangular stone perched upright on the edge of the cliff. Some said it had interesting, possibly artificial markings on it, but the majority of anomaly hunters including myself think that it was created by NASA to cover up the original object. I was going to try to find the article but it&#39;s been too long, pretty sure this site covered the story though:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Marine Captain Randy Cramer, civilian Tony Rodriguez, Washington-based practicing attorney Andrew D. Basiago.  All have extensive testimony regarding time they say they spent on the planet Mars.  Their information is not easy to discard by anyone who really pays attention to the data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not intentionally shooting OP down here, but, </p>

<p>a) Why would all these things, assuming they&#39;re actually what OP states they might be, be made of rock? Wouldn&#39;t an advanced civilisation that is capable of space travel have metals, plastics, and other materials? </p>

<p>b) After millions (billions?) or years these things are still just lying around on the surface? Meteor strikes haven&#39;t buried them? General erosion? I mean let&#39;s say Martians all left Mars on the same day, they happened to leave at the absolute end of any atmosphere or weather that might have buried these things? It&#39;s like arguing that the environment is so absolutely unchanged that we should see every footprint, vehicle track, and launch from the last day of colonisation. </p>

<p>c) If NASA are painting out the big ticket items, why leave 100&#39;s of other things open to interpretation? Wouldn&#39;t they also paint over the gun and spoon as well?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for the theory that humans are introduced to earth, and I&#39;m open to the idea that Mars may have been colonised or visited at some point, but I don&#39;t see much here. My eyebrows raised over a few statue-type formations, but not enough warrant a serious discussion. </p>

<p>Sorry OP. Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those a good points imo. And im not also shooting OP down, but just remind, that nature itself has its &#39;ways&#39; to form &quot;artificial&quot;-looking shapes like crystals and so on, even round shape holes called Giants Kettles/potholes(requires propably moving liquid/ice etc)... Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway">Giants Causeway</a> in ireland is damn interesting looking. They think it was formed by lava and cooling ocean water 50-60million years ago.</p>

<p>But anyway, Im like this sub and people dedicated to their subjects, nice collection of mars pics anyway..</p>

Like I said, this looks closer to ten thousand years (if that) to my eyes than the 65 million postulated by Hoagland and others.

    <div class="md"><p>I would be totally on board with a civilisation that once existed but now the planet is dead.</p>

<p>Everything &#39;alive&#39; you point out in pictures is reaaally a stretch and could very well be imagination. </p>

<p>Some static objects sure are unexplainable and look like mars might be a postapocalyptic wasteland... but inhabited... you will still have to provide a single picture that supports that. The ones you posted with aliens on them are without exception easily explained away...</p>
