      <p>
       Greetings!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am writing this correspondence to inform people that I am finally disseminating a project that I have been working on for the last few years. I have now published a book that I have written: Of Personal Liberty, The Truth of Motor Vehicle Infractions. If you have any time to spare, I’d greatly appreciate your audience for my work.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is my book about? Well, first off, I want to assert that my book is NOT a discussion about how to get out of traffic tickets. Rather and more importantly, my book aims to examine the legitimacy of traffic tickets, and in doing so teach people fundamental principles of law that everyone should know.
      </p>
      <p>
       At its core, my book is a discussion about freedom—in practical use. Specifically, the book enunciates the fact that if a person is free, they don’t need to ask for anyone’s permission before inclining to act. Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a ‘license’ or ‘permit’ (permission) from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the many freedoms that have been deprived from Americans is their right to freely travel upon the highways. For a long time, we have been told that “driving is a privilege”, but this is a grave misnomer. My central thesis is that people should not be forced to obtain a license (ask government’s permission) nor meet other prerequisites before being allowed to privately travel upon the highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our country’s backbone was designed to support a free society. Requiring everyone to get a driver’s license before they can travel upon the highways has led to a form of scoliosis; Constitutional provisions have been grossly reinterpreted, and basic principles of fairness (due process) are being ignored, in order to sustain our current trafficking system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve put thousands of hours of work into this book. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am diligent when it comes to my projects. I wouldn’t disseminate a publication unless I felt it met an acceptable standard of quality. I’m ready to share my book for dialectic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, there you have it. If you’d like to be the envy of your friends with your legal savvy, if you care about the subject of natural rights, or if you simply need a new coaster for your drinking mug, you should buy a copy of my book. It will be unlike any other book you’ve read.

       If you're traveling on public highways then you're doing so publicly. If you want to drive privately then get your own road and no one would care if you have a license.

       A drivers license is only needed if you are engaging in commerce. This can be found in your State's law.  It is the second step in getting you into the UCC system. Your picture, with your fictional identity, all signed by your signature. Nail in the coffin for a free living human being.

       The federal definition is irrelevant, unless someone is charged with a federal crime or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas requires drivers to have licenses to operate a motor vehicle. The Texas definition of "motor vehicle", in the same law, applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Federal law is irrelevant; there's no equivalent federal requirement to have a driver's license, as far as I know, so it has no bearing on state requirements.

       I didn't say trump, I said are an addition to the Federal US Codes. State law inherit from the Federal. The Federal has legal definitions. I just gave you what you were asking for. There is a Federal requirement for Drivers License, hence where the US Code is the definition for motor vehicle (commercial). State law can alter and further define a bit, but ultimately the US code is the basic doctrine or "definition". A motor vehicle is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term “motor vehicle” means every description of carriage or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and
        <strong>
         used for commercial purposes on the highways
        </strong>
        in the transportation of passengers, passengers and property, or property or cargo

       You made up imaginary rules and want a citation to prove that they're false? You made the affirmative claim that the federal definition controls, and obviously you did that because the state definition (found in the same state law you yourself cited) shows how ridiculous your argument is. The burden of proof is yours to fail. Show us proof that one uses federal definitions in applying state laws with their own definitions, please.

       Such as? For example? If these laws exist, why can't anyone ever actually cite one? It's an urban legend, not a fact. You can tell by the vague hand-waving whenever someone asks for details.

       The two big goofs the people behind this myth tend to make are (a) conflating the right to travel with the right to drive, and (b) assuming that there's an absolute right to drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have the right to travel. The Constitution doesn't protect a right to travel by any particular method. The states can and do regulate methods, such as by imposing speed limits, weight limits, vehicle safety laws, and requiring drivers' licenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are rights involved with driving. The state can't arbitrarily deprive one class of people of the right to drive while giving it to another--requiring licenses only for left-handed people would be unconstitutional, for example. But no court has ever found that requiring drivers' licenses is unconstitutional, or that it's legal to ignore the requirement and drive without one.

       If there was a federal drivers' license requirement, it might preempt state laws on the same subject. But there isn't.

       My arguments are largely forensic: I put a lot of effort into showing that only way you can truly respect the provisions in the constitutions, state laws, due process, and precedent, without them contradicting one another, is to not mandate licensing for personal travels on the highways.

       My book shows case law that say people have access to public highways by right. I put a lot of effort into showing how laws have been reinterpreted in order to accommodate our current traffic-ticketing system.

       No, courts do not respect the fact that people shouldn't need a license to personally travel on the highways. You cannot use my book to get yourself out of a traffic ticket. However, courts have also said other things that, if you think about them to their logical conclusion, prove contrary to their policy of requiring everyone to get a license.
      </p>
      <p>
       My book is intended to point out what ought to be, not what currently is. America was founded on fundamental principles; these principles are being routinely violated in the way we administer licenses and traffic tickets. My book attempts to show people what these principles are--in a practical way--and show why we should care about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts rulings are nothing more than opinions. I'm saying that to the best of my knowledge, someone a long time ago had an erroneous opinion and we've gone astray ever since. The only way you can make the "iron sights line up", the only way that you can simultaneously respect constitutional provisions, principles of due process, and state law, without absurdly redefining everything, is by not requiring everyone to have a license.

       I'd like to ask you a question in light of this. Do you think my opening message is enough to separate me from the pseudolegals (in your hindsight?), or do I need to tweak the opening message some? Would you offer any suggestions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you just messaged me to make sure I wasn't a pseudolegal; if so, that is fine. However, if you did have any interest in reading this book, let me know. I'll sell you a book at material cost (well, no profit for me anyway) if money is an issue.

       I think your opening message could be clearer, but at the same time I don't think many people will notice or care about the potential ambiguity. It's a particular focus of mine, since I'm so interested in pseudolegal gurus. (Yes, that is why I messaged you.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not particularly interested in the book--no offense to you at all, I'm quite envious that you've produced one as I'm working on one of my own. It's just not a field I have the time or interest to dive into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have some advice, though. A self-published book isn't going to move the needle much with judges and other lawyers, and if you want to effect a change in the law you're going to need to persuade some subject-matter experts at some point. (Or, at the very least, doing so would make your job massively easier.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you thought about refining your argument to a good, tight thirty pages and submitting it to law reviews? I think the odds of getting it accepted are fairly slim, but you could submit it around the country easily enough. And you may find yourself in some interesting dialogs with the students who run those journals. Students who will be more receptive to out-of-the-box ideas than established lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a big deal, one way or the other, but that's what I would do if I were trying to get your message out. Best of luck!

        Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a ‘license’ or ‘permit’ (permission) from the government.

       Beautiful, I've been making this point for a long time, a permit or license inherently makes that act illegal with permittion from the state.  Even with marrage licenses it's the same thing, I'd point to the

       .  I'll try to think of it, but there was a guy who had a whole website dedicated to all the court cases where someone sued the state for infringing on their right to us the roads without a license and won... As I recall he was a former sheriff.

       The issue with complaining about licences is it forgets the basic principle that freedom is never absolute (and no serious political thinker has ever suggested it is).

       No…no it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person gets a driver's license at 16 and never has to take another test or skills update/test UNLESS they show a level of incompetency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure take a written test and road test to show basic competency…period. One should not have to pay yearly for the right to travel on the roads they already paid to build UNLESS they prove to be incompetent.

       Again all I said is that they at least establish basic competency and since poor driving could easily kill others you should have some form of test.
