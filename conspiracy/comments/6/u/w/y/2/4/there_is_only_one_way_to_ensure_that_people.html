       Yes, this is a great idea. I've actually already been doing this with one person I know. I approached them like this, "Hey, do you have a little bit of time? I really value your opinion and want to see what you think of something. I can kind of see both sides to this thing, but something about it doesn't seem quite right and is bothering me. I wanted to see what you thought of it."
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do it that way, they are more prone to listen. Now, you'll have to use your acting skills a little bit, but it is worth it.

       You're missing the point. You shouldn't "pretend to have doubt to get people to listen to you", rather you should sincerely and doggedly argue against yourself at all times so you can develop more refined and more correct positions, positions which may end up being the exact opposite of the ones you started with.

       Don't: Robbie Parker is the worst Crisis actor ever, horrible job.

       Do: Robbie Parker is a grieving dad who right before facing the world press, acted in a way that appeared "Unnatural" to some so he was branded a "Crisis Actor".

       This is the approach I have been taking with coworkers. I look at it like someone trying to make believe in jebus. It pains them that I will not accept their belief system so they think I am suffering. It is how many of us are everyday.

       Excellent post. Our goal should be to have as many people willingly engaged and learning about what is going on and your example a great way to red pill people.
