<p>Don&#39;t: &quot;The military-industrial complex controls our foreign policy!&quot;</p>

<p>Do: &quot;It&#39;s crazy how much money we spend annually for our military. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the heads of those companies paid some politicians to actively favor aggressive actions regarding our foreign affairs...I mean, it&#39;s unlikely that people would bribe our congressmen to kill people, but with <em>so</em> much money involved...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is a great idea. I&#39;ve actually already been doing this with one person I know. I approached them like this, &quot;Hey, do you have a little bit of time? I really value your opinion and want to see what you think of something. I can kind of see both sides to this thing, but something about it doesn&#39;t seem quite right and is bothering me. I wanted to see what you thought of it.&quot;</p>

<p>When you do it that way, they are more prone to listen. Now, you&#39;ll have to use your acting skills a little bit, but it is worth it.</p>
