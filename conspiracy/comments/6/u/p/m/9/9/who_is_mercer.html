       Just heard of him few days ago. Surely people here must be knowing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I got from a quick wikipedia search
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Leroy Mercer (born July 11, 1946),[2] better known as Bob Mercer, is an American computer scientist, a developer in early artificial intelligence, and co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a successful hedge fund.[3][2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercer is a major donor to conservative political causes such as Breitbart News, [4] Donald Trump's 2016 campaign for president,[5] and Brexit in the United Kingdom.[6] He is the principal benefactor of the Make America Number 1 Super PAC.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
       Renaissance Technologies LLC is an East Setauket, New York-based[4] American investment management firm founded in 1982 by James Simons, an award-winning mathematician and former Cold War code breaker,
      </p>
      <p>
       Simons is a major contributor to Democratic Party political action committees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics,
      </p>
      <p>
       Simons is currently ranked the #5 donor to federal candidates in the 2016 election cycle, coming behind co-CEO Robert Mercer, who is ranked #1 and generally donates to Republicans.[30] Simons has donated $7 million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA Action,[31
      </p>
      <p>
       Bigger then Soros
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Renaissance is the top financial firm contributing to federal campaigns in the 2016 election cycle, donating $33,108,000 by July.[34] By comparison, over that same period sixth ranked Soros Fund Management has contributed $13,238,551.[34] Renaissance's managers have also been active in the 2016 cycle, contributing nearly $30 million by June, with Mercer ranking as the #1 individual federal donor, largely to Republicans, and Simons ranked #5, largely to Democrats.[3

       Jane Mayer is a true Investigative Journalist. It's a great article full of quality original research, with gems like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Patterson also recalled Mercer arguing that, during the Gulf War, the U.S. should simply have taken Iraq’s oil, “since it was there.” Trump, too, has said that the U.S. should have “kept the oil.” Expropriating another country’s natural resources is a violation of international law. Another onetime senior employee at Renaissance recalls hearing Mercer downplay the dangers posed by nuclear war.
        <strong>
         Mercer, speaking of the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, argued that, outside of the immediate blast zones, the radiation actually made Japanese citizens healthier.
        </strong>
        The National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to support this notion. Nevertheless, according to the onetime employee, Mercer, who is a proponent of nuclear power, “was very excited about the idea, and felt that it meant nuclear accidents weren’t such a big deal.”
       </p>

       I am not asking as in "Who is this Master conspirator, here are the details"

       I am literally curious about " Who is Mercer". I heard his name only yesterday, in connection with bannon.

       We hear a lots about George Soros in conspiracy land, but the opposite equivalent of that is not mentioned at all.

       Good point. I would like to know more about this man myself as I had heard his name brought up before in reference to trump. I believe Mercer also donates a fair bit to Rand Paul if I'm not mistaken. No sources just me trying to remember.

       I'll add a few thing about this, first his company Cambridge Analytica needs to be looked into. Corbett Report as usual does an excellent job looking into this as well as HIGHLY underrated duo (at least on this sub) of Aaron and Melissa Dykes of TruthStream Media.

       As OP also stated Mercer is HEAVILY involved Conservative Right Wing Ideologies and has Zionist ties to add. His daughter Rebekah Mercer has ties to the Gatestone Institute, a Neocon think tank.

       Gatestone Institute has ties to the Hudson Institute which has ties to the Rand Corporation, a major arm of the military industrial complex and its imperialist aims of Global Dominance.

       That's a lot of jumps to get to Rand Corp, and if there's any entity for which additional backing would be meaningless, it's Rand.  They're basically the tip of the info spear for the entire MIC, which has already been in charge since Eisenhower.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wouldn't cast the Mercers or Gatestone as Neocon.  They're something else ... something kind of weird.  And it's made it confusing as all hell to figure out what's happening in the WH, as McMaster &amp; Co. are coming across as Neocons who aren't Iran hawks and are being cast by Team Mercer as anti-Israel.  But then how the hell can that line up with Team Mercer (Bannon) being the ones who pushed to end the CIA Syrian program, while they were fought by McMaster and the other generals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think this all goes back to China being the pivot point, with the Mercer camp wanting to normalize relations with Russia to avoid pushing them to team up with China, whereas the Neocons are still focused on Russia as the Big Baddie, and they want to normalize with Iran to forestall the same process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest difference with the Neocons is that Bannon, the Mercers and Gatestone seem focused on fighting the West vs. Islam culture war at home, which is a strategy that hasn't really had much of a public airing.

       Neocons want to remake the Middle East in their image with lots of nation-building.  But they hollowly preach "tolerance" and multiculturalism at home, so that they're allowed to keep destroying countries in the MENA and creating refugees.  Bush, Tony Blair, and Hillary are the posterchildren for this approach.

       The Mercers and Gatestone are taking the opposite approach, being non-interventionism, but fighting a culture war against Islam at home.  Trump and Le Pen have been the biggest proponents of this approach.  More paleocon than neocon.

       Good point. I would like to know more about this man myself as I had heard his name brought up before in reference to trump. I believe Mercer also donates a fair bit to Rand Paul if I'm not mistaken. No sources just me trying to remember.
