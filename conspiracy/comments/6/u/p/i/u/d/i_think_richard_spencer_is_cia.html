        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve googled this and seen it talked about by douches and racists, and I&#39;ve heard it talked about as a joke. I&#39;ve personally thought Spencer was a <em>possible</em> plant since before the election. </p>

<p>I think &#39;Based Stick man&#39; Kyle Chapman is a possible federal agent as well, seeing as though he&#39;s had a violent past, allegedly has had run-ins with the ATF, and has had several felony charges dropped. With a record like his, it makes me very suspicious that he&#39;s a free man.</p>

<p>Why would they do this? Well, to get people <em>actually</em> fighting. The left has been ready for war for a while. The <em>normal</em> or traditional right wasn&#39;t taking the civil war bait, so they organized the fringe and if you turn a live feed on YouTube today, you&#39;ll see numerous sheep on both sides in Boston doing <em>exactly</em> what the establishment and the media want them to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agreed except his isnt international. He is a FBI plant. So is Cernavich. Fairbanks. Deray. Etc. look at Fairbanks. Average chick. Gained notoriety in steubanville. Then went to help Dancing Man. Then Kelly thomas. Was fuck the police. Then went to BLM. IMMEDIATELY paired with deray and netta. Then moved to Bernie Bros. then move to Trumper with a WH press pass. With ease. Why? Cuz Handler! Same with Spencer. He was gonna &quot;harm&quot; some Jews near some land i own. Whitefish,MT. Hyped it up to see which &quot;radicals&quot; would contact him.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of it sounds plausible except Cern and Fairbanks....and even Milo for crying or loud....broke away from all of the extremist shit where your extremists like Baked Alaska went harder. I think there is a federal presence but I think it&#39;s much more present on the fringe rather than the body of the &quot;alt right&quot; which was originally triggered by guys like Andrew Breitbart and later usurped by Spencerites...,long after Breitbart (pro-Israel) was knocked off to leave the fringe susceptible to usurpation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but look how long it took to draw them all out on both sides. You&#39;re talking decades of media and Hollywood programming, politicians, etc. <em>just</em> to organize a fringe extreme enough to actually openly right for authoritarianism. Anyone who believes this is representative of anything near the majority on either side is a total sucker but the media continues to cover it as if this is the majority and not the fringe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not be surprised if Spencer was on the CIA payroll. Spencer has admitted he wants to revive the Roman Empire and he and his associates are fond of installing a Catholic monarchy and setting up something like the Roman Catholic Church&#39;s college of Cardinals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2edCI11M5bM">I am not kidding.</a>  Given that the CIA has always been dominated by Rome, this is a perfect fit. Other alt-right figures like Ramzpaul are trying to blame Protestantism for modern day liberalism. Millenial Woes admits he supports Catholicism and favors the Catholic economic model of distributism. Spencer also disregards, or, though I doubt it, is ignorant of, the 1924 Johnson Reed Act which protected White Northern European Protestant and Baptist hegemony in America by restricting immigration of Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics from Eastern and Southern Europe. Those of my persuasion regard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNqVL5YVgDg">the alt-Right to be a deep state Catholic psyop.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The white house is almost entirely Jewish year after year (under Obama there was only 1 non-Jew in the cabinet and he was married to a Jewess),</p>

<p>Obama was trained by Jesuit Greg Galluzzo. Joe Biden is a Roman Catholic with honorary degrees from two Jesuit Universities and whose son is in the Jesuit volunteer corps. White House Chief of Staff was Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained Dennis McDonough. Intelligence advisor and CIA head Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained Leon Panetta, Director of Naitonal Intelligence Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained James Clapper. Senior Advisor for Strategy and Communication and White House Communications Director Dan Phiffer Jesuit trained Roman Catholic. Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained Secretary of State John Kerry. Secretary of Defense Roman Cahtolic Jesuit-trained Robert Gates, Roman Catholic Jesuit professor Chuck Hagel. Chairmen of Joint Chiefs of Staff Roman Catholic Martin Dempsey and Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic Joseph Dunford. Secretarty of Homeland SEcurity Jesuit-trained Janet Napolitano. I&#39;ll stop there. Theses were the most important people int the Obama cabinet. All Roman Catholic Jesuit. </p>

<p>As for Trump, you may review the following links showing the vast amount of Roman Catholic and Jesuit collaborators he has appointed and his connection to the Archbishop of New York. Also know that three of his children are all Jesuit-trained. Eric Trump is on the board of directors of Georgetown University&#39;s Business Society and Public Policy Initiative. Trump himself attended Jesuit Fordham for two years. </p>

<p>Also, the heads of both Houses of Congress ar Roman Catholic, during Obama and Trumps tenures. Under Obama the President of the Senate was Jesuit Joe Biden and the Speaker of the House was Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained John Boehnor. Under Trump the Speaker of the House is Roman Catholic Paul Ryan and the President of the Senate is self-described evangelical Catholic Mike Pence. Also, Catholic are the most represented people in Congress. Congress is comprised of over 30% Catholics. Only 5% are Jews.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is ruled by a majority of Roman Catholics, including the Chief Justice John Roberts. </p>

<p>So we have covered the executive bracnh, the legislatice branch and the Judicial branch; all branches are thoroughly Roman Catholic. </p>

<p>the IMF and Federal Reserve have never had a non-Jewish chairman,</p>

<p>No, the head of the IMF is Christine Lagard who is a French Roman Catholic. And the head of the more important Bank of International Settlements is a Spanish Roman Catholic Jamie Caruana. </p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is controlled by a Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic named Jerome Powell. Powell controls all of the major decisions of the Federal Reserve, he being the chair of the most important committees and the majority of comittees in general, including the chair of the committee of affairs of the Board of Governors itself, while Janet Yellen is the chair of zero of these committees, was sworn in by a Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic named Daniel Tarullo who was dubbed the most powerful man in banking, and whose husband is a professor at Jesuit Georgetown. Powell controls the oversight and supervision of banks, lending of money to the federal government, Federal Reserve Bank affairs, regional and comunnity banking, etc. See my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q10UggQc1XY">video on the Federal Reserve.</a></p>

<p>an unseemly number of Jews run the major corporations and media conglomerates</p>

<p>That is propaganda. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RomeRules/comments/5iji87/jesuits_at_the_head_of_worlds_top_50/">The most super-conneted companies have Roman Catholic Jesuit-trained head executives</a> and the media is ran by the CIA which is and has always been totally Roman Catholic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AIPAC donates over 3 times as much as the next PAC, the biggest donors to both parties are Israeli dual citizens, and Netanyahu can blatantly violate American law and enter into the U.S. congress/senate without permission and get no less than 40 separate standing ovations while calling for nuclear war against Iran</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Israelis need a lobby speaks for itself. There is no need for a lobby when you already control everything. Hence the Catholic lobby, which used to be the largest lobby in politics many decades ago is now quite unimportant. The Vataican owns the Temple Mount and Old City of Jerusalem as exposed by Israeli Journalist and author Joel Bainermann and author Barry Chamish. The Israelis and the Palestinians are servants of the pope. Arafat had 11 audiences with the Pope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christine Lagarde has openly bragged about having Jewish ancestry and has married 2 Jews, worked for a Rothschild central bank, and received money from the Zionists in France. In the U.S. all the leaders in congress take money from AIPAC, this is a verified fact, and are required to sign papers stating they will support Israel before they are allowed to take their seats. Benjamin Netanyahu was able to make an illegal speech in the U.S. congress and got a 45 minute Stalin-style standing ovation because AIPAC told them they had to or they would fund an opponent to run against them.  </p>

<p>As for the Catholics, Only one pope since Vatican II hasn&#39;t had Jewish ancestry, and he was forced to resign (Pope Benedict). John Paul II said he had Jewish family and bragged about having Jewish friends and growing up in a Jewish neighborhood. Pope Francis&#39;s family has Jewish origins from the Venice region, which had the largest Jewish population in the world at one point. Besides, in countries like Spain and Italy it is a known fact that when Jews were expelled or &#39;persecuted&#39; they would fake converting to Christianity and always put 1 son in the priesthood to hedge their bets. You can read about this in the Encyclopaedia Judaica.</p>

<p>In regards to the federal reserve, why were all the chairmen Jews and not Catholics? Why would they let the murderers of Jesus control the chair position and run everything? Or are you going to make some dubious claims about some secret Catholic fake underling who is really in charge and Yellen is just a puppet? Evidence please. Also, how is Tarullo more powerful than the Rothschilds, who control over 60% of all the world&#39;s wealth? That is a retarded premise and, once again, you present no evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;The Vatican owns the Temple Mount and Old City of Jerusalem as exposed by Israeli Journalist and author Joel Bainermann and author Barry Chamish.&quot; - “Jews may use subterfuges to circumvent a ‘goy.’” - Baba Kamma 113a - &quot;To communicate anything to a Goy about our religious relations would be equal to the killing of all Jews, for if the Goyim knew what we teach about them, they would kill us openly.&quot; - Sanhedrin 59a</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercer is a Trump supporter. Antifa/Nazis only serve to silence productive discourse and take time resources away from Trump. IMO Antifa/Nazis/BLM are part of the same strategies. Antifa has no relevance if there aren&#39;t fascist to violently be fascist against. They can&#39;t exactly show up at their own rallies and beat the shit out of themselves. </p>

<p>BLM is suspiciously absent since the elections, a tell tale sign their funding dried up which is indicative of a mission specific political group that preceded Antifa in public awareness. </p>

<p>If I had to guess the point of BLM it was to act as a wedge between the police and the populace. Now they&#39;re gone and surprise, Antifa and the Nazis are fighting while the police take a smoke break and let everyone beat the shit out of each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got FOIA-obtained documents on <a href="/r/psychotronics">/r/psychotronics</a> that show they didn&#39;t trust the secrets of MKUltra with more than 2 top agents!

<p>Anyways, I know that Bannon attended the Georgetown School of Foreign Service and is a trained diplomat.  This is usually cover for the CIA, and the CIA are NWO globalists.  That is my logic, anyways...  </p>

<p>I have been reading and watching some videos and I now wonder if Bannon left so that he can be a back channel of information to Trump.  They have been keeping certain information from Trump and isolating him.  Perhaps Bannon stayed long enough to learn how it all works, then left to help from the outside.  </p>

<p>And the research backs this up. Spencer appears to have taken his playbook from Russian right-wing ideologue, Alexander Dugin. It&#39;s also not a secret that the &quot;protesters&quot; in Charlottesville chanted, among other slogans, &quot;Russia is our friend.&quot; As if to buffer the fallout of certain ties.</p>

<p>A simple search for &quot;Alt right russia ties&quot; will produce a plethora of articles on the subject. By all accounts, Russia is exerting influence on American politics by propping up and influencing these white-nationalists on our own soil. It&#39;s not a secret, yet it doesn&#39;t seem to get the attention that the violent acts committed by these groups affords. Not a surprise, but do not be fooled by the source of these groups&#39; influence.</p>

If we become too preoccupied with our home front, they will have an easier time achieving their international goals like annexing Ukraine, establishing the Moscow-Tehran axis, and a whole host of other strategic positionings that they expect to pave the way for their return to global political preeminence.

<p>That&#39;s hilarious. </p>

<p>Oath Keepers have been around since 2009. The tea party formed after the 2008 election.</p>

<p>Which leftists have been ready for war?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And whoever the organizer of all this is (presumably CIA?) they would totally trust hundreds of random actors they hired to keep a secret that would destroy the republic. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got FOIA-obtained documents on <a href="/r/psychotronics">/r/psychotronics</a> that show they didn&#39;t trust the secrets of MKUltra with more than 2 top agents! They knew that people have crises of conscience, find Jesus, get drunk and brag, confide in close friends and relatives, etc, etc. </p>

<p>To me, this fact completely debunks the &quot;crisis actor&quot; theories that are bandied about here.</p>
