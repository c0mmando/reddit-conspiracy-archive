    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the parasitic nature of archons is unproveable, especially if you look at our current paradigm. It&#39;s a leeching system that takes our energy in one form or another, whether it be our money or our health, we are constantly being leeched off. Everytime we get close to exposing this ie: Pizzagate, Satanism, etc.. there is giant backlash from TPTB and more division created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those things all have earthy explanations that involve emotions and blackmail. There&#39;s no logical reason to invoke archons, which again have no definite proof. It&#39;s an interesting theory, but it&#39;s just one of millions of metaphysical theories that cannot be proven or disproven. No one knows what happens after we die, and there&#39;s no proof archons exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though I believe there are external negative forces at play here, it is apparent that focusing on human beings and verifiable facts is the best strategy. The outside forces are able to evade detection due to advanced technology and understanding of the nature of beings and are also regulated in a way by a system of rules that limits them to mostly tricking and tempting us. They trick us into enslaving each other. So, if we just identify, target and deal with the humans that decided to betray their own species, we can be largely successful in remedying the problem.</p>

<p>It is a spiritual problem and conflict, but defining spiritual is elusive. Spirituality is a practice of contemplating existence and how we should interact with each other. The two extremes are to treat others the way we would want to be treated or to embrace self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. This choice is unavoidable in life, as we face conflicts of self-interests, and almost all of us have chosen both of these options at different times. They have recurring patterns.</p>

<p>The presence of the temptations from outside negative forces pushes us to choose to either embrace their way of life or reject it and behave with integrity toward each other. This is seen as useful and allowed, in a limited way, by other beings. If we choose to be self-serving even at the expense of others, we are threats to others just like the ones who came to become threats to us. They are seeking slaves and they get them by tricking species into enslaving others, so they enslave themselves for the greater self-serving minds.</p>

<p>So, this is set up, in a way, for our evolution or devolution if we so choose. It filters out souls that want to be useless eaters, parasites, not by chiding them for being evil, but by allowing them to form their own agreement with others that also believe that others don&#39;t deserve freedom. Then, basically, the slave seeker is declared a slave and has no ability to rhetorically defend itself other than to repent and renounce seeking slavery for others. Yet, it might seem a little late. </p>

<p>So, the individual judges God and itself, which are all one consciousness inside all life, as a slave to be exploited and so it judges itself as a slave to be exploited. This is the game the dark uses to recruit fools to be slaves like them.</p>

<p>As you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. God, a being of virtually infinite intelligence and perspective, sees his individuals as what they are, unique individuals. As such, the only proper judge of them is themselves. God let&#39;s beings judge themselves. If a being can stand living with its own kind alone, it is at the minimum level of acceptable. If not, it can just destroy itself by embracing out of integrity behaviors towards its other selves in a sort of quarantine, a separation, for itself and other like minded individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He does keep an open mind. He stated he&#39;s open to the theory but also suggested that it should be treated as a theory, and not a fact. I agree. I&#39;m in the same boat. I&#39;m open to such theories and don&#39;t see it being too far of a stretch. However since it&#39;s unproven we shouldn&#39;t try to adopt that as the main narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there are times to focus on the physical and obvious rather than the supernatural, so as not to scare off normies. It&#39;s easier to get someone to understand that 9/11 was a false flag because of WTC7, rather than explaining that Christmas is a pagan celebration of the winter solstice and September 11 is <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/was-jesus-born-sept-11-3-b-c/">Jesus&#39; real birthday</a>, according to the Book of Revelations, hence why they picked that date.</p>

<p>But as many people here keep looking, they find the supernatural is the real ultimate conspiracy, and everything else the distraction to keep us from finding the powerful and horrific truths that we are all part of something bigger and more powerful (some call it god) and that our world is run by evil (Satanists, Luciferians, etc.).</p>

<p>When I read about how Google and GoDaddy kicked a neo-Nazi site off their servers , I immediately thought of the censorship and the American right to freedom of speech.

<p>That represents <em>billions</em> of dollars in propaganda funds.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s CNN alone.</p>

<p>There is a global media marketing campaign to present Trump as the Nazi Russian-puppet Klansman. </p>

<li>The last few ways to control him are through manipulation, intimidation, and deception, and then finally through physical means - which they&#39;ve all done and displayed. </li>
<li>When people say &quot;thank you for exposing his establishment ties!!&quot; what ties are you even talking about? He has almost no allies in the White House it&#39;s like there&#39;s a snake behind every corner. There are very, very few Trump loyalists and maybe half of them are his kids. 6. The few &quot;corrupt evil bankers&quot; he&#39;s put in are just good at what they do - they&#39;re businessmen. I could surely do some research into all of his picks but what&#39;s the point? Is Trump responsible for every last one? His incredible accomplishments and reversal of America&#39;s downfall speaks for itself. The label of &quot;greedy evil bankers&quot; doesn&#39;t really hold when mostly everything so far balances the budget, helps the economy, and tries to reverse the economic stranglehold Obama placed on the country.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called psychology. MSM attacks Donald Trump incessantly on some very basic things that trigger the reptilian brain and a visceral reaction. The main reaction is to embolden Trump supporters. This crowds out any calm reasoned analysis and keeps the loud &quot;both sides&quot; fighting to such an extreme level as to make others quiet down and give up.</p>

<p>MSM made Donald Trump. Now they are preparing to use the widespread disgust with him as a tool to make the next oligarch, Mike Pence for example, seem decent or reasonable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s kind of hard to make the argument that he&#39;s Establishment,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When non-truth becomes the centerpiece of a political figure, there can be no people&#39;s will, no democracy, no progress, no consensus. </p>

<p>To suggest that Donald Trump is not establishment, no matter how eloquent the attempt may be, is to ignore the very basics: that Donald Trump was placed in the primary from day one to clear the field and take the nomination, that Donald Trump&#39;s actual policy positions have been establishment, and that Donald Trump has completely backed away from any of those promises he made that would place him to the &quot;left&quot; of HRC. </p>

<p>The only reason Obamacare has not been overturned is because it is outside of what is politically possible -- a rare case of politicians being afraid of the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Magnora,</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an upvote for such an insightful comment! I agree with you 100%.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that Trump is some random outsider. That&#39;s what I referred to the Powers that recruited him.</p>

<p>Trump is the face of another faction. A rival cartel.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re watching is a &quot;corporate takeover&quot; on a massive scale. And the new corporate raiders aren&#39;t idealistic anti-establishmentarians. They&#39;re hard-nosed business interests with pragmatic goals.</p>

<p>For the time being, certain people (me among them) can&#39;t be faulted for thinking that (for just this moment) their interests and our align.</p>

<p>I really believe they do. For now.</p>

<p>Of course, after they finish the purge and consolidate their power, they&#39;ll inevitably get greedy and stupid (like what happened the last go-around). It happens <em>every</em> go-around.</p>

<p>It&#39;s endemic with institutions. The longer they last, the more corruption and malfeasance sets in. And then the machine breaks down.</p>

<p>And we start the cycle all over again.</p>

<p>My point here is that what we&#39;re watching is a cycle. (Like in the book &quot;The Fourth Turning,&quot; which tracks different Ages as they cycle through four basic cultural/historical periods.) People miss the mark when they think of Trump as a &quot;person&quot;. He&#39;s not. He&#39;s the spokesman for a larger group.</p>

<p>According to &quot;The Fourth Turning,&quot; had it not been Trump, it would have been someone else.</p>

<p>And not because the rival cartel was brilliant, or had foresight. It&#39;s just part of a larger historical process.</p>

<p>When you go with the drift of history, doorways open. When you try to fight it, you flail in disaster.</p>

<p>Look at the DNC trying to synthetically replicate the era of the 1960s. Trying desperately to re-create the Civil Rights movement. To re-fashion the mob violence and student protests.</p>

<p>(Except this time around, they have to hire actors and pay people.)</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p>The 1960s (and the circumstances that rose to shape it) are all gone. This is a totally different era (with its own underlying forces).</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t respect that, you are condemned to failure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that could be a route they could take in theory, the presentation is wrong.  Just today I was listening to NPR (I like multiple news sources) where they had two people talking about Trump&#39;s reaction to the recent protests, counter protests, and unfortunate death of an innocent.  When the pro-Trump guest was speaking, he was interrupted to be corrected on petty definitions, he was given little time to speak, and was not reengaged by the speaker, where as the anti-Trump speaker was allowed to speak for triple the length, uninterrupted while calling for more protests and slurring Trump personally, and was then asked a couple questions to continue her tirade of anti-hate hate speech.  This seems like a not-so-subtle smear campaign than them pulling a fast one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much of that coverage is significantly damaging coverage? From what I can see, they are just pushing irrelevant stories and exaggerating these stories so some people think it is bad while others are just sick of hearing about it, and thinking &#39;he isn&#39;t <em>that</em> bad&#39; and causing a lot of divisions over it.</p>

<p>CNN loves Trump. They love writing these bullshit stories for clicks. If the media was truly against Trump, and Trump was really not a part of the establishment, he wouldn&#39;t be getting negative air time. He would be getting no air time. This pretend negative airtime is having the opposite effect of what it is perceived of doing. It isn&#39;t to make him look bad. It makes it look like he is, so people think he isn&#39;t <em>as bad</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually the banks and military and media are relatively coordinated though. But here we see the media clearly with an unbelievably coordinated anti-trump bias, so it seems clear those who own the media want the public to hate Trump. But if the military-industrial-banking complex owns trump, then why is the media being so uniformly negative? Did the media suddenly divorce from the MIBC? Extremely doubtful. </p>

<p>So why do the elite want the public to hate the guy that they control? It really doesn&#39;t make sense at all, unless they&#39;re planning to use him as a scapegoat for some awful shit they&#39;re about to pull. Maybe I&#39;m making a leap of logic there, and sure Bush and Obama were scapegoats for the deep state, but they had the backing of the media by and large. The way the media wants to make it look like everyone has turned on trump, when many large companies are getting exactly what they want, is a bit baffling. Unless they want us to hate him because he&#39;ll take the blame for some horrible thing coming down the pipeline, then they can throw him away and pretend like a revolution was had and then continue on like before </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, every single thing you listed is bullshit. Let&#39;s go through the list...</p>

<p>The Trump infrastructure plan is a giant giveaway to business in the form of tax credits, as opposed to an actual jobs program.</p>

<p>There was no news regarding the Awwan case. He was arrested 2 weeks ago. And he worked for the house, not the senate.</p>

<p>The Clinton investigation itself was not reopened.  Rather, the FBI reopened a FOIA request previously made by Trump&#39;s lawyers.</p>

<p>3.7% GDP was FORECAST for 3rd quarter 2017 by the Atalanta Fed. </p>

<p>There was an article in Salon which showed evidence that Guccifer 2.0 was not a Russian hacker, but someone with local access to the DNC servers. It made no assessment of the rest of the Trump/Russia collusion claims.</p>

They&#39;re tightening money supply, it&#39;s only a matter of time before it catches up to demand and is reflected in a stock market move downward. Then it&#39;ll be blamed on Trump, instead of the people who actually did it, and those who did it will be bailed out by the government they basically own </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but the stock market is hooked on 0% so anything other than 0% now is a shock to the system over the long term. We were at 0% for waaaay too long, and also had QE, and the markets haven&#39;t even retracted from the interest rate increase yet... the whole market is set up on a paradigm that doesn&#39;t exist now, and that&#39;s why it&#39;ll crash, imo.

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair the markets haven&#39;t reacted too negatively to the interest rate hikes because of the weakening dollar and expectations of Trump&#39;s tax cut. That&#39;s why in the short term atleast, the market is being rational.</p>

There is an investigation ongoing and it doesn&#39;t rely on citizens attention to conclude.  Weather the people focus on it really makes no significant difference.  Manfort MAY be guilty of SOMETHING but that is literally all we know at this point.  There is only so many Russian connections you can keep the American people entertained with.  They conduct much more nefarious plots that NO ONE is paying attention to that we should actually be focusing on.

<p>Did that ban actually happen though? Last I heard, the military was not given any marching orders. The same thing with the NK &quot;threat&quot;. I heard NK threaten us in response to the sanctions, but then I heard Trump respond in his typical fashion. </p>

<p>None of this would be a distraction if the media could stop themselves from reporting on every single thing he tweets. His twitter feed is literally front page news. Trump could take two shits in a single day and the media would spend all day analyzing that... </p>

<p>There is no distraction if the media, main stream and social, didn&#39;t hang on his every last word. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look at Obama or Hillary&#39;s tweets. they are incredibly PC, expected stuff. no need to report on that. nearly every day, Trump has a tweet saying inflammatory shit, riling people up. of course the media is going to report on that. </p>

<p>at this point i would be shocked if Trump tweets for any reason other than to get a bunch of articles written about it.</p>

<p>I want to be perfectly clear with you guys that many of the people who will be there are National Socialist and Ethnostate sort of groups. I don’t endorse them. In this case, the pursuit of preserving without shame white culture, our goals happen to align. I’ll be there regardless of the questionable company because saving history is more important than our differences. This is probably why they named the event “Unite the Right.”
Speaking for myself only, I won&#39;t be punching right. We need to save civilization first, we can argue about the exact details later.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the statement by the OP before he deleted it. They knew full well they would be marching with Nazis and White Supremacists. He basically says &quot;well I&#39;m not one of them but in regards to white culture we have the same goals&quot;, which apparently didn&#39;t set off any red flags for them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there were a real threat of nuclear war, wouldn&#39;t the people who work for the media be more concerned about that then about whatever other political crap is going on? I&#39;d think they&#39;d want to keep bringing it up so that somebody could do something to prevent it. Being on TV doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll get that sweet bunker access if shit goes down.</p>

<p>Even if they were being threatened to keep quiet, that would be like having two people pointing guns at them, one saying, &quot;Talk or I&#39;ll shoot,&quot; and the other, &quot;Shut up or I&#39;ll shoot,&quot; - you&#39;d figure on average half the people would keep talking.</p>

<p>Which all means that I don&#39;t think this is something the powers that be could very well keep quiet, so what a drop in media coverage means I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>However, this is the fact everybody keeps missing. White nationalists aren&#39;t just gonna get violent at such a highly publicized event -- they understand they have no large public support, and they especially understand they have no support within the legal system. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t just decide to get violent. The police were ordered to stand down and were <em>allowed</em> to get violent. Reports on the ground were police were actually marching the two groups TOWARDS each other, which is the exact opposite of what their training is. </p>

<p>This violence was allowed to happen in order to serve a political purpose. It was extremely effective, too, because now my social media is filled with people who truly believe White Supremacy is at an epidemic level. </p>

<p>My understanding was that it was the largest neo-nazi gathering in like 20 years. Which if true, seems perfectly reasonable that the media would cover it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that bothers me is that I&#39;m having trouble finding a decent crowd size estimate for Charlottesville, either aggregate or per &quot;side&quot;.   The closest thing I&#39;ve found from an admittedly cursory search for size numbers is &quot;500 white nationalists.&quot;</p>

<p>Without an actual number, relative claims like &quot;the largest neo-nazi gathering in 20 years&quot; doesn&#39;t say very much and may actually be inflating perceptions of the size.</p>

<p>If the &quot;largest in 20 years&quot; is really only 500 people, is it that big in absolute terms?  The marches associated with Occupy Wall Street numbered in the thousands, for example.  The Watts riots in 1965 had close to 30,000 active participants.  12,000 people were full-on <em>arrested</em> during the Rodney King riots.  Even the Kent State protests where students were shot in 1970 drew 2,000 protesters.</p>

<p>So given that the Charlottesville Nazi Protest (the actual planned event) was around 500 people, it&#39;s at least an order of magnitude smaller than other protests.  How newsworthy is it, really, and to what degree did reporting on it ahead of time increase both white nationalist attendance and the size of counter-protesters?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we could debate what role the media had in enraging that young man into doing such a thing. But from my pov its def 100% his doing. Not the medias regardless of what they&#39;ve done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the guy driving the car into the crowd is solely responsible for that act and there&#39;s no way to blame the media for his actions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m commenting more on the media blowing the so-called white nationalist movement way out of proportion, not any individual action.  The media simultaneously giving them a ton of credibility -- they&#39;re &quot;organized&quot;, a &quot;movement&quot; and they have &quot;followers&quot;, while at the same time <em>discrediting</em> them as racists, thugs, stupid, etc.  It&#39;s a fascinating dichotomy to have them be <em>both</em> functionally effective and individually defective.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they both can be true -- my sense is that the far right really is mostly incompetent, which ultimately makes it a non-threat outside of lone wolves, but I do think lone wolves are often inspired by mass media coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the North Korean &quot;threat&quot; is a long term fabrication. They&#39;ve almost got an entire generation now, that, when they hear North Korea, they instantly think &quot;Dictator, Propoganda, Crazy Leader&quot; </p>

<p>I think this was just to test the waters of how people would react, talking about a threat, name a real zone as the potential strike zone, throw things on prime time, get more serious, push things to the front page, instill a sense of importance in tone when addressing this on the media. </p>

<p>This has been brewing, and it will continue to brew, but we&#39;ll go to war with them, sooner or later we will. I give it, top, 4 years. If not Trump, then early next president, unless the next one is some real American not controlled, then we will be fighting NK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some claim that certain celestial events like this upcoming eclipse are nodes in time and space of potential change of consciousness. Beings put some of the ingredients into the soup and it becomes a subtle, yet potentially powerful, adjustment of perception to many beings. Such change is usually not consciously realized by beings, because they lack enough awareness of how their own minds work to perceive the change.</p>

<p>The cabal is a network of separate groups of beings that generally embrace a path of service to the self even at the expense of others, the definition of evil. They find utility in cooperating with each other to achieve mutually beneficial results. So, they are working together on a project of enslaving the human race, to serve themselves better, but they are being used as tools of enslavement of humanity by negative beings from offworld. </p>

<p>They all rely on secrecy, deception and coercion, basically manipulation of others, to achieve their goals. They infiltrate, survey and corrupt systems and then insert deceptive signals in order to subvert systems into serving themselves. This applies to hackers, the cabal, and the offworld negative beings that control them.</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>These people are in the middle of dismantling any portion of the government which regulates or holds industry accountable for their actions. Think Industrial China. Trump is just a circus and a sideshow to keep everyone cranked up on manufactured outrage so nobody will notice the coup is dismantling labor and environmental protections, education, remaining civil rights etc. This is really what&#39;s going on behind the show. If you look for the hints and whispers of the real actions of the administration you can piece the big picture together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler proposed many peace treaties but they refused because he wouldn&#39;t let them have so much influence in the government like many countries such as America. They portrayed him to the world as someone who just hated. He said he would lay down arms if everyone else did as well. They all refused and forced his hand. Nationalism is bad for Jews, our nationalism is bad for them. However, they love their own nationalism. Destroying everybody else&#39;s nationalistic bonds is their goal. They hated Germans for being nationalists under Hitler. The jews want to hang on to their National identity as Gods chosen people, whether anyone else likes it or not.</p>

<p>Back in the last century Nationalism was the big new idea. Everyone was doing it.
Sibelius Finlandia, Vaughn Williams, Wagner, Elgar... But the jews didn&#39;t want that so what did we get?
Schonberg, Stockhausen, Boulez... Jewish dischord.</p>

<p>&quot;Deconstructivism&quot; masquerading as intellectual progress.
Jewish Jihad wrapped in bows and ribbons. Jews want to be the only people on earth to have the rights to assemble and have a sense of themselves. In other words, they want to be the only people on earth that have the right to be racists. At least White Nationalism wants White empowerment, but it also respects and recognizes the rights of other races and ethnicities to exist! And thus far remains the only such group on earth that does so! Meaning, that everyone else thinks it&#39;s ok for others to be racially aware (except if you&#39;re White).
Iv&#39;e browsed Stormfront a lot .. and these guys are no where near the racists that people portray them as, they just figured out what was really going on when liberalism started becoming popular in the US did you watch the video from vice about the protests? Notice how a lot of them were not skinheads and people in white hoods?
 Normal white americans who realized what was going on when their brothers and sisters started telling them how oppression is only going to get worse if we do not do something.  These jews saw Hitler and Germany as a threat. Some died don&#39;t get me wrong but it was far less, In the lower hundreds of thousands and that was from the typhus epidemic and starvation from allied bombing runs on food supplies the &quot;gas chambers&quot; were just for delousing (typhus is caused by lice), hence the evidence of stairs leading to a &quot;changing room&quot; to get undressed before going in. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2gLRs">http://imgur.com/a/2gLRs</a> said by Alexander Trachtenburg - a Communist Zionist..
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/WbBJL">http://imgur.com/a/WbBJL</a> These jews are Manipulators and play the victim role (&quot;poor me&quot;) by portraying themselves as victims of circumstances or someone else&#39;s behavior in order to gain pity or sympath. . Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering, and the manipulator often finds it easy and rewarding to play on sympathy to get cooperation. But now when people come out with the truth on such a place as stormfront who gained thousands of people in the last few years they became fearful. I mean look at this ..<a href="https://wearechange.org/israel-demands-world-internet-censorship/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wrc+%28We+Are+Change%29">https://wearechange.org/israel-demands-world-internet-censorship/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wrc+%28We+Are+Change%29</a>  They are losing control as the people become awakened. Forums like Stormfront are one of the reasons why those who claim to be Jews but who are not, are no longer able to dictate what others learn of their years of lies and media control.</p>

<p>Folks this the the brutal and honest truth.. Liberalism will and never will work.. It is sowing the very seeds that they are against. If people don&#39;t come to this realization very soon things will only get worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites know Trump is emotional.  The Anifta effort was planned to get him frustrated and irrational. They know he will lose his shit and make a mistake.  That&#39;s the goal is make him miserable.  It will make everyone tired of the bullshit and they think that alone will get some puppet elected.  They don&#39;t want people to realize the economy is booming that we are safer. Their agenda is suspended so they want to suspend Trump.  It&#39;s ugly politics and if a Democrat gets elected in 2020 we will see another massive opposition smear campaign.  </p>

<p>Media needs to be put in check and the career politicians need to go.</p>

Now, with the Internet, people have realized that things are much much scarier than movies, TV,  and print. So instead of being able to tell people what to be afraid of and get angry over, they have to show people in order to keep power. 
We&#39;re being manipulated to keep fighting eachother and not question who our enemies actually are
Just my take on it, but if people would realize it&#39;s a game and we&#39;re the pieces this shit would move along a whole lot faster. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM is gaming us like never before, and it&#39;s working really well. </p>

<p>They beat the same drums of &quot;negative coverage&quot; about Donald Trump constantly. Everyone has picked sides. It&#39;s a huge distraction.</p>

<p>Who are they not putting on and what are they not covering?</p>

<p>Anyone here who has been to independent sites knows the answer: TONS of stuff and TONS of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some claim that certain celestial events like this upcoming eclipse are nodes in time and space of potential change of consciousness. Beings put some of the ingredients into the soup and it becomes a subtle, yet potentially powerful, adjustment of perception to many beings. Such change is usually not consciously realized by beings, because they lack enough awareness of how their own minds work to perceive the change.</p>

<p>The cabal is a network of separate groups of beings that generally embrace a path of service to the self even at the expense of others, the definition of evil. They find utility in cooperating with each other to achieve mutually beneficial results. So, they are working together on a project of enslaving the human race, to serve themselves better, but they are being used as tools of enslavement of humanity by negative beings from offworld. </p>

<p>They all rely on secrecy, deception and coercion, basically manipulation of others, to achieve their goals. They infiltrate, survey and corrupt systems and then insert deceptive signals in order to subvert systems into serving themselves. This applies to hackers, the cabal, and the offworld negative beings that control them.</p>
