    <div class="md"><p>He kind of did in his last one. Rogan has been one of the more accepting media personalities (for lack of a better term) of Alex Jones. He&#39;s had Jones on his podcast before and will discuss things Jones says. But Rogan seemed really upset with Jones&#39; comments on what happened in Charlottesville. Rogan basically said that skepticism is great, but if your response to every major story is that it&#39;s some kind of grand conspiracy and can&#39;t even accept the possibility that it just is what it is, then you have serious problems.</p>

<p>Here are the SWIFT codes for a wire transfer that was sent from <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/354277914/SWIFT-Email-Sater-Almaty-Kazakhstan-case">Nicholas Bourg to Felix Sater</a>. These codes were for wire transfers from Telford International to Triadou SPV S.A to purchase outstanding debt from the Tri-County Mall in Cincinnati Ohio. After Triadou purchased the mall debt for $30 million, it was sold months later to TxOil for $40 million. <strong>Guess who was on the advisory board for TxOil?</strong></p>

<p><em>Felix Sater</em></p>

<p>Telford International is an investment fund ran by Viktor Khrapunov and Mukhtar Ablyazov, both of whom are wanted in Kazakhstan for large scale looting in the range of $8-12 billion. Through the Tri-County deal and several other deals, Khrapunov and Ablyazov sought to clean their money. A man named Felix Sater and Daniel Ridloff assisted in several of these operations, including efforts to purchase several condos from Trump Soho worth $3 million. <strong>Guess who Sater  and Ridloff worked for in 2010?</strong></p>

<p><em>The Trump Organisation</em></p>

<p>The Trump Organisation was one of three partners working on a development project called Trump Soho. The other partners were the Sapir Group and Bayrock. Donald Sr., Ivanka, and Donald Jr had a combined 18% equity stake in the project. The financiers of the project largely came from Kazak mining backgrounds. Those individuals, after looking at their starts in the Kazak mining industry, had heavy ties to Trans World Group and Russian mafia protection rackets ran during the Aluminum Wars. There were several crimes committed in the development process of Trump Soho, including tax fraud, money laundering, and embezzlement. <strong>Guess who worked for Bayrock during the time period that the three development partners controlled Trump Soho?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several instances of Trump Organization&#39;s financial ties to several different Russian and Kazak mafia affiliates.</p>

<p>Trump Soho was entirely funded by Kazak mining oligarchs that initially partnered with Russian mafia protection rackets during the Aluminum Wars. Several Bayrock employees that were affiliated with the Russian mafia then went on to work for the Trump Org in 2010 and participated in several other laundering efforts using funds originating from bank fraud and kleptocracy.</p>

<p>Trump Batumi in Georgia wasn&#39;t even built because the land was repurchased from the developer by shell companies of shell companies that were ultimately under the control of the original developers. Those funds for the Batumi project originated from the same person that was the financier of several different laundering operations in US that had Trump Org employees participating in.</p>

<p>Miss Universe in 2013 was in Moscow. The entire pagent was funded by the Crocus Group company. Crocus received some of the largest development loans from Sberbank at the same time that Miss Universe occured. Sberbank held severe clout within Crocus, so much so that Trump personally met with the head of Sberbank at Miss Universe and discussed a hotel project in Russia with Crocus. The Trump project in Moscow would have used funds that were part of a loan from Sberbank. Sberbank is entirely state run. </p>

<p>Why would George Sorros, a globalist billionaire, fund the Occupy movement that was about toppling the billionaire class? </p>

<p>Your premise is flawed. Occupy wasn&#39;t &quot;a movement that was about toppling the billionaire class.&quot; It may have marketed itself as such, but it was a &quot;movement&quot; being utilized by one (group of) billionaire(s) against another (group of) billionaire(s).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conservative narrative: The criminal investigation hinges on a fabricated &quot;Trump Russian Nazi&quot; narrative and a faked, completely discredited pee-pee dossier - which we have MOUNTAINS of evidence for.</p>

<p>Please oh please tell me what evidence they have on Trump? Please oh please tell me why deep-state agent Mueller, Comey&#39;s butt-buddy, is digging into financial transactions now?</p>

<p>To the guy below me - How about you give some specifics regarding these &quot;financial ties&quot; and how they&#39;re illegal? Oh you can&#39;t, because his financial transactions are clean?</p>

<p>Everything they accuse Trump and his team of doing, the Democrats have done 25x worse and I&#39;m not even exaggerating. Maybe you don&#39;t know this but the DOJ is investigating EVERYTHING them Democrats are doing. They offered Hillary a plea deal but you don&#39;t hear that on the nightly news do you? </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because no matter how much you try to project it&#39;s all going to come back to you. Democrats were caught in a lie, they kept lying, and now it&#39;s grown to an absolute cancerous, hideous tumour-infested swamp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve always said there&#39;s a divide going on in the government, where have you been? I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s more good than bad but I personally think it&#39;s the opposite. Regardless, there are confirmed &quot;white hats&quot; and &quot;black hats,&quot; whatever you want to call them, in the government and the white hats in the DOJ under Sessions finally get to make their move. Pretty telling that you don&#39;t dispute the fact that the Dems committed acts 25x worse huh? </p>

<p>Lol I actually voted for Obama twice but that&#39;s only because I just turned 18 and bought into the main-stream liberal hype. I was pretty much apolitical until the liberal SJW hysteria became mainstream and the red-pilling commenced from there. It&#39;s crazy that you think people like me even stick to fake partisan party lines - like we can&#39;t think for ourselves based on everything that&#39;s happening around us. The Democrats and GOP uniparty establishment are rotten to the core and I see no problem with throwing these swamp creatures in prison, after a fair trial of course.</p>

<p>Again, personally attacking me. For what purpose? You&#39;re just insinuating they won&#39;t talk to me because they don&#39;t like me. Wow, that really took some incredible self-awareness to realize. Except that&#39;s wrong, you don&#39;t know anything about me, and in debates, you take people on their word unless you can definitively prove otherwise. You can&#39;t debate anything else so you&#39;ll just reply to the easiest thing to attack - I understand, I&#39;ve seen it time and time again.</p>

<p>If I were in a situation of going to a pride parade, and after being told to leave my car was surrounded by an anti-gay mob that gathered illegally, and they began hitting my car and throwing rocks, I&#39;d gun it too. </p>

<p>Hilarious, you must have forgot about denying the election results, the recounting, the literally shaking crying, tantruming. That was the most childish thing I&#39;ve ever seen.

Falling into the false dichotomy, the intentional narrative of right and wrong that both sides try to play up. Choosing one side over the other doesn&#39;t make you right. </p>

<p>Really I am appalled at how terrible the conspiracy  sub has become. This was one of the first subs I subscribed to 5 years ago and it is absolutely nothing like it used to be. For anyone who is truly interested in seeing past the veil, there are many very small subs that will help you in this without basically being another <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> </p>

<p>Don&#39;t fool yourself and think any comment about one side being right or wrong is correct because they&#39;re all wrong. If you&#39;re picking sides you know nothing about real conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, not that worried. The Nazi stuff is going to blow over in the next couple of days, just like the North Korea and Venezuela war threats. It serves a purpose to suck oxygen out of media reports that week.</p>

<p>For an example, just this week, Adam Davidson released an amazing piece of investigative journalism on the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/trumps-business-of-corruption">Trump Organisation&#39;s hotel project in Batumi Georgia</a>. He follows the money trail behind the project and found that the funds for the project development and for the Trump licencing fee originated  from bank fraud involving Mukhtar Ablyazov, the former head of BTA Bank. Davidson found that the hotel was never fully built, as the deal was only done so that the development company could buyback the property from itself from shell companies that it owned in an attempt to launder the original source of funds.</p>

<p>If you look deeper into the Trump Organisation, you can find the initial link between the Trump Org through key laundering operations done in the Trump Soho project, where several Trump Org employees assisted in large scale money laundering for the Khrapunov and Ablyazov controlled investment funds.</p>

<p>Now if I were the president and I didn&#39;t want attention to be brought to a report on this deal because it was coming out that week, I think the best distraction from this would be to say some really, really dumb shit. So he does this, but it doesn&#39;t really distract the overall Special Counsel investigation, who will focus on these insanely corrupt deals. I see why he does this, but it won&#39;t necessarily distract investigators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been compiling information on several deals that I think will be important to the investigation. The first one is about Trump and his biggest and most obvious connection to the Russian and Kazak mafias. The second one is about Manafort and all of the shady financial crimes he was a part of in Ukraine. They both are long, but good imo. I have another thread about the Italian mafia connections Trump has, but I&#39;ll let you look these over first.

Maybe you don&#39;t think that, but it&#39;s pretty clear that some people will never be happy until even more Americans are in jail.

    <div class="md"><p>A cancellation fallacy implies OP believes one over the other, but that isn&#39;t what he&#39;s positing. He addresses both the Russian narrative and the influx of Nazi related news as being, what he perceives to be, false narratives pushed to invoke a certain response in the populous. On the contrary, he makes it clear that both are very wrong, just not for the reasons for which they are advertised on the news. I believe you may be misinterpreting the message.</p>

<p>Both have factual basis, even if it is sensationalism at work. It could also all be fake, that is true. I do not believe there is somehow zero substance to the russia thing, nor do I believe every single person on both sides or these recent protests are paid by Soros. I do believe there are agent provacutours and that some of the Russian stuff is overblown. However, according to DJTjr, there more to it than I thought for a long while. ($. Just $ was /still is mostly my take on trumps himselfs collusion. Other parties pay for the bots and shills and propaganda facenews clickbaits. Assange is pro Russia, heavily. I&#39;m NOT anti Russia, but I am very anti DJT, as he&#39;s not trustworthy or honestly qualified for even a puppet presidency. If this was a pre nukes and internet world, this would go better for his philosophy than actual reality) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you weren&#39;t paying attention much to the GOP and their language and actions during the election cycle. They hate Trump. Some of them &quot;signed on board&quot; because they knew they would be voted out if they didn&#39;t at the time. The whole of Washington didn&#39;t want Trump in office, but much as you see a push for strongly partisan legislation by a congressman or senator that has no hope of making it to a vote before an election cycle is complete, there&#39;s a lot of political posturing to retain political power. </p>

<p>That&#39;s part of what makes it a swamp, aside from the Capital being built upon reclaimed swamp land (the Summers here are humid and nasty!)</p>

<p>As a quick example of this; under Obama and a guaranteed veto, much of the same Republican candidates &quot;easily&quot; pushed for repair if the ACA. Then, with greater control of the house and Senate and a president who would not veto it, it can&#39;t pass the house. I guarantee you that even among the &quot;yes&quot; votes that if additional &quot;no&#39;s&quot; were needed, others whom are on record as yes would change their vote. But if they have the &quot;yes&quot; on record and a guaranteed no-pass scenario, they&#39;ll leave their vote to whatever they believe their district will reelect them for so long as the powers that be will be unaffected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>repealing the aca and replacing it with a tax break for rich people that covered less people at greater cost was like the most unpopular move ever. under obama this legislation wasnt real, it was just an idea, much easier to support. like trump said, they had 8 years, and they rushed together a shitty self serving bill that nobody wanted, that had no democrat input (unlike Ds working with Rs for the ACA). 8 years and all they did was bitch and did no work.</p>

<p>im not surprised it had little support</p>

<p>on a related note, trump is a self serving narcissistic asshole, and has been his whole life. im not surprised the whole of washington didnt want him</p>

<p>None of that happened. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-comey-emails-1494374889-htmlstory.html">Comey said</a>,</p>

<p>When the director of the FBI doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a case, there&#39;s not a case. A federal prosecutor (including Trump&#39;s own FBI director) could easily bring charges if they disagreed with Comey&#39;s findings. But alas, that haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>Gathering, transmitting, or losing classified information; you&#39;ll notice in that there is no requirement of intent. It&#39;s one of the few major crimes in this country that doesn&#39;t. Comey never had the authority to say what he did, he was by law supposed to turn over what he had to Lynch for the prosecutors decision. Instead, he made it for her after she told him &quot;call it a matter, not an investigation,&quot; and after Lynch met with Bill in a secret on the tarmac. </p>

<p>You&#39;re the one pushing the states agenda. The state never dreamed Trump could win, and now the parts of the state left in power afterwards are doing anything they can to prevent their years of illegal, conspiratorial work from evaporating under a man they can&#39;t control. If you realize this and do it anyway, you&#39;re a disgusting human being. If not, then I&#39;ve found one of Hillary&#39;s useful idiots. </p>

<p>The only ones saying Mueller&#39;s probe is exclusively focused on Trump/Russia are the media and their retarded followers. The probe was opened to investigate <strong>all</strong> instances of collusion with Russia, <strong>including the Clinton campaiogn</strong>. </p>

<p>If there were any true collusion in the sense of it being any different than say AIPAC&#39;s or Saudi Arabia&#39;s standard practice or bribery.. If there were anything that were outside of that playbook, Obama and his officials would have stepped in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because it&#39;s a big fucking farce and you know it. </p>

<p>Being that he NSA has all communications, they simply just pull those records and they WILL find collusion, but it&#39;s standard collusion. The kind that is above board and not this treasonous shit. </p>

<p>Let ME reiterate.  You have no evidence of this.  If you can&#39;t support your claims, stop making them.  There&#39;s an ongoing investigation, so you literally have no idea what they do/don&#39;t have.  You&#39;re spreading disinformation.  </p>

<p>in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. A sub where every conversation about Trump/Russia gets hijacked into a Clinton email/Benghazi/Ukraine/uranium argument. </p>

<p>Then I actually went back and found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tu6gs/the_most_effective_way_to_destroy_people_is_to/dlno9b2/">the thread</a> where you got rule 10 called on you. </p>

<p>It was a regular argument. He didn&#39;t divert to any MSM viewpoints that weren&#39;t on topic. You&#39;re literally calling him a shill just because you don&#39;t agree with him. That doesn&#39;t make you enlightened, it makes you, at best, lazy, and at worst, stupid. </p>

<p>Grow up and learn to have a disagreement with another human being without assuming they could only disagree with you because they&#39;re paid to do so. Grown ups disagree with each other, it&#39;s a part of life. It will be ok. Not everyone who disagrees with you is part of some grand conspiracy to get you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of the original post was discussion around whether or not removing historical artifacts is an Orwellian style maneuver as illustrated in the book 1984. Delving into historical facts regarding the reason they were placed there is irrelevant as is Lee&#39;s viewpoints on them. The rationale for them being there has zero basis on whether or not removing them is potentially an attempt to rewrite history. My comments focused on the topics at hand. His comments were a repeated campaign regarding why they should be removed. Whether or not these statutes are right, moral, racist, or should be removed again has zero basis on whether or not this is an attempt to change history. His discussions, while well researched and written, were a campaign that reflects the views of today&#39;s left wing. To shill is to campaign or promote a person or a concept in case you were curious. I did lose my temper somewhat as this continued focus was completely off topic and quite frankly annoying, and due to emotions my posts seem childish in response. However, I still stand my my initial claim. By definition he was shilling a concept that was not part of the subject matter. This was a diversion, a well written and educated diversion no less, from the topic at hand. </p>

<p>Out of curiosity why do you care?  More importantly, why should I care what you think of a discussion you were not a part of?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what shilling means. Shilling claims he got paid to make that argument against you. Regardless of whether it was on or off topic.</p>

<p>I care only because your claim of encountering a shill yesterday piqued my curiosity. As someone who has been active in this sub for 3+years, it&#39;s my biggest pet peeve. We&#39;ve built a ridiculous snowglobe for fanboys of certain political persuasions, and if their opinions are ever challenged, they simply scream &quot;Shill&quot; like it&#39;s the new &quot;REEEEEEEE&quot;. A sub that used to be primarily research driven discussion (admittedly, mostly crazy at times) has divulged into an ear plugging &quot;I can&#39;t hear you&quot; contest. It&#39;s obnoxious. </p>

<p>In hindsight, I honestly think you just misused the term shill in this context. Seems like a pretty legit discussion where someone may have veered too far off topic for your tastes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I obviously don&#39;t agree with your opinion regarding our discussion, but I can understand your viewpoint. On another note, I feel this sub has veered too far off course. I dropped off Reddit about a year ago after being active for a long time. I jumped back on to try to gain some insight/hear theories into what in the hell is going on in the world outside of what MSM tells us. The last 120 days or so have taught me that this sub, among others, is a completely different world than it used to be.  It used to be a forum to bounce ideas off of original thinkers regarding topics not mainstream.  It unfortunately is not anymore IMO, thus the comment that piqued your interest. I can empathize with your curiosity as I&#39;ve spent my &quot;second life&quot; on Reddit trying to figure out what the hell happened here! Incidentally i&#39;m probably going to unsubscribe.  I can turn on the tube to hear most of these &quot;original ideas&quot;. I never knew that compensation was a prerequisite to shill. It makes sense as I&#39;m guessing the word is derived from the English coin. Here&#39;s Websters definition in case your curious. Take care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You deflecting from Mueller and 9/11?</p>

<p>For anyone curious why UnverifiedAllegation brought up those other people:</p>

<p>Flynn told Turkey he&#39;d turn over the CIA asset who tried to stage the Turkish coup, and he publicly and privately called out pedophiles.</p>

<p>Manafort was working with the democratically elected government of Ukraine to resist a CIA/deep state funded coup by neo-nazis carrying tiki torches (remind anyone of Charlottesville).</p>

<p>Kushner is close family friends with Bibi Netanyahu. Personally I do not trust or like him and want to know why he paid so much to buy 666 5th Ave.</p>

<p>All of these people are into shady international business deals, many with geopolitical ramifications. Just like every other international businessman and politician. But the reason it&#39;s totally not ok for them to do it when Clinton and Bush and Nixon and Kissinger and everyone else did, is because they&#39;re doing it against, not with, the CIA.</p>

<p>Whenever anything bad happens on the right, this sub gets hit pretty hard with pro trump related things. I noticed this a lot during the Flynn ordeal. I commented on some of them, only calling out the pretty obvious bullshit accounts. Oddly enough, a lot of of those accounts are now deleted. I&#39;m entirely sure it goes both ways, but here are some examples of my claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for tracking this. ive definitely seen the trend but its nice to see it plain as day</p>

<p>they always delete posts and threads so its harder to track their work, identify an agenda theyre spamming, and so they can pivot positions whenever it suits the narrative of the moment (we love flynn/manafort&gt;trump barely knew them)</p>

<p>also one of their deflection techniques is &quot;please provide proof of FSB/CA/right wing shills, we KNOW ctr exists&quot; and if they delete their content its harder to track. Trump shared fake news from a podium, and that story is no longer posted at its original location. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal. I&#39;m sure there are people orchestrating things on both sides, sure, but one side ended up with Nazi flags, saluting Hitler and chanting Nazi slogans. That really sucks for them because forever they are worse than anyone on the other side, because now their opponents are anti-Nazi, which is a pretty good side to be on. </p>

<p>Also, Russia, a lot of people in the Trump admin have been proven to be colluding with them to some degree..... there&#39;s no denying that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, but I think the real issues are bigger than both of those. Whatever is being plastered on the TV  screens is (to me) a blatant indication of what I <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be focusing on. Since the Greeks has entertainment and drama been used to control the masses and since then continuously to today. I don&#39;t even think it can be disputed that that was the case back then, so how could it be different now?</p>

<p>The most common forms of communicating with society is through TV, radio, and internet. I&#39;m sure all the things they talk about are problems but they are almost certainly not the real problems. I believe there are things that are the root of these issues that are rarely (if ever)  addressed. These things are fruits of the rotten tree but we have to trace it back. Specifically I believe corruption within secret societies (not any illuminati type stuff but actual deep state connections) are what causes this. </p>

I know that with a certainty.  Want to spot a shill?  Get the reddit app and tag around a dozen people over the course of a day - only accounts yiou are 95% sure are shills.</p>

<p>Then tomorrow, sort through top and then controversial and you&#39;ll see 2 to 3 of the tagged shills in every single trump/cnn/neo-nazi thread.  It is transparent when you know what to look for.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what shilling means. Shilling claims he got paid to make that argument against you. Regardless of whether it was on or off topic.</p>

<p>I care only because your claim of encountering a shill yesterday piqued my curiosity. As someone who has been active in this sub for 3+years, it&#39;s my biggest pet peeve. We&#39;ve built a ridiculous snowglobe for fanboys of certain political persuasions, and if their opinions are ever challenged, they simply scream &quot;Shill&quot; like it&#39;s the new &quot;REEEEEEEE&quot;. A sub that used to be primarily research driven discussion (admittedly, mostly crazy at times) has divulged into an ear plugging &quot;I can&#39;t hear you&quot; contest. It&#39;s obnoxious. </p>

<p>In hindsight, I honestly think you just misused the term shill in this context. Seems like a pretty legit discussion where someone may have veered too far off topic for your tastes. </p>
