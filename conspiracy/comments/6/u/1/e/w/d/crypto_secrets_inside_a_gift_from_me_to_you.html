        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Think like a journalist</strong> </p>

<p><em>When you&#39;ve read an article. PR is good- yet the principal is nothing lasts for ever...</em></p>

<p>A journalist has a goal behind his writing. Take potcoins growth via the dennis rodman piece-</p>

<p>The goal was to promote the technology to inspire growth. Yet an existing market &#39;with a future&#39; has no direct need for growth. It should be coming by default. Therefore the intent was to bring in investors to bulk the price up-</p>

<p><strong>Investors place holdings prior to PR releases</strong></p>

<p>If user flock into a new crypto or commodity, the price inflates. <em>This is when the sneaky bastards pull the carpet on holders-</em></p>

<p><strong>Pretend your the investor.</strong> </p>

<p>You have 1 million on the technology. That initial investment bolsters the price. As users flock in you distribute another million into the circulation. Everyones smiling having a good time... <em>(Until that is the initial investors jump ship)</em>.</p>

<p>Then the once 2.00 coins make their way back to .75usd percoin. &#39;It&#39;s not fair&#39;... The holders are stuck. Caught in a trap and no ones going anywhere until a profit can be absolved. So now you have an existing market. They arent going anywhere and you can spend the money on future promotions. (Maybe hire some developers and coders. Boltser the technology and intergrate your future collaborators). In potcoins case (dispensary owners)-</p>

<p>After awhile the dispensary&#39;s are enlisted. It takes some money but by then users start &quot;buying on a low&quot;. You (as the investor have revamped the brand) and can now re invest prior to the next PR release. There by setting you up for the next round of growth mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>The inherent truth is reading the headlines is all you need to do.</strong> </p>

<p>Articles are the meat and potatoes, yet the headline says it all-</p>

<p>Bad news = short term loss. 
Good news = short term gain. </p>

<p><strong>Never let a &quot;loss&quot; make you move-</strong></p>

<p><em>As selling on any loss, is a loss in itself.</em></p>

<p>You have to be strong!</p>

<p>A phrase that comes to mind is: </p>

<p>&quot;<em>The stock market is nothing more then a contraption designed for transferring money from the impatient to the patient&quot;-</em></p>

<p>Your continual assessment of headlines should really be considered &#39;inference&#39;. / (Or reading between the lines)</p>

<p><strong>Stop thinkin like a reader.</strong> </p>

<p><em>That journalist got paid to write that article.</em> </p>

<p><em>Investors paid to have it placed on the front page of xyz website-</em></p>

<p>Hop in, but for christ sake rule 1. In life<strong>Nothing good lasts forever...</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, be ready to get of the market, the second the hat drops, <em>(meaning within even 10 minutes of any gained percentage)-</em></p>

<p><em>Seconded this by an additional technique...</em>
<strong>Learn to juggle in trades.</strong> <strong>Don&#39;t &#39;all in&#39; ever!</strong></p>

<p><em>instead learn to juggle multiple hands and when possible: fill available orders so your not paying fees.</em></p>

<p><strong>Juggle in and out</strong> </p>

<p><em>Say 20.00 stacks at a time</em>. </p>

<p>Use an actual timer and count the profit percentage per ten minute intervals. When youve made a desirable percentage. Say 8% pull it back to usd. Do this constantly and watch your profit per ball. <em>(think juggling);</em></p>

<p><strong>If your making 8% per 10 minutes, then simply watch those ten minute intervals. The second its down to 5%. Get out-</strong></p>

<p><em>Thats why juggling and a timer will help you</em>. </p>

<p>This way your initial investments are secured while your profits are determinative, and coming in constantly. </p>

<p>Yet, if all the sudden investors pull, you will now  merely lost the profit on a single ball. Vs. &#39;the bulk fund&#39;, in a hard crash... <strong>Also pencil in all trading fees, and costs within your profit %</strong> </p>

<p><em>If your gunning for 8% but losing 2% in cost. You need to re-adjust to 10%, and get out at 7%. (5 +2 for *(cost).</em></p>

<p><strong>If you use strategy it will reward you with security.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first rule of business is always protect your investments</strong> </p>

<p><em>Meaning only trade with a given percentage of your net worth in crypto</em>. </p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s say that you have 1 full btc</em>...</p>

<p>In this case I&#39;d suggest that users save 80% (off ); and only use 20% trading via the juggling technique-</p>

<p><strong>Keep the 80% in a private wallet or vending site having it ready to hit your account asap in a crash.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Never leave it in an exchange, if its your bread and butter</strong>. </p>

<p><em>If you do it could backfire and you can get locked into a &#39;stalemate&#39; having to wait out a profit.</em> <em>(which can take months at times).</em></p>

<p><strong>Therefore if only 20% net is on the line</strong></p>

<p>Use the 80% pulling 10% (half your stalemate) as a snowball to recomp on lost time. Yet, do not re invest to inspire trading.</p>

<p><strong>The worst trader thinks he &#39; owns the floor&#39; and that &#39;he&#39; is making the price move.</strong> </p>

<p>No- I dont care if they have 1 million in a single cryoto. Btc is a billion dollar platform and your million could pull instantly maybe denting the price by .10c usd. </p>

<p><em>You&#39;re not that important! -</em></p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t try to &#39;raise the price when its falling&#39;.</strong></p>

<p><em>Don&#39;t try to break a wall with other users either, because it can either crush or block you based on the bulk efforts of others.</em></p>

<p><strong>Final note</strong> </p>

<p><em>Is the price on a streak, in a hold, spiraling?</em></p>

<p>Learn to identify the floor and ceiling...</p>

<p><em>These are known as &#39;whale walls&#39;.</em></p>

<p>On trading sites you will notice extremely large sales walls. These walls are created for the 5%rs. That literally live for the 5% and juggle just like you will learn to do. Accept their stash has leveled uo for several years @ 5% per hour; every hour; potentially: since btc was erected.</p>

<p><em>If there is an unbreakable wall &#39;Sell&#39;. This signals when the &#39;bull run is over&#39; and the market is deadlocked</em>.</p>

<p>*<em>That means its at its ceiling.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sell at the ceiling and rebuy at the floor-</strong></p>

<p>However the next month will be a 2 steps forward 3 steps back situation. (imo) As many users are &#39;hopping in to score&#39;.* Which means those whales are eating uo 5% like candy. Making weak (and new hands) flock off the track.*</p>

<p>New hands are shit. -</p>

<p>This recent 4k price run talked half of the world into hopping in and those whales set traps for them new ... 
<em>Hence the now struggle to reach 5k</em>. </p>

<p>3-4k was easy, but 5 will factually be a bitch- </p>

<p>This is because some .25 billion usd must go in, to create that markup level. (Which will take a couple months...</p>

<p>Whales will continually pull (taking new money from the weak), (Making matters worse). So the long game is on in that regard for the 5k push-</p>

<p><strong>My initial estimate in Feb 2017 was 5600 by xmas.</strong>
With potentially a gain of 7800 by january 2018 Which reminds me. Sell jan 06th (ish). </p>

<p><em>Don&#39;t make every dollar to you can in holding to the last second.</em> Half the users will be new by then; Many getting btc for xmas; Which means they will sell asap, making the price drop back to say 5500- 6000 again. Get out at 7.5 not 6-:/</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, Do not be a whole numbers tard.</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;I&#39;m getting out at 100 or say 50&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>(instead: choose 93. Or 42.9)</em></p>

<p>Never try to reach a whole number. Because thats the trend, and trends drive herds into walls; which ultimately make the herd take a knee on the veracity of the situation).</p>

<p><em>Set dates not prices. And set odds not evens</em>. </p>

<p>If it were a fair game then the guy on wheel of fortune wouldn&#39;t be a c*nt and bid 1.00 higher then you now would he?</p>

<p><em>So underbid him ahead of his acts.</em></p>

<p>(see a price hitting a slow down say price is 1689?÷?)</p>

<p>Everyone wants to pull at that 1700 ceiling... (right). </p>

<p>12.00usd is not worth - 100.00usd;</p>

<p><em>Once the sell rush hits.</em></p>

<p>So learn to have the capacity to say: &quot;Made my 8%&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Then simply look for the next whole number</em>. <strong>(But dont bet on it. Bet before it)</strong>. <em>Otherwise you&#39;re just as vulnderable as anyone that a whale is about to undercut</em>.</p>
