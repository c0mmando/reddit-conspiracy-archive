       I love how the mass media controls what we should be talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       One week ago the "top story" was to prepare for nukes to be dropped any time on Guam, Hawaii, etc.  Get some iodine pills just in case!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seven days later:  Confederate statues causing division and must be removed!
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses are so easily manipulated you just have to laugh.

       I should say Manufactured News.  Those statues have been around for decades. Not really any issue of any consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this week, they have replaced N Korea as the number one threat to public safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next week the "danger" from the statues will be forgotten and it's on to the next Crisis (TM)

       Yea, that's a red herring.  Four weeks ago weren't you talking about Putin?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then last week about war with  NK .
      </p>
      <p>
       And now racial violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Putin just STOP having committed election manipulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, he did, and they can't prove it--so let's get people up in arms about NK.
Oh but now that's not happening anymore either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy how these world events just fucking vanish and you move on.  It's been a story for 6 months, sure, the only story.

       Yeah I fail to see your point. During the olympics news is dominated by new about the olympics. Why don't we hear anything now about the olympics?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm confused about what OP is attempting to show with this. The Russian story is still very much in the news but just not "front page" right now. These types of investigations can take years and just because there's not breaking news everyday of the week does not make it go away.

       Shocking that you fail to see it.  Like someone who already doesn't understand and/or objects to this post would.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're suggesting here that for 6 months literally nothing happened but Russia, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all they reported on after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So zilch else happened and there was no concerted effort to put our eyeballs on that story that has never had any actual evidence other than "anonymous intelligence individuals believe..."
      </p>
      <p>
       So in your mind, no events took place while the Russia story went on.  Because they only report on what's pertinent right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that story has vanished.  Gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, there's no plan as to what the people are allowed/deliberately led to hear.

       No dude, I was making fun of op for suggesting that the Russian story went away because other news happened and it didn't make front page for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still the biggest story of our lifetime and it's not going anywhere any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you still think all they are basing this investigation on is the dossier then you have not been watching the news. It's gone so far beyond that now.

       Dude, come on. You can't bury your head so far in the sand that you honestly think this is still just some rumors and secret memos that nobody has seen. Do you just jam your fingers in your ears and screen LALALALALA every time the news is on?
      </p>

       I feel like you must just be trolling because that's just crazy to me to think someone in this day and age is so far out of the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I'll play along just in case you just got back from a cruse or something and have not seen the news in months. It's now a proven fact, verified by emails from a whole bunch of people in the White House that their was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. These emails were turned over, not leaked or hacked or just rumors from unnamed sources. Verified emails.

       Wow, just wow. Donald Trump jr willingly handed over the emails. This is not a rumor or a hunch or unnamed source. This is the guy in question admitting his actions and providing the proof to back it up.

       That's not enough for you? The man said he did a thing and provided proof and that's not enough? So what, unless you were in the room with him you don't believe it?

       Difference? In how Clinton ran her campaign? She was shady as hell and I'm pretty sure she was cheating and breaking laws. I would love to see the dnc ban her from ever running for office again. If she were in office I would be all over that shit. But right now she's not and today we found out that trumps team met with a spy who is an ace at email hacking. And they knew going into the meeting that they were going to get dirt. Is that legal?

       For the sake of discussion let's say there is no difference. What then? Is your whole stance on this "well Hillary did or would have done the same things to get elected"?

       It's very simple, if Clinton was in office I would would support an investigation. Like I said, as it stands she cheated the system during the primaries and should be barred from politics at a minimum.

       Sorry man, you are wrong about why one is more important than the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really quite simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       If both candidates made deals with foreign powers and compromised the security of our nation in order to get in elected then both should be investigated. But here's the kicker: only one got elected so only one is a direct threat to me right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the clintons did commit crimes I would love to hear about it and have it come to light. But does it affect my life right now? No not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it like this, driving drunk is not cool and makes someone a menace to society. If you told me you knew a guy who drove home last year drunk from an office party I would still consider that a serious crime even though it happened last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you said there is a guy who is driving around drunk every day, through crowded school zones in every town and will keep doing it every day for the next 3+ years I would say this needs to end right now.

       So the

       can make millions of dollars selling
       <em>
        uranium

       I don't get what you are trying to argue here. I'm all for investigating Clinton. I have never supported her and if she broke laws then she should be held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know that it's possible to have two ongoing different investigations right? I'm so confused that you think that because one person possibly did something it's ok for Trump to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you should learn more about the uranium deal you keep bringing up. It's not so simple as you are making it out to be. She was one of many people who needed to sign off on the mining operation and it was not to sell uranium to Russia. It was to give a Russian company rights to mine but they could not take it back to Russia and she did not get paid. Her charity got donations and she does not get paid by the charity but I'm sure it influences policy and I am all for an investigation into that foundation. It smacks of corruption up and down and I am all about getting foreign money out of our political system.

       Then you have no friends. Bc anyone with a  Facebook account has seen a political post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't you should get out more often, seriously.  Which tells us you have no life and therefore no real point that can be useful to actual social humans.

       So I'm done now.

       Hahaha. That's fucking gold. Just because someone does not use Facebook as a source for news you somehow have determined that I must be some sort of basement dwelling outcast. I love that leap in reasoning. Pure gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you don't make that leap again, you could not be further from the truth.

       I love how you can't answer my logic so you jump to this.

      <p>
       Anyway all of us who are real people have seen at least one political post from our friends and family in Facebook.  If you say you haven't, you're lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all done here.  Not getting anywhere with deliberate lying for...whatever reason.
