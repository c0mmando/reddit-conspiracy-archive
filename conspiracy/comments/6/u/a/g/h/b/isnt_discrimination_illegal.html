       Apple Pay not offering services to people who hold a specific viewpoint (e.g. - white nationalism). Isn't it illegal to discriminate against people based on their beliefs/ideologies?  And people are lining up to support this?  I'm fucking triggered right now.

       Most online payments to US companies I have to use Paypal or credit cards. I'm not really sure what other services you have in mind here? Applepay/Googlewallets? EBay only goes through PayPal, CC or private bank transfers afaik.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationally I can use a quick online bank transfer system similar to PayPal in its simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider the termination of PayPal access a direct attack on somebody's economical existence.

       I disagree, you dont need paypal to survive, especially in the US. It is certainly not a monopoly.

       I still hold up to their rights of denying service to who they want as long as it is not a protected class.

       Did I misunderstand your attribution of the Holocaust genocide as a believe? I see it more as a historical happening, which distaste of by the New World Order should not be condemned. I'm confused how condemning past actions coincides with believes.

       Holocaust denial is a belief. There are lots of those out there. Some right, some wrong. We have a right to them. I say it's dead wrong to believe in the benevolence of a New World Order.

       There are legally defined protected classes when it comes to discrimination. It's basically, religions, minorities, age, and sexual orientation. White sumpremicists aren't a protected class in anti-discrimination legislation for some reason.

       That is incorrect, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not list sexual orientation as protected. It's mostly down to the states, for instance Mississippi has a law that allows refusal of service based on sexual orientation and it has been upheld by federal courts. A baker in some states can indeed refuse to make the cake.

       Those are all different categories, with different rules. Typically a business can refuse service for any reason, except that some reasons are prohibited. Race is the big one, gender is allowable sometimes, sexual orientation is allowable in some places, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an area of law I've ever practiced, so grain of salt, but I don't think there are any ideology restrictions.

       Thank you for at least some sort of rational comment. I must ask you this, though.  Do you think it should be illegal to discriminate based on beliefs?  And, if so, do you believe what apple is doing is immoral?

       No, and probably no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm worried that some business, like CloudFlare, have so much market power and are so critical to the modern media market that they're essentially even more a public good than "common carriers," like railroads used to be. In that case I'd want their ability to discriminate restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't know enough about the tech or business to know if that's the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the power company shouldn't discriminate on viewpoint, even if it's private. Newspapers should. I don't know which end of the spectrum we're at here, but I suspect the latter.

       I understand what you're saying - that certain companies essentially become utilities.  but I would say that a company that provides a service such as Apple Pay would be considered a utility, much like I believe google and the internet should be considered a utility. As to how that would work, I don't know. But I do believe that once a corporation/technology reaches that level of being a utility for society, it should be regulated like one.

       ..... THEN WHO THE FUCK DECIDES WHCH IDEOLOGIES ARE PROTECTED AND WHICH AREN'T?? Do you not see my worry here? There aren't any (and should not be) any "protected classes", because deeming what is immoral and not is completely subjective. Which is why we have laws against government and businesses discriminating against people based on THEIR BELIEFS

Would you be pissed then?  Because that's the same shit. The only difference is that one of those ideologies/beliefs is considered by many to be wrong.

       Yes, I would. I don't think you should discriminate based on beliefs. People who follow ISIS ideologies have the right to believe what they believe. However, when they begin harming others based on those beliefs is where I have a problem with it. Problem is, you can't say.  Not all racists harm people of the race they discriminate against. So, i would say apple would have the right to express their discontent, but not flat out refuse them service based on opinion alone. That's a slippery fucking slope.
