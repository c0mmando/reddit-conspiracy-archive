<p>Did I misunderstand your attribution of the Holocaust genocide as a believe? I see it more as a historical happening, which distaste of by the New World Order should not be condemned. I&#39;m confused how condemning past actions coincides with believes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is incorrect, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not list sexual orientation as protected. It&#39;s mostly down to the states, for instance Mississippi has a law that allows refusal of service based on sexual orientation and it has been upheld by federal courts.

    <div class="md"><p>No, and probably no.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried that some business, like CloudFlare, have so much market power and are so critical to the modern media market that they&#39;re essentially even more a public good than &quot;common carriers,&quot; like railroads used to be. In that case I&#39;d want their ability to discriminate restricted.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know enough about the tech or business to know if that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>In other words, the power company shouldn&#39;t discriminate on viewpoint, even if it&#39;s private. Newspapers should. I don&#39;t know which end of the spectrum we&#39;re at here, but I suspect the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying - that certain companies essentially become utilities.  but I would say that a company that provides a service such as Apple Pay would be considered a utility, much like I believe google and the internet should be considered a utility.

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. Bro. People are being discriminated against and you&#39;re okay with that?  If a company decided to not sell things to atheists or christians, how would that make you feel?  Would you be pissed then?  Because that&#39;s the same shit. The only difference is that one of those ideologies/beliefs is considered by many to be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I would. I don&#39;t think you should discriminate based on beliefs. People who follow ISIS ideologies have the right to believe what they believe. However, when they begin harming others based on those beliefs is where I have a problem with it. Problem is, you can&#39;t say.  Not all racists harm people of the race they discriminate against. So, i would say apple would have the right to express their discontent, but not flat out refuse them service based on opinion alone. That&#39;s a slippery fucking slope.</p>

<p>&quot;I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay but no one is stopping them from saying anything? They&#39;re just removing their content from their service? </p>

<p>So who exactly is stopping freedom of speech? If I give you a platform to speak on and I decide I don&#39;t want to support your speech anymore so I take my platform. </p>

<p>How is that stopping you from finding another platform.</p>

<p>So it Isis had a gofundme and private discord how would you feel?</p>
