    <div class="md"><p>I guess I should have been more specific: &quot;totalitarian governments and dictatorships restrict the art and media available to their populace in order to exert control.&quot; If you were a composer in Stalin&#39;s Russia you weren&#39;t having a good time. You could be killed for what you wrote. How Orff wasn&#39;t killed for the Carmina Burana under Hitler is beyond me. Joseph Goebbels went as far as to standardize the tuning of German radio orchestras to A=440 HZ (which is an interesting conspiracy theory). The Taliban performed public &quot;executions&quot; of televisions and radios. North Korea limits the kind of music that can be written and performed. Russia sent Pussy Riot to jail. In the Middle Ages the Catholic Church was so controlling with music that composers could have their hands cut off for writing a tritone. I could go on, but the history of music and the state is pretty well established. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foot tapping?  Head banging?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a musician, so I&#39;ve done a lot of foot tapping and head banging.</p>

<p>Dancing, however? as in &quot;listening to music and moving your body rhythmically (or un-rhythmically) in a public place to said music - usually while holding or otherwise being very close to another person whose doing the same thing.&quot;?</p>

<p>No.  That I don&#39;t do nor have I ever really done.</p>

<p>Independent of that, I&#39;m personally of the persuasion that feels that a real and true revolution - especially on this planet and with regard to the very serious issues that need to be combated and addressed here - should be more of a focused, disciplined, serious-as-a-heart-attack kind of thing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just me though.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>As an contrarian</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’m not a contrarian, as I don’t fancy disagreeing with someone <em>just</em> to disagree and be “contrary” to them.  I feel that’s pointless and not conducive to individual and collective improvement.  That said, it’s “as <strong>a</strong><del>n</del> contrarian” - not “an”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when the serious issues of the world result from focused, disciplined, serious-as-a-heart attack kinds of thoughts and feelings, the solutions are likely frivolous, MacGyvered, and organic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t quite understand this statement at all, as calling something “MacGyvered” tends to mean that the things being referred to “works regardless of how it was put together” - which is ultimately a <em>compliment</em> in favor of my above comment, and, A) of your very own admittance (calling yourself “a contrarian”), as well as B) the general energy of this particular statement of yours I quoted itself here, it seems you’re trying to make a comment <em>against</em> my own perspective - not in agreement with it.</p>

<p>Additionally, using the world “organic” to describe my comment <em>also</em> implies, not a negative thing, but a positive, constructive thing.  This adds further confusion as it relates to effectively interpreting your comment (further confusing me as it relates to your supposed tendency toward contrarianism), as an organic result from efforts made toward a thing tends to be a <em>good</em> thing - not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Now the word “frivolous” is about the only one of the three you used that would indeed indicate actual disagreement with my previous comment.  That said, to call the results of a movement that is approached in a “serious-as-a-heart-attack” manner “frivolous” seems quite detached from and unaware of what actually tends to happen to things that are approached in said manner, for most things that are approached in a “serious-as-a-heart-attack” manner tend to result sooner or later in the result actually intended by those who engaged in the act in the first place.</p>

<p>Well cool.  Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No.  Serious people cause serious <em>actions</em>.  Those actions, if the serious person happens to be a malicious one, can turn into big problems - yes.  However, if those serious actions happen to be <em>benevolent</em> actions engaged in by a benevolent person, then that level of seriousness can yield great, great positive effects for the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Die-hard revolutionaries end up dead as often as they turn into violent authoritarians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing of much real and lasting worth gets done on this planet unless one puts their heart and their will into the act and go for it 100%.  I’d much rather be on the side of a very serious, “die-hard revolutionary” with benevolent ideals who believes in her/his objectives and goals even at the risk of possible death to themselves than to be with someone who is not sufficiently serious about their objective and may or may not abandon their ideas without following through - especially if the going gets rough for them.</p>

<p>The latter does not tend to be the kind of personality that makes any real changes happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The solution to many of the serious problems seems to be relaxation, flexibility, and receptivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And none of these qualities are in any way contradictory to an intense and even “revolutionary” level of focus.  No one can ever say that the Buddha isn’t a revolutionary - and that’s one of the most relaxed, flexible, and receptive figures around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most succesful idealogues are seldom as effective in their tasks as the average hedonist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could not disagree more actually.  Take, as but one of a myriad of examples, Christianity.  Love it or hate it, believe in it or not, it is indeed one of <em>the</em> most successful ideologies in history.</p>

<p>There isn’t <em>one</em> “average hedonist” in existence (or even one hedonistic perspective or philosophy for that matter) that has ever even come close to being as successful as that particular ideology.</p>

<p>Again, this was but one example that just rose up off the top of my head.  There are many others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you disagree with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entirely.  No disrespect or angst meant toward you, of course, but yes.  I would disagree with your assertion entirely.</p>
