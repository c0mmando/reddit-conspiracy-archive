        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of debunkers around.  These people like to think they are smart because the mainstream tells them they are right.  It is constant affirmation to feed their weak egos.  Fragile egos don&#39;t take risks.  They play it safe because it is so psychologically painful for them to be wrong.  So they parrot the mainstream narrative exclusively and defend it even in the face of the most solid evidence.</p>

<p>These people keep their brain in a cage of rigid skepticism because it&#39;s nice and safe, but they pay for it with never being able to expand their consciousness beyond that cage.  They have not one original thought that has originated from within their own skulls.  It is the popular mainstream opinion and theory or it is ridiculed as conspiracy and woo made up by conspiratards.</p>

<p>They actually think they are the smart ones, as unoriginal and unthinking as they are,  but even worse is that they are useful idiots for those that can control the popular narrative.  They are the first to defend it and call anyone who wants to think deeper about events and narratives an idiot.  Even here, in r/conspiracy, where the whole purpose of the sub is to question everything.  </p>

<p>So that is why there are so many of them here.  While the thinking members, the true r/conspiracy veterans, those who do the research and take the risks by thinking outside the box,  who can take the ego blows when missing the mark in order to gain in wisdom and knowledge about how our world truly works and actually is.  </p>

<p>We are the original thinkers, the dangerous thinkers, the rebellious thinkers that change the world, who invent and enlighten, without which our society would still be in the stone age where the debunkers would still be very content in their safe ignorance.  </p>

<p>We will continue to question every event, every mainstream narrative, every theory, every single time.  Because that&#39;s what we do here in r/conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Stay brave friends.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a religious talking point. There&#39;s nothing dogmatic about refusing to believe in an entity for which there is no evidence, and is furthermore defined by religious people as being impossible to detect against its own wishes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What came before the big bang? What created that? Did the universe materialize out of nothing, or has it always been in an infinite sense, and if so how is that possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asking what came &quot;before&quot; the universe is arguably pointless, because time came into existence as a consequence of the Big Bang. The simple answer is, &quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; and &quot;We currently lack the scientific knowledge to try to find out&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t heard a convincing argument, which is why I remain agnostic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like you don&#39;t understand that the majority of atheists don&#39;t categorically rule out the existence of a god, or fairies, or ghosts, or any other unfalsifiable entities. In the absence of any evidence for those entities&#39; existence, we simply live our lives as if god, fairies and ghosts don&#39;t exist. Ghosts could exist - do you spend time every day thinking about ghosts? Do you support laws which assume ghosts do exist?</p>

<p>Agnosticism as actually practised is amusingly inconsistent. When was the last time an agnostic person said <em>&quot;We don&#39;t have evidence that the Easter Bunny doesn&#39;t exist, and we shouldn&#39;t rule it out&quot;</em>? They reserve a special level of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; for the existence of a god as defined by mainstream (usually Abrahamic) religions, which they don&#39;t apply to other equally superstitious beliefs.</p>

<p>I can only hope you&#39;re as agnostic about Santa and unicorns as you are about a &quot;god&quot;.</p>

<p>cause nothing about the natural world is &#39;fantastical&#39;? All this order we see around us is possibly chaotic in nature (as you imply with your religion bashing), and it&#39;s not fantastic or based in fantasy? </p>

<p>Really political &quot;conspiracists&quot; are children in the grand scheme of things because politics doesn&#39;t challenge anything it&#39;s more along the lines of common sense. If a corrupt government to the surprise of anyone you were living under a rock.</p>

<p>Occult conspiracists really just use it to push their warped view of reality. Deeming it either was evil and taboo or something we should embrace but one is more common than the other.</p>

<p>And so forth I&#39;ve realized at the end of the day a lot people in this sub are just glorified order followers. Really it&#39;s the most disheartening because this should of been the building blocks of destroy the current paradigm but people are really just supporting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that the Russian claims were generated to create dissent against President Donald Trump, and to keep the masses/media away from covering the DNC leaks in truth.  There&#39;s a lot of indication that many users on this sub feel very strongly that the MSM Russia narrative is a total hoax being used to keep people like yourself from realizing that the DNC email were in fact leaked, by a person who was potentially murdered for those very leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony here is that Breitbart, Infowars, and others have been pushing the narrative that Seth Rich leaking DNC emails automatically kills any conspiracies about Trump and his campaign colluding with Russia - and people like yourself just eat that up - &quot;oh SR leaked emails so Trump didn&#39;t collude with Russia! MAGA!.&quot; Honestly, the whole push for the narrative that SR leak = no Russia collusion is an interesting conspiracy theory in itself.</p>

<p>The two theories are absolutely not mutually exclusive and I for one tend to think there is a bit of truth to both of them. For example, Seth Rich leaking emails doesn&#39;t negate the fact that Don Jr. met with the Russians hoping to obtain information. Also, Seth Rich leaking information doesn&#39;t mean that the Russians also couldn&#39;t have hacked that information. </p>

<p>did you look at the transfer speeds? unless computers have been reinvented in the last 2 years, it&#39;s impossible for it to have been taken remotely.</p>

<p>Do you at least consider it to be a leak instead of a hack? Or do you think somebody snuck onto the premises?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of the transfer speeds, but it doesn&#39;t prove the data was taken off-network using a USB. The metadata will show the timestamp of when the files were LAST copied, so the DNC could have indeed been hacked and then the data was shared internally via USB amongst whatever group (supposedly) hacked the DNC before eventually being leaked.</p>

<p>That said, I do think it&#39;s still very plausible that the data was taken by someone with inside access to the DNC&#39;s computer network. That doesn&#39;t prove it was Seth Rich, though I do agree there is a lot of circumstantial evidence to at the very least demand answers about the Seth Rich, RIP, murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m way off in left field, but isn&#39;t the heavy-handed inspection of Trump been all about finding evidence when there was no real evidence to initiate the investigation? </p>

<p>There is blatant corruption paraded in our faces, but half of America has been cheering on the Trump rectal exam. </p>

<p>The basis of Trump-Russia collusion investigation was what exactly? So far every shred of purported &quot;evidence&quot; used to initiate said rectal exam has been voided/nullified/debunked yet the rectal exam continues. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any one person to be perfect, but I find it laughable that the most corrupt are in charge of investigating. I also abhor the idea of giving them a longer leash to &quot;investigate&quot;; they become harder to reign in once we&#39;ve given them that much leeway. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t trust those corrupt sewer rats to refrain from attempting to fabricate something. They really have become quite brazen because nothing ever happens when they are caught.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Russia because I feel they have been the opposing force behind every conflict the US has entered since the Cold War. I just don&#39;t understand the Trump-Russia collusion hypothesis. </p>

<p>My apologies if I misunderstood your context. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we are in agreement on all those points.</p>

<p>I suppose i&#39;m okay with the initial inquiry because I can respect due diligence, and where I plant myself firmly on your side of things is when those investigations are STILL ignored for more rectal viewing... I can take a bit of bullshit, but i&#39;m not taking a giant steaming scoop of it.</p>

<p>So your points are well taken in that context. I am a &#39;pro-light&#39; person in terms of focusing in on corruption and finding the &#39;dark corners&#39; of our society&#39;s structure, but you are right that things can be twisted into something perverted from their original intent.</p>

<p>So no argument in this context - I am squarely on your side. I&#39;m all for justice, but there has to be substance. If we are inventing substance in these circumstances, then you are absolutely correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point that seems to be consistently overlooked is that the speeds were compliant with USB2.0 transfer rates in-practice (under test conditions using the specific files from the archive rather than the theoretical maximum rate of 480mbps), files had FAT filesystem anomalies (where timestamp resolution is low and times are rounded up to the nearest 2 seconds, implying a USB memory stick was used) and that this was in the Eastern time zone. (Some will argue a FAT partition as a possibility but it&#39;s a technology that was becoming redundant 20 years ago and isn&#39;t corroborated by the transfer speeds like a USB stick is)</p>

<p>Not sure which &quot;they&quot; you&#39;re referring to, but I assume there is no real evidence that HRC or the Podestas or the restruant owners hired kidnappers. (Link me to some evidence if it exists. Maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting you.) </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never understood this. What makes you think any of us, or indeed the media, could have access to 95% of the evidence Mueller is considering in the course of his investigation? It&#39;s not like they dutifully publish it for the public to pore over throughout the investigation...</p>

<p>It&#39;s all up in the air until Mueller arrives at his findings. The subpoenas would certainly seem to indicate that there is <em>something</em> to it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to retort:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of believers around. These people like to think they are smart because their ideas are different than the mainstream and the mainstream, obviously, always lies. They go online, post youtube videos, and call scientists liars or idiots to feed their weak egos. Fragile egos, when cornered, will only double down on their beliefs. They call out critics, sometimes calling them shills, because it is so psychologically painful for them to be wrong. So they parrot the narrative that literally everything taught in school is a lie exclusively and defend it even in the face of the most solid evidence.</p>

<p>These people keep their brain in a cage of rigid contrarianism because they only read people who support their own theories, but they pay for it with never being able to expand their consciousness beyond that cage. They have not one original thought that has originated from within their own skulls. It is the popular conspiracy opinion and theory or it is ridiculed as mainstream lies and propagated by shills.</p>

<p>They actually think they are the smart ones, as unoriginal, unthinking, and, honestly, uneducated as they are, but even worse is that they are useful idiots for those that can control the popular narrative (<em>haha that&#39;s still true</em>). They are the first to attack it, usually starting with the most unlikely explanation, and call anyone who wants to think deeper about events and narratives an idiot. Even here, in r/conspiracy, where the whole purpose of the sub is <strong>to question everything</strong>(even the conspiracy theories themselves...)</p>

<p>Also, &#39;online opinion shaping&#39; is absolutely a growth industry at the moment. There are companies popping up that dedicate themselves to manipulating online forums like the one we&#39;re on now - this is fact and not fiction. I believe in this sub-section of users, there is more funding and influence on the side of established power as opposed to crackpot theories.

<p>also, never meant any offense - i&#39;m in &#39;internet forum&#39; mode in terms of semantics.

<p>There&#39;s an enormous financial motivation for parroting conspiracy theories. Websites like Infowars, Gatewaypundit, ZeroHedge etc. <strong>MAKE MONKEY</strong> off clicks, and sell you merchandise. Alex Jones in particular makes a fuckton of money off medically useless supplements he sells for 5x their retail cost.</p>

<p>This is why the alt-right media were so up in arms about Google demonetising YouTube videos from alt-right channels. They cried &quot;censorship&quot; because Google said, &quot;We will stop Google ads from appearing on your videos&quot;, thereby removing the profit motive to post those dumbass videos.</p>

<p>You see this argument perfectly when it comes to climate change. Edgy conspiracy theorists claim every climate scientist in the world is in on some kind of scam, but they don&#39;t ever question the fact that Big Energy companies (Exxon Mobil, Shell, fracking, etc.) have a <strong>profit motive</strong> to convince you that global warming is a scam.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe I had to explain this. There are people in this sub who don&#39;t even have a high school level understanding of math, who argue with physicists about why it&#39;s impossible for the earth to be round.</p>

<p>This is the level of stupidity we&#39;re dealing with, here - people who can&#39;t ever accept that they&#39;re not experts in every field. Tens of thousands of scientists around the world <em>must</em> be wrong, and it never occurs to them that they may not be an expert in a particular field, whether it&#39;s climate science or behavioural analysis.</p>

<p>To make my point further, there are <em>still</em> people around here who think evolution is a hoax, and that the world is 6000 years old. If you disagree with them, you&#39;re &quot;parroting the MSM narrative&quot; and are a shill, apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that&#39;s the thing. The sky ISN&#39;T blue. You only think it is because light scatters in the atmosphere and the cones in your eyes report &quot;blue&quot; to your brain. This is why the sky can also appear yellow, red, orange, grey, purple, black, it all matters how the light gets scattered as it refracts through the atmosphere. I&#39;ve even seen a green sky during some extreme weather conditions when there was a tornado nearby. </p>

<p>That is brilliant, and so true. Dismissing alternative ideas to those peddled by the mainstream allows dumb people to feel superior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you are entitled to your understanding of his point, but i think you are being a bit pedantic to not read between the lines of the original post. We can agree to disagree there. I just think things are a bit more nuanced than you are presenting them as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we are in agreement on all those points.</p>

<p>I suppose i&#39;m okay with the initial inquiry because I can respect due diligence, and where I plant myself firmly on your side of things is when those investigations are STILL ignored for more rectal viewing... I can take a bit of bullshit, but i&#39;m not taking a giant steaming scoop of it.</p>

<p>So your points are well taken in that context. I am a &#39;pro-light&#39; person in terms of focusing in on corruption and finding the &#39;dark corners&#39; of our society&#39;s structure, but you are right that things can be twisted into something perverted from their original intent.</p>

<p>So no argument in this context - I am squarely on your side. I&#39;m all for justice, but there has to be substance. If we are inventing substance in these circumstances, then you are absolutely correct.</p>
