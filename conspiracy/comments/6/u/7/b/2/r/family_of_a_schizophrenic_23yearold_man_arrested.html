        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">765</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Foobzy.html">Foobzy</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, let me put this into context.</p>

<p>On Monday, the FBI announced Jerry Drake Varnell, a 23-year-old of allegedly trying to detonate a bomb at a 10-story bank building in downtown Oklahoma City. The statement accuses the suspect of meeting an FBI informant and being set up to detonate a &quot;dummy&quot; van that he thought were filled with explosives to bring down the building. The FBI said he called a number three times that he was told would cause the van to explode, and that&#39;s when officers made their arrest. The criminal complaint against him says he was upset with the Federal Reserve and has an underground bunker.</p>

<p>That same day, the suspect&#39;s brother went on Facebook and <a href="https://www.thelostogle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cade-varnell-statement.jpg">posted this</a>, which he later deleted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My brother is schizophrenic and the FBI brought him the van loaded with explosives. Good job America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tuesday, Varnell&#39;s parents issued the <a href="http://newsok.com/attempted-bombing-suspects-family-issues-statement/article/5560334">following statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We as a family are extremely distraught about this situation with our son Jerry Drake Varnell, but what the public must understand is that he is a <strong>paranoid schizophrenic</strong> and is extremely susceptible to different types of ideology that normal people would deem immoral. Underneath his condition, he is a sweet-hearted person and we are extremely shocked that this event has happened. However, what truly has us flabbergasted is the fact that <strong>the FBI knew he was schizophrenic.</strong> The State of Oklahoma found him mentally incompetent and we, his parents have legal guardianship over him by the Court. These documents are sealed from the public, which is why no news media outlet has been able to obtain them. The FBI clearly knew that he was schizophrenic because they have gathered every ounce of information on him. Reading the criminal complaint against him has brought us great pause due to the numerous lies from the informant. <strong>We do not have an underground bunker!</strong> We built our home a few years ago and bought a storage container, as we use it for a storm shelter. We only recently pushed dirt up around it to make it safe. The building is used for storage and is NOT a bunker full of food and supplies, in fact the doors close from the outside. It has neither electricity nor anything that would make it habitable.</p>

<p>What the public should be looking at is the fact that <strong>the FBI gave our son the means to make this happen. He has no job, no money, no vehicle, and no driver’s license, due to the fact that he is schizophrenic</strong> and we; his parents do everything we can possible to keep him safe and functional. The mental health system has consistently failed us due to the lack of establishments and health care coverage for a person like him. He has attended college and just enrolled in welding school. His medications allow him to be somewhat functional but he will never be completely functional in life. His brain does not work like a normal person and never will due to the nature of his mental illness. He has suffered through countless serious full-blown schizophrenic delusional episodes and he has been put in numerous mental hospitals since he was 16 years old. <strong>The FBI came and picked him up from our home, they gave him a vehicle, gave him a fake bomb, and every means to make this happen none of which he had access to on his own.</strong> We know who their informant is and what the public should know is that he is that a drug-dealing criminal. On June 15, 2017, Jerry’s Father told the criminal informant “that he was not allowed back on our property and if he returned we would have him arrested for trespassing and drugs”.  <strong>Apparently, he continued to sneak onto our residence. The FBI paid him to continue this operation and I believe they have cleared his criminal record.</strong></p>

<p>The FBI should have filed conspiracy on our son and had him committed to a mental institution. They should not have aided and abetted a paranoid schizophrenic to commit this act. There are many more facts that I will not make public that will support my son and the disturbing acts made by the FBI.</p>

<p>I realize that many will say my son could have found another person to commit this act. Yet, any person that has access to the materials and the state of mind necessary to bomb a building would not have any need for a schizophrenic who has no resources to contribute. Schizophrenics always have conspiracy theories and feels everyone is out to get them. They trust no one and <strong>there is no doubt in my mind that this informant began this hate against the government and my son followed along because others easily influence him.</strong> There is no person in his life that has even heard anything about hatred for the government and we have all been shocked by the event.</p>

<p>We ask all news media outlets to please respect our privacy. Do not fly helicopters over our home and stalk us at our gates for a story, we are trying our very best to comfort each other because this is a devastating loss for our family. We do not need to be bombarded by reporters who only want to omit important facts of this event. We understand the public wants to know how this could possibly happen. We simply ask them to look at the facts of the case and ask why the FBI made this happen. He is our son and he is a brother and loved one no matter what he has done. We have unconditional love for him, we are heart broken by this event and wish we had been made aware by the FBI, and we would have committed him into a mental institution for help.&quot;</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Clifford and Melonie Varnell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question for me is who is the informant? Is this person a fed from another agency out to stir up trouble to justify some sort of demonization campaign and crackdown on people who are against the Federal Reserve? </p>

<p>Keep in mind this all happened the same day as the events in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a great statement. The FBI however are fucking genius with how they&#39;ve set this up. He&#39;s schizophrenic, the family has a &quot;bomb shelter&quot;. Now, as she points out it&#39;s not true, but who&#39;s going to read and care besides people that understand the government and its agency&#39;s have other agendas?  The fact that we are in r/conspiracy alone discredits us to the mainstream as tinfoil hat but jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another case of criminal behavior from the FBI, just one of dozens, if not hundreds, of egregious conduct cases.  </p>

<p>The YouTube link below shows live footage and video from recent history of Neo-Nazis actually shooting at peaceful demonstrators at a rally.  The video is called:</p>

<p>&quot;Political Murder, Klan / Nazi Style&quot;</p>

<p>An FBI agent provocateur and an undercover ATF officer from the government manipulated a KKK group and a Neo-Nazi group to shoot and kill union organizers and peace activists at an anti-hate rally in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1979. Five were killed. The dead labor organizers were targeted by name on a list provided to the Neo-Nazis / KKK by the undercover ATF officer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_f7ETEg1U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_f7ETEg1U</a></p>

<p>So if government operatives can manipulate 2 groups of about 16 people to shoot and kill union organizers and peaceful demonstraors in 1979, then surely undercover government operatives can manipulate a single 20-year-old to use his car as a weapon last weekend. Is that what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia? It certainly cannot be dismissed at all given our government&#39;s vicious criminal history against union organizers, anti-war demonstrators, civil rights leaders, and other peace activists.</p>

<p>The FBI and ATF&#39;s actions in the 1979 case raise the disturbing and natural question: Were those &quot;services&quot; provided by the FBI and ATF to companies that did not want their workforces unionized for fairer pay, better benefits, and healthier working conditions?</p>

<p>There have been many, many cases since then and before that are equally unsettling, and bring into question the true nature of the FBI, ATF, CIA, and other intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>The agencies demonstrate a tendency to protect the criminal wealthy and attack the middle class and struggling poor, both domestically and abroad. The agencies are indispensible in funneling wealth upwards, taking from the majority to give to the criminal minority at the top: the criminal elite, the one-tenth of one percent, and perhaps even many of the one percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly disturbing. The rationale for this attack is pretty apparent. It directly lines the pockets of whatever corporation didn&#39;t want to have to deal with union representation. This being encouraged and even facilitated by government agencies we commonly believe were created to protect the citizenry is frightening. There is evidence to suggest that there was &quot;The Hand&quot; involved with the Charlottesville attack, but to what purpose?  I don&#39;t see any entity directly benefitting monetarily as the situation represented in the video you referenced. If the man in Charlottesville had used a firearm as his weapon of choice I could see another push for disarming citizens.  </p>

<p>I have two broad theories. 1.  The Charlottesville attack correlates to the attacks in Nice on Bastille day last year where a terrorist drove a truck into a crowd killing 86. It also correlates with yesterday&#39;s terrorist attack in Barcelona where a van plowed into a crowd killing 13.  The choice of weapon makes me feel that this is all a strategy at sewing fear that we are never safe. We need to rely on The Hand more to protect us further from villains we can&#39;t fathom. In our country is it potentially a call to arms?  A demand by the citizenry for further erosion of their rights? A rationale to demand an increase scrutiny/monitoring of its citizenry based solely on their political beliefs?  Besides registering as D, R, I, whatever how do we determine someone&#39;s true beliefs without monitoring internet activity, chat group history, shopping history, etc? In today&#39;s highly monitored world the rabbit hole has no end. </p>

<p>Theory 2.  I also believe that the use of the term &quot;terrorist&quot; is being used specifically with a deeper purpose. The two attacks in Europe were claimed by Islamic militant groups and IMO meet the definition of terrorism. The Charlottesville attack was done based on differences of idealogical beliefs so the use of the term terrorist is accurate by definition. I would argue it differs somewhat as he is a lone individual and could be viewed as a disturbed psycho/sociopath. The correlation of weapon choice and differences in ideological beliefs will resonate with Americans however. There is an important difference to distinguish between a psychopath and a terrorist in our country. It is my understanding that a psychopath still has rights. A terrorist has virtually none. Who is a terrorist and who is not?  Currently it appears to be a matter of opinion. This opinion/label is defined by those in control. At this point you aren&#39;t labeled a terrorist until you have committed or are planning something egregious. That could easily change however, and at the rate of hysteria in this country it could happen quicker than we could imagine.  IDK, call me crazy, but I&#39;d love to hear some thoughts. </p>

<p>Well, CIA critic Robert David Steele (who was a CIA officer for many years, but is now a strong critic of the agency) believes the violence at rallys this Summer of 2017 and the violence at both Democratic and Republican Party rallys last year (before the 2016 election) is being orchestrated by Deep State individuals opposed to Trump&#39;s presidency, and they&#39;re funding the violence to a tune of 60 million dollars for the summer. </p>

<p>Here are some links with interesting info about the Charlottesville attacks and the summer of violence:</p>

<p>By the way I&#39;m not a fan of Trump or Clinton.  I voted for Doctor Jill Stein of the Green Party, the only honest party which truly loves America.  The criminal Democrats and criminal Republicans voted for a costly war in Iraq, and let the Big Banks destroy the economy 9 years ago by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, a regulatory law that had stood since the 1930s to prevent another Great Depression.  The bought Republicans and Democrats don&#39;t love America as much as their Congressional jobs and pay.  People in the Green Party, however, love America, like Doctor Jill Stein and legendary consumer advocate Ralph Nader who for decades has given away 90 percent of his income every year to causes he believes in.  People like that can&#39;t be bought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....and I just wanted to add that the vast majority of hard-working people who are members of unions are capitalistic of course (very capitalistic), and many union members even have enterprising side businesses of their own.  </p>

<p>In the USA, about 40 percent of the workforce belonged to a union in the 1950s.  After decades of the government wildly hacking and slashing away at unions that percentage is now down to 15 or 20 percent.  </p>

<p>The capitalistic - socialistic dichotomy is a rather false division, I think, used to persecute people who just want to be paid better  (don&#39;t we all want better pay, [and unions help provide that]).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another broad theory is that vehicular manslaughters are happening around the time that car manufacturers are talking about auto-driving cars.  Idk if you drive but it&#39;s exhilarating!  I feel free and I can listen to music and go my own way!  So if the fear that we can&#39;t trust people to drive has been sewn into us and because an AI could do it better, then everyone starts riding in a self-driving car.  Then</p>

<p>the term is relative.  </p>

<p>from the perspective of a common person - the average citizen - these acts are abusive, nonsensical, stupid.  that&#39;s what most of us are - common people.  our strength is in our numbers, and we tend to forget this.  to the common people this behaviour from a hero class we&#39;ve enabled doesn&#39;t move in line with our well-being.</p>

<p>from the perspective of the abusers, this is all done for a reason.  </p>

<p>i select my language from my relation to the acts - as a common person.  if i were in palestine i&#39;d see the israelis as abusive (and they are).  if i were in yemen i&#39;d see the sauds and americans as abusive (and they are).  </p>

<p>i say these things to help others understand the mentalities and rhetorical games being used to coerce their behaviour.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think thay terrorism doesn&#39;t even exist, at least not to the extent we are told it does.</p>

<p>What I mean is it is often assumed that terrorism is bottom-up, the rag-tag disenfrachised guerilla-fighters going up against the rich, the government, or the powerful. That&#39;s what we are supposed to think is happening.</p>

<p>But the powerful are SO powerful, how can this even happen?</p>

<p>In reality they are puppets paid for by the powerful to incite fear and terror among the poor and weak people to garner even more control. To get them to willingly hand-over their few remaining rights. And to give us the illusion of freedom. If terroism exists, hey, thats just part of the price we pay for freedom and privacy, right? Modern terrorism is always top-down. Always has been, always will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it&#39;s not the worst plan in the world if you are looking for something preemptive. </p>

<p>You can argue that if the FBI can convince someone to detonate a bomb, so could somebody with the intent to do actual real damage.</p>

<p>Better that it is a fake fbi bomb than a real one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way to spin this into an acceptable light.  The FBI is directly seeding &quot;terror&quot; into the minds of citizens, for what?  Good press?  Or part of something more sinister?  This is far from the first time they&#39;ve used questionable patsies to pin their crimes on.  But it&#39;s rare to have such a direct and unambiguous incrimination of them.</p>

<p>Preying on the crippled, the feeble minded, and using active criminals to get them onboard...  it&#39;s a gross abuse of power.  You should really rethink your stance of supporting this inexcusable fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except if you&#39;re actively radicalising people on a federal scale you&#39;re going to have a <strong>deleterious effect on public ethics</strong>.</p>

<p>When FBI agents infiltrate &quot;dangerous&quot; organisations (and remember they have a very low bar for this, and it&#39;s ranged from Occupy Wall Street to the Juggalos) they flood them with undercover agents who are role-playing as a villainous interpretation of whoever they infiltrate--one-upping real members in order to be above questioning. This lowers the overall potential for independent thought in an organisation, and eliminates potential for dynamic changes in identity for the group as a whole, because it is now populated by people acting like one-dimensional zealots instead of real, thinking human beings. Those are agents provocateur, perpetually trying to convince the group to engage in arrestable acts, affecting the tone of conversation of the entire group continuously. They create their own cartoon monsters in this way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on an individual level, imagine how many vulnerable people like this 23-year-old that they must approach and manipulate before discovering that they can&#39;t be fully radicalised into an arrestable act and disengaging. There must be many candidates for every one that they follow through with, right? But it&#39;s undercover, so those people are left confused about who they were really talking to, generally under the impression that the world is really full of people like that, an impression which they&#39;ll take into their interactions with others for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s slow and subtle, but imagine the effect this can have on society on a national level, amplified over decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first article you linked mentions the Fort Dix Six. I went to school and had some classes with the supposed mastermind of that plot, even though the FBI informant was he one that came up with the plan, assembled the group and had the connection to procure the weapons. He now has a life sentence, which you can argue he deserved for going along with the plot, but it was definitely a case of entrapment, just like the others.</p>

<p>Here is a great article from the Intercept that provides all the details on how the events unfolded. It is a bit long, but is definitely worth the read.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/06/25/fort-dix-five-terror-plot-the-real-story/">https://theintercept.com/2015/06/25/fort-dix-five-terror-plot-the-real-story/</a></p>

<p>Chris Christie was the prosecuting US attorney in this case. Here is a video of the pres conference he gave proclaiming how they stopped a terrorist attack on military and civilian personnel, this helped elevate his status and lead to his election as Governor. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they can. Which is probably why they&#39;re going to file tons of motions to suppress under the bullshit of state secrets or national security or any other number of bs loopholes. Good on the family for speaking out, even though countless attorneys would advise them not to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rebuttal to what the mom said is that if the FBI can convince you to try and blow up a building, so could a terrorist group. It&#39;s unfortunate in this circumstance and I can&#39;t imagine this case will make it past a judge, but there&#39;s a reason they do stings this way. It not only makes sure that they find lone wolves before a more radical group does, it also makes people less likely to put trust in a radical group that might contact them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, if people contribute, I&#39;ll stand on a corner in my city and be really nice, presentable, well-spoken, and happily give out pamphlets, answer questions if people ask them, and spread awareness in a welcoming, non-confrontational way, about the issues we care most about. We could crowdsource some irl shills, to fight all their online ones. lol Man think about it, we could do this for a whole group of people if things went well, and we stayed cool, and we didn&#39;t go full retard, stuck to provable things. </p>

<p>Hire me, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. My resume includes managing a hotel for 2 years, during which time I learned to take a hot fucking and smile and say &quot;thank you, sir. I completely understand your concerns and it is my honest, sincere intention to make this right&quot;, in addition to general customer service skills, so I&#39;d be able to handle those who attempt to get a rise out of me, and would remain a good &quot;face&quot; for the cause, while engendering good-will and using my public relations experience to try to associate positive feelings with the information we most dearly want others to see.</p>

<p>We could begin with pamphlets, simple graphical presentations that encapsulate easily digestible, proven conspiracies, such as this story, or Waco, Jonestown, etc. No &quot;ARE YOU GONNA STAND FOR THIS?!?!?!?!!&quot;, and more &quot;Have you heard about the time the FBI gave a kid with schizophrenia a bomb to see if he&#39;d blow up a bank?&quot;</p>

<p>I mean it doesn&#39;t gotta be me, but we should do something like this. I&#39;d pitch in a few bucks, if there were checks and balances, like, say, $150 for manning a station for 7 hours, and you have to upload video, and who knows what else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI definitely crossed a line. </p>

<p>But this was no sweet person, he had violent tendencies. He raped and choked his wife. I understand that we want to give him the benefit of doubt due to his mental health. But many mentally ill people live their lives without attacking people or planning to blow up buildings. </p>

<p>The family wants to scapegoat the FBI, and again, they went to far. This was entrapment so they had an airtight case and somebidy could get their promotion. But they share some blame here. He needed to stay on his meds, you cant expect strangers to do that unless you go and get help.  They also let their son down. He lived at home, Im sure they knew he was off his meds. And dont get me wrong, I know its not an easy task.  But its not the governments job to keep this kid medicated, until he is commited or incarcerated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. This isn&#39;t just unethical police behaviour; this is psychological abuse.</p>

<p>Imagine struggling with paranoid schizophrenia and <em>literally being set up and entrapped by the FBI</em>. That would make a perfectly sane person paranoid for the rest of their life. Just outrageous.</p>

<p>I really hope this draws more attention to the fact that the FBI has been conducting operations like this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/fbi-entrapment-fake-terror-plots">for years</a>, making their numbers look good by manufacturing &quot;terrorists&quot; and then arresting them. It&#39;s absurd. At least when it results in the arrest of a sane person who was willing to commit an act of terrorism, that&#39;s some defense for it. But this person should have been offered help with his delusions, not led by the nose into a trap. Despicable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Why the U.S. provided at least 150 people with bombs, transportation and other means of carrying out terrorist plots.</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The FBI is looking for what they term &quot;a lone wolf terrorist,&quot; which is someone holed up in an apartment somewhere who sympathizes with Al-Qaeda but may lack the specific means to do that. And so the FBI uses sting operations to [find] these people -- these people who may want to commit an act of terrorism, are right on that line from moving from sympathizer to operator -- and then through these sting operations, lure them out and get them involved in a terrorism plot that they&#39;re ultimately prosecuted for.</p>

<p>But what I found is that of these cases, we can point to a handful of real, dangerous terrorists, like Faisal Shahzad, who came close to bombing [New York&#39;s] Times Square, or Najibullah Zazi, who came close to bombing the New York City subway system. But so many more of them, more than 150 people, were these men who were caught in sting operations who never had the means and, in some cases, never had the idea for the terrorism plot, and it was the FBI that provided them with everything -- the bomb, the transportation, everything they needed to move forward in a terrorism plot that on their own, they never would have been able to do. And certainly evidence suggests that in most of these cases, they never had any specific connections to terrorism. So it&#39;s really hard to believe that they ever would have had or acquired the means to commit some sort of act of terrorism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the FBI has similar &quot;lone wolf&quot; operations going on like this where they take advantage of men who have mental disorders and give them the means to carry out terror attacks. In some cases they are allowed to carry out those attacks using real weapons or explosives. They let the lone wolf go live when it is beneficial to the government. They setup narratives for the media beforehand and use crisis actors to relay their message. In most cases they make the arrest as the lone wolf is trying to detonate the fake explosive. Nothing like a random terror attack, mass shooting to distract the public, create fear, and push an agenda.</p>

<p>I disagree. Sometimes they have violent tendencies.</p>

<p>I dont know how to respond to this last part. It doesnt seem like a serious question. </p>

<p>I wish this kid wouldve had a better support system. From listening to the family, it seems like they were not up to the task. They blamed his mental illness for him not working, but when he was medicated it sounds like he wouldve been functioning well enough to hold a job. Like many other schizophrenics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;schizos have violent tendencies&quot; thing is completely untrue: it&#39;s an <em>extremely</em> outdated myth(and has been so for quite some time now). Sad that this is still being perpetuated. The disorder may cause delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, etc. but it does <em>not</em> impair(nor otherwise effect) a persons&#39; sense of/ability to recognize/distinguish &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, nor is &quot;violent tendencies&quot; or even aggression of any sort a symptom of the disease(as you seem to believe... ?). They <em>are</em> much more likely to cause harm to <em>themselves</em> but self-destructive behaviours are exactly that - <em>self</em> destructive behaviours - and their existence is <em>NOT</em> evidence of a predisposition to violence/cruelty/aggression towards others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always hated when the FBI used taxpayer money to go after depressives and mentally ill people like this.  There&#39;s no evidence that this man ever would have harmed anyone.  They did the same thing about ten years ago when they arrested a guy for trying to bomb a building in Dallas.  That person did not pick the target, did not build the bomb, and did not have the idea in the first place.  All they did was volunteer to push a button.</p>

<p>In a real terrorist organization, there are bomb makers.  There are handlers.  There are money raisers.  There are people who choose locations.  All of these people are higher up the chain of command than the person they convince to either strap on the bomb or push the button.  If you find and arrest the button pusher but nobody else, you&#39;ve at most delayed their attack for a few months.  You&#39;ve hurt their bottom line by taking away some bomb making materials.  But you haven&#39;t done anything to hurt their ability to recruit bombers and build bombs.</p>

<p>But in this case and similar cases the FBI has done even less.  Every society has people within it who would like to see the world burn.  Every society has lonely, vulnerable, angry people.  Terrorists know this, and the FBI knows this as well.  Terrorist organizations know how to find and exploit these people.  They have procedures to slowly gain their trust and then convince them to run missions for them.  The FBI does as well.  The fact that the people the FBI arrests have never spoken to a real terrorist organization or otherwise harmed anyone means that at most, the FBI has taken away from the pool of people that might have been recruited by a terrorist organization if there were a terrorist organization recruiting from that community.  We have no way of knowing how large the pool of potential terrorists might have been or whether this FBI operation hurt or slowed any actual terrorists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the FBI using the same psychological metods as terrorist organizations to create publicity and justify their paychecks.  All paid for by your taxes.</p>

<p>I agree with this. And there is incredible pressure to find them. People do bad things out of desperation. Its easy to trash the FBI and CIA. I understand that. I feel that way also. But I can also see where that pressure can lead to a desperate act like entraping a mentally ill person into a terrorism case to try to make themselves look good. I wanted to compare it to a fire fighter that sets a fire so he can be a hero, but that is a bad comparison. They dont have the public demonizing them, and they have politicians breathing down their necks to produce stats. </p>

<p>Its just bizarre that the feeling here is that this is a black and white issue. Its not. This kid was crazy and didnt like to stay on his meds.  He has a history of violence when not medicated. While I also agree that he was probably not going to carry out a bombing by himself, I also feel society is safer with him locked up or institutionalized untill he is willing and able to stay on his meds. </p>

Cooper in retaliation for his being able to describe the real OKC bombers. FBI
wanted to rope in Cooper to pin OKC on him too, but Cooper was a true Patriot
who outsmarted the Hoovers, saying the FBI &quot;keeps tripping over their own
dicks&quot;, so he did not fall for their entrapment!</p>

<p>Notice anything weird about that page?</p>

<p>Why would FBI redact the names of John Doe 1 and John Doe 2?</p>

<p>McViegh is long dead and according to the official FBI cover up narrative to
create Evil White Nationalist Militia in order to get more budget to harass
them. And no John Doe 2 was ever found. So why would the names of these
2 mystery visitors need to be redacted in The Current Year?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why: their names are NOT McViegh!</p>

<p>BTW those John Doe&#39;s real names are Kenneth Trentadue and Richard Lee Guthrie.
Both of whom were bank robbers and long-time FBI informants flipped to
infiltrate the Militia Movement. Both were under surveillance the whole time and both were
entrapped to commit the OKC bombing just like the guy in the story of this thread.</p>

<p>&quot;Coincidentally&quot;, both Trentadue and Guthrie were murdered in prison under
mysterious circumstances and framed as suicide.</p>

<p>In fact, Trentadue&#39;s &quot;suicide&quot; was later ruled to be murder in 2003, and the Bureau of Prisons was found
responsible, but the case couldn&#39;t proceed because the Coroner was himself murdered and the only witness, another inmate in the adjacent cell, was also murdered in prison.</p>

<p>How convenient. No witness, no evidence, no crime.</p>

<p>See how deep the rabbit hole goes with FBI false flags?</p>

<p>The slogan &quot;the FBI always gets their man&quot; should be renamed to &quot;the FBI always frames their man.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m pretty late here and some of you already know this, but when controlling groups and intelligence agencies look for people to use, they often seek out those who may be more prone to dissociation. Kids who grow up in abusive situations, people who have spent a lot of their lives neglected, etc. This makes it easier for a person to be programmed using torture. Their minds already know how to acclimate to extreme trauma, (dissociate) how to tune out and become suceptible to ideas or commands. </p>

<p>I wonder if it might be easier for these perpetrator groups to find people who are already deemed unstable to carry out short-term commands. These deemed-unstable people won&#39;t be used for complex or very secret operations, just ones that really highlight their mental instability and help push a narrative about people who need to be controlled. </p>

<p>I think there is a vulnerability here, on the perpetration groups side. Kids who are programmed from infancy to do whatever they&#39;re told are different in that they are more dissociative. They really don&#39;t have access to their own memories and can&#39;t say that they&#39;re being used by a group of people, but the ones perpetrator groups are accessing as adults might not have that. They know and can remember someone telling them to do shit. </p>

<p>I guess the takeaway I want to leave y&#39;all with is: Consider what someone is telling you if they are disclosing abuse or manipulation by someone, especially a stranger, even if they have a diagnosis of a mental disorder. It could be true, and there is a better chance of the truth coming out of them than someone who was born a (I know this is strong language, but) slave to intelligence agencies/millitary/satanic mind control groups. (Like I was) </p>

<p>I know this sounds pretty nuts, but please take any sincerity you may have felt from me while reading this and consider what I&#39;m saying. This is a much more plausible way to out them. People who have not been programmed from infancy may remember who is trying to get them to do shit and may be more likely to expose this horrible use of human beings. And they may remember with more accuracy than someone who has been trained to dissociate and forget.  </p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that there was &quot;The Hand&quot; involved with the Charlottesville attack, but to what purpose? I don&#39;t see any entity directly benefitting monetarily....If the man in Charlottesville had used a firearm as his weapon of choice I could see another push for disarming citizens. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, CIA critic Robert David Steele (who was a CIA officer for many years, but is now a strong critic of the agency) believes the violence at rallys this Summer of 2017 and the violence at both Democratic and Republican Party rallys last year (before the 2016 election) is being orchestrated by Deep State individuals opposed to Trump&#39;s presidency, and they&#39;re funding the violence to a tune of 60 million dollars for the summer. </p>

<p>Here are some links with interesting info about the Charlottesville attacks and the summer of violence:</p>

<p>By the way I&#39;m not a fan of Trump or Clinton.  I voted for Doctor Jill Stein of the Green Party, the only honest party which truly loves America.  The criminal Democrats and criminal Republicans voted for a costly war in Iraq, and let the Big Banks destroy the economy 9 years ago by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, a regulatory law that had stood since the 1930s to prevent another Great Depression.  The bought Republicans and Democrats don&#39;t love America as much as their Congressional jobs and pay.  People in the Green Party, however, love America, like Doctor Jill Stein and legendary consumer advocate Ralph Nader who for decades has given away 90 percent of his income every year to causes he believes in.  People like that can&#39;t be bought.</p>
