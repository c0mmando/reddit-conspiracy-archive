        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A solution to paper currency is giving it value based on time and energy. Every person would agree that their time and energy have worth. For instance six minutes of basic energetic output could equate to one bank note and this sets a minimal standard of ten per hour. Natural competition can then determine higher wages and price commodities off that basic standard. A real Free Market regulates itself through competition and does not allow corporations to exist and compete with private businesses. Capitalism is not a real Free Market since it is regulated by federal agencies that are leveraged over by corporate lobbyists. Applying actual worth to paper currency can remove all economic chains that they have on society.  They cannot devalue paper money if it has substantiated worth or create artificial debt through derivatives.</p>

<p>Corporations are not natural or moral constructs and should not exist at all. Corporations are defined as a person with rights under law.  Corporations are not people. This corruption enables them to evade liability for most crimes or the corporations are only subject to petty fines compared to their earnings. Most corporations operate as subsidiaries and this conceals the true owners. The stock exchange is a byproduct of corporations and there are no real regulations to fully restrict insider trading. The only regulations imposed onto businesses should be the natural laws. The owner of a business should be the one responsible for their business. Quality is then regulated through competition. Corporations and private businesses are not equal under law. All businesses should be competing on an equal playing field.</p>

<p>A corporation is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. Corporations enjoy most of the rights and responsibilities that an individual possesses; that is, a corporation has the right to enter into contracts, loan and borrow money, sue and be sued, hire employees, own assets and pay taxes. It is often referred to as a &quot;legal person.&quot; </p>

<p>Most small private business owners operate under a thing called an LLC. LLC is an acronym for &quot;Limited Liability Company&quot; and it exists for the exact reason to protect the individuals who are run a company. There company may be held accountable, but the LLC protects the business owner. Same the other way around. If I get in a personal lawsuit, it can&#39;t affect my company. Do some reading on LLCs, S corps, and C corps. </p>

<p>What makes a business private is that it is not controlled by the government. Weather it&#39;s a small company, medium company, or large corporation. My argument here is that corporations are still private businesses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creating a unit of measurement for time and effort is an interesting idea, but an incomplete one.  One problem is in exchanging these units and keeping record of them.  Any record keeping would have to authenticate the users of the transaction and validate the transaction occurred, which is susceptible to gaming if 2 parties decide to invent the transaction.  Also the system of record of any transaction would have to be distributed similar to blockchain or it would be subject to a single point of failure design flaw.  Then the problem of quality of work comes in.  Some tasks require skill sets or ability that aren&#39;t common and can&#39;t be easily measured or compared to other providers.  The market helps to valuate these contributions but it does so under all of the implicit design flaws inherent in money itself.  </p>

<p>Money generally speaking is Bad Design.  Using single metrics to summarize things that have multiple dimensions is generally a bad idea.  Having a small set of actors determine value for the cohort is generally a bad idea.  </p>

<p>Trade promises (ie. agreement to do something in exchange for something else) is a better approach that avoids the money middleman.  Having systems around these promises allows for market-like services such as auditing ones transactions, ones history, etc.  These provide smells as to the value of someone&#39;s contributions, but in a non single metric way.  It also avoids the problem of debt generally speaking as transactions won&#39;t be completed until they are completed.  Unfulfilled promises are just that - non transactions.</p>

<p>Money is a proxy.  There are other ways to implement proxy functionality without using money.  </p>

<p>I agree with your corporation points.  It&#39;s a device that evades accountability.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You misunderstand my points.  Organizing the record keeping around this standard is an inherent monoculture-y design flaw.  That&#39;s one problem.  Trying to normalize all time and energy (if they are the same quantitatively speaking) is another that doesn&#39;t map to reality.  Basically the whole money idea is a bad idea.  Using the unit of measurement you&#39;re suggesting IS useful but as a way of quantifying contractual obligations, and not as a form of currency, as there would be no way to really validate the time/energy was used.  Since money is a proxy, you&#39;re creating a gateway for the creation of these time/energy units out of thin air, absent checks that they occurred.  Much easier to avoid the currency trap entirely and just use the concept of promises as constraints on any exchange.</p>

<p>again you&#39;re falling into the monoculture design trap.  monocultures suck.  badly.  a panoply of service providers to manage &quot;trade promises&quot; provides the market checks that monocultures tend to really fuck up.</p>

<p>re: wage regulations.  this is an entirely different subject and goes more towards collective social values.  on that subject there is need for provision of basic services by the collective - but this can also be done contractually as a &quot;social contract&quot; kinda thing, and still fall under the umbrella of &quot;promise&quot; systems.</p>

<p>no.  totally off point.  totally incorrect.  i&#39;m speaking design.  i&#39;m speaking about functionality.  i&#39;m saying one thing and you&#39;re hearing something else. </p>

<p>no i was very specific.  you are articulating a design yes?  in that design you have a need for record keeping yes?  your idea requires a single thing to manage those records, yes?  a central reserve, yes?  these are your own words.  that&#39;s a monoculture.  that&#39;s a single point of failure.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m speaking the language of design.  you are not.  you are very much not understanding what i am saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is bothering me because it is a straw man. I will give an example of a monoculture which I have not suggested in any way. I have a farmer that lives across the street and owns a small farm. He grows corn, flowers, various vegetables which would be considered a polyculture since he produces many products. Poly means many or a variety. A monoculture would be where he produces only one crop like only corn. Mono means singular. No where did I suggest this. You need to be called out because you did blatantly come at me with a straw man argument.</p>

<p>You&#39;re promoting a unit of currency.  Where does the information recording this unit&#39;s existence live, guy?  A central bank.  How do you validate the existence of this unit?  A central bank.  Do you even understand the design you are promoting, how it would be implemented?  </p>

<p>yes making statements about design is a true/false paradigm - oh wait it&#39;s not.  your willful interpretation, incorrectly i&#39;ll add, of my statements as lies is complete bullshit.  if you think a discussion about design is a lie then you don&#39;t know what a lie is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a printed currency based on time and energy it should still allow the ability for untaxed free trade of basic commodities and services. This would allow people to be entirely self reliant within their own communities. The paper currency allows further growth and prosperity beyond self reliance and businesses would register with the treasury. I believe there should only be a flat sales tax of 10 percent cost for example. 4% could go to locality. 4% could go to state. 2% could go to the federation or under the current system the federal government. To change the current system into time and energy based currency people could still retain their social security that they invested in with by converting their time and energy invested into the new standard. Social security should eventually be removed or only through choice because it creates binds or chains to the government which can use it as leverage on people. Time and energy currency could also get rid of all the fake derivatives they created. If they were to ever collapse the economy this could solve the problem almost instantly. Gold and silver are preferred forms of currency however there is not enough gold and silver for 300,000+ million people unless the value is increased. Those with the most gold and silver are the criminals running the system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think trashing Capitalism based upon the over-regulated version of Capitalism that the U.S.A. institutes is fair to the idea of Capitalism.  Just because the U.S.A. twists it and utilizes it to benefit a few, doesn&#39;t mean it is wrong ideally.</p>

<p>Going after monopolies in the U.S.A used to be possible (even if ultimately useless since it all benefited a few in the long run anyway).  These days, no one hears about monopoly hearings against the largest corporations.</p>

<p>As for corporations being not natural, yes and no.  Within an economic system such as Capitalism (and not a unified economic system such as socialism or fascism), there needs to be a way to group unified interests within the economy, in the case of Capitalism, this unit of grouping is the corporation.</p>

<p>Where the U.S.A. twisted and perverted the ideological idea of units of grouping within the Capitalist economy is when they used government to rule that corporations could be defined as people, and thus the crossover/perversion of government and Capitalism was completed wholly.</p>

<p>Corporations should not be defined as people with rights under the government.  And they weren&#39;t since the inception of the country until recently.  It&#39;s only been less than 20 years if I remember correctly that the government permitted corporations to be treated as people with rights.  So the U.S.A. did hold onto the ideological ideas of economy and government before they perverted it into what we have currently, and that will lead to a one-world-government/economy (using a one-world-government currency) hybrid.</p>

<p>Also, regulations of businesses are not in and of themselves bad, it has been the perversion of those ideas that have made them bad, and has led to bigger bloated government to manage those rules and regulations, which then feeds itself in all other areas.  The beast system grows and grows if you will.</p>
