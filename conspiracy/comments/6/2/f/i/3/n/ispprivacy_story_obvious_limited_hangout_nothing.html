       The persistent "outrage" on social media, and to lesser extent our society, is being effectively corralled by this story. It's a limited hangout, or a smoke screen, for a very obvious purpose.

       Acclimation to a world without privacy.

      <p>
       Focusing on the ISPs or the Republicans obfuscates the ubiquitous nature of this war against privacy. There is no privacy online. This bill doesn't change that.

       Jesus fucking Christ, I'm not disagreeing that privacy is rare and hard to come by..
      </p>
      <p>
       However Obama passed a law that required ISP's to get your permission before selling your info to 3rd parties.  This was just APPEAL, meaning we now have LESS privacy than we did before because we no longer have the right to say what happens to our data.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can keep twisting things to fit your narrative, but we have LESS privacy because a dumb ruling.

       Well from my understanding, for those concerned enough, they still have a right to opt out; whereas previously you would have to be convinced to opt in.

       You are wrong about that. Previously ISPs were REQUIRED to get "opt-in" consent. You can still ask them to opt-out after this, and while they aren't obligated to protect all of your info (they never were) it is still a smart idea since most of these companies don't want a PR nightmare and have policies in place to protect their consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this, Google, Yahoo, and Bing already sold this information (regardless of consent). That info is already available. If you have the right channels and enough money, it was never private.

       I'll just say though, even though information like this was probably already being collected/used, seeing congressmen risk a PR issue to pass this bill makes me think that they aren't just doing it for no reason, and that makes me nervous.

       It's not to say this bill or the actions of the congressman aren't problematic. The entire thing is very concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is similar to the Russia "story." How they build a narrative and paint a broad picture of reality is more effective towards control, than any of the details. Any details (AKA facts) are literally just convenient tools for creating believable propaganda. It's not about the facts or the reality. It's about the story they want the people to believe or at the minimum be the baseline for improved control.

       There's more to it. The regulations that are hopefully being nullified give edge providers (Google) an competitive advantage over common carriers. It is a classic piece of Obama era garbage that is nicely named but in reality is selling our freedoms to Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives all the shills the perfect cover story. "Big telecom companies are ecstatic that Trump is going to sign this!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We need shit because otherwise Google is going to completely take over. It's just more of the same abuse of legislation to consolidate industry power to huge players like Google. Well it's pretty much only Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder you don't see much criticism of them because they already pretty much control the internet.

       I wouldn't call it a limited hang out. It is more of an vocal exaggeration started by VPN companies, then picked up by the news for that good click-bait revenue.

       The news gets to kill two birds with one stone, pretend Obama's weak sauce rules were real privacy protections and to insinuate the GOP ruined it.

       Really, the ISPs always could make giving up privacy part of their contract with you. Obama's FCC rules tightened how they could get that consent, slightly, and mandated some rules for protecting customer data (like credit cards) from breaches.

       Fair enough. Use the terms you want. My main point is simply that nothing is being taken from you that was not already being taken from you. This story is a way to control the way we think of privacy online.

       I wont dispute the sort of limited hang out nibble approach to encrouching on privacy that is already being intruded upon... What i feel the issue is is that this formalises and legalises the process in a way that before forced data collection info to be 'laundered' as to the origin of its source, no?

       ISP's gain additional income, and 3rd parties gain information on you. It's not a matter of you gaining or losing anything, it's a matter of others gaining what they couldn't before.

       100% agreed, but it's also a limited hangout of sorts; people didn't -officially- know they were being watched at all levels of connection before. Now they're catching up to the facts.

       The great thing about the Trump presidency is this: people are starting to expect the government to do bad things, even if they weren't before because of Obama's lawyerings and smooth talk.

       No, because it's a systemic issue that goes far beyond this bill. Its an attempt to define the narrative and its working.
