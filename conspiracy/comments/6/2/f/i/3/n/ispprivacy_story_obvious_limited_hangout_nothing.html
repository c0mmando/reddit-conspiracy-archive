    <div class="md"><p>Jesus fucking Christ, I&#39;m not disagreeing that privacy is rare and hard to come by..</p>

<p>However Obama passed a law that required ISP&#39;s to get your permission before selling your info to 3rd parties.  This was just APPEAL, meaning we now have LESS privacy than we did before because we no longer have the right to say what happens to our data.</p>

<p>So you can keep twisting things to fit your narrative, but we have LESS privacy because a dumb ruling.</p>

<p>Do you lock your doors at night? Cause I&#39;ve got sledge hammer that take your lock out really quick.. Or do you lock them anyway because it&#39;s still a viable safeguard..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong about that. Previously ISPs were REQUIRED to get &quot;opt-in&quot; consent. You can still ask them to opt-out after this, and while they aren&#39;t obligated to protect all of your info (they never were) it is still a smart idea since most of these companies don&#39;t want a PR nightmare and have policies in place to protect their consumers.</p>

<p>Before this, Google, Yahoo, and Bing already sold this information (regardless of consent). That info is already available. If you have the right channels and enough money, it was never private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t dispute that. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just say though, even though information like this was probably already being collected/used, seeing congressmen risk a PR issue to pass this bill makes me think that they aren&#39;t just doing it for no reason, and that makes me nervous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not to say this bill or the actions of the congressman aren&#39;t problematic. The entire thing is very concerning. </p>

<p>The issue is similar to the Russia &quot;story.&quot; How they build a narrative and paint a broad picture of reality is more effective towards control, than any of the details. Any details (AKA facts) are literally just convenient tools for creating believable propaganda. It&#39;s not about the facts or the reality. It&#39;s about the story they want the people to believe or at the minimum be the baseline for improved control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more to it. The regulations that are hopefully being nullified give edge providers (Google) an competitive advantage over common carriers. It is a classic piece of Obama era garbage that is nicely named but in reality is selling our freedoms to Google.</p>

<p>It gives all the shills the perfect cover story. &quot;Big telecom companies are ecstatic that Trump is going to sign this!&quot;</p>

<p>We need shit because otherwise Google is going to completely take over. It&#39;s just more of the same abuse of legislation to consolidate industry power to huge players like Google. Well it&#39;s pretty much only Google. </p>

<p>No wonder you don&#39;t see much criticism of them because they already pretty much control the internet.</p>

<p>So yes massive limited hangout.</p>

<p>Really, the ISPs always could make giving up privacy part of their contract with you. Obama&#39;s FCC rules tightened how they could get that consent, slightly, and mandated some rules for protecting customer data (like credit cards) from breaches.</p>

<p>100% agreed, but it&#39;s also a limited hangout of sorts; people didn&#39;t -officially- know they were being watched at all levels of connection before. Now they&#39;re catching up to the facts.</p>

<p>The great thing about the Trump presidency is this: people are starting to expect the government to do bad things, even if they weren&#39;t before because of Obama&#39;s lawyerings and smooth talk. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact same with the environment and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/29/criticism-harvard-solar-geoengineering-research-distorted">geoengineering</a>. </p>

<p>We all saw the planes chemtrailing like crazy before and nobody admitted it. Now there&#39;s a limited hangout about air baloons that will be spraying aerosols for blocking out part of the sun in order to combat climate change.</p>

<p>Guess who gets the credit for that one as well?</p>
