       This is unbelievable. It looks like a Hail Mary pass. They literally blamed EVERYTHING on Russia. They claim that conspiracy sites are russian made. Stories of migrant rape in Europe is Russian made. That Hillary and Marco Rubia lost because of Russia. The stories of American aggression against its own people is Russian made. Protests are Russian made. Every fucking thing is Russian made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do these people think we are utter morons? Now they are suggesting that only an attack against Russia will put a stop to all of this when in reality they know that this would lead to a Nuclear war. They even claimed Americans worrying about Nuclear war is because of a Russian propaganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sore Loser Marco Rubio and his sinister team needs to be flushed out of our leadership system. These scumbags are strictly in it to win it for themselves and could give a rats ass what you or I think or how much misery they spread in the process. They should NOT be in power. They are way too dangerous and puppeteered by even more sinister forces like Rothschild or the elders of Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only good part was when one of them brought up a quote by Putin from earlier today that suggested American politicians are simply playing the Russian Red Scare card for their own political ambitions of self gain.

       so we can never question whatever decision Russia makes because they have nuclear bomb?

      <p>
       that seems nice for them. I guess we'll just have to keep the sanctions then, unless they'll threaten us with nuclear bomb or something.

       I think they do, id be extremely surprised if the whole inventory were functional at this point though. Tritium has an half life of 12 years and is required for all hydrogen bombs to work and older dial a yield designs, and some plain old fission bombs as well. That's a lot of maintenance.

       Profit is irrelevant following a nuclear war with Russia. Even if the economy could somehow hold itself together enough to honor money, let alone production, the reduction in population alone would be enough to plunge the world into a decades- if not centuries-long recession.

       I haven't accused anyone of scaremongering but the divide and conquer stuff is pretty obvious. I don't believe most of this Russia stuff because it all comes out of the CIA owned and operated Washington Post and their "anonymous sources"- much like Hillary's stupid claim of "17 intelligence agencies."

       You're taking me too literally. I'm aware you don't just wipe out Russia. But they do seem to be trying to force ideas on us that Russia is the big scary enemy we all need to be weary of even though they don't seem to want to kill us too badly.

       I mean, it's shitty, but it makes perfect sense from a political standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's approval is in the low 30's, a record low for any president at this point of their first term.  On top of that, it has been in a steady decline since he entered office, so it looks like it'll continue to drop.  If the Republicans want to have any shot at retaining the House in 2018, they need to start disavowing Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, all these people backed him in the election, so if they start condemning him directly, less than 3 months into his presidency, it'll reflect poorly on the Republican judegement in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blaming Russia is the easy alternative, then.  Have a senator from a safe state, or a senator who isn't up for reelection until 2022 (Rubio), start calling out Russia and talking about how terrible they are.  To the best of my knowledge, only one Republican has endorsed Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if Trump is found to have colluded with them, the Republican leaders will try to remove themselves from blame and say "Oh, we condemned those people.  If we'd known you were working for them, we wouldn't have endorsed you in the first place."  It's the Republican leadership trying to cover their asses, because right now they know they fucked up bad and are they are scared they'll lose the House in 2018 if they continue putting their faith in Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the kind of textbook cowardice that is a hallmark of politics.  It's shitty, but it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole theory is wrong, though, if more senior Republican don't start doing similar things in the coming month.  In my mind, this is a first step to test the backlash from the Trump base.  Rubio is just putting his toe in the water.  If it burns him, he won't dive into the deep end, and the others won't follow him.  If not... well, we'll see soon enough.
