<p>First off, check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Le_Pen/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Le_Pen/</a> .  You&#39;ll notice that most of the posts on have between  20-150 uptovtes, and &lt;15 comments. Between the code writing, Graphics creation, Discord,  and obvious use of bots it&#39;s obvious there is financial backing to this subreddit (whether by just political staffers or whatever).
The Senate intelligence chief has warned of russian interference in the (french election)[<a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20170330-russia-actively-involved-french-election-warns-us-senate-intelligence-chief">http://www.france24.com/en/20170330-russia-actively-involved-french-election-warns-us-senate-intelligence-chief</a>] 
  Between the similarity to <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> ( the name, subreddit aesthetics, and &quot;meme bank&quot;,) and russian favoritism of Trump, I think it&#39;s probable that The_Donald was at least started, and helped brought to popularity, by Russia&#39;s propaganda team. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>That&#39;s really what it is at this point.  There&#39;s no conspiracy left.  It&#39;s just a matter of connecting the dots between the 5 or 6 people we know were compromised (Flynn, Manafort, Kushner etc.) to all the people that they appointed/recruited.</p>

<p>there were a lot of crusades bro, and being that they were defined as movements of europeans going to jeruselum to fight, well that kinda shits on the whole self defense thing (as though that was even the justification for <em>all</em> of them) don&#39;t it?  Its not self defense if you jump in front of a bullet fired in another direction is it?</p>

<p>yeah i am an atheist, you got a problem with that?  And what exactly makes atheists faggy?  Funny criticism coming from a person whose religion talks about loving a dude all the time.  And do you have a problem with gays?  Whats your damage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tankie apologism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>who the fuck are tankies?</p>

<p>whatever, as usual the demand for evidence christianity is the same is met by silence and shifted goal posts, as should be expected from someone so morally weak they can be lead to hatred and vitriol of others who&#39;s beliefs are basically the same, yet will think they are virtuous in doing so despite violating every directive of their (not truly respected) holy book.</p>

<p>and when more evidence is presented and the goal posts won&#39;t shift anymore you instead just go for ad hominem, apparently not forgiving everything christians do or not villifying the same things when muslims do them makes me &quot;faggy&quot;</p>

<p>thats how i know i&#39;ve won.  You have retreated to insults, and i choose to follow you know further.  Contemplate the things i have written, and your errors of morality and logic, i do no t intend to respond further.</p>

<p>Thats the thing bro, you are not investigating shit you are just regurgitating what they feed you. If you actually did investigating like you said you would have proof and wouldn&#39;t have to google &quot;Trump Russian bots&quot; to find you evidence of something you whole heartrendingly believe. I am not asking you to believe the man in the ivory tower, I am simply asking you to follow actual hard evidence and follow sources and go down that rabbit hole to see the source of this information you are getting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no Russians. Russians didn&#39;t hack the DNC, they didn&#39;t hack the election, and the only real link that exists between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump was a very ill-advised exchange of mutual respect while Trump was still a primary candidate.</p>

<p>The fascists trying to crush free speech in this country right now are using the Russians as their Eastasia. Don&#39;t buy a fucking word of it, not for a minute, the CIA is known to have the ability to spoof state actors - which means any actor - with the malware thay&#39;ve spent your taxpayer money putting together.</p>

<p>the Propaganda and Disinformation Act - again, taxpayer money - has been paying the salaries of thousands of propagandists who have spent assiduous months using the tactic of repeating something over and over until you accept it as true, although it was never true in the first place.</p>

<p>There are no Russian hackers, not of the consequence these fascist bait for firing squads have been leading you to believe. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very true that fascism is finally trying to put its stinking fucking boot down in this country. But those aren&#39;t the Russians, those are the people talking about the Russians. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give them a fucking inch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You linked a article with absolutely no proof and not even a mention of T_D. Yeah some pro Trump tweets come out of Russia, most likely because he doesn&#39;t demonize them nor want a war with them unlike the other presidential runner. I want to be reasonable with you because its the only way to make headway. You are being mislead by a huge political machine, be wary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t automatically excuse the republicans just because theyre on your side. US politics is corrupt all the way through and the narrative is always controlled by one side. I think russia picked their horse and supported him in every way possible. Hey I voted for Trump, but it was a vote for chaos. I think the Russians would also appreciate some American chaos so its not outside of the realm of possibility that they support him too.</p>
