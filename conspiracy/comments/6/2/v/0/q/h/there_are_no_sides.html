        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Politics has always been about dividing and conquering. Our politicians use the same tactics and strategies as the Greeks and the Romans and they mixing it up with other great warriors and warlords of the past like Ghengis Khan and the guy who was with Krishna in the battle in the Bhagavad Gita. The point is it&#39;s all been done before and it&#39; has always turned out the same. Nobody is trying to make a great America, nobody is trying to actually make things better. It&#39;s all war games. That being said is I don&#39;t believe we will see a safe haven under Donald Trump or any current leaders we have. I think Donald Trump is a clever ploy to rally the herd. They made Hillary Clinton the villian, along with the rest of the system. Donald Trump is the savoir figure to the rest of the sheep. Their flock got a little scattered but it&#39;s not hard to bring them back home.</p>

<p>During Bush they fucked up with the Iraq war and the length of the ear was a big problem too, alot of people started to feel resentment with the government and they know when the waters start to get disturbed. The economy started getting worse and people started getting anxious, so to relieve the public they got Obama. Now he is a brilliantly charismatic and a talented liar. You have to give him that. He really knows how to spin the people. </p>

<p>Obama was used to install a more structured police state government. The passing of surveillance bills, Obamacare, the huge step up in the milliary and the step up in Federal Police and Local Police Forces. Obama was out on display with athletes and comedians and actors. Special guests appearances and TV bits. Keeping the people laughing at how likable he is. Except the drones were still striking villages and JSOC was more active than any presidency to date. Things seemed to go well, the economy was &quot;growing&quot; but people were getting restless towards the end of Obama&#39;s presidency. Obamacare wasn&#39;t working and the war was getting worse.</p>

<p>Out steps Mr Donald Trump. Instantly people are addicted and want him and believe he is the savior. Same thing happens with Obama. All it is, is an elaborate guiding of awareness. The are recollecting the strays and the MSM hatred of Trump  is a way to try and keep hold of the followers they gained during Clinton, Bush and Obama. Politics is a long term game and they are just rallying the rest of the herd. There are no sides, there are only people and once we stop hating people because they are on the other side of the line then we can evolve. They keep using the same illusions and we keep fall for it. We have to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, Doc.  I have been saying for a while that Trump is owned by a foreign power (which isn&#39;t Russia, but Israel). The hacking hearings are designed to gaslight partisans into conflict. The Zionists will first eviscerate the globalists through these hearings. After that, it is mobilization for WW3, while we wait for LePen, Grillo, and May to finish off the EU.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets wait at least 4 years to really critique Trump. Although I do agree something is fishy, and there must be something more to the Trump presidency if they really let him in office, since I believe presidents are chosen not by the people. This whole MSM bullshit and everything else would need to be a massive psyop that&#39;s genius though. The divide and conquer tactic seems to be in full swing though. We need to give it time to see how things turn out, and with Trump, I think would be the last straw when a civil war happens during or after his presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I got the point its blatantly obvious you just don&#39;t like the guy. Its not even being skeptical on your part. He hasn&#39;t been in office for half a year and you already lost faith. Its just ignorant to assume he&#39;s the same as any other corrupt president before him, just based on the fact that he is the president. You&#39;ll get far in life being optimistic not negative like that. When he fukks up for real, and not the same MSM spewed bullshit constantly repeated in various different ways with the same narrative to warp not only the way you think, but your subconscious as well, then you can jump on the hate train and form a valid criticism on Trump. The fact is, we don&#39;t know shit, and the only source of news we can get is all fake, altered, you name it, in some form. So we come here and figure out what we can but jumping to conclusions on every little thing is just stupid. Just be patient, you bet your ass if he legitimately fucks up, the media will blast it for years 24/7, considering how they cover him right now.</p>
