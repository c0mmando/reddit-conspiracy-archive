    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure which &quot;Russia narrative&quot; you&#39;re referring to specifically, but frankly I&#39;d be surprised if Russian intelligence were not actively trying to gain access to Democratic <em>and</em> Republican campaign IT services, and given the apparent lack of security from the Dems, I&#39;d be astonished if they tried and failed to get that access.</p>

<p>But I think your point is somewhat valid: of what we&#39;ve been shown, there&#39;s not much hard evidence that the leaked emails from DNC and Podesta actually came from Russia. If the security was as lax as it seems, half the script kiddies around the world could have broken in, let alone the possibility of an inside leaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What upsets me is:</p>

<p>1) NSA is collecting everything on us, FBI and CIA spy on us and &quot;wiretap&quot; and can do it without any repercussions.</p>

<p>2) Their people can apparently unmask anyone so this supposed protection of US Citizens is worthless.  It being done for political gain os exactly the fears we all have who protested this.  What will be next? Unmasking Campaign for Liberty donors and leaking their private info to their employers so they get fired or insurance gets dropped or whatever.  If they can do it to a 4 Star General then us plebs are doomed.</p>

<p>3) the protections against a second Watergate with the FISA court now has been turned on its head and turned into the opposite.  Through secret courts with unelected judges we can have sevret wareants on any one od us.  Sure it is supposed to be used when foreign intelligence is suspected but here we see them twisting the truth to gain the warrant.  And there is no record of it what was said because the FISA court keeps no record on purpose.  That also means there is no repercussions for abusing it. No accountability for corruption. No recourse for the wronged and nothing to stop the seeker from committing perjury while getting a FISA warrant.</p>

<p>You are saying why doesn&#39;t the end justify the means.  This is why.  Same reason we don&#39;t dox on here also.  Snowden is a hero for leaking our government&#39;s crimes but to iirc he never leaked personal data or calls to the press.</p>

<p>Even the hero that leaked the DNC corruption and Podesta emails still did commit a crime violating his privacy and stealing from him.  We can be glad to see the truth behind the Hillary facade to her rotten core but none of us wants to have our emails stolen and posted for everyone.</p>

<p>Notice what is happening though, Intel into the cia, which is normally very private, and with the leaked emails; the public wants to know the secrets and look into the private dealings of our government, and the public also does not want to be spied on.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s hypocrisy on both sides.</p>

<p>But I know it&#39;s not black and white, either or.  in this case it&#39;s our elected officials so the public has the right to know what those elected officials do in their private dealings. This imo gets deflected to Russia as fuel to promote sentiments similar to how Bush got us to believe in the desert boogeymen after 9/11, especially since Cheney is part of promoting that narrative. If anyone trusts a word out of the mouths of the one who were in office during 9/11 I recommend not to.</p>

<p>Well, the difference is that the government works for us, the people.  Their actions are (at least supposed to be) all intended toward the public good, so I think there&#39;s a greater expectation of accountability.</p>

<p>We actually have third party transparency. We get it from assange and whoever else is being that outlet. We don&#39;t get source transparency directly from the gov. </p>

<p>third party transparency is also questioned. So ultimately it&#39;s up to us to create our own version of transparency through the info we acquire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that there are two separate issues here. </p>

<p>One is that corruption is exposed. That part is absolutely good. </p>

<p>The other concern is that a foriegn country could try to install the leader they want by seeking and exposing corruption on only one side. It&#39;s still great that corruption is exposed, but at the same time you have to recognize that the party has an agenda (that isn&#39;t to expose corruption for the peoples sake) and you might not be getting the whole picture. They aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>Whether it is worth it is up for debate. Personally I wouldn&#39;t like Saudi Arabia or whoever digging up dirt on Republicans, because you have to ask yourself who is this helping more, our people or SA government. </p>

Instead, they decided to try and sway the election and went out looking for things to use towards that end.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a form of propaganda where someone selectively reveal the truth, but not the whole truth. A partial truth can actually be just as misleading as a lie if it&#39;s presented the right way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such an important point that can&#39;t be repeated enough. This is in my mind the difference between Western propaganda and what we might call &quot;totalitarian propaganda&quot;. The totalitarian model (NK, Soviet/Russian, Chinese) is based on presenting often demonstrably untrue claims about events through state-run media. </p>

<p>The Western model is more subtle, and IMO more effective, in that it presents mostly true information, but selectively. If you fact-check CNN and MSNBC, they&#39;re probably upwards of 95% presenting factual information, but only that information that conforms to a certain narrative. You could get all your information from MSM sources, and be mostly correct in the things you believe, yet still have a wildly inaccurate and incomplete picture of the world. </p>

<p>If you run for public office all your records should be available including emails and past history that is available and you&#39;ll get paid no more than the federal minimum wage and must live in government housing with federal healthcare. Also accepting money from lobbyists will be illegal. As we will have knowledge of bank statements before and sometime after. Also term limits.</p>

<p>Turn the word politician from a dirty word to something good. Also this doesn&#39;t work in a capitalist society where people with money to advertise themselves win. So, yay lobbyists.</p>
