This will drain our money supply and put us further into debt. Not to mention, destroying all those countries is causing massive instability across the whole planet. Orderly neighborhoods have turned into full blown chaotic war zones. </p>

<p>Murder wasn&#39;t always a taboo but thankfully it is now. War is large scale murder but its not a taboo yet. War is bullshit. These countries are like big kids. If they get their feelings hurt, they start killing each other. </p>

<p>Another theory is that the Rotshchild family is instigating all these wars so he can loan both sides money. Rothschild is in control of the 2 factions of the Cabal which are the Zionists and the Communists but this is also a theory. I&#39;m guessing this is the basis of all recent wars. Rothschild just pits global communists against nationalistic Zionists and all for personal gain. He doesn&#39;t care about the billions suffering from death and misery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so to be honest. I understand human potential. I don&#39;t limit humans just because life has been messy historically. I just see us as a growing, evolving species that will surely eradicate all war once our maturity level hits a high enough level. There is no limit to how high we can go though. Also, perpetual war stumps our growth so if we can just try being peaceful, then maybe we can evolve faster. </p>

<p>It will happen when we decide to do it. </p>

<p>Trust me, it is in our hands. The fastest way to world peace is focusing entirely on the self. Greed is bullshit because eventually a few people make tons of money while the rest suffer. This is plain logic and if everyone can just agree that this is true, then greed will be replaced with a desire for planetary wealth instead of personal wealth. Planetary wealth outdoes personal wealth by far. We need a well oiled system that serves all people, not just a few. By understanding this, I can eliminate greed in my own mind and adjust my perspective to focus on planetary wealth. That small change in perspective makes me a person who seeks to make this happen and therefore, the world gets a step closer to peace. I assure you, its all in our hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It more than lingers in our society. The Law of The Jungle will never go away. There will always be a way of thinking that using violence to gain something is okay. Self defense will always be required. You have to use violence to stop violence. You wont be able to persade a man or woman starving from days without food to not rob and kill you for all your supplies. You could argue that taking them in and feeding them would solve this. </p>

<p>But then they get the idea&#39;s of taking over your infrastructure system for themselves. Laziness is probably one of the most influential things promoting evil. If you are too lazy to grow your own food. Why not take it from others? Self preservation is the basic instinct that will not allow humans to co-exist without violence for a very long time. I wish that we could all evolve spiritually to understand this.</p>

<p>But I believe the world was set up this way on purpose. Through some kind of belief that evil must exist for people to appreciate good. Sadness must exist to appreciate happiness. But people take it to extremes and corrupt the basic fundamental ideals of life and the universe. It is true in this universe to survive you <strong>must</strong> consume something else. It is a system that inherently promotes violence, conflict and struggle. While at the same time allowing for peace and the opposite of conflict. The years of programming from our corrupted failure of elected leaders of the past shows they had quite the different vision of humanity and what future it should have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first, don&#39;t discount the massive gains we&#39;ve made on reducing violence. If you could glimpse back a few thousand years ago, you would see that. </p>

<p>Also, we will evolve past violence. Violence seems like the only solution but its not. Its just a weak solution vs stronger solutions that don&#39;t cause as much collateral damage. Also, the elite are very violent people so they have created a world where violence is a means to an ends whether that&#39;s physical violence, psychological violence, or financial violence. All of these systems can be reworked so that cooperation becomes profitable. Also, media pushes violence on us 24 hours, 7 days a week and all those who watch it are brainwashed into thinking violence is a way to resolve disputes (all 3 forms of violence). </p>

<p>Its just so ingrained in our society that it almost forces humans to play ball or fools them into doing so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very great points and I agree with you there. I also believe we will evolve past this point of violence being so rampant in society. I just don&#39;t see it happening in our generation without a world wide cataclysmic event. We can surely set the path towards the greater good and understanding and acceptance of all humans, flaws and all. But it is just like you say. The system is setup to perpetuate this cycle. When we can break the chains of this cycle is when we can set humanity on the path to evolving past our primal instincts and desires.</p>

<p>And you are correct that violence has been greatly reduced. But I wonder if the punishment of jail and such was gone how nice would people really be? When it comes down to someone wanting something you have.. Whether it be a mate, resources, land, or knowledge/technology. There will always be others who would rather take it by force than compromise and learn the skills or techniques from others. </p>

<p>That is what I meant by laziness being so intertwined with &quot;evil&quot;. And with how society has programmed us to be even lazier and want instant gratification on such a scale never imagined. That it will continue until we can massively change our culture and ideals. </p>

<p>If a man rapes a family member of yours, trying to change or convince that man to stop committing crimes is hardly an option if they believe they are &quot;right&quot;. That is why the Law of The Jungle will always prevail. People have their own idea&#39;s on what is right and how the world works. And some will feel justified protecting their loved ones if it means hurting others to continue their survival.</p>

<p>Even if you can compromise on certain things. Without fear of punishment for hurting others. They will continue to do so because ultimately violence is the best tool to convince someone of your viewpoint. And power corrupts many who are exposed to it. Violence through power is the ultimate trap and true power comes with being able to make changes just through ideals.</p>

<p>I struggled to understand why people can behave as so. And it seems to me it is a systemic problem of education and being raised to believe violence is necessary to live. When in reality, it is but many warp that idea to involve killing other humans. You must kill an animal to eat its meat. No matter the amount of understanding and respect you have for that other life. To survive you must consume another life. Even if that life is as simple as a plant. It is the sad truth of the world we live in currently. But it can always change for the better. Through better education of our incoming generations we can teach that violence is a part of life and when it is necessary and not. But people will always have their own opinion due to free will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I learned is that all people are doing the right thing from their prespective of the world. </p>

<p>A man from the hood robs a bank to pay for his surgery because the hood simply has 0 opportunity outside of a few janitorial style jobs that pay chump change. The system is screwed and he wants to live so he robs the bank, gets caught, and ends up in jail. </p>

<p>To break this down, the man believed his only way to make money for the surgery was robbing a bank and since this is a life or death matter, it is justified from his point of view. We throw him in jail thus ruining his life and the family&#39;s lives so we make things worst. Jail makes him worst, the we release him out into the public and a monster thus making society even worst. </p>

<p>The only way to change discraceful behavior is to alter the belief system. Beliefs cause behavior. This man believes his only way to make money is robbing a bank. He&#39;s partially right and partially wrong. By getting rid of corruption, this man will no longer have to rob banks and we no longer have to jail an extra person who costs taxpayers an arm and a leg plus makes our society worst. Jails should alter to rehab centers that focus on altering the belief system and offering inmates more noble options against the lower, more violent ones they know. </p>

<p>The whole fucking this is a mess. That&#39;s why everything from religions to economies to governments are falling apart. We are simply doing it all wrong. That&#39;s the main issue here. I can name 10,000 things we are doing completely wrong and most of this stems from the merciless, every man for himself attitude that harbors a society full of secrets, lack of transparency, media violence (both psychological and physical), and many other elements that simply harm humanity. </p>

<p>I used to think our rulers were stupid but now I realize, all of this is intentional. They are intentionally killing us. They don&#39;t want planetary wealth. They only want wealth for themselves but all this is a temporary era that will eventually pass. </p>

<p>Are you actually fucking serious? First off debaathification was a bush policy not obama. Second off do you honestly think that IS just magically sprang out of the ground at the request of the cia? This kind of thought process oversimplifies a complex issue in a way that borders on a lie.</p>
