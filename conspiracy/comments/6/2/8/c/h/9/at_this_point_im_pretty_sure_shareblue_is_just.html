    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I have some ideas, but they are long in the making.</p>

<p>I feel the best project to work on in the interim is the Ethereum project. It can lead to profits, and will restore some form of order to the internet, such as <a href="https://akasha.world/">Akasha</a>, social media immune to censorship by design.</p>

<p>All this will get loaded up in about a year. Until then, I&#39;m working on in person networks, moving off line. It&#39;s somewhat of a waste at this point. I&#39;m hoping to develop a Torrent Library of useful information.</p>

<p>Once Ethereum is up, they will not be able to remove linkage, or block websites, world wide. That could be a game changer.</p>

<p>However, the Ethereum team is not super political. Vitalik is a programmer, and Vlad is the programmer politician. Designing the mechanisms so that they protect humans, instead of say the current power system, is a difficult innovation that I hope we improve upon.</p>

<p><a href="https://our.wikileaks.org/Main_Page">Our Wikileaks</a> is also a good opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hence the information war. I posted something similar to this a week ago or so, about how burnt out I got after 20 years of research. Got tired of the CHAOS. A million contradicting stories, and even worse people&#39;s shitty attitudes. Yes, it does get you to a point where you don&#39;t want to participate anymore and say fuck everyone. </p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t want to feel like that. So I double my efforts to detach myself from the insanity. Some days I just plant seeds and post articles. Some days I engage in debate, but only civil debate. Shit attitudes are immediately disqualified and don&#39;t merit a response. And there&#39;s a huge difference between shit attitudes and a different opinion. I welcome different opinions. We NEED different opinions. But if I wanted a shit attitude I&#39;d talk to my ex wife.</p>

<p>In my decades of doing this, the best thing for sanity is taking a break. Don&#39;t be afraid to pass the baton for a while. Or have a small private group where you can evolve ideas and solutions and push them forward without too much stress. I have a group of friends from around the world and we do just that and have for 9 years. We&#39;ve become like family. And we cover every conspiratorial issue and there&#39;s never bad energy.</p>

<p>War is war. And this is information war. But like any war, soldiers have to step back and regroup, otherwise they will die on the field in battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all depends on the topic. A million topics, a million problems require a million separate solutions.
Not that we are grand wizards or anything. But after all the years we&#39;ve been together seem to work well together at identifying certain causes and effects of sociology and social engineering, and what we have to do to avoid certain things, even on a personal level. </p>

<p>And some of us are more interactive than others. I&#39;m the type to go to town hall meetings and make a stink, the rest are more passive in that area, but are more inclined to create websites and FB pages sharing info. One of my friends Pages has 7 thousand followers. </p>

<p>However, solutions to anything have a certain formula. First is raising awareness. Share links, plant seeds. Awareness turns to action once it reaches a critical mass, and action leads to change. I&#39;m not too big on protesting like I was 20 years ago, because it&#39;s all paid for and shilled and provocateured in most cases. What&#39;s proven steadfast for me anyway is twenty years of dropping truth bombs, spreading info, writing congressmen, making YouTube vids and spreading them. </p>

<p>One thing I do recommend is not getting people to drink out of fire hoses. People new to conspiracy or doubtful of it cannot process being bombarded. It&#39;s counter productive. It&#39;s best to pick their brains and ask them questions. Let the lead the conversation with their ideas, while you guide the conversation to deeper information. This way they think they&#39;re coming up with the answers, and their egos and beliefs aren&#39;t threatened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are definitely right with the raising of awareness. A friend and I are trying to do the same thing but the problem is it takes quite a while to explain the situation to people. It&#39;s even worse when they ask why they haven&#39;t seen anything like this on &#39;the news&#39;. At the moment it&#39;s all we can do to make people more aware of the situation. The problem then is there is no alternative once people &#39;wake up&#39;. We all still gotta go to work the next day to pay the rent, feed ourselves etc. Lack of alternative is in my mind the greatest problem to changing things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a very complex situation. I&#39;m glad I got into this when I did. I started getting suspicious around the time of the OK City bombing in 1995. Then more so with the USS Cole. By the time 9-11 happened I knew right away it stunk like shit, and that the official story was bogus.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had 20 years to dissect and question and ponder and watch other events. People who are recently jumping on the conspiracy train don&#39;t have the luxury of time like I had. They have to play detective a lot faster, but to be honest, there&#39;s so much more info available, both a blessing and a curse.</p>

<p>And closed minded skeptics; nothing is going to change their minds, except their own will to.  So don&#39;t try. But people who are open minded and want to learn, it&#39;s imperative they understand the history of conspiracy and the history of mind control. These are fundamental building blocks to help understand conspiracy in and of itself. Think of them as keys.</p>

<p>You make a profound point about once waking up, then what do we do as an alternative. This is just one more paradigm shift in a series of them in our human history. And every paradigm shift can only happen one person at a time. It&#39;s all about critical mass. An individual can get in politics, run for congress, etc, but what can that really do? Great people go in all the time to be compromised by the system. The only thing that can really be done on a citizen level is the spreading of knowledge. </p>

<p>Even if you just post links, you&#39;re putting it in people&#39;s faces and making them look at it. They can even laugh. But then someone else will put it in their face, then someone else. Eventually they&#39;ll look or be a lost cause. But I will tell you this: 20 years ago basically no one was talking about this. Now hundreds of millions know. Conspiracy is becoming the new norm. And we&#39;re at stage three of Ghandi&#39;s four stages. He said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. Like I said, stage three. This will be the hardest stage, but Pandora&#39;s box is now open and critical mass is happening. We citizens have to keep dropping truth bombs, we have to educate our friends and families. </p>

<p>And never forget: your energy is valuable. So don&#39;t waste it on naysayers and name callers. Use it on those who want to learn more. The naysayers will become the vast minority then will either wither or jump on board to catch up. At least I hope so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for typing this, we all need to hear it. I agree that we need differing opinions to function as a society, echo chambers are mentally and emotionally unhealthy.</p>

<p>The problem with ShareBlue is that it forces us into an echo chamber, because it divides us and pits us against each other. Everyone is a sh1ll because it cannot be proven or disproven easily. This was one of the smartest things the establishment has ever done. </p>

<p>My SO got too caught up for a while. He took a break, and I am glad. Don&#39;t let it affect your attitude or your passion for human life. We are all people. Lets give everyone respect regardless of what they believe.</p>

<p>This does not apply to bots, however.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think pornography was bad before internet. But now, everything is entirely too accessible. While porn addiction used to be few and far between, it is rampant now. Kids as young as 10 getting on the internet watching choking and gagging doesn&#39;t help them in future relationships, or with anything else really. There is just so much wrong with all of it today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know our age gap so I&#39;ll just give my perspectives. Porn is no worse now than it was before it&#39;s just delivered diffrent &amp; more accessible, you used to have to sneak a mag or borrow your cousins VHS. I do however believe there is a push to desensitize the general population to things though &amp; it does seem to me like we are pushing adult things on young adults, however I may also be that adults now are still acting like children &amp; the lines are just blurred. It&#39;s not hard to see how people get the idea that it&#39;s normal ehen dad has &quot;pornhub&quot; bookmarked &amp; mom is sending the little league coach her tits on &quot;snapchat&quot;</p>

<p>They are trying to flip this sub to democrat. It&#39;s very obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this sub is 9 years old, which means that it existed during the GWB administration. i was on reddit before there such things as sub reddits, and was one of the very first subscribers to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>9 years ago, 9/11 truth was a hot topic on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and many of those who were into 9/11 truth were GWB opponents, or aka Democrats. </p>

<p>it was only after Obama got in that the Democrats let their guard down, and assumed everything would be better, and quit being government critics, skeptics and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.  </p>

<p>if Hillary would have won, the Democrats would have remained as statists aka government worshippers, but fortunately for us, Trump won, and turned the young, idealistic generation of Hillary Voters into critics, skeptics, and conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>all in all i think this is a good development. perhaps if we can red pill enough people when Trump is in office, they will remain red pilled when the next POTUS is in office.  </p>

<p>whenever you see an OP that you think may be planted by a Democrat, just remember that most people are compartmentalized, and have a speciality niche on which they focus their efforts. so, instead of addressing the topic of OP, for which they are probably well-prepared, change the subject to something slightly off-topic for which they are unprepared yet probably curious about </p>

<p>for example, if Dem makes a post about Trump&#39;s bogus wiretapping claims, you bring up the fact that Keith Olbermann did a piece on Mark Klein the ATT whistleblower, who told us that the NSA is intercepting and recording all electronic communications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see those towers burning from my backyard as a five year old child every day of my life. I remember my firefighter father saying he had to go for a while and to take care of pregnant mom and my unborn little sister. I remember being at my grandmas house with mom not knowing why daddy didn&#39;t come home for the past two weeks, and why everyone was so sad. I remember daddy being found in a hospital after he was trapped under rubble for 72+ hours with our next door neighbor firefighter (small world). I remember how daddy was never the same, how he suffered from severe PTSD from all the shit he saw, how my family and childhood was ruined because my father was taken from me and my family forever. I remember him coming home from ground zero with thousand yard stares. I remember his stories of how things didn&#39;t add up, how things were not making sense, how what he saw was &quot;wrong&quot;, how he thought he was crazy, and no one listened to him. I remember the divorce, how I felt it was somehow my fault. I remember how daddy always coughs in pain in the cold, and needs medicine that insurance doesn&#39;t want to pay for. I remember all the pain, and suffering, and yet they think bots and shills will sway me. I have seen TPTB&#39;s evil firsthand, they have made themselves a lifelong enemy, until my dying breath I will not stop. I will try to take this diseased country back in whatever way I can and truly make it great, to be the light in a world shrouded in darkness, even if it be the end of me. I&#39;m coming for them, so in the meantime, they can sit on their piles of bodies and think they have won, their smug satisfaction will just make it easier for them to be dealt with.</p>

<p>So does this mean that users who comment on r/The_Donald comment on r/Conservative more than any other subreddit? No. Eight percent of r/The_Donald’s users have also commented on r/Conservative, which is about one-fifth the size of r/The_Donald, and conversely, 51 percent of commenters on r/Conservative have commented on r/The_Donald. But the raw number of shared commenters isn’t very informative on its own because, for example, almost every subreddit will have a lot of overlap with big, really popular subreddits such as r/AskReddit, which has over 16 million members. Our analysis is a bit more subtle: We weight the overlaps in commenters according to, in essence, how surprising those overlaps are — that is, how much more two subreddits’ user bases overlap than we would expect them to based on chance alone. </p>

To deny crossover between this sub and that sub is laughable.</p>

<p>Yes it referenced <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but It doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means. They took two independent subs &#39;x&#39; and &#39;y&#39; and substract them.

<p>Obviously when I say then&#39;s no crossover I didn&#39;t mean in it the absolute literal way so it might be my fault, let me repharse it, there&#39;s no major crossover/correlation between both subs based on the study of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, you are at least a real sincere person, not someone who is paid to be here. you can probably have discussion and reasoning. whats what was great about this place. people could agree and disagree here. i was never a fan of bringing politics in here to shill for either side. (altho it is inevitable in the current climate) </p>

<p>I was anti Clintons since before i knew of reddit (probably before reddit) so i can admit i was a never hillary team member, and there is some good suspicion on trump..  but this isn&#39;t my first rodeo, seeing dems scramble for an angle of attack is obvious and the anti trump paid-shilling is obvious</p>

<p>when this all began and i heard there was a possibility of a bush-clinton race, it was the last thing i wanted. if we had that race, we would all be united here i believe. the race i wanted to see was bernie vs trump. as they both seemed to be outside the party there were representing, and drastically different</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my observations, these are a few of the tactics groups like shareblue are using:</p>

<p><strong>Confusion</strong></p>

<p>-prevent average citizens from being able to determine fact from fiction by filling the internet and mainstream media with a sea of false stories</p>

<p>-take away the social media voice of the average citizen by flooding them out with sockpuppets and censorship</p>

<p>-create echo chambers where dissent of opinion is not encouraged.  Force users into ghettos where information that does not fit a prescribed narrative reaches only a minimal amount of people.</p>

<p><strong>Smear</strong></p>

<p>-typical political smear campaign bullshit: attack your opponent with anything and everything (true or false)</p>

<p><strong>Infiltration</strong></p>

<p>-infiltrate your opponent&#39;s supporter base and frame them for being unintelligent people who are spreading lies (or worse - remember the Bernie facebook group?)</p>

<p>-capitalize on your infiltration to divide and conquer - spread discord among your opponent&#39;s supporters on various topics</p>

<p>-guide the narrative of the infiltrated user-base into a direction that will dissuade previous followers from participation (constant reposts of stupidity, blatant disinfo, etc).  </p>

<p>The amount of time and money being put into these types of efforts to control social media is staggering.</p>

<p>Keep you like a mindless fapping zombie in front ofa screen, while the relationships around you crumble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watch regular porn, so I would have to eqaute the &quot;heinous acts&quot; to video games (&quot;if I tap B repeatedly I can rip this guys spine out&quot;) I have pretty healthy relationships &amp; a high paying job(&amp; still watch a good bit of porn, even got an ex on PH!!), but I do see a new social ackwardness in people just younger than me. I think it is technologly &amp; is intentional, though. Make people shun direct communtication &amp; they&#39;ll never stand up for anything, execpt what they tell you to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see those towers burning from my backyard as a five year old child every day of my life. I remember my firefighter father saying he had to go for a while and to take care of pregnant mom and my unborn little sister. I remember being at my grandmas house with mom not knowing why daddy didn&#39;t come home for the past two weeks, and why everyone was so sad. I remember daddy being found in a hospital after he was trapped under rubble for 72+ hours with our next door neighbor firefighter (small world). I remember how daddy was never the same, how he suffered from severe PTSD from all the shit he saw, how my family and childhood was ruined because my father was taken from me and my family forever. I remember him coming home from ground zero with thousand yard stares. I remember his stories of how things didn&#39;t add up, how things were not making sense, how what he saw was &quot;wrong&quot;, how he thought he was crazy, and no one listened to him. I remember the divorce, how I felt it was somehow my fault. I remember how daddy always coughs in pain in the cold, and needs medicine that insurance doesn&#39;t want to pay for. I remember all the pain, and suffering, and yet they think bots and shills will sway me. I have seen TPTB&#39;s evil firsthand, they have made themselves a lifelong enemy, until my dying breath I will not stop. I will try to take this diseased country back in whatever way I can and truly make it great, to be the light in a world shrouded in darkness, even if it be the end of me. I&#39;m coming for them, so in the meantime, they can sit on their piles of bodies and think they have won, their smug satisfaction will just make it easier for them to be dealt with.</p>
