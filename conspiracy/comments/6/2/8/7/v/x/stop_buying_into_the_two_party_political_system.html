       Since the ISP bill passed, more and more people are giving credence to the two party political system. It's about time everyone recognize that Republicans and Democrats have always been working together to benefit only themselves, their industries, their corporations, and their masters. They are well aware of how polarized the people have become under the illusion of Left and Right. It's all a reality TV show and they are acting like they are divided in order to divide us. Their goal has always been to divide and conquer, to pit us against each other, and to make us resent our fellow human.

       I tend to agree with you mostly, but the fact that not a single democrat voted yes kind of debunks your claim that both parties are the same.

       That's precisely the point. They present themselves as divided and their constituencies follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm glad you brought this up because it is the very argument that inspired me to make this post. The fact that the votes were unanimous on both sides just goes to show that they want to appear as polarized as possible so that the public really believes that they are at odds with each other.

       Because they ARE divided. To say 'both parties are the same' is to say 'I haven't looked at roll call votes in the last decade'. In fact, there's good evidence according to DW-NOMINATE that the parties are in fact further away from each other than they were 30 years ago.

       Like it or not, the ideological divide in Congress is not manufactured. It's a real representation of a deeply divided nation.

       On the important issues, they are the same.

       Abortion&gt; Bush did nothing on this (R's need this as an issue). 
Global Warming&gt; Obama did nothing on that. 
Entitlements&gt; Attack came from Clinton, then Bush, then Obama. 
Healthcare&gt; Obama instituted the Mitt Romney plan. Killed off Sinlge Payer.

       The examples you provided don't support your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush was of the stance that abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or sexual assault. This was a marked difference in republican policy up until then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama pulled out the vast majority of ground forces out of Iraq when it became apparent that Arab's wouldn't fight alongside westerners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan has been managed by a NATO force since 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off hand, I don't remember much about the patriot act, but I think it was bundled into a budget which, if veto'd, would have sent the government into shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama addressed global warming repeatedly and based policies off it. Billion dollar investments in Solarcity and Tesla. His opposition to the KXLPL. Directing NASA to do climate change research instead of huge pushes into the space race. Clean Power Plan that was just reversed by Trump. Ban on coal leasing on federal lands. Rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production. Greater weight into climate change and carbon emission affects when deciding policy and infrastructure. Countless speeches about the gravity of the climate change situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama and Clinton wanted a single player system, but couldn't have hoped to pass it without a larger majority in the house and senate. They were forced to adopt Romneycare and make it their own, since some health reform was better than none at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even from an outsiders perspective, the two parties couldn't be more different in policy.

       No offense but you're one of those people still stuck in the left vs right paradigm. There's more going on than that and there's more to life than categorizing people into one of two groups that are actually working for the same end result.

       Gaslighting, shilling, shareblueing, blah blah blah. Any time I ask a question around here I am immediately attacked. But I guess it is too much to ask to have a conversation with someone in this sub who actually likes to think for themselves.

       No it proves that democrats did not want this bill to pass. Nothing more and nothing less.

       What you and others are saying is that this proves that democrats colluded with Republicans so that no Democrats had to vote yes and Republicans would take all the heat. That is just silly.

       Thank you. Im so tired to coming to this sub and seeing things like "Republicans sold us out, but Democrats are just as worse!". No they fucking aren't. I'm not saying Dems are good or care about the US public, but at least they don't vote to fuck us over EVERY SINGLE TIME.

       Both sides know the outcome before any vote is cast. There are many dems that would have voted Yay if they needed to but seeing as they knew the results before any vote was cast they are able to make things look like the are split down party lines.

       How? It's fun to criticise, but you need practical solutions to change anything. First past the post mathematically devolves to a two party system. So unless you're advocating anarchy your choices are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Figure out how to best navigate the
         <strong>
          inevitable
         </strong>
         two party system.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fight for election reform. Instant runoff and mixed member proportional have been tried elsewhere with some success.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The most prudent is the latter, but in absence of that being a possibility, the only option left is the former.

       This left/right idea is just a little thing I wanted to point out. On a larger scale, if any restructuring period is to come, it must start on an internal/spiritual level in all people. The most damaging aspect of any two sided facade is how easily most people fall for it. Before any progress can be made we have to show people just how much they have been deceived.

       Stop spending money. Only buy what you need. and PLEASE... stop watching tv. Unplug it. Control what you watch with the internet. Watch RT or Aljazeera for a change and discover how much more relevant their reports are. Just stop watching that mental (tele) vision programming

       Yes, but PBS and CBC are far more independent than RT is. Their funding is much more from donors than the government and they face no repercussions for acting antagonistically towards the administration.

       You kidding? Whats the worst thing our government has done that PBS or CBC report on? George Bush and John Kerry in Skull and Bones? Tim Ruppert asked them both about it and he was murdered two weeks later. American media avoids our administrations real evils and only takes jabs at the stupid shit that gets an emotional response from the viewers. America's biggest weapon is entertainment.

       Sure, but some outlets are more consistently untrustworthy. You might say that the NYT and Breitbart have both misled people at times, but I don't think it's fair to say they're both equally unreliable.

       Let's just say that there's some information that we know to be true and some where we know that isn't and that we also know damn well our own government and the politicians that run it would rather have us believe instead of knowing the actual truth about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having RT go after them and explore that aspect and even provide legitimate evidence to prove that information has been seriously skewed, exaggerated, or is patently dishonest, particularly on important news events and major issues is merely them doing what our own media with plenty of independent players used to do and had to do before it got completely co-opted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia does and continues to do a lot of good in the world that US mainstream media refuses to ever report and even if it does it will only attempt to portray it as having some nefarious or ulterior purposes. We've seen them step in to not simply evacuate some of their own people caught in a tight spot but those from other western countries including the US whose own governments had left them to simply take their chances with a volatile and highly dangerous situation. People like you would probably say they only did that to look good but the fact of the matter is that it raised the level of danger for their own people but they did it anyway and for those who were similarly trapped and despite the fact that they'd get that same kind of a black-eye for it anyway, but not from any of those they actually did it for.
      </p>

       It's rare for Putin to travel anywhere that he doesn't sign a billion dollar co-operative deal for a power station, modern train line, or major infrastructure projects that are as beneficial to the ordinary people all of those countries that he makes those deals with as it is all of his own that they help to keep working and their economy on the move. Being informed about that while our own leaders do nothing but run out and sign free trade agreements that always mean even less employment and lower wages for what's left isn't propaganda, it's simply the bare an bitter truth.

       Online we have interesting fellows like James Corbett who curiously enough from his vantage point in western Japan provides some of the most insightful, incisive, and informative looks into the heart of darkness that lurks in the midst of North American politics and society as you are ever apt to find. The Asia Times is yet another good one because parked between US and Chinese geopolitical ambitions it's essential for all the surrounding and neighboring countries to know and understand exactly what those are and what they mean for them without pulling any punches about it.

       The things I listed are clearly not comprehensive, obviously I didn't list every news outlet out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else worth noting though is that when I reference MSM I am making a distinction between opinion oriented news items and purely factual reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factual reporting, such as things that simple report the events, with interviews, etc., fall under "independent research", though opinion pieces from the same publishing outlet should be given far less attention, falling into the top part of the pyramid.

       Okay, but that's not the problem with OP's logic. He says:

      <blockquote>

        Republicans and Democrats have always been working together to benefit only themselves

      <p>
       If that were the case, how does it possibly make sense that Democrats pushed hard for environmental regulation when they were in power? Corporations hate regulation, but somehow they wanted the Dems to add more regulation? And now Trump is neutering the EPA in response. Clearly there is a difference between the two sides and saying 'they're both the same' is completely contrary to reality.

       I would argue that many of the Democrats who voted for EPA regulations already knew how they were going to profit off of them when they passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Federal regulations seem well-intentioned enough, but in general, they tend to favor established players, or bigger players--who can afford to hire more and better legal/regulatory support staff than can any small business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I argue that the people voting on those things--and the high-level bureaucrats overseeing their implementation--knew from the outset how they could profit off of them.

       Of course, from 2000 until about 2012 pharmaceuticals were pushing for the FDA to have more regulation so that the big players could buy out all the little players, because although they had to spend more money on engineers to do code compliance, the money they saved from not having to do clinical trials for new drugs more than made up for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because the regulations forced a lot of small to medium sized pharmaceutical companies with profitable products to sell to bigger pharmaceuticals, along with all their intellectual property. Things that were worth much more than paying some engineers $140,000/yr.

        If that were the case, how does it possibly make sense that Democrats pushed hard for environmental regulation when they were in power?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because its an emotional appeal to their base.  Despite the fact that these regulations will have no measurable impact on the environment, by their own admission, they are "feel good" measures that transfer more power to government.  Government likes having more power.

       HAHAHAHA.  Big corporations LOVE regulations as regulations can protect them from competition, protect their revenue streams and force people to give them money.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: Dodd-Frank did not harm the large powerful banks at all.  The big banks love Dodd-Frank as it creates a tremendous regulatory burden that only large banks are equipped to handle.

       <p>
        The latest salvo from the President’s Council of Economic Advisers ignores the reality that more than one in five U.S. banks have disappeared—1,708, or more than one every business day—since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Meanwhile, virtually no new banks have been formed, a historically unprecedented lack of investment and startup activity for the industry.

       It's called regulatory capture.  In a truly free market, without regulations, market forces force corporations to compete.  With regulations, government can grant them a number of protections, even if they occasionally need to kowtow.

       You want to cater to the liberally minded University and academic circles and academia in general the best way is to establish governmental bodies that they can aspire to ultimately being employed by and to be recognised as official public authorities and spokesmen for their respective fields of study.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have the power to appoint hand picked political appointees to oversee and set the agenda for all those bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think any of those bodies or agencies were created strictly for the public welfare, think again. Nothing the politicians do is ever done if it doesn't give them more power, political leverage, and influence over public opinion for their own ends and those who financially back them at the end of the day.

       You thinking government is requiring all corporations to follow the regulations? They aren't. Mainly they go after small businesses. Regulations is part of the corporate play to win scenario. Regulations, as they are created now, serve to bolster monopolistic empires. It has nothing to do with Democrats making things safer for the every day American, other than illusion of such.

       I agree with you on the blue-red thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the left-right thing ... while there are vast differences in worldview and ideology between the economic left and the economic right, the best course of action is probably right smack dab in the middle of the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pure communism does not work.  It is known.  But neither does pure
       <em>
        lassiez-faire
       </em>
       conservatism either!  But there is another way.  To use the Buddhist term, there is a Middle Way: the way of
       <em>
        pragmatism
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       A philosophy of economic pragmatism does not rely on ideological models of how the world ought to work, or how various numbers and formulas suggest it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       work, but rather on
       <em>
        observation
       </em>
       .  A pragmatist observes the world and thereby figures out what
       <em>
        does work
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Economic pragmatism, to my knowledge, has not been tried in this country.  And if this is where the old ways have led us ... I dunno, might not be a bad idea to give it a shot.

       I haven't, because I literally heard about it yesterday, and I don't remember some big media push in late 2016 to give Obama credit for it. Why would the massive media machine that has been riding Obama and Michelle's dicks for the last 9 years not take this opportunity to glorify him even more? Is it because it's not what we are being led to believe it is? Hmmmm. We can find out together

       That's some fantastic redirection.  You managed to avoid the entirety of my comment and bring up a completely unrelated piece of legislature that is coincidentally also in the process of being repealed for being complete shit.

       I didn't avoid it at all, you asked "have you actually read the whole document?" As if this means that you can't know what the bill actually does.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to read the entirety of ObamaCare, my example, to know essentially what it does. It isn't redirection at all, it's called an analogy.

       So can we talk about why I'm supposed to freak out about Trump nullifying a regulation and returning us to the same regulatory state we were in for the first 11 months of 2016 and some of 2015 after broadband internet providers were reclassified as Title II common carrier telecommunications? Because that is the reality of this "privacy bill". It's being completely lied about and people are eating it up like they have been doing with all the fake news for months now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not me. I'm not a fucking idiot.

      <p>
       We still have state attorneys general, the Wiretapping Act, and privacy agreements that we signed with our providers.

       Because that regulation was a good thing, and protected privacy. This is them dipping their toes in the water to see how easily they can expand the sale of our privacy, and I'd think you'd rather they not feel comfortable with it. You have to think bigger picture with bills like this, it's never just a simple "oh, they aren't going to take this any farther." Even if you are conservative, you should be open to criticism of your politicians, just like liberals should be critical of theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money in politics is a cancer that is metastasizing, being aware of these issues should never be considered being a "fucking idiot", and the fact that you hold that dismissive of a position on it is indicative of your apathy in regards to the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, note that this isn't Trump alone as you said, this is Republicans in general.

       I think you're getting way ahead of yourself and reading into something that isn't there. You can't just tell me that the regulation was good and protected privacy....that's literally what every media organization had been doing for the last however many months and it was literally all bullshit. Why should I believe them now? I have done my own research and I simply do not agree with your assertions.

       You realize that the regulations that are being nullified were literally our government siding with the Google lobby over all the telecom lobbies? If you actually read the article that I linked you would have read that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...this puts the broadband service providers in competition with edge providers, so the Obama administration followed its standard game plan: side with Google. Asymmetrical regulatory intervention on one (albeit extremely crucial) segment of the internet ecosystem directs this evolution on a less healthy and innovative path by effectively transferring profits from the core to the edge.
       </p>
       <p>
        What a disaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the huge costs that would be imposed by the FCC's new privacy rules (compliance costs, lost investment incentives, etc.), and the minimal (if any) benefit these rules would confer on consumers, common sense dictates that Pai should have the agency immediately stay the privacy rules until it figures this mess out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, a stay should not invoke panic: This country went for two years between the time of the Open Internet Rules and the FCC's privacy rules without incident.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can certainly wait a bit longer to make sure we get the policy right.

       I think you need to go back to r/politics with your ignorant bullshit tactics. Closest thing to a Google shill I've ever seen personally.

       You aren't understanding. When it is nullified we go back to Dec 1st 2016. We will then be at the same regulatory state as we were starting in 2015 when broadband internet providers were reclassified as Title II common carrier telecommunications, which took the FTC out of its regulatory position. Then instead of having the FCC do the same regulations they did what the Obama administration is notorious for doing which is giving Google an unfair advantage over everyone. This is the reality of the FCC final document that's being nullified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one couldn't be happier that it's being nullified.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still have state laws and privacy agreements that we sign with our providers that are legally binding for both sides.

       Left/right is not the false dichotomy. The issue is the two party system is entirely right wing, except for a very rare exceptional few politicians who may sometimes lean centrist like Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats are NEOliberals (VERY right wing, pretending to be left wing just because of a few easy things
like LGBT rights and pro-choice on abortion, give me a break.....)
and Republicans are NEOconservatives (EXTREMELY right wing, pretending to be moderate right wing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal/Conservative and Democrat/Eepublican are the false dichotomies (they're almost the same and you can see this by comparing Obama and Romney's policies in 2012).
The entire establishment is right wing and authoritarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right wing was coined from the French Revolution and it meant on the side of the king (establishment/status quo) while left wing meant on the side of the people/against the king.
Not all leftism is anti-establishment but democratic socialism and social democracy (approx center left) are anti-establishment as they give more opportunities to the working/middle class population without ass kissing the elite all the time like right wing economics does.
It's best to abolish the two party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly all Democrat and Republican politicians CANNOT be trusted.
It's important we campaign for an independent candidate that does not take campaign money from corporations. For example Dr. Jill Stein of the Green party.
But of course independent isn't always trustworthy since Gary Johnson is supposedly an independent and yet is a Koch brothers extremely economically right wing pro-TPP shill.
So be careful but independent is definitely the way to go except the shilly ones, because the two party system has stabbed us in the back way too many times.

       You keep saying "right wing", but I don't think the republicans are right wing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all work for international interests who want the tax payers to fund huge private corporations.  The US is essentially just a company.  We're the human resources.  And they'll bankrupt the company when it's no longer profitable, and take everyone's pension to invest in their next venture.

       That is right wing. Privatization --&gt; corporations profiting from tax funded programs and subsidies.
Republicans are extremely right wing economically, and extremely authoriarian socially.
If a policy benefits the corporations/royalty/bankers/wallstreet/establishment/status quo, then it's right wing. If a policy benefits the working/middle class population, then it's left wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. Deregulating wallstreet is a right wing policy, and Obamacare which is privatized and gives contracts to greedy Big Pharma and insurance companies at the expense of tax payers, that's also right wing DESPITE the fact that national tax funded healthcare is left wing in concept.....but it's the way it's implemented is like a trojan horse.
      </p>
      <p>
       A right wing policy masquarading as left wing/progressive.
But a fully/mostly nationalized healthcare single payer system would be absent of that garbage and just be tax funded without vulture third parties taking a slice of the cake they don't deserve, or at least allow drug prices and things to be much more reasonable and less monopolistic with contracts being bidded to the lowest price bidding companies, sort of like a regulated free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if I've explained well but the republicans are definitely right wing NEOcons and they call any centrist policy as
"loony left" "unrealistic" "pie in the sky" "communist" and so on without objective reasoning. :/
The Republicans are bought and paid for by oligarchs which thrive under right wing policies while working/middle class
people suffer significant to extreme right wing policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know politicians are absolutely compromized when they won't even touch centrist let alone center left (which IMO is optimum if it has the right balance of socialism to capitalism).

       Right.  But democrats are authoritarian socially, too.  And that isn't part of the right/left spectrum, but you're supposed to think that personal freedom minded people are just further apart on that spectrum and that the authoritarians are just "more centrist".
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYONE- both right and left in our government (save for a small number), wants to take take tax money and use it to fund private corporations.  The democrats pass it under the guise of a social program, and then the republicans keep it and privatize it- that's the whole game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare is a "left wing" SOCIAL PROGRAM, but ultimately it will be "privatized".  Both parties want to privatize education (charter schools/ "school choice"/ vouchers) while funding it with tax dollars.  The next time you see a "new deal" it will be paid for by the people and lauded as a jobs recovery act, but the infrastructure will all be sold off to the most connected bidders, and the citizens will continue to pay to use the services (see privatized roads/ bridges/ trains etc. We will subsidize grid upgrades for electricity and then all the utilities are going to be privatized under deregulation.  This will also be true for water/ infrastructure.  In fact- we'll probably even subsidization of a whole new fleet of autonomous vehicles in the next ten years- that will all be paid for with tax dollars and debt, and most people probably won't even be able to own a car anymore.  The property will be owned by the corporation or banks- and you'll pay a usage or leasing fee.  Soon everything will be carshare.  You'll pay for it through tax and through usage fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican vs democrat is false.  They play two supposedly opposed roles all committed to the same goal.  And it doesn't matter if production is owned by the state or the corporation, because the state is owned by the corporation.

       Yep, the false dichotomy
       <strong>
        isn't
       </strong>
       left/right, it's democrat/republican (with very few exceptions, I don't even trust Ron/Rand Paul's economics but for the most part I trust Bernie when he isn't compromized by the murderous DNC) and liberal/conservative is also a false dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least in my experience anyway, liberal is a useless word because it doesn't seem to pinpoint anywhere on the spectrum. If someone says they're a liberal, I have no idea where they are on the spectrum. 
 Seems more useful as an adjective but it's been muddied so much with NEOliberals that I'd rather just describe policies as left center, centrist, right center, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal/conservative are vague at best, deceptive at worst. And in terms of the corporate media reality TV show of "hippie drug addict feminist liberals VS uneducated religious gun nut conservatives" stereotypes, you're either THIS TYPE OF SHEEP or THAT TYPE OF SHEEP. It's super dishonest. Especially when people behave as if you're either a democrat or republican when both groups suck. PEPSI OR COCA COLA, why not water? :/

       You're wrong there. The people in Congress do care about getting reelected specially the Republicans in the House because they're afraid of getting primaried. The only people they care about are ofcourse their constituents, they don't give a fuck if ISPs sell our data.

       You can 100% bet there are many Dems that are in the pocket of ISP's but voted along party lines because they knew their vote didnt matter and its best to show unity in order to further the illusion.

       Agree 100%. It is not just about the politicians but also the policies. Each policy should be considered by itself regardless of red team or blue team. Why is it that if we support policy A it immediately means we support policy B just because they are both on the red team? Voting on people to represent us needs to end. We have advanced so far in this world yet we still use the same political systems, same schooling systems, same court systems, basically anything that involves controlling the people has not changed for centuries. Why?

       Completely agree. Neither Democrats or Republicans are working to benefit the interests of American citizens (besides their wealthy donors). We need to elect honest, accountable, politicians and we need to end FPTP. I recently created a new sub called

       Saying "the two parties are the same" is the most common sentiment - AND it's the basic strategy of the "establishment."
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that the two parties are just placeholders - instead of wasting time on a third party, which can't win due to the nature of first past the post voting, you take over one of the existing parties via a coalition.

       There is a definite divide between nationalists and globalists....It sounds nice and fuzzy to say that "we are all in the same fight" but in reality people have a sharp disagreement on these things. Either you think a nation has the right to have in-group preference for its own citizens, or you do not, and there is not a ton of common ground there.

       It's no coincidence that the power is always shifting back and forth between the Republicans and Democrats equally to appease the masses on either side. Also notice how the votes are almost always close to half and half. They have us completely divided, or another explanation is that we simply did this to ourselves, and there was no grand design by shadowy figures in some dark, nefarious room in a far awa compound.

       I just disagree that it's intentional. There aren't reptilians in disguise planning all these. They are common folk who got drawn by power and have become part of the problem and now work towards their own goals, as it has been done for centuries with power and control in every society.

       The two party system represents an illusion of choice.  While each party may have their pet projects, none of them involve your best interests because you do not spend billions lobbying our representatives.  Even if a particular piece of legislation comes down the pike which initially seems to benefit the people (i.e.: Obamacare), it will be so thoroughly skewed in the favor of powerful special interests that it will create a situation the vast majority were better off without it being passed at all.

       "The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty
      </p>
      <p>
       Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the Government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in Governments of a Monarchical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in Governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And, there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume."

       People are justifiably outraged because a reasonable regulation that was set in motion to protect our privacy is being undone. Stop trying to spin this as nothing. It was an opportunity for some progress (even if it wasn't everything).

       Have you read the entire ObamaCare document? By your logic, you can't possibly have an opinion (positive or negative) on it unless you've read the whole thing!

       You kidding? Whats the worst thing our government has done that PBS or CBC report on? George Bush and John Kerry in Skull and Bones? Tim Ruppert asked them both about it and he was murdered two weeks later. American media avoids our administrations real evils and only takes jabs at the stupid shit that gets an emotional response from the viewers. America's biggest weapon is entertainment.
