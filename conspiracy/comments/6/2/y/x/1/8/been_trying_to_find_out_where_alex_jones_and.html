       I don't know anything about that event, but I think Alex Jones got his start covering/protesting the Waco siege. There are videos of a much skinnier Jones holding a mic &amp; screaming about something or other outside the compound.

       If you go down this rabbit hole you won't be a Trump supporter for much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex's most significant ancestor is a guy named
       <a href="http://grandlodgeoftexas.org/texas_history_committee/anson-jones-first-grand-master/">
        Anson Jones
       </a>
       , the first head of Texas freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can immediately tell that (Anson) Jones is a subversive anti-American, because his ascendency in freemasonry is in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason">
        post-Captain Morgan
       </a>
       ) era after the subterfuge of English loyalists went mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we need to rewind a little bit for some deeper context.  In 1810, states began to pass the
       <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/7/10/356123/-">
        original 13th amendment
       </a>
       .  By the spring of 1812, 10 of the necessary 12 states had adopted this amendment and war commenced with England in the summer of 1812.  New Hampshire adopted the 13th in December of this year, but no further states acted until after the war.  In 1818, Virginia adopted the 13th amendment and therefore brought into effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The text is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive or retain, any title of nobility or honour, or shall, without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this amendment actually stripped all lawyers at the time of US citizenship (they were registered to the bar established by England still), but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  It strips freemasons of citizenship as well, so Jones' ancestors are not just anti-American subversives, they are not even American at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because freemasonry was effectively outlawed (citizenship stripped) you see the emergence of a lot of pseudo-masonic organizations like the Mormon church which were created by freemasons in the Golden Circle (with famous degenerates like Albert Pike as members and responsible for stirring up the Civil War after the attempts at western secession by Mormonism in 1857 were put down).  All of this ties back into the Morgan affair, with the anti-Masonic party challenging Andrew Jackson for the presidency and Jackson having been involved in his own secession attempts in Louisiana for which Aaron Burr took the blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's fast forward a bit to get to the point of the thread.  In 1947 the church of scientology is created.  Mormonism is often referred to as "scientology lite" and scientology is just "freemasonry lite."  Masons made a big stink back when Mormonism was created about it "stealing" the rites of masonry, but this was just thinly veiled advertising of Mormonism because the religion was created and financed by freemasons, same as scientology.
      </p>
      <p>
       L Ron Hubbard actually coined the term "prison planet," Alex Jones' original website.  Then the name "infowars" comes from the CIA's Mockingbird / MK Ultra programs, Michael Aquino's "MINDWAR" book.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Norman Peale (Trump's pastor, freemason) are the public heads of Freezone scientology.  Trump's only 9/11 charity donation is to a scientology charity co-founded by Tom Cruise.  There are a lot of weirdos surrounding Trump along these lines like Paula White.  The most exoteric form of what they practice is something like Oprah's "positive thinking" stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as funding for Jones/Trump goes, ultimately all of this is CIA connected, but to give you a name for the rabbit hole: Khashoggi.  Khashoggi names almost all of his front operations "Genesis XXX," i.e. Genesis Communications Radio.  Trump has deep business ties to Khashoggi as well, even bought Khashoggi's yacht from him, but it goes so much further.  The people who carried out 9/11 are all tied into this mess as well, like Trump's deep ties to Mogilevich and the Bogatins.  The "punished Trump" meme is more like "Trump punishing," that is, he is among the major operators in the 9/11 tragedy rather than opposed to it.

       I see people post far more unsubstantiated nonsense than this on an hourly basis here and others accept it hook, line and sinker.  Most of us believe presidents are selected, but nobody wants to make these connections for trump, unless it is "muh russia" or islamaphobe" - at least this guy is providing some links, using dates and names, specifics, and making some logical connections

       It is completely made up. There is no missing 13th Amendment. It was a proposed Amendment. It stripped no one of anything because it was never ratified. Hence not an amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it had passed it would not have stripped lawyers of anything. That misconception is based on silly people thinking Esquire is a title of nobility. It's not. Note that he didn't even get the misconception right. Instead, he said it was because lawyers were still registered in England. Which first, wouldn't have stripped citizenship, and second, isn't even true. 1818 - 1776 =  52 years. Any lawyer in 1776, at say 20 years old, would have been at least 72 years old by that time. It similarly would have no effect on a Freemason.

       Your whole argument is smart sounding, but flawed, I believe - CS404 provided an article source in the post regarding the amendment, and in that article there is actually a verifiable link to the date, location where you can verify the document for yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you want to verify this document, go here: 
Maine State Archives 
State Capitol - Station 84

       "
      </p>
      <p>
       So you should probably address this first.

       Dude, I don't know why you're lecturing me on what I should and shouldn't address. You see some phone number and think that's proof enough that you do absolutely zero research. It would have taken you a whopping 5 seconds to find this:

       His source seems to address the '13 required ratifications' mentioned in that wikipedia that you linked me to, if you read further down - so it seems like there is more to it than that.  And I think the whole esquire deal is a matter of interpretation.  You seem to be acting more condescending to me than I am to you, all I asked was you take a closer look at CS404's sourcing

       You should reply directly to CS404 with your points - I didn't make the initial assertion, I only found it intriguing.  I would love to see you two debate the topic - you both seem learned - I appreciate your insight, really I do

       Doesn't the fact that you had to put truther in quotations give it away?  He baited you a little.  Why didn't he declassify the truth day one and make himself a national hero overnight if he was a truther?  Because, at best, it is a fall back plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, did you know Trump's buddy Khashoggi is the guy behind the financing of the 9/11 patsies?  Trump doesn't need to "fight the deep state" to find out who did 9/11 because he already knows who: his buddies!

       Wow I've read a lot about L Ron Hubbard and Scientology but would never considered it close to Mormonism in any way shape of form (not even lite) nor would I consider it close to Freemasonry (not even lite). L Ron Hubbard was a science fiction writer so prison planet would make sense. Scientology has nothing to do with God and everything to do about scamming people out of money. You just linked to "prison planet" which isn't trademarked and can be used in many different ways  if you put a little though into it. I'm gunna have to call source on all your info sorry.

       I don't think that was hiss first conspiracy but it's pretty important that people have that information. It was about the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization where violent protesters were paaid and protected to cause daamage and be violent in order for police to use that behavior to target and brutalize the  peaceful protesters the following days. This is the use of Agent Provocateurs, the ones we're speaking of here were paid in free rent and police protection but the point is that they were paid to blacken the names of the legitimate protesters .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a common practice that has worked to the point where all protesters are now considered violent.

       I just remember seeing him on this local Austin channel where people could sign up and do their own show.  Right after 9/11. I had been laid off when my company moved the call centers to India and stuck at home, bored with a few cable channels that were free with apartment rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember being shocked at this crazy ranting about Bush lol.  But it started to make sense.  I couldn't watch him much he was too stressful but some other Austin people did shows on there and one had also discussed some health and nutrition things I had just discovered because of my dog breeder mentor.  Namely the lies of the lipid hypothesis (satueated fats clog arteries so eat margerine etc).  That guy woke me and I started reading books he mentioned the Unseen Hand etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am not sure if I'd have paid attention if Jones's strange behavior hadn't shocked me enough to wake from the post 9/11 malais and stupor just a bit.
