        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This needs to be said.</p>

<p>Edit: to all those who think I am still a Trump supporter, just so you all know, I WAS a Trump supporter, but have become extremely disillusioned with him and his administration. I plead to other Trump supporters to open your eyes and mind about him, being a little more skeptical about who he is, and his actions. I have learned he is a CONMAN, and he is no different from previous presidents before him, including Obama, Bush, and Clinton, PROBABLY worse.</p>

<p>We must stand up to him. We must not blindly obey him just because he said he was going to drain the swamp and you think he&#39;s playing 420D backgammon Chinese checkers. It&#39;s all bullshit, he&#39;s full of bullshit, and you all need to OPEN your eyes.</p>

<p>This is r/conspiracy for fuck&#39;s sake, NOT r/the_scumbag, or any other biased subreddit.</p>

<p>Be skeptical of ALL authority.</p>

<p>Edit2: I never voted for Trump. I stopped supporting him before election day. I bought into his bullshit during the beginning of his campaign when he was promising to drain the swamp, but I eventually realized how much we&#39;ve been played and DUPED by this fuckwad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a justified case of American exceptionalism.  We&#39;ve <em>done</em> the successful revolt for liberty thing before.  Our culture is different from most cultures due to its advanced individualism, and that makes all the difference when it comes to determining whether a revolution goes full circle.  It isn&#39;t enough to be a warlord in an individualistic society.  Individualism thus agitates against revolution, but makes it more efficacious as a means of change if the necessary threshold is reached.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, you&#39;ve overstated my case.  I didn&#39;t say it <em>only</em> applies in the US, merely that the USA has a valid claim to specialty.  I&#39;d name Switzerland as another nation that could have a successful revolt for the same reasons.  It&#39;s just not as likely.  Switzerland doesn&#39;t have the same problem with persistent government overreach.</p>

<p>Revolutions, the kind you&#39;re talking about, don&#39;t happen because of internet privacy, they happen when there&#39;s no food on your table and half your family and friends are locked up or killed by the government, or when someone with power manipulates the poor into joining their fight to take down those who currently have power. </p>

<p>When automation takes over I believe you&#39;ll see the military and military police forces expanded drastically, even private forces possibly. It provides work for a certain percent of the population while making sure the other part of the population who are poor and desperate are kept in line.

<p>It&#39;s clear you know nothing about history because that&#39;s exactly the way civil wars progress once they escalate. At first it&#39;d maybe be just &quot;regular&quot; armed conflict, guns vs guns. Do you think the military would just keep their soldiers unsafe because magic or something? Once casualties start increasing you don&#39;t think they&#39;ll use armored vehicles?</p>

<p>I&#39;m Spanish so I know a thing or two about whether a government would be willing to bomb their own population or not. You don&#39;t have to go back in time, though, look at Syria, look at Ukraine (not bombing but shelling separatists with artillery surely counts), look at Egypt (not bombs but tanks). You don&#39;t know shit about history if you think a government would care about material damage in such a situation.</p>

<p>Alright, this tells more about your general mindset than anything you could possibly say.</p>

<p>Again, look at Spain, look at Greece, look at the Balkans, look at Portugal and their Carnation Revolution (which thankfully backfired on the government - this is a point for both of us), there&#39;s plenty of examples with different cultural backgrounds.

    <div class="md"><p>if you&#39;re talking about the payment of senators sarcastically (and I think you are?) as the &quot;one time payment,&quot; no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a blip. But I&#39;m saying these companies are fucking enormous and I sincerely don&#39;t think the executives and lobbyists are the ones selling the data. We don&#39;t know yet, but I doubt it. My congressman isn&#39;t high profile in media, nor does he take a ton of money from Telcoms comparatively to say, McConnell. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t mistake my analysis for naivete, I&#39;m just saying we don&#39;t know how data will be sold and I doubt executives personally will know everything my dude </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your ISP has been doing this for as long as advertising networks have been trying to buy the information. If I recall, the 1984 cable act is what added the personal identification protections, hence why your data is anonymous coming from someone selling an analytics package.</p>

<p>You guys seriously don&#39;t even know how the laws work, or what regulations are in place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a LOT of Americans don&#39;t know that.  And yes, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that a lot of conservative Americans are in that group.  The number of times I hear about people who don&#39;t know where babies come from are either those under 18 or adults (sometimes married) who never learned basic reproductive science.</p>

<p>There are an astounding number of people in the country who don&#39;t know how their own genitals work, let alone those of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>This is why people get pregnant at age 16 and men can&#39;t find a clitoris. These are not people who will give you objective facts. And even if YOUR parents and friends will, you can&#39;t rely on other people&#39;s families to give THEM good information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not the guy to ask but I&#39;d guess it was because of the mutualism between the peasants and knights. The peasants gave them food and they repaid by protecting the peasants&#39; land. The nobles were the highly educated people and so I guess people looked to them for answers to problems. Farmers sold food and paid taxes, taxes were used by the king to hire knights and knights fought for power. </p>

<p>In today&#39;s society, an engineer generates more money for society than a farmer, through taxes. You need a degree to become something like an engineer and thus, education is needed to improve the economy. Well, on paper at least. A person without a degree may in some cases be better fit for a job than a person with a degree, but filtered out simply because the lack of a degree. Thanks to the internet, we can gain and share knowledge easier than ever and there is therefore much less need for school when aiming for certain careers. Also, an educated but stressed person might perform worse than a not-so educated but calm person.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Anybody could be a farmer, which were the jobs that paid a lot back then. Today, you need a degree to get a decent-paying job, as work tasks have become way more complicated.</p>

<p>I say &quot;safe space&quot; because they ban people who have unacceptable opinions and refuse to admit they&#39;re a safe space because that&#39;s something they accuse every other subreddit of being. </p>

<p>An &quot;echo chamber&quot; or circle jerk isn&#39;t always a safe space because being downvoted heavily by a circle jerk is much different than being banned by the moderators in addition to that. The cult members know the difference they just choose to conflate it so they don&#39;t have to admit they&#39;re the biggest safe space of all. All they do is either deflect about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or come up with a euphemism for safe space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually started using my alt account to attack the people in the no no sub who question anything, even in the slightest.<br/>
The top comment earlier this week in a post about the failed healthcare bill was from a guy (his post history showed he was an obvious red hat) who said something like- &quot;I&#39;m as loyal a pede as there is, but come on, Trump was pushing this bill and it failed. No big deal, but be honest about it.&quot;</p>

<p>I laid into him using all their typical &quot;cuck&quot; talk. Told him he wasn&#39;t a true pede, and was obviously a paid shrill. Others joined in, and now his comment has been purged by the mods, and I&#39;m assuming (based on my experience) that he is now serving a week long ban.</p>

<p>My thoughts:  This is how they will implode. They&#39;ll split from within...I just want to make it so so when the average supporter in that shit hole eventually questions something, he gets harassed and banned for a week. Maybe it will opentheir eyes to experience what it&#39;s like for the toxicity of that circlejerk to be focused on them for logically evaluating something (and also how they protect their safe space)....</p>

<p>and now I&#39;m excited, because it sounds like if he signs this bill I&#39;ll have a chance to get back into character on my alt acct, and lambast some motherfuckers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Trump can still act against the bill, so probably that&#39;s why they still can have some discussion. But we all already know how things go over there, it&#39;s a sub for supporting him blindly. 
I hope that I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure that he won&#39;t do shit to protect internet privacy, and then t_d users will go for a narrative that justifies it, like it&#39;s GOP&#39;s fault, it&#39;s Obama&#39;s fault, the bill isn&#39;t really bad, he&#39;s playing 7D chess, or whatever, we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>impossible.  you see t_d is sorta like north korea, if you criticize great leader or speak against the OFFICIAL PARTY TRUTH you will be immediately banned and deleted.</p>

<p>so obviously you won&#39;t see any criticism for him not vetoing it there, once he inevitably doesn&#39;t veto it.  only in forums that care about facts and the truth can be debated openly without first checking in with the party masters for the acceptable narratives of the day would you see such criticism.  Never in the donald, or if you do you can go back five minutes later and see how its been swept into the memory hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>citation needed.  or to put it another way, i think that is a lie.  </p>

<p>also i&#39;d like to quote another user here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is usually what Trump supporters resort to. Whatboutism that paradoxically insists the thing he&#39;s been accused of is fine, whilst also insisting that you need to focus on this other person that did(n&#39;t) do something sorta like what Trump did because they&#39;re worse.</p>

<p>The Russian connections are the most frequent, but they&#39;ll do it with Trump&#39;s ignoring of Saudi Arabia on the terror list and Clinton&#39;s supposed ties to the Saudis. And they&#39;ll do it with his &quot;kill the familise of terrorists&quot; whilst also saying everyone want&#39;s us to go to war with Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I ran into him backstage at a concert at my college in OH. He wasn&#39;t really famous yet...this was post-Half-Baked but pre-Chappelle-Show so I knew him but saw that he was sitting alone. I had just crowd surfed and hugged De La Soul, so I was pretty happy to suddenly see Dave Chappelle, too. He immediately noticed I was very high. I was hapy to point out the same qualities in him. We hugged for a moment. Then people started taking pictures and we parted ways. Two high souls in the night.</p>

<p>Chapelle is a great human being. I have a lot of respect for him as a comedian (amateur comedian here) and as a person who stands up to the system and speaks truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh. Idk.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s hypocritical of them, because people who are heavy trump supporters often go to to other subreddits where they disagree with others, which is fine - to each their own with their opinions. But it bugs me how I often hear that t_d is good with freespeech when you get permabanned as soon as you disagree with something. </p>

<p>At times I&#39;ve agreed with them in there because I think it&#39;s been stupid how violent some people have been with trump supporters.</p>

<p>Sure, I disagree heavily with trump and think they&#39;ve done some.. Interesting things to say the least, but violence and the like isn&#39;t good no matter what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporter here. </p>

<p>I always express my complaints and concerns with Trump. </p>

<p>When he was mentioning giving the feds control over marijuana again (which is against what he said while running), I voiced that it should be a state right and that what he said saddened me and made me lose a some of my respect for him. </p>

<p>I had many people comment and ask why I support Trump, tell me that they too felt the same way, others telling me that the states will probably vote against that and not to worry. Overall a healthy and fair discussion about my thoughts and concerns, and I was even able to get a few others to see Trump in a different light when they previously vilified him. You don&#39;t have to like the guy, but we should all be working together to shape him into a good president.</p>

<p>But in those comments, I had many people telling me I &quot;deserved that&quot;, &quot;thats what I get for being a racist&quot; (lol, wut?), and even got many pms slandering and threatening me. &quot;Oh, you post in (insert one of my most used subs), no wonder you&#39;re a stupid fuck.&quot; Many people even went through my post history to spam some of my comments telling me to kill myself.</p>

<p>I took all that with a grain of salt, albeit I was disappointed in people, but I can see now why many people dont dare voice their opinions (wether positive or critical) on Trump outside of their respected subs. </p>

<p>I will gladly voice my disappointment and anger if he lets this bill pass, as I&#39;ve done before. But dont expect many people to, due to the possible backlash and hate. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>He promised Mexico would pay for the wall; Trump was too cowardly to actually see that through (or even bring it up) and it&#39;s now American charities who are paying for it</p></li>
<li><p>His Muslim ban was overturned, not because of politics but because of legality and the constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. was never in the TPP; they were negotiating its terms but got to the point where both Hillary <em>and</em> Trump were running against it</p></li>
<li><p>He promised to spend less time golfing and vacationing than Obama (he hasn&#39;t; he&#39;s actually setting a record for most vacations)</p></li>
<li><p>He promised he had a great Healthcare replacement plan to keep everyone insured (he didn&#39;t; he left it to the GOP and then yelled at them for fucking it up)</p></li>
<li><p>He promised he&#39;d prosecute Hillary (he didn&#39;t)</p></li>
<li><p>He promised he&#39;d hire experts and the &quot;best people&quot; for each department (he didn&#39;t)</p></li>
<li><p>He promised to appoint a commission to investigate voter fraud as soon as he became president (he didn&#39;t)</p></li>
<li><p>He promised to reveal his secret plan for defeating ISIS when elected (he didn&#39;t; post election he ordered the Pentagon instead, to present a plan in 30 days - they presented exactly what Obama has been doing and the Trump administration has been quiet ever since).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t go through them all, on mobile, but after a quick skimming...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Signed the executive order to begin the building of the wall on the Mexican border</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then proposed a budget to pay for it with US tax payer money. Even if his supporters say they&#39;ll pay for it later, I&#39;ve never seen Trump himself clearly explain this, and I don&#39;t trust any politician. Until I see it in writing, I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An order stating that when an agency adds a regulation, they must abolish two others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why exactly is this a good thing? I understand the attraction in theory. Everyone likes to say there are too many federal regulations, but what does this measure do to get rid of those that are actually bad, instead of those that are merely hindering corporate profits (e.g. dumping coal ash in rivers)? If you want to remove some regulations, remove those regulations. This broad measure is just lip service to the &quot;don&#39;t tread on me&quot; crowd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Temporary suspension on immigration from countries known to be heavily inhabited by Muslim extremist groups. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A. The heavily inhabited by Muslim extremist groups is a point of contention. Also, even if that was the goal, he missed a lot.</p>

<p>B. This is a success for him now? Pretty sure the courts have been killing him on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hiring thousands more Border Patrol agents</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, why is this a good thing? Obama deported more illegal immigrants back to Mexico than any president ever. Less than 1/3 of illegals actually come here across the border (most are from overstayed visas). It&#39;s very clear that immigration is an important issue, but what problems is he actually solving by dumping massive resources into plans that may or may not be solved by these measures?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>US will withdraw from the TPP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen. Something we can all agree on.</p>

<ul>
<li>The unauthorized resident population was about a million lower in 2013 than in 2007.</li>
<li>The “Great Recession” was not the principal cause of population decline. </li>
<li>Annual arrivals into the unauthorized population increased to more than one million in 2000, then began to drop steadily, and have now reached their lowest levels since the early 1980s.</li>
<li>From 2000 to 2012, arrivals from Mexico fell by about 80 percent. </li>
<li>Between 2010 and 2013, the total unauthorized population from Mexico declined by eight percent. </li>
<li>In 2006, the number of arrivals from Mexico fell below the total number of arrivals from all other countries (combined) for the first time.</li>
<li><strong>The number who stayed beyond the period authorized by their temporary visas (overstays) exceeded the number who entered across the southern land border without inspection (EWIs) in each year from 2008 to 2012.</strong></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>On the wall- many illegal immigrants still sneak over the border illegally. Sure, not as many as there were in 2005, when it was nearly 800,000 a year. As of 2015 that number was down to close to 200,000. Which is still too big a number. </p>

<p>On the Muslim ban- how is it unconstitutional when the people living in the seven countries mentioned (which are in fact inhabited by many extremist groups and even in the middle of war) are not even US residents or citizens? It is not just Muslims not allowed to come from those countries. It is everyone in the country as a whole. Muslims can still come from countless other countries. Just not the seven mention due to those countries being way too unstable and dangerous. </p>

<p>They legally can&#39;t do that,  and even if they could they wouldn&#39;t dare piss off the parts of this country that are subsidizing trashistan. All those cities give more to the fed than they get.
Furthermore sanctuary cities exist so illegal immigrants aren&#39;t too scared to testify when the state needs them.</p>

<p>The thing about seemingly all of these rules is that like most conservative thinking - they want things that don&#39;t work to work. </p>

<p>Just build a wall, stop brown people, get tough on drugs, make it so businesses can make more money while the citizens get less protection. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just an old tired way of thinking that seems to make sense but decades of experience has shown us doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Modern problems today require solutions that are counter intuitive. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the thing that in my opinion the Conservative mind accept. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like these Southern states that ban sex education and promote abstinence only - then a few years later they end up with the highest teen pregnancy rates and high welfare bills. </p>

<p>Just banning and smashing and stopping doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>But the real tragedy is we already knew that&#39;s how it worked. </p>

<p>But then a new generation of assholes comes along - reads the Bible, doesn&#39;t real anything else and then that want to ban sex education again and the cycle continues. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why there&#39;s so much hate for Trump and the republicans. Because they keep letting people who don&#39;t understand history and politics govern. </p>

<p>It&#39;s far too late now but the entire reason that CEOs and the 1% were able to consolidate the amount of wealth and power they have is <em>because</em> of immigration and the ensuing balkanization. Humans are innately tribal. We function in homogeneous groups and we hold leaders accountable. When we are mixed with other tribes, we start voting stupidly and defensively. </p>

<p>The USA started its dowhill trajectory as soon as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a> was passed, as this effectively opened the flood gates. </p>

<p>So, for those who hope to regain what the nation stood for and regain a sense of community and honor, any hope at all is to get a wall in place and a strong effort to remove people who are not of us. Hopefully this explains the less overt reason that immigration is a force of destruction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a vocal Trump-nonsupporter, I think my my lefty friends and I are being brainwashed by the media - not the real media like the NYT, let&#39;s call it the &quot;alt-left media&quot; of disappointing Jon Stewart spinoffs and terrible blogs e.g, Occupy Democrats and Truthout - to be unnecessarily divisive. I&#39;ve fallen for it too, and I&#39;m a freaking Southerner and some of my dearest friends and relatives voted for Trump with good intentions. AND I&#39;m a tin foil hatter. So if I can be tricked into calling people racists and rednecks, when I know full well it&#39;s not true, imagine the typical San Francisco bubble dweller who doesn&#39;t even know any rural Southerners. It&#39;s too easy. Smart people are easier marks than average ones sometimes. </p>

<p>Anyway, good on you for keeping your own reaction to disappointment. But if someone or something is trying to tear apart the USA (&quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot; is more than just a catchphrase, it&#39;s an eternal truth), this isn&#39;t an accident. It&#39;s psyops. And it&#39;s working.</p>

<p>I hope we can all figure out how to rise above it, and accept that people on both sides can be fooled into acting foolish. And call it a human weakness to be forgiven and overcome rather than personal failings to be avenged and punished. Otherwise, whoever is doing this will win. </p>

<p>The minute that ANYONE does anything to put the American people in jeopardy, I will turn on them instantly. I get why people don&#39;t like Trump. Hell, I know he isn&#39;t the best president we&#39;ve had like many die hard supporters say. But in my honest opinion, he was the only choice for me in this election and he has done much good while in office. I hope to see independent business owners thrive, and America to be about America only again. I will completely dump Trump if he passes this bill because this goes against America.</p>

<p>But at the end of day, the president isn&#39;t who makes the choices. We are. And we all need to work together to fight for what we all want and for what we think is for the best. </p>

<p>Many people will downvote me because they disagree, but will never give reasons why. That saddens me because Im open minded and love to peacefully discuss politics, and have been swayed to new view points before. Its important for us all to stop labelling each other, and think together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, greenlemon23, but my point is that lots of us are being brainwashed into being mean to each other. Trump&#39;s the President, he&#39;s not even 100 days in, and while I disagree with most of everything he&#39;s doing, I get why people still want to stand behind him. And I feel like I was almost tricked into calling my own friends and family rednecks and racists on Facebook of all places. I got all spun up reading left-wing blogs and started talking shit. Wish I could take it back. Not the marches, not the protests, not the calm, reasoned arguments against his policies - I stand behind all that even though I know it upset and angered my friends. But the name calling. Even if they called me a snowflake or a libtard or whatever. But if we can forgive each other, that goes a long way (well, a way) toward standing up to whatever forces seek to divide us. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a subset of corporate interests trying to create a neo-feudal society, and so they&#39;re breaking down the middle class and democratic republics into bite-sized, easily digestible chunks.

<p>Very unskilled low level work. </p>

<p>Maybe the American people should think about using their position as an advanced nation and do more high end jobs, in the year technology sectors, rather than being forced time and time again to compete with cheap foreign labour. </p>

<p>I mean, cheap foreign labour exists no matter how you look at it... Capitalist countries will find a way to utilise it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real reason we lack jobs is because all the easy jobs for the masses were automated long ago and only tradition and refusal to change has left them in place for as long as they have been.</p>

<p>The economy has shifted and while there are enough things to do for everyone, those &quot;things to do&quot; largely aren&#39;t about survival anymore (ie: food, shelter, and heat; ie: agriculture, construction, and energy). The economy has been based on need, and most jobs similarly based on need, for a long time. Most of those jobs are gone forever. The want-based economy has been growing for a long while, but we don&#39;t know how to structure that yet.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m for UBI to take care of needs, so that &quot;wants&quot; have room to grow unimpeded.</p>

<p>Pretty much everyone I regularly socialise with has a job that didn&#39;t exist twenty odd years ago </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this.</p>

<p>And I would add that the Trump era is a direct and logical result of the modern Right, which uses fear, division, and misinformation to push an agenda that benefits the wealthy and turns the nation backwards economically, socially, culturally, and educationally. It is not just Trump but the entire Republican Party that is ruining this country.</p>

<p>This is important to remember, because what&#39;s going to happen next is republicans are going to try to distance themselves from the Trumpster fire, and act like they are the better, sane choice. Don&#39;t forget that midterms are right around the corner. They are counting on the short memories and lack of attention of their voting base.</p>

<p>If you look at Donald Trump and see a competent leader, you&#39;re a racist and an alpha-male-icon worshipping sexist.</p>

<p>Prejudice isn&#39;t just negative, where you see other people as bad.  It&#39;s also got a delusional construction aspect, where you see people as being things that they are not, because your head is so full of false projections of their superiority, ideals and abilities.  Trump clearly possesses none of those, and anyone who saw/sees him as remotely fit for office of president, is clearly projecting prejudicially favorable fictions out of their imaginations onto him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but my point is the president does have a say and can play a big role in what&#39;s put in front of them. Trump is just incompetent and knows absolutely nothing. He has no idea what he is doing. The ACA is better than before but it still sucks and trump has done nothing to replace it or come up with a replacement. He just hung Ryan out to dry(deservingly) and seems to have no intention on making actual pocily just cutting taxes and programs that make him more money </p>

Americans don&#39;t think so because the rest of the world is catching up to us because we grew complacent. We stopped investing in anything long term and became short sighted. Anything that didn&#39;t give us immediate satisfaction or results, we ignored. Other nations didn&#39;t succumb to this and now they are catching up to us. But to Americans, it looks like we are deteriorating when a better description would be that we are stagnant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Of our own doing&#39;</p>

<p>Cause and react. 8 years of ultra-liberalism and social justice has gotten us to today.. Social Disaster will most certainly involve the Left and their tolerance against conservatives and their stubbornness.</p>

<p>Economic. What do you think happens when you borrow an insane amount of money and double the debt in only 8 years?</p>

<p>The US military still reigns most powerful and you see why they spend so much of our GDP on military spending to keep it that way. Unless we as Americans think it would be another great idea to let China and Russia lead militarily as well. It would save us enough money to pay for more welfare and maybe another intelligence agency to staff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize you are part of the problem right? We don&#39;t have ultra liberalism. Obama and the Democratic leadership are moderates. If they were &quot;ultra liberals&quot;, we wouldn&#39;t have the ACA, we&#39;d have single payer. When it comes to gay marriage and similar issues, that was the simply Democrats saying people should stay out of other people&#39;s business, which is something I figured all Republicans could get behind. Also, it was the Supreme Court that approved that.</p>

<p>As for economic issues, keep acting like the debt wasn&#39;t a thing before or since Obama. The money he spent helped us create jobs and dig us out of a deep recession. The private sector sure wasn&#39;t going to.</p>

<p>We spend more on defense than Russia, China, UK, France, Germany, India and Saudi Arabia combined. I&#39;m not worried one bit by them surpassing us militarily. China is more concerned about surpassing us technologically and economically and Russia is focusing on espionage and cyber warfare. Congress keeps buying tanks though, because they will save us.</p>

<p>Trump was conceivably putting Paul Ryan in his place and showing him that we need to listen to the American public and Conservatives to get things done in the future. Polished politician? Not even close and still learning obviously.. but setting up the pieces for legislative processes down the road. </p>

<p>Why do you think it took 17 days from start to finish? Obamacare took like 100.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably because Donald thought he could strong-arm the party into voting for the bill without ever addressing the problems because he&#39;s not overly concerned with the details of his own bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ryan Care is now dead or in a better place for compromise.. it was a terrible Health Care plan and whoever came up with the Language to it is now on the chopping block.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, Donald and Ryan should suffer some consequence for crafting such a terrible bill. </p>

<p>Oh no don&#39;t upset all the weak minded with your strong minded catchphrase!</p>

It was already being sold.</p>

<p>taking away health care for millions.
Obamacare is still here for now, calm down.</p>

<p>defunding the EPA. Overburdensome 
Government is too big. Cuts need to be made and will make companies more profitable. </p>

<p>hindering climate change research.
Maybe. But so was Obama because nobody was researching the real answers that need to be addressed. Convince Americans to care</p>

<p>giving tax breaks to the ultra-rich and stocking your cabinet with Goldman Sachs.
Conservatives like to make money and Democrats like to spend it. Trump is filling his cabinet similar to any other president and will judge them individually as they make decisions. Do people really think everyone at Goldman Sachs is a terrible person and is trying to take away your rights?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is not going to veto it and he shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The point is to take power away from the FCC and give it to the FTC. This is to ensure FCC censorship powers are never an issue with the net.</p>

<p>They are undoing what Tom Wheeler did under Obama during the net neutrality scare.</p>

<p>Unlike the FCC, FTC don&#39;t/can&#39;t censor shit.</p>

<p>The framework they were building to push the PC culture narrative for more control and censorship under the guise of net neutrality is dismantled.</p>

<p>Next step is to get back control of Internet that Obama gave the UN.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/324520-fcc-ftc-are-playing-a-shell-game-with-online-privacy">http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/324520-fcc-ftc-are-playing-a-shell-game-with-online-privacy</a></p>

<p>There is no legal leg for the FCC rule to stand. This rule will be repealed and then they will create an actual legislative bill to stop selling our data.</p>

<p>Everybody who hates trump become it&#39;s easy are just echo chambers of the &quot;news&quot; notifications sent to their mind numbing iPhone. Anyone saying they actually care should do some research on the situation at hand before trump was in office. He seems to be making a positive difference... </p>

<p>Creating 227,000 jobs last month</p>

<p>Decreasing debt by $68,000,000,000</p>

<p>Illegal border crossing down %40</p>

<p>I could go on about all the bull shit &quot;CLIMATE REGULATIONS&quot; That apparently just kind of make a lot of money for a small few....</p>

<p>Trump knows we can do better than what we have. </p>

<p>He needs to wake America up on the whole &quot;nwo&quot; shit if that&#39;s what we want to refer to it as.</p>

<p>Why are we all in r/conspiracy ? </p>

<p>For truth? Or just to conspire?&quot;</p>

<p>From the article you linked which I guess you didn&#39;t read</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody should fall for this privacy shell game. <strong>The FCC’s broadband privacy rules are currently the best protection consumers have for their personal information online.</strong> They would make a fine template for rules governing edge provider practices. <strong>Any weakening of the rules by either the Trump FCC or Congress will leave consumers unprotected from ISP data collection</strong>, use and security practices that might violate their privacy. <strong>That is certainly not the result the American people want or that policymakers should support.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s your right to interpret his words that way, but it seems pretty clear to me in the video that he interrupts himself like he usually does and the point he&#39;s making is that he didn&#39;t say he would repeal and replace it within 64 days.</p>

<p>When we offer the worst possible interpretation of his meaning, we open ourselves up to dismissal by the people we want to convince. It&#39;s better to not give them that option. The strongest criticism is the least deniable, and yours was easy to look past even for someone opposed to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interpreted that statement as him doing his usual partial-sentence-then-interrupted-thought-and-bounce-around way of speaking. Like this: </p>

<p><em>“I never said repeal and replace Obamacare</em>--you&#39;ve all heard my speeches--<em>I never said, repeal it and replace it within 64 days.”</em></p>

<p>The sentence, without his interrupted thought, would be, &quot;I never said repeal and replace Obamacare -- [that is,] I never said repeal it and replace it <strong>within 64 days</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see how that can be interpreted in slightly different ways? He&#39;s a horrible speaker when he talks off-the-cuff, and he often does this thing where he repeats the same thing multiple times but adds slightly more context to his meaning. Then, if you take one snippet out and ignore the rest, it&#39;s possible to come to a conclusion that doesn&#39;t mean quite what he was trying to say. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really bad because his words can so often be misinterpreted like this (apart from when he&#39;s just flat-out wrong anyway) because of his stylistic approach to speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah he doesn&#39;t do his work in the backyard. This administration is the most unprofessional, vile, scandalous, incompetent and chaotic we&#39;ve ever seen. Trump can&#39;t go on for a week to not contradict himself or say something mind numbingly stupid that not only is laughable, but undermines his own and his administartions popularity and credibility. He achieves absolutely nothing that&#39;s good for him with these things. You have to face the truth that a wise or strategic person doesn&#39;t say retarded shit that upsets everybody even his own fanbase and has absolutely zero strategic value- trump does this every day.</p>

<p>He might have had some kind of strategy like that in real estate businessbut it&#39;s pretty clear that he is just a demented idiot by now, and he wasn&#39;t very smart to begin with (much smarter than he is now that&#39;s for sure). You need to stop deluding yourself that this bambling buffoon is a bambling buffoon because he wants to be but secretly he is a genius. People eat him for breakfast for a reason, he has the most serious job in the world yet has the knowledge and vocabulary of a 7 year old. Never in his life has he uttered anything that is even remotely impressive, and in his older days he is straight up dumb and cringeworthy. </p>

If you have paid attention you would have seen that he has filed every cabnet position with slimy corporate assholes.  He has rolled back rules that stop the corporations from taking advantage of the middle and lower class.  I am not saying that he signed things into law.  He went out of his way to sign executive orders to explicitly give the rich more money.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t care about the environment, minorities, paying more taxes for a useless wall, a shitty health care system. You didn&#39;t care about all the evidence mounting up over trump/russia connections. You didn&#39;t care that your president is making your country an international embarrassment. </p>

<p>But when someone tries to mess with your internet THAT is what gets you to wake up and realize he&#39;s a conman?</p>

<p>At least it&#39;s nice to know that everyone has their price. Being a racist bigot only earns you so many brownie points. Lesson learned for trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done some  research on this for a bit  I&#39;m a Trump supporter and have been following the &quot;net neutrality/FCC shit for years.  What this boils down to is the FCC has been trying for years to exert their control on the internet.  The ultimate goal is to control content like they do for radio and TV.  The internet has ushered in a Wild West/free market place of ideas that is beyond the control of &quot;favored&quot; media like the newspapers and &quot;big three&quot; tv channels of yesteryear in which the &quot;correct&quot; narrative can be cemented by the &quot;elites&quot;. This new bill&#39;s goal is to null and void a borderline illegal power grab by the FCC in October of last year.  There are numerous laws at the federal and state level (including wiretapping laws) that protects your privacy.  Don&#39;t be sheep.  Understand the end game to all of this.</p>

<p>The FCC did not foresee these happenings.  They are in the business of controlling content consumed by citizens</p>

Just like you can have a conservative who is anti-globalism and one that is pro-globalism.
Although ALL conservativism is bullshit to screw over workers.
Except MAYBE the most moderate of conservatives but those
types do NOT exist in America lol. America is shifted so far to the right that American &quot;center right&quot; is equivalent to far right in Europe economically if not also socially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dems are compromized like the repubs.
Both parties are right wing excluding a rare few exceptions like Bernie who is about centrist.
Democrats are NEOlibs (very right wing pretending to be left wing)
and republicans are NEOcons (extreme right wing pretending to be moderate right wing).
The &quot;PC culture&quot; thing is bullshit.
IMO it&#39;s manufactured to piss people off.
I&#39;m left center on the political spectrum and I don&#39;t like
feminism (biased and compromized ideology, while humanism is much more balanced)
and I don&#39;t buy the &quot;WHITE PRIVELAGE&quot; bullshit (I mean, technically it might exist
but it&#39;s being overblown as if white people can&#39;t be poor.....the majority of Americans
in poverty are white because the population is mostly white).</p>

<p>I think the alt right movement is the establishment buying itself more time
because people are waking up to the fact that &quot;left center to centrist&quot; candidates
like Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein are the REAL anti-establishment candidates.
Trump ran after Bernie ran.
The alt right uses scapegoats such as &quot;immigrants are the problem&quot; (instead of blaming
corporate jobs outsourcing AND WAR which facilitate immigration in ways that reduce
wages for immigrants AND natives WORLDWIDE).
Another scapegoat is the anti-PC bullshit.
I understand that OVERLY PC stuff is bullshit but
to jump to the other extreme end and be ANTI-PC is
equally as bad.
Most people are in the middle, they don&#39;t want to be rude
and assuming/judgemental (anti-PC) but also don&#39;t want to make shit up
just to further an agenda unknowingly (overly PC).</p>

<p>E.g. if there was a teerrr....orrr...ist....
incidence involving a muslim,
the idiotic anti-PC thing to say would be
&quot;SEE IT&#39;S DA MUZLIMS, THEY SAVAGES!!&quot;
but the OVERLY PC thing to say is
&quot;IT&#39;S JUST THEIR CULTURE, DON&#39;T HATE!!&quot;.
Absolutely both are RETARDED statements.
In fact, I&#39;m not even sure overly PC idiots are THAT stupid,
I think the ANTI-PC idiots just make the overly PC idiots look more foolish
than they are.
But both are stupid groups to be in.
The NORMAL response would be:
&quot;Firstly, it&#39;s Wahhabism not NORMAL islam and certainly NOT the majority of
normal muslims.
Secondly, SAUDI ARABIA, an ally of the corrupt American government, is pushing
for extreme Wahhabism in the middle east and funding terrr....or....ism.....along with the U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies and military industrial complex.
Thirdly, most or all incidences on America/European soil are FALSE FLAGS
so you should be so easily manipulated to fall for the divide and conquer tactics of hating
all muslims and wanting more war in the middle east because your warmongering government says so.&quot;
Do you see what I mean?
You don&#39;t have to be in either extreme.
It&#39;s like being feminist VS sexist.
You can be somewhere in between like a humanist
who acknowledges that sex differences exist so TRUE equality is not
possible but relative equality is.
Men and women are equal BUT NOT THE SAME.
I&#39;m a left center person and not one of those idiots
who thought Clinton was a good candidate...LOL.
I cringe at the shills/useful idiots who protested for Hillary after she lost.
Screw her and the DNC, they rigged the primaries against Bernie using
multiple dirty methods including diebold machine hacking.
Bernie played fairly and got screwed over by the establishment.</p>

<p>There are some things he says I disagree with, most notably his autism - vaccine statements, but overall I agree with his ideas.</p>

<p>And what I meant when I said &quot;Him doing his thing is just whatever to me.&quot; I was talking about his twitter thing, which I should have made clear but I only noticed the mistake when I was already in bed.

The only thing I said pro-Trump so far in this convo is him withdrawing the US from the TPP... Why can&#39;t I disagree with some of Trump&#39;s actions and agree with others? Why can&#39;t I like some of the things Obama did and despise him for what he did to the Haitians and the civilians in the middle east?</p>

The problem is everyone leveraging credit to grow their wealth and squeezing it out of anyone they can. There is no way to stop it or fix it. If you raise the interest rates, loans are much harder to get, these overleveraged businesses can&#39;t keep up because they depend on the credit and they sink.

    <div class="md"><p>That is perhaps the most reasonable request for brake-pumping I&#39;ve ever heard. Hah! Okay.</p>

<p>So the way I see it, the masters--the various groups and factions that own the U.S. and endeavor to own the whole world and everything in it--they&#39;ve rigged the game so that only certain methods of protest are deemed &quot;acceptable&quot;. Voting, for one. WeThePeople petitions. Protest marches that get corralled into &quot;free-speech zones&quot;. That sort of thing.</p>

<p>It seems clear--regardless of where you happen to fall on the political spectrum--that fundamental change is needed, and that it has to occur very, very soon. Every day the &quot;long train of abuses and usurpations&quot; gets longer. We cannot afford to wait around for the next set of popularity contests, which may well be rigged anyway.</p>

<p>Violence seems to be off the table for now, which is okay, because that&#39;s the very last resort. As Frederick Douglass wrote, &quot;this struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be moral and physical, but it must <em>be</em> a struggle.&quot; In other words, our methods of resistance can be nonviolent or violent, but they have to <em>be</em> resistance in the first place. Voting is not resistance. WeThePeople petitions are not resistance.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> nonviolent resistance, however, is the weapon of <em>the strike</em>.</p>

<p>May Day is the traditional day of labor resistance. Hence I am advocating for a general strike, across all industries, to take place then. The idea is to grind the gears of the machine to a halt, and not let them restart until we receive adequate assurances of our future security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situation is different. </p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is heavily left leaning and actually have been controlled in the past by a pro-Clinton PAC as I heard. Still they cover the negative things too. Comey letter about Clinton, etc. was covered, upvoted, etc. Before the end of the campaigns it was actually very much pro Bernie and many times criticizing Clinton. Right wing comments are not removed and many times upvoted if sensible. The things I don&#39;t see covered is hate attacks by left wing people or the such. Opinion pieces and sensationalist shit is posted regularly.</p>

<p><a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is a shithole that is spammed with conspiracy theories, insults, memes, personal attacks, whataboutism, mocking of muslims, half truths and lies, senseless hype about stuff. Everything that is pro-trump gets heavily upvoted be it the stupidest lie on the planet, everything that&#39;s anti-Trump is banned including comments, nothing anti-Trump is covered, and it pretends to be the last bastion of free speech. It is not just trump-leaning subreddit, it&#39;s a dishonest, stupid echo and spamchamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the mob mentality bit I&#39;ll give you. You&#39;re overstating the case, though, at least relative to what I&#39;ve seen in my interactions.</p>

<p>Republicans and Democrats do equally stupid shit in <em>many, many</em> domains. In terms of sheer, rapacious indifference to the wellbeing of their constituents and the non-owning masses in general, Republicans consistently do more heinous shit, but the Democrats shovel their share.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not the point here. I was mocking you because Trump is, by any measure, <em>absolutely full of shit in super-obvious ways</em>, and &quot;ribbing him&quot; is not really an admission of that.</p>

<p>That said, it was needlessly unkind for me to mock in the way that I did, and I shouldn&#39;t have. I&#39;m sorry for that, and wish you well.</p>

<p>This one is not even about Trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like Trump took in donations and arranged government positions for those donors or was taking in millions and millions in donations from foreign countries (which would likely result in favors down the road) or sold valuable natural resources to a country and had his partner go to that country to promote the stock for company they sold it to....Of course he didn&#39;t, this is Hillary.</p>

<p>You can give it another go on providing sources from Trump &quot;profiting&quot;. Remember, the keywords are &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Profit&quot;. </p>

<p>1) Those companies provide a service, they need to make money<br/>
2) Since a lot of sites need ads to make money, wouldn&#39;t you rather have targeted ads than generic ads like the radio<br/>
3) What are you trying to hide?</p>

<p>I&#39;d go along with the second argument if not for the fact that the cable companies have a fucking monopoly in a lot of places.</p>

Is it an ironic statement or an old opinion you had?
Not all leftism is bullshit.
The extreme stuff like feminism (which is biased and compromized)
doesn&#39;t reflect all leftism especially the more valid types such as
democratic socialism and social democracy.

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to explain that the extreme of a truly free market comes with its own set of shortcomings. </p>

<p>A true free market economy leads to many problems such as monopolies, which is when a single company controls the entire market for a certain commodity. If we look from a business standpoint, this is a poor situation because it encourages practices such as price fixing. Also, it usually means higher prices for an inferior quality product, thus poor consumer protection. This kind of control over a market can also ensure that competition does not arise within the country. Which overall is bad for interstate and even international trade. </p>

<p>A truly free market economy also encourages poor treatment of workers, which is why the government implements things such as minimum wage, to prevent the exploitation of lower and middle class workers. </p>

<p>My reference to the 20s was taking note of the era before the great depression, where there was little government regulations in regards to business. Even though the Sherman Antitrust law to deal with the monopolies listed above was enacted in 1890, there was still a very small government presence in business. There was a stock market crash at the end of the 20s which can be seen as the catalyst for the Great Depression. However it was only a catalyst. The real problem lies in the fact that so much wealth was controlled by such a small amount of people. It does nothing to grow a country&#39;s economy when the money is not moving. In addition, banks operated without any sort of guarantee to their customers, which in turn created an environment of panic when times got tough. There were no government guarantees that you&#39;d see any of your money ever again if the bank went under. When the stock market crashed, people rushed to pull money out of the bank. The banks could not deal with the sudden huge influx of demand for people&#39;s money (which was invested in other places due to the nature of business in which a bank operates) and crumbled under the demand, closing for good. Since then, the government has implemented laws to make banks protect their consumers to prevent such a situation. </p>

<p>The point in all of this is that neither a purely Communist nor a pure Capitalist system has had success historically. It&#39;s ignorant to say a true free market is the answer. The answer lies somewhere in the middle. In this particular case of ISPs (where ISPs are a sort of legal natural monopoly due to the rarity of its business) many people feel it is important that the consumer&#39;s privacy is protected from any party wishing to use that information with malicious intent (including government entities). Overall, there will be more faith in the industry which will continue to encourage competition not only in the ISP business, but also by seeing the Internet as a business platform. Basically preventing large ISPs from holding a monopoly on all business that resides on the Internet, thus preventing growth of the country&#39;s fastest growing business platform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be pretty disappointed if he doesn&#39;t veto the bill, as it does seem to be exactly the kind of legislature that his strongest supporters rally against, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it goes through. </p>

<p>The problem is to go against the bill would be to go against the entire Cabel/Internet Lobby. Making enemies with that group would create a lot of problems down the road. Trump&#39;s fighting enough sides as it is, to throw another one on and make the midterm elections even harder then they&#39;re already gonna be is gonna be a tough sell. </p>

<p>I think the bill is bullshit and shouldn&#39;t have even gotten as far as it did, but I don&#39;t think this is going to be the bill that Trump&#39;s willing to take a bullet in order to veto. It&#39;s probably part of the reason it sped through congress faster than a lobby-lubed up bill normally does. </p>

<p>Politics is more than just sticking to your principles at face value on every issue. Concessions need to made sometimes in order to deal with larger problems. </p>

There&#39;s not a corporate wishlist out there that isn&#39;t being granted. Funny how internet privacy is the one to get Trump supporters to take notice. I guess trying to up your healthcare premiums and lower your coverage wasn&#39;t enough. I guess his budget and policies getting rid of anything that protects consumers from greedy corporations wasn&#39;t enough. I guess filling his administration with an all star team of pay to play special interests wasn&#39;t enough. I guess getting rid of protections put in place to prevent the 08 Financial crisis wasn&#39;t enough. I guess getting rid of rules to keep rivers and waters clean wasn&#39;t enough. </p>

Career politicians care about the public&#39;s opinion, not because they are good moral people but because their job literally depends on it. They are up for reelection and if a bill hurts their chances of being reelected they will not vote for it, because it works against their self-intrest. </p>

<p>Also, if you are unhappy with specific contributions/lobbying money/bribes your senator is taking, call them up, let them know you will be voting against them for that specific reason, and then do that. </p>

<p>If people start losing elections because they take money from lobbying firms for bills that go against the interests of their constituency, they will stop doing it. It is simple as that. </p>

<p>Or you can victimize yourself and do nothing but whine on the internet.</p>

<p>I hate having to explain to Americans how they can apply pressure in their own political system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they made things up. I said they contradict themselves (within a single article nonetheless) and are biased enough to be considered fake. &quot;Fake News&quot; is the deliberate spread of misinformation. When they post a headline/article combination like <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5w8ftFWMAY8dr8.jpg">this</a> they are intentionally writing a misleading headline. They know it&#39;s misleading. And they know many people only read the headline. Those people will have consumed intentionally deceptive information. Which is the very definition of fake news.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even defending Breitbart here. You&#39;re delusional though if you don&#39;t think CNN intentionally misleads people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say it&#39;s a misleading headline, I say if you actually read the article, they are saying that computer scientists believe they found a pattern that would suggest that the votes had been tampered with. They end the article by saying that even though these experts are coming forward with these claims, there is no solid evidence. That&#39;s not misleading; in fact presenting both possibilities is good journalism. </p>

<p>Sure, you can say that they are intentionally misleading people who only read the headlines, but is it CNN&#39;s fault people take things out of context when people don&#39;t even bother looking for context in the first place? Should all titles have a beginning, middle, and conclusion? That&#39;d be a hell of a skill. But they don&#39;t want to save you a click; <em>they want you to read the article</em></p>

They have every right to be able to say whatever they goram want because ...omg.. News flash... We are a free country with freedom of speech and freedom of press. I mean how long have tabloids been around and that&#39;s not fake news?? Nobody has said anything about those things ever except not to believe them because they&#39;re trash.  How did we know they are trash?  BECAUSE WE DID OUR RESEARCH BEFORE BELIEVING THE CRAP.  Just because the means of delivery has changed doesn&#39;t mean we need to all if a sudden crack down,  it means we need to inform people more. Maybe if the news covered things that mattered in a way that was impartial rather than Kim kardashians ass,  we wouldn&#39;t be looking to these alternate news sources in the first place. And still either way you should question what it is you&#39;re being told. Do your own research before digesting bullshit from any source. I&#39;m done. //EndRant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I got your point that we should do our own research and always question what we are told. I agree with you. But i don&#39;t understand why you seem to be arguing that the press is working with the government. The press in America has always been here to protect us from the government. As I said I don&#39;t like CNN but they don&#39;t report fake news. They don&#39;t make up stories. The White House and the current on the other hand actually make up stories. CNN has slanted opinions but they do report on real events like most other news sources. Other ones like then national enquirer make up stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never once said that they make up news.  I don&#39;t know why you are arguing that.  You made my point when you said they are slanted. And not only are they slanted but they don&#39;t report a lot of things that should be told. Instead we are fed a lot of celebrity news and propaganda.  Not fake,  just not the whole truth.  That wasn&#39;t my point. It was just that this war on fake news is bullshit.  Like I said,  some do make up news for the attention. But they want to put limitations on anything the government deems as &quot;fake&quot; which is also bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I clearly proved that CNN has by definition published fake news, so I&#39;m not sure how you can disagree (on that one example at least).</p>

<p>I did not claim they were comparable to Breitbart. I&#39;m right-leaning and consider CNN to be more reliable by far. My point was merely that Breitbart isn&#39;t the <em>only</em> fake news source. </p>

<p>Breitbart in my opinion is the most openly biased of them all so I agree with you there. Breitbart being reaaaaaally fuckin&#39; bad doesn&#39;t mean that others aren&#39;t just bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. But you need to show me where the fire is not just the smoke. I&#39;m not going to to deny that some behaviors have tipped the meter to oppose Trump. I just dont clutch my pearls at any rumored hint of impropriety. There are major things though that will make me not only oppose but actively campaign against him. Such as him voting for this bill if he does. Because I&#39;m an american before I&#39;m a Trump supporter. Unfortunately millions of others show loyalty more to their party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I continue to wonder what the deal breaker is for the staunch trump supporter.
On day one he pissed off Mexico by claiming the country is sending drug dealers and rapists.
Throughout the campaign he showed an obvious allegiance with Russian government.
And he acted like an imbecile toward merkel when they met.
There are countless and very serious problems with this man that are completely overlooked by his supporters.  This goes far beyond party politics into the realm of delusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly a lot more people would probably be willing to switch sides but one side has continued to spit on and call the other side racists, sexists, or even traitors. People have said I should be hanged for my vote for Trump. So dont be surprised when ppl dont jumped to the other side when Trump has inconsequential missteps. </p>

<p>We all have our different issues that would turn us, for me it internet privacy among a few other important switch vote topics. He hasn&#39;t signed it yet so I haven&#39;t flipped. But to be honest i wont flip democrat, i was a democrat all my life before this election and what the dems did in the primary is unforgivable and is a stain on a democratic election process.</p>

<p>It still remains to be seen whether or not Trump colluded with Russia. I&#39;m waiting patiently for the smoking gun because I&#39;m more measured in my judgement than most.</p>

Politics is a very diligent and purposeful endeavor.  Electing trump to that office thinking he would be successful would be the equivalent of hiring a plumber when you need heart surgery.
There have been trump supporters with proven racist histories much like those who opposed Obama.  Nobody thinks all trump supporters are racists but they do believe they are willing to accept a president that embraces racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I told you that their is another side other than left or right? You can be in the center on issues or focus on whats best for America and not just whats best for republican, or democratic parties.</p>

<p>I feel, as do millions of others that if Clinton won it would have cemented corruption. The kind of corruption that goes unseen and ignored. Because so many feel that democrats are immune to any wrong doing. So that corruption would have gone unchecked.  Corporations spent over a billion dollars trying to get her elected. Thats how badly they were relying on her for their agenda.</p>

<p>There have also been Clinton supporters who have sympathized with terrorists or support Sharia law. We need to both agree that those ppl, the ones you and I mentioned are the fringe. However a lot of press would have you believe that Racist that support Trump are in the millions and thats just not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are alternatives to trump or Clinton.   There is not voting.
I did not think Clinton was a good choice either.  I feel the same way about Clinton to a certain degree and I believe the Democratic Party has a long way to go.  However you are supporting trump, that is your choice so there must be something you thought he would do.  After decades of self enrichment in his seventies you thought he would suddenly change his whole outlook on wealth and people outside his sphere of influence.  You supported someone with obvious ties to corruption and self enrichment.
I am wondering at what point that support ends.  I am not tying insult or demean your right to choose.  I am just wondering when the fallacy ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont see the fact they dont want to investigate the numerous ties to russia as suspicious? Its not like its just one person in the trump campaign tied with russia. Every week someone new comes out as having ties. You dont find the fact the nunes went to the person involved in an investigation before the committee as suspicious? Any conclusive evidence there might be isnt evident because of obstruction by the trump administration.  The blatant lies by trump via twitter should be enough for any reasonable person to see the character of the person in charge of the most powerful gov in the world. The fact that hillary was a horrible candidate isnt a justification for whats going on with this presidency. Even just forget all the corruption he hasn&#39;t done any thing he claimed he would do </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I find it suspicious but suspicious isn&#39;t conclusive. There is also opposing views that go against it but ppl won&#39;t hear it unless it comes from the same beloved news outlets that got it wrong during the election and have been on a witch hunt ever since.

    <div class="md"><p>I love you just assume anyone critical of the shitshow that is the current presidency they are automatically a dem or &quot;covering their eyes and ears&quot;. I see the absurdity on the both sides mainly the crazy money in politics. You actually reference that in another comment but yet are still supporting the richest cabinet in recent memory and what could be argued as widening of the swamp. That video is interesting but it also is using the same sources you claim are unreliable &quot; beloved news outlets&quot;  as proof that something didnt happen when numerous times in the video he says there isnt conclusive evidence but there also isnt an absense of it. He then goes on and says the case is closed. How can you say that isnt covering your eyes and ears/ isnt biased? When talking about corruption and ties to russia people arent only talking about hacking. People in his campaign met with russian officials and lied about it... that is a fact. That should be enough for an independent investigation. I love how you claim to be so objective yet site a video that says for a fact the russian issue is &quot;closed&quot; yet you will admit there are suspicious things going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point has been all along that there isn&#39;t enough conclusive evidence. Many people take those news outlets as the word of God. Which you can&#39;t deny because its easy to find people calling for Trump to be hanged along with his supporters for committing treason after the headlines they&#39;ve read on the politics subreddit with stories that are based off of inconclusive evidence.</p>

<p>The video doesn&#39;t speak completely for me, I was offering it as a different view, not that it was point for point my view. I said that I want to see investigation go through to the end but Im afraid that if nothing is found ppl won&#39;t accept that there was actually nothing there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe this is a moot point now, since Donnie failed so hard at his promise to &quot;reepeeal and replacccce&quot;.  But I don&#39;t know any issue illustrates your point so clearly.</p>

<p>The older cohort -- more Republican, more Trump -- raised a generation of liberals totally on accident by instilling religious values into them.  Now the Boomers are getting old and their health is deteriorating.  But that&#39;s cool.  We&#39;re comfortable with paying more than we spend on healthcare, young and generally healthy as we are, as long as it&#39;s negotiated collectively and the most vulnerable among us are protected.  And <em>THEY</em> turn us down on the offer on a matter of principle!</p>

<p>It&#39;s like, if you knew you wanted to live in a co-op?  Where every housemate has chores to complete each week?  And Germophobe House tells you &quot;hey, we really want you as a housemate!  Don&#39;t even worry about your chores, we&#39;d like you to do them, but honestly we actually kind of like doing them and will probably just do them for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Boomers: NO NO NO.  STOP BEING SPECIAL SNOWFLAKES.  YOU JUST WANT FREE MONEY AND EVERYTHING DONE FOR YOU.  BUT THAT&#39;S NOT <em>FAIR</em> TO <em>ME</em>.</p>

<p>Really, just... breathtaking stupidity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I get the whole thing about negative and positive rights libertarian argument. I preached it when I didn&#39;t have a penny to my name, because I didn&#39;t want what little I had to be taken away from me. I must&#39;ve done a year&#39;s worth of research on how to renounce my SSN and on the evilness of taxes.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m older, established, have some savings and things are going well. I could have held on to my beliefs and cried foul every time I had to pay taxes. But facts are facts and it would be better for me economically now to be in a single payer system.  Hell it would have been economically better for me then, as well.</p>

<p>Some people refuse to change their views because it would violate some principle of their ideology. They tend to take it to the extreme as well, like saying they are forced to buy insurance at gunpoint.  It&#39;s the whole I got mine thing. They don&#39;t understand the importance of the public commons. They don&#39;t understand the implications of a functional society in their lives. They&#39;d gladly cut off their noses to spite their faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was a Sanders supporter too until it became clear that the DNC was corrupt as shit along with Hillary. And Bernie in essence selling out to a &quot;elite&quot; that he was supposed to be against. Before I looked into Trump I even thought Hillary might be the better of the two, and even got sick of the constant EMAILS headlines. But unlike you just declaring that &quot;its just deleted emails, its no big deal, everyone does that!!!&quot; I decided to actually look into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is like a month old. Okay, I&#39;m going to say to you what I said to people the entire campaign after Bernie was out, the DNC didn&#39;t want a non-democrat to get their nomination and they actively used their rules against him. Was it unethical? Hell yeah. Was it criminal? Certainly not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bernie in essence selling out to a &quot;elite&quot; that he was supposed to be against.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, you mean choosing to stay politically relevant instead of simply fading away? The Berniecrats are the future of the Democratic party, the fact that a guy in his 70s managed to galvanize a group of 20-somethings on a shoe-string budget and nearly topple one of the most potent Democratic candidates was nothing short of incredible. So yeah, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s selling out so much as he&#39;s an author of the insurgent wing of the Democratic party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;its just deleted emails, its no big deal, everyone does that!!!&quot; I decided to actually look into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be more than willing to &#39;look into it&#39;, but the issue is that it has been repeatedly stated by those in a position to do so that there&#39;s nothing actionable. Simply repeating the same point does nothing, you need to have people willing to prosecute her, and there aren&#39;t and likely won&#39;t ever be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, you want justice for Trump&#39;s crimes, but what Hillary did should just be gone and over with?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Por que los no dos? It&#39;s not a binary choice, you can in fact have multiple investigations and prosecutions running at once, the US government is capable of that. If there was new evidence that turned up that was enough for someone to re-open an investigation into hil-dawg, I would support it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you sound incredibly fishy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you sound like a deluded partisan who wants to beat up on a straw-man. Don&#39;t be a pussy, just call me a shill, or a (((globalist))) or a pedo. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so I&#39;ll just assume that you won&#39;t entertain things go against your dearly held beliefs and will perform mental gymnastics to keep thinking you&#39;re right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prove me wrong. Right now it looks like Trump&#39;s administration is going to go down as a national embarrassment, even if the investigation into Russian influence on them is shaken off, they might in fact go down simply due to their obstructionism into the investigation. So how about you let me know how you think it&#39;s goin to go around October of 2018.</p>

But they tend to post racist stuff. Making funny cartoons about Muslims. Just one the other day somebody posted what looked like a Nike commercial for a hijab (I think I called that right), and they photoshopped a machete in there also with a Nike symbol. They just tend to make themselves look awful as a community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erm. What?</p>

<p>Democrats are not socialist.
Did I say anything about the establishment, let alone about being against it?
What&#39;s Hillary Clinton got to do with this?
How is socialism in favour of the establishment? The hate for &#39;the establishment&#39; is about the entanglement of politicians and big businesses - politicians making decisions based on who&#39;s paid them/what&#39;s going to make them and their mates more money. That&#39;s capitalism, not socialism. Socialism is about providing for everyone. 
Yeah, the working class voted for an out of touch rich guy that is rich because his Dad was rich, who has shown no evidence of caring for the working class (quite the opposite) and think he&#39;s going to use the presidency to help them. The same guy who turns up to AIDS charity events, pretends to be a donor and leaves without donating a cent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hows socialism the establishment hahahahah cmon now. maybe not pure socialism but a representative one like what bernie wanted and pls find me a successful socialist country, other than venezuela haha. democrats lean towards socialism and would push for more i didnt say they were outright socialists, how do you think bernie attracted democrats?. ok, hate for the establishment, who do you think is paying trump off? have you watched the primary debates where all the donors there dont even clap for him yet he somehow wins? hes not a part of the establishment and youre a retard if you think that, even if his plan is to creat a diff establishment hes not a part of the current one where theyre selling influence to foreign countries. and i mentioned hillary to point out dems are for the establishment or just dont care. find me 10 people who inherited a mil and turned into multiple billion if thats only reason hes rich. youre a fucking moron or have never been an entrepreneur if you think its as simple as having money. i cant believe you mentioned &quot;out of touch&quot; as if anyone gives a fuck about your subjective view </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to attempt to translate that and understand your ramblings..</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say socialism was the establishment, quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Did I suggest socialism has ever been successful?</p>

<p>Democrats are not socialist, Bernie has some &#39;socialist&#39; (every other developed western country would just call them common sense) policies. </p>

<p>There&#39;s two parts to &#39;the establishment&#39;, the people giving money to politicians so they push agendas that benefit them, and the politicians accepting the money. Trump was one of the former, now he&#39;s the latter.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that about not selling influence to foreign countries? Him and his team are up to their eyeballs in an investigation into their dodgy dealings with Russia. </p>

<p>He was given around $14 million, several decades ago, and an established brand being his father&#39;s last name. Not to mention the rest of the money he&#39;d inherit after his father&#39;s death. Then he&#39;s had multiple failures and bankruptcy (hence why US banks won&#39;t lend money to him.) 
He would be richer now if he&#39;d just left his money in an investment than he is. </p>

<p>He single handedly ended the recession? Aha. Okay..</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even read the Huffington Post...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im aware socialism is the opposite  but it&#39;s IMPOSSIBLE for america to not have a gov and representatives cause we deal with other countries and are a super power and until every one in gov  is pure of heart itll lead to special interests. and yeah, i just meant they lean more towards socialism thats what i said. i guarantee you have no actual idea how the healthcare works other than everyones covered which sounds nice in theory but its a tad bit more complicated. &quot;common sense&quot; there you go again with your subjective smug faggotry. common sense says its not that simple. </p>

<p>i guess i am on r/conspiracy if youre mentioning the russia investigation thats been going on for 8 months now w no hard evidence. its plausible as most conspiracies are but unsubstantiated. also you claiming him taking money for certain agendas is unsubstantiated and its not illegal for him to give to a cause. </p>

<p>and hillary said he helped contribute to end the recession. neither of us have facts on that but why would hillary say that when he was a common businessman? its stupid of you to just automatically assume cause of the name mentioned its false. </p>

<p>huffington post is better than reading nothing i guess huffingtonpost.com </p>

<p>keep mentioning his inheritance as if it even matters. this is just you being a stubborn little bitch. obviously its a huge boost but to make it 100x bigger isnt something everyone can do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erm. You know socialism means you still have a government and representatives? .. Right?</p>

<p>No, i understand that healthcare is complicated but i know the basic concept of how &quot;socialist&quot; healthcare works, at least in the UK. Everyone is taxed some % of their income, the government, like it does with a lot of things, allocates healthcare a budget. Everyone gets covered and nobody goes bankrupt because they got sick or in an accident.</p>

<p>Yeah, if there was nothing to the allegations then went wild the Trump administration be caught in so many lies? Why would Trump say he has no relationship with Putin despite previously saying he did? Why would there be new instances of dodgy connections and events almost daily if there was nothing to hide? Why refuse an independent investigation? </p>

No incentive? You know, not dying early is always a good one. And you don&#39;t just need medical care because you didn&#39;t take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Nunes is clearly not able to do his job. He&#39;s refused to tell the committee things. He&#39;s told Trump stuff before the committee. He&#39;s closed down the committee because they don&#39;t want people to testify.</p>

<p>A well respected ex-mi5 agent isn&#39;t credible? </p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t moved from rigging the election. That was something Trump said. It&#39;s always been about Russia influencing the elections. 25% of Pro-Trump social media content was from Russian bots/shills.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying the election was hacked. </p>

<p>Influencing foreign elections, while not a good thing, isn&#39;t the real problem. It&#39;s the <em>collusion</em>. That&#39;s potential treason. There&#39;s a shit tonne of smoke, and that&#39;s why a 9/11 style independent investigation is needed. Manafort is pretty damn incriminating. The lies are incriminating. Turning off the recorder while taking to Putin is incriminating. Etc. Etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">NASA</a>
Here&#39;s a handy guide to climate change.</p>

<p>The Earth gets its heat from the sun. The sun&#39;s energy output is actually currently getting lower than it has been, yet earth is still warming. The more greenhouse gases in the air, the more heat we trap, the hotter the earth gets. It&#39;s us making that increase of greenhouse gases. 
Coal is a big part of that. It&#39;s an old resource that&#39;s dying. The future is renewables, that&#39;s what Trump should be focusing on, not some outdated coal jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but virtually no money as far as the gov goes have funded what kind of changes would be occurring naturally while weve spent like 60 billion over the past 10 years. i was just being a dick about the al gore thing but i think its naive to assume that a rock in space for billions of years has generally been 0-100 degrees fahrenheit. we dont know and its turning into religion where we have plausible reasoning but its not really 100% proven. IPCC predictions keep being wrong and they dont even try to fix the next prediction even if the one right before was off. im just skeptical about it. co2 has gone down but not temperatures (could take a couple years to effect environment tho if temp lowers in next couple years) </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9oNutgSa7U4">https://youtu.be/9oNutgSa7U4</a> we probably wont agree on this. im still pretty much 50/50 i think were making it worse, just that it was exaggerated. but at least consider that trump has looked into it more than just him conning coal miners into voting for him. you dont have to watch the vid but actual climate scientists say they have talked to trump about it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what you&#39;re saying is that, yes greenhouse gases make the world hotter, but just because we know that, it doesn&#39;t mean we know pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere makes the world hotter? </p>

<p>co2 hasn&#39;t gone down, the amount we&#39;re adding yearly has gone down a bit. We&#39;re still adding to the amount.</p>

<p>Yeah that video is one guy. Why believe him over the masses of scientist who agree we are causing climate change? (It&#39;s something like 95% of scientist agree)</p>

<p>The evidence says the climate is changing at an extreme, unnatural rate. We know that greenhouse gases cause heat to be trapped, and we know that we produce way more greenhouse gases than would naturally be produced. This theory hasn&#39;t been plucked out of nowhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>97% of papers on climate change show that it&#39;s humans. That&#39;s not faith, I&#39;m not the one using faith. 
I&#39;ve explained this already, we can say that the climate should be almost exactly as it was in 1750 because we know that down to nature alone, the climate does not change as rapidly as it has done since. I don&#39;t know what numbers you want. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend the chance that it&#39;s entirely down to humans is only 50%. If we don&#39;t do anything about it, we&#39;ve got 50% of being wrong and creating a global catastrophe. If we do do something about it, then we can mitigate the damage if it was is. If it turns out it wasn&#39;t us, then we&#39;re screwed anyway. The best way forward is to do something about it. </p>

<p>I keep citing 97% because that&#39;s the amount of studies conducted by experts on the topic who have concluded it&#39;s because of humans. That&#39;s why it&#39;s relevant.

    <div class="md"><p>dude its not all experts lol and have you read the dissenting opinions or are you just siding w the majority. yeah pollution is unnatural and were adding extra but attributing the change to solely humans when we havent put money towards finding out what happens naturally is god awful science and doesnt answer the question of how much we are contributing to the change. is it one degree? 100% of the change? you dont know until we find out the rate itd naturally occur at which hasnt been done yet so saying its all humans when weve only done half the tests is retarded. no one can predict the climate and that should be clear by the ipcc&#39;s awful predictions. the 97% keeps getting it wrong other than the fact were adding pollution which no one disagrees with </p>

<p>I knew about climate change before i knew who Bill Nye is.</p>

<p>The 97% isn&#39;t from one survey. It&#39;s from multiple studies using various methods. One of which is to look at all the peer reviewed abstracts that involve global warming/ climate change and out of those, 97% of those that took a position, agreed with the consensus that it&#39;s humans causing it.  <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm">Here, look for yourself</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>He uses the &quot;math&quot; incorrectly. He&#39;s a terrible source for anything. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/Monckton_Myths_arg.htm">See Here</a></p>

<p>Okay. Lets do some research then. 
So if we imagine humans never entered the industrial revolution and so we never started burning shit loads of fossil fuels and adding tonnes of greenhouse gasses back into the atmosphere. What would our climate look like today based on what we know. </p>

<p>First of all, what effects the temperature of the Earth? 
1. The sun. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=5">Well the sun&#39;s output has actually been falling, as the graph at the top of this page shows</a> so we might actually be a bit colder if it were just the sun. But there&#39;s other things..</p>

<ol>
<li>Volcanic eruptions. This gets a little complicated because large volcanic eruptions can actually cool the planet, as they release aerosols which can reflect the sun and have a cooling effect. However, this only lasts for 1-2 years. They also release CO2, which as we know is a greenhouse gas and contributes to warming the Earth when there are extended periods of volcanic activity. Fortunately, people who are actual experts have studied the effects of volcanic activity for us...</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html">A number of studies have used a variety of statistica</a>l and physical approaches to determine the contribution of greenhouse gases and other effects to the observed global warming, like Foster &amp; Rahmstorf and Lean &amp; Rind.  And like those studies, they find that volcanoes have had a relatively small contribution to global warming, and in fact, likely have had a net cooling effect over the past 50-65 years (Figure 3).</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>El Nino, the southern oscillation. This only really effects short term temperatures, as it&#39;s a short cycle. So not really worth anything when comparing over centuries.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, there&#39;s nothing to suggest that natural causes have caused any change in the average climate since the 1750&#39;s, and definitely not to explain the current conditions. Without some major events, the climate doesn&#39;t naturally change very quickly at all, we&#39;re talking thousands of years. Since they&#39;re hasn&#39;t been a major event, or any evidence of anything else, we can conclude that the climate today, should be very much the same to the 1750&#39;s. </p>

<p>So if you think it could be natural causes, please tell me what those natural processes could be.</p>

<p>Currently we can&#39;t match the future predictions to anything, because it&#39;s the future so we have to wait. But the same predictions have matched so far. </p>

<p>Whether they end up to have been underestimated is rather irrelevant to whether humans have caused climate change.</p>

<p>He makes a comparison to a sine wave, which is clearly wrong as the net value of a sine wave is 0. There&#39;s a clear increase in the average temperature graph. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you get it? The only problem is totally the fact that politicians are in bed with billionaires. Its the politicians that are bad! Surely its not the billionaires, the actual group of people actively trying to consolidate their interests <em>using</em> politicians.</p>

<p>It still baffles me this day how this mess happened. I understand the appeal at electing an outside to stand up to the elite, but... You have a problem with politicians acting in the interests of billionaires so you directly put a billionaire in the white house? Let alone one that inherited his wealth, had daddy  had to bail him out and then just making a fortune by selling the family name? </p>

<p>This is pure insanity. And then these people unrelentingly still treat him as a deity when he&#39;s got nothing to show for because they <em>think</em> he&#39;s eventually going to do something right. Its like they can only see in black and white. <em>Democratic politicians are the bad guys so surely Republican politicians and billionaires can be bad too, right?</em> People need to see the bigger picture, its never just been about the Democrats, if you think that&#39;s a case you&#39;re just cherry picking what the problems are so you can defend the party you prefer.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have fucking open borders. In fact this entire problem with illegal immigrants was caused by republicans in the first place because they are constantly slashing funding to federal groups, including the ones responsible for keeping illegal immigrants out. You don&#39;t know anything at all kiddo. You are quite literally the poster boy for republican ignorance. They cut funding to government programs so they can complain government doesn&#39;t work, and you idiots don&#39;t realize they caused the problem in the first place. </p>

<p>Except pushing for these privacy rules that are now being eliminated.</p>

<p>Obama had different privacy priorities. He was okay with NSA warrantless bullshit, which was bad, but he was not okay (or at least much less okay) with <em>corporate</em> intrusions into consumer privacy, which was good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question. Then why do so many people believe it?</p>

<p>Like, what was the research or evidence given that trickle down works on a large scale?</p>

<p>Personally, I know a conservative guy who uses the following anecdote to firmly cement his belief; i forget what year it was, but in the past few decades a luxury tax increase caused sales of yachts to go down, and a company near me that built yachts closed down, and a bunch of people lost their jobs. He goes &quot;if thats not trickle down, I dunno what is.&quot;</p>

<p>Does he have a point? Does this argument hold water?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supply side economics is sort of like economic chemo, at least back when it could work which I will get to. It should be a last resort when there just isn&#39;t money changing hands but the caveat there is that you have to ensure that the rich will spend instead of hoarding which they tend to do. It seems to work in the shortest of short bursts and usually only when the tax cuts are given to businesses rather than individuals.</p>

<p>People that buy into supply side economics, without any ulterior motive, tend to believe that myth that Job Creators are the foundation of the economy which is a very bourgeoisie kind of attitude. They believe these high earners are all going to spend their money to hire people or to buy expensive things infinitely as long as they can but as our growing inequality demonstrates they are just going to keep it.</p>

<p>Couple this with trade deals and automation and it becomes unlikely that this strategy can work in modern times. Save some magnate a few million and he doesn&#39;t hire more workers or bring back any that were laid off, choosing instead to keep his factories automated or overseas for a fraction of what it would cost for an american worker.</p>

<p>Trickle down in this day and age is simply a way to reroute our money, as the non-elites, up to the top much like countless other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are relatively few rich people versus not rich people.  Yachts are very much a rich people thing.  Their market is already targeting a very small group of people, and some rich guy in Wyoming probably isn&#39;t going to purchase one making the market even smaller.  Additionally it isn&#39;t a product that you buy more than one of very quickly so you&#39;d probably have lulls in sales that could last a while.  </p>

<p>There are so many things that could have caused that company to go under that it is impossible to blame it on that luxury tax.  Heck, some company could have flooded the market with cheap quality yachts and stole all that companies business.  Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdotes are extremely poor sources of information. On net people lost jobs working on Yachts for this specific company, but if that tax money raised went to programs with a larger net impact on employment obviously it created net jobs. Similarly, if spending on Yachts went down and the rich instead bought from more labor intensive sectors that also creates jobs.</p>

<p>Your friend is being short-sighted and self serving. The unemployment can be the lowest in history and I can still find a single person who lost their job when their company shut down. Ideology sustaining anecdotes like that are a dumb way to think about the world. </p>

You can bet your ass that they are salivating over this horrible bill.  Most are too computer illiterate to understand what that law will mean for their owm internet history.  They dont care; all they want are as much details on our habits as possible to either sell it or justify their cozy jobs.</p>

<p>In other words this whole thing is a dog-and-pony show. This new bill that repeals the old bill isn&#39;t some massive sea-change of privacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally said the same thing a day or two ago in response to another post of a similar nature. The problem with using a VPN to circumvent the bill is that it&#39;s the first step EVERYONE will take to get around it. I don&#39;t see the VPN option lasting more than a few months before another law is passed requiring all VPN providers keep up to date logs on all its users, and they must submit those logs when requested by the FBI, CIA, etc. If I was in a position where I would want this bill passed, that is exactly how I would combat people attempting to cover their tracks. </p>

<p>But to answer your question, a VPN is the easiest and most efficient way to cover yourself should the bill pass. Don&#39;t think it won&#39;t be rectified incredibly quickly though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your source,</p>

<p>&quot;Trump&#39;s ethics pledge, issued as an executive order on Saturday, includes a five-year &quot;lobbying ban&quot; that falls short of its name, preventing officials from lobbying the agency they worked in for five years after they leave, but allowing them to lobby other parts of the government.&quot;</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t ban lobbying, the EO just put restrictions on who could become a lobbyist in very specific situations. I guess ignorance is bliss though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim was never that he outright banned lobbying. That would bring our nation to a grinding halt and nothing would get done. Do you really want Congressmen/staffers being the ONLY people who make very tough decisions? Believe it or not, lobbying does FAR more good than bad.</p>

<p>The claim I replied to was &quot;He didn&#39;t.&quot; Yes, this EO falls short of a full &#39;lobbying ban,&#39; but no one ever expected, wanted, or should want that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it may be a red herring. 
Im not sure how this improves our national trust in government. Thus it may be a ruse to show his ambiguity and solidarity with the people. A tactic to win over the people so to speak. 
I cant see a single american wanting this accept those that profit directly. </p>

<p>Probably why the dems didn&#39;t vote. (they knew it was a trap). 
He is weeding out the bad apples imo. They didn&#39;t fall for it. 
Yet he still gains support from the people with a veto. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t see why he wouldnt consider it. Unless the home bound terror cells are gsing ground. In which case this is all being done so that intel can ise this information against them. I.e. you looked up anarchy cookbook and shariah. &quot;Makes arrest&quot;.</p>

<p>To me we either have a really big problem and this bill is needed to address it. Or its a farce and always was. 
Money isn&#39;t more important then faith in government. Unless the government is asking for faith itself. </p>

<p>If Trump has any brains at all he will veto this but from the bottom of my heart I think he might be the dumbest person to ever hold office. I don&#39;t think he has any idea what he&#39;s doing. He doesn&#39;t know how to market himself in this environment, he doesn&#39;t know how to effectively manage people that he can&#39;t scam or fire, he&#39;s been completely neutered because his sleezy, backhanded business tactics aren&#39;t functioning Post-campaign. Regardless of whether you agree with his ideas he has not been an effective leader so far. He&#39;s just going to listen to the people he trusts which most likely includes Pence and Bannon. </p>

Buisness is war. No owner of any company stood well with a &#39;fair&#39; mindset. Thus, his practices are inebt to the world which they were intended. </p>

<p>Our congress needs a facelift. While dinosaurs are grandfathered in I feel that he will make the appropriate cuts as they interfere with his plans to reestablish the american grand podium and philosophy. </p>

<p>This will take time. You have to pull the weeds to grow the garden. Rightnow hes the laying the foundation for our future. I feel he has good intentions, great aides, and an effective cabinet. 
So time will tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just like that awful &quot;free&quot; trade deal.  The left was set up to fail in their campaign against it, but they were supposed to believe all the while that the Dems would be their salvation.  They were never supposed to doubt that... and as long as they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d never win.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other guy gets in, and IS the actual salvation.  Turns out a little skepticism goes a long way.</p>

He knows we are almost to the time of universal income and technology replacing the majority of the laborers. He&#39;s allowing his buddies to stack up before the drop.

How do we deal with this?</p>

<p>So far it&#39;s just putting it off to the next generation/ guy. If you think he&#39;ll stand up for net sec when he will save coal rather than be middle class in a post capitalism world, you&#39;re insane.</p>

Are you aware that as a foreign policy position certain nations are allowed to set up protective tariffs while they build their manufacturing basis?  Mercantilism was always done because it worked, as painful a realization as <em>that</em> has been for me.  (Farewell, Bastiat&#39;s <em>The Law</em>.  I will always love you; I will not forget you.

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding.. To be fair to the Senate at least, I think almost all of the votes in favor of this bill were Republican senators. I am certainly not going to forget that in 2018. For some reason the more malicious corporate lobbies (oil, telecom, etc) have clung to that side of the aisle. Not to say by any means I think the democrats are innocent. They&#39;re corrupt too, I just think they have either a better understanding of some of the issues or just a stronger moral compass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We will fight back&quot; but how? Calling my representative? Yeah that does a lot. Bitch on Reddit? Circle jerks are fun, aren&#39;t they? Wait to vote out my rep for someone who will represent MY interests? LOL keep dreaming. All senators and Reps (cept Bernie and Warren) do whatever the people with money want or what their party wants. We don&#39;t have a democracy. We&#39;ve never had a democracy. We have the illusion of democracy in order to replace the dying influence of religion over the mass of civilization. Religion has been the way rulers control the people. Now it&#39;s dying out because collective intelligence has increased and more than enough people now know that religion is just a bunch of bullshit. But the morality that religion forced on people&#39;s behaviors is dying out too. &quot;Voting&quot; for people to represent &quot;our&quot; interests is the biggest lie that&#39;s ever been told to people. We have no control and only a little faith that who we vote for, will at least keep our heads above water. But now we are starting to drown. These people are sinking our country as fast as the money can be shoved in their pockets. I sometimes wonder why? Is it really just pure greed by many many or is there something darker, more sinister at play. What if they knew a life destroying asteroid was headed toward earth and would be here in 2040ish? I bet life would look a lot like it did now. Those who knew, trying to get as much as they can now. Not telling the world so that we ca live normally for as long as we can before descending into anarchy</p>

<p>ISP&#39;s on the other hand do charge! A lot! And you can&#39;t even get online unless you are using their service. So in real world not they have complete monopoly over communication networks.

Also, who is Alex Jones and what does he have to do with the email leak that was acknowledged by Democrats as being true - thus the firing of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile. So which is it, the emails were fake or not? If they werent, why is John Podesta going to Spirit Cooking events and using terminology the FBI considers peophile related?</p>

<p>Neerk&#39;s comment was humorous sarcasm.</p>

<p>Considering how often this subreddit and others repost Breitbart and act like they are the gold standard in truth telling, the comment does indeed add to the conversation. As many of us have seen such events happen.</p>

I understand why so many are frustrated; they spend tons of money on a useless degree and then end us serving people lattes for a living. I just don&#39;t typically have to deal with or talk to people like you, except for when I&#39;m on Reddit. Its entertaining in small doses.</p>

<p>SPEZ: I just did a brief look through your comment history, and my lord you are one hateful person! Constantly insulting people and calling them unintelligent. You really need to get off Reddit for a while and turn off the propaganda on the TV, it can&#39;t be healthy for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing else matters anymore. The one way to tell if someone is extemely unintelligent these days is if they somehow thought Trump was fit and qualified to be president of the country. How he acted wouldn&#39;t get him hired as a Walmart greeter. But Trump supporters are so extremely unintelligent because they lack a part of their brains that detects very obvious bullshit. He was constantly extemely immature, unprofessional, often didn&#39;t know what he was talking about and his whole campaign was unpatriotic (&quot;make America great again&quot; means &quot;America is not great&quot;... that&#39;s unpatriotic as fuck!) Takes real unintelligence to somehow think that is good for the American presidency.</p>

<p>Those are all conspiracies, but here are facts: he doesn&#39;t want to release his tax returns, many of his campaign cohorts and current members of his administration have had unsolicited meetings with Russian ambassadors and Russian businessmen that are under US sanctions. Not only that, but they LIED about having those meetings under oath. He&#39;s screwed a fucked people over on his way to the top, especially small contractors and low income families (trump university).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, Hillary was a fucking mess, but to say that there isn&#39;t ANYTHING suspicious with Trump is and I&#39;ll say it again, being a partisan hack.</p>

<p>I read about those and when I dug into them I realized there was nothing of substance.</p>

<p>I agree, but I think its important to be smart and aware. There are groups of people who brainstorm and make up stories to make Trump look corrupt and suspicious. It pays to keep an open mind and not just assume someone is corrupt because you have seen a few stories about them. They could do that to literally anyone who becomes President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through that post, and a bunch of the comments. I think it&#39;s a good idea generally to look at both the pros and cons. My concern is all of the &quot;pros&quot; arguments were trash. IDGAF if republicans feel the move was an Obama power grab. The legislation affects me regardless of what politicians feel about it. If some bill is having a positive effect of real people, but the bill was signed in a power grab, then I am pro-that-bill. The power grab argument is the most moot of moot points. The only other argument in the &quot;pros&quot; sections refers to ISPs feeling they are unfairly regulated. IDGAF about what ISPs feel. I stand for personal privacy regardless. The argument from ISPs seems to be &quot;.....but Facebook&quot;, and my reply is two fold 1) I&#39;m also against Facebook selling data. Pointing out someone else violating my privacy does not justify ISPs violating my privacy. 2) ISPs can do this on a <em>much larger scale</em> than Facebook. Facebook can only collect data about what you post on FB, what you liked on FB, etc. ISPs collect data on every website you have ever visited. Every anti-government site you visited will be seen by the government. Facebook does not have that power. </p>

<p>If you have any other &quot;pro&quot; arguments which you think will actually have a positive impact on my life, I&#39;d love to hear them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it seems are are in agreement on this one. This goes in the same catagory as TTP, where both the left and right actually agree on an issue. I just want you to be fully ready to backpedal your &#39;There are no real conspiracies of merit surrounding Trump&#39; claim if he does not veto this bill. The people on the left and the people on the right agree that this should be vetoed, so who agrees it should be passed? Corporations/governments who want to spy on their citizens, that&#39;s who. How does that relate to the &quot;drain the swamp&quot; campaign promise (another thing both the left and the right agree on)? If I was a betting man, I&#39;d say he will pass this bill, and put to rest any still clinging to the belief Trump will drain the swamp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, let me detail the conspiracy. (All contingent on him passing the bill, and I&#39;m aware we agree on the bill)</p>

<p>First I&#39;ll go for the &quot;drain the swamp&quot; connection. Drain the swamp, correct me if I am wrong, is about how big money interests have taken over Washington. How politicians cater to corporations who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars, while ignoring the interests of the vast majority of their constituents. This falls exactly into that catagory: on the &quot;pro&quot; side, you have ISPs and other big money interests who have donated over $600k to congress to get this bill passed, and on the &quot;con&quot; side you have you, me, most all of the right, and most all the left (aka most all Americans). Now it is Trump&#39;s choice: does he side with the corporations and their big money, or does he side with the American people. This is a great chance for Trump to go back to his campaign rhetoric and win over some moderate liberals saying something along the lines of &quot;I&#39;m a billionaire, I don&#39;t need your financial contributions, that&#39;s bribery. The hard working everyday Americans want this bill vetoed, so I will veto it.&quot; This seems like a cookie cutter example of &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. </p>

<p>The deeper conspiracy here is about government survailence. We don&#39;t know who these ISPs are selling the information to, and what those buyers are using it for. It seems extremely likely the government will eventually get their hands on it. What are the consequences? If you frequent <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they put you on a list. If you support zeitgeist or other types of anti-government media/information, they put you on a list. If you support the 9/11 truth movement, they put you on a list. They can even do things like dig up porn searches to get dirt on anyone who tries to challenge the government: &quot;Person X searches for Y porn videos, this is not the type of person who has moral, intelligent views on our current society.&quot; It&#39;s totally a way of controlling and tracking anti-government sentiment, giving them an advantage in squashing anti-government movements early, before they reach a mainstream audiences attention.</p>

<p>The Administration strongly supports House passage of S.J.Res. 34, which would nullify the Federal Communications Commission’s final rule titled &quot;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services,&quot; 81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016). The rule applies the privacy requirements of the Communications Act of 1934 to broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other telecommunications carriers. In particular, the rule requires ISPs to obtain affirmative &quot;opt-in&quot; consent from consumers to use and share certain information, including app usage and web browsing history. It also allows ISPs to use and share other information, including e-mail addresses and service tier information, unless a customer &quot;opts-out.&quot; In doing so, the rule departs from the technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission. This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor.</p>

<p>If S.J.Res. 34 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how it took a bill affecting the internet for redditurds to even care. Threaten to deprive millions of healthcare? NBD, fuck Obama. Give manufacturers free reign to rape our environment? Sure, just hook me up with that clean coal. Cripple the agencies designed to protect the public? Absolutely, got to cut down on costs, just send us that bill for the wall though. Deprive green card holders, who have a legal right to travel freely, access to the country? Absolutely, who cares that the countries where terrorists actually come from were conveniently ignored.</p>

<p>Reddit is so fucking sheltered that it took a bill affecting the internet to open their eyes just a little. They could&#39;ve see this coming from a mile away if they weren&#39;t so busy dickriding in his cult of personality and &quot;triggering the liberulz&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...&quot;
&quot;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &quot;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&quot;
&quot;Odd,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&quot;
&quot;I did,&quot; said Ford. &quot;It is.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&#39;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &quot;why don&#39;t people get rid of the lizards?&quot;
&quot;It honestly doesn&#39;t occur to them,&quot; said Ford. &quot;They&#39;ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they&#39;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&quot;
&quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Ford with a shrug, &quot;of course.&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &quot;why?&quot;
&quot;Because if they didn&#39;t vote for a lizard,&quot; said Ford, &quot;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I said,&quot; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &quot;have you got any gin?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&quot;
Ford shrugged again.
&quot;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&#39;s got to say it.&quot;
&quot;But that&#39;s terrible,&quot; said Arthur.
&quot;Listen, bud,&quot; said Ford, &quot;if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say &#39;That&#39;s terrible&#39; I wouldn&#39;t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually voted for Trump partially because he&#39;s a &quot;conman&quot;. He is literally a genius at tricking the media, using confirmation bias, and persuasive speaking. </p>

<p>While his political opponents used quantity to try to win, by having more endorsements, more people spouting the same talking points, Trump just says something everyone with half a brain would support and then gets viciously attacked over it for the next week. </p>

<p>Trump: &quot;Burning flags is bad&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone else: &quot;WTF I DESERVE TO BE ALLOWED TO BURN FLAGS&quot; *actually burns flags*</p>

<p>I liked most of his policies and he&#39;s clearly capable of either A) getting them implemented or B) making people look bad for not implementing them. Anyone who voted for him and is &quot;unhappy&quot; or &quot;disillusioned&quot; with his performance probably shouldn&#39;t have voted for him. He&#39;s doing basically everything he said he would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe what you want - the fact is that he persuaded 60 million people to vote for him, and did it in such a way that he happened to win the electoral college by a significant number of votes (i.e. 2 swing states flipping wouldn&#39;t have been enough to make him lose). </p>

<p>Whether he&#39;s insane or a genius, he&#39;s gotten results. It&#39;s probably a little of both, but if you&#39;re actually going to tell me that he just somehow bumbled his way into the most powerful office in the world, I think you might need to do a bit of rethinking.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t get there by accident. He intended to get there. He planned to get there. And to be honest it&#39;s quite baffling how anyone who voted for him can&#39;t see his capacity from the short time he&#39;s been in office. </p>

<p>He has done his part in almost every campaign promise he&#39;s made. He&#39;s set up stuff for the wall. He set up stuff for the immigration bans, and got rejected - and simultaneously made it clear to his supporters that the ban included no mention of Islam, but that was the reason the courts rejected it. He set up stuff for health care, and gave it to Paul Ryan to fail. He started removing regulations on businesses. He killed the TPP and is making moves to renegotiate NAFTA.</p>

<p>Even when he&#39;s failed, everything he&#39;s done he&#39;s spun into a win in some way. He either succeeds or flushes his enemies down the toilet with the failure. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still holding out for the tax reform, personally - that was a big voting point for me. </p>

<p>Seriously though, it&#39;s nice to see people follow principles rather than people. I wasn&#39;t a Trump supporter, but part of me was hopeful/optimistic that he might actually do something to take on the establishment. Then he started selecting his cabinet...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the hard look at the corruption within the Democratic Party and recognition that my issues have gone unrepresentative by them I&#39;ve kept an open mind toward Trump. Domestic surveillance, civilian ownership rights over the data they generate, and modernizing fourth amendment to recognize that today our papers and effects extend to our devices are some of my primary issues. Trump signing off on this would shift my opinion toward him to a more negative light.</p>

<p>Now if he were to instead take the anti-trust hammer to the major ISPs, and at a minimum have them spin off their entertainment divisions to reduce incentive to fundamentally tip the scales of access to the Internet in ways that destroy competitors, the need for privacy protection at the FCC level is reduced. Foster an environment smaller ISPs can enter the market and compete - bring competition back to telecommunications. Coupled with scaled back domestic surveillance and clear data ownership protections - entrepreneurs working on a new business involving electronic research and communications should not have their work collected by their ISP to be sold - then there is potential for a huge PR win by standing up for the Internet / preserving that innovation engine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could you not see this coming?</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s FCC Appointee is 100% ready to strip privacy protections and help big ISP&#39;s. He has come out against net neutrality, and has fought on behalf of big ISP&#39;s to protect <strong><em>their</em></strong> rights to free speech with regards to our data.</p>

<p>So, with an appointee like this as the <strong>Chairman of the FCC</strong>, why would ever think Trump would hesitate to sign this bill?</p>

<p>Hilarious that we were told by Trumpers that we need to give him a chance. Concerns are raised about his cabinet appointments... no, no wait and give him a chance. Welp, now all the pieces are in place and Trump&#39;s ready to pull the trigger like every reasonably aware person said he would -- are you willing to continue to give him chances?</p>

<p>Of course it doesnt tickle their fancy. I see posts about how people need to wake up, anti-globalist/brainwashee stuff but I think its really about waking up to their point of view. </p>

<p>I can see potential for many on that side of the fence to become free minds. They just have to finally give up on the belief systems in place which serve the status quo. There is more chance of unlocking alt right than alt lefties which have become increasingly close minded, divided amongst themselves with petty indifferences and Political correctness. </p>

<p>Im not pro trump or pro any side of the political spectrum. I sit somewhere in the middle without being impartial. I support anarchic ideals in the sense that humans dont need a single leader or a group of leaders but perhaps a truely democratic system a bit like what voteflux/pirate party is working towards. One where we freely come together to work towards common goals based on the needs and wants of the community while maintaining our individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted an article a couple times from awhile back where (if I recall) a Russian official was musing stripping anonymity away from Russian Internet.  I couldn&#39;t find the article again, but here is another one:</p>

<p>Putin Makes Russia’s Top Blogger Ban Anonymous Internet Access</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the highest-ranking Russian official to use social media, banned anonymous access to the Internet in public spaces as his mentor Vladimir Putin tightens control over electronic information flows.</p>

<p>Medvedev’s decree complies with amendments approved in May and effective from Aug. 1. Recent legislation requires Internet companies to store Russian users’ information on servers in the country, similar to Chinese regulations, and makes bloggers with more than 3,000 readers as liable for what they publish as media.</p>

<p>Look at the top posts for the year, and the majority are talking about what a shit candidate Clinton was. Not that she wasn&#39;t a shit candidate, but where were all the submissions taking a critical look at Trump&#39;s candidacy? No where to be found. </p>

<p>There were plenty of submissions related to the Clinton&#39;s campaigns influence on protests at Trump rallies, but <em>not once</em> throughout this past year did this community take a serious, critical look at Trump&#39;s candidacy. That&#39;s not admins fault, that&#39;s not the retards from <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a>&#39;s fault. It&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s own fault that you guys allowed this sub to devolve into such a shithole community, and the reason is that you guys have been so singular in your focus that you completely lost sight of things.</p>

He never had any posts in support of Trump.  That&#39;s why everything had to be deleted... he was never a Trump supporter and looking back on his history  would have proved that meaning his entire premise is a lie.</p>

<p>The only reason his account is valuable is because of the age of the account and amount of karma he&#39;s accumulated not because he was ever a Trump supporter.... I can&#39;t believe I had to explain that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By this comment it seems like you were implying republicans would filibuster the Obamacare replacement bill, which is total nonsense. </p>

<p>In addition to that misconception, you also seem uninformed about the roles of various governmental branches. Congress writes legislation; the President does not write legislation. The president can issue an executive order, but these do not go through congress. You can recall that Trump&#39;s immigration bans have not gone through congress, they got struck down in courts. </p>

<p>However given all that, I&#39;ll give you credit for giving the best rational I&#39;ve received for not vetoing the bill. (I think this really speaks to the lack of rational arguments for not vetoing.) The problem is this exactly what Trump said he <em>would not do</em> when he was campaigning. He would say things like &#39;I&#39;m a successful billionaire, I won&#39;t be taking any money from special interests and passing their legislation; I will take back Washington from the lobbyists and special interests, and give it back to the people.&#39; This is a golden opportunity to show everyone that all those &quot;drain the swamp&quot; chants were not just blowing hot air.</p>

<p>Trump is the President of the United States of America. This is the worst excuse I have ever seen, justifying Trumps actions. &quot;Oh both the liberals and conservatives across the country wanted this bill vetoed, but I approved it because it wasn&#39;t on my radar.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is an odd sentence which I am trying to parse, but he had nothing to do with the bill up to this point, so simply vetoing something is hardly executive overreach. It is literally the only way the President can directly affect policy. Trump does <em>not seem shy at all</em> when it comes to executive overreach. Just look at cases which could <em>actually</em> be considered executive overreach, like his numerous EOs (Something which republicans have been against for years).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he might have the ego that he wants to repeal anything obama does even if it&#39;s a good bill </p>

<p>Are you saying that this is a positive thing? This is something a 5 year old would do. It is shameful for a President, and is clearly against the best interests of the US. (re-read &quot;...even if it&#39;s a good bill.&quot;) </p>

<p>You said <em>Trump</em> would repeal the protection, then reinstate his own version with his own name on it, but this is not how it works. <em>Congress</em> wrote the repeal, and they have absolutely 0 reason to undo their own work, and reinstate the law they just repealed, but with Trumps name on it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very odd to be a liberal person born and raised is San Francisco, one of the most liberal places in the US, then a Trump supporter (who is obviously deep in their echo chamber) comes along and tells me how liberals feel. Needless to say none of the above comment is true, it&#39;s just what you have been fed. If you were on Reddit at the time, you would remember that when Trump got out of TTP, it went straight to the top of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and all the top comments were liberals saying it was a good move, but I guess that doesn&#39;t fit in with the right wing narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m neither a Democrat or Republican, but I fully understand why people voted for Trump. I get it, you were stuck between Trump - who could potentially be an underdog set on taking down CIA and draining the swamp regardless of his colorful personality - or Hillary, who was forced on you as your next set President option, with a trail of corruption behind her and a very likely Russian war ahead of her. </p>

<p>What is becoming frightening, and why I&#39;m so thankful that you&#39;re saying &quot;WAS a Trump supporter&quot;, is that after he has been shown to be just another puppet for the deep administration, his supporters <strong>will not admit this</strong>. Their enthusiasm and optimism of what he could be capable of (taking on CIA, giving more power to the people) has been effectively crushed, but instead of admitting defeat, they continue to excuse and defend him, stuck in a state of cognitive dissonance. That&#39;s a dangerous place to be.</p>

<p>I truly hope that they will face their reality soon, and that the manipulation from deep government between Democrats and Conservatives being set up against each other like two sides of a war, will come to light and be defeated. They have succeeded enormously in this election to divide the people, feeding each side with hate. We can&#39;t fight the underlying causes if we&#39;re split and blind with constructed rage towards each other. Trump/Republicans are not your problem. Hillary/Democrats are not your problem. Opposing them is like taking pills for depression, it only solves the symptoms, not the cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad that the OP has come to his senses about Trump. We need Trump voters to come back to the fold.</p>

<p>My only request is that he does not just change his view about Trump, but change his approach to analyzing politics. Trump pushed unhinged conspiracy theories not based on fact throughout his campaign. Those kinds of crazy and false beliefs are not unique to Trump, but are standard in the Republican party. I&#39;m talking about climate change denial, birtherism, the demonization of Obama and Obamacare, and so on.</p>

<p>Trump is the symptom, not the disease. We must fight the disease by avoiding poor quality information sources like Fox News and Infowars. We must fight every Republican who does not stand up against Trump -- and as of now that&#39;s pretty much every Republican. But most of all, we must <em>read</em>, not watch, quality news. We may need to pay for it (but an incognito window will get you free unlimited access to the NYTimes and Washington Post). </p>

<p>It is not enough to turn on Trump. We must turn on misinformation and conspiracy theorizing that is not based on fact. Yes, there are conspiracies in the world. That doesn&#39;t mean we should accept any conspiracy theory without evidence. If we do, the end result is giving power to con men like Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having my doubts as someone who voted for him because of the following: continuing what Obama did with Saudi ties, this new ISP bill, stopping certain funding to foreign entities(which is good) except for Israel, still keeping American forces in the Middle East, and not providing a pro-American solution to Healthcare. If he does not veto this bill and offer us a replacement for Obamacare, I&#39;m done with him and openly opposing him. I&#39;ve tried to keep as much of an open mind as possible with this, now I&#39;m starting to become seriously concerned. r/the_donald needs to come out against this as well instead of blindly supporting Trump on words alone.</p>

I still enjoyed distrupting the Clinton train and the Washington elite. I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t think he will be able to or have the will to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; but his killing TPP (for now) was epic. As we see these evil MFr&#39;s aren&#39;t going to stop their backroom deals. Corporations/banks really own this country and have called the shots for so long now, it&#39;s impossible to wrench the stranglehold they have around our necks. One man is not going to be able to do it. 
Isn&#39;t it ironic that corporate America is against this guy when he IS them symbolically speaking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but many fail to realize this was something written up during obama&#39;s administration. And that the ISP companies have been selling this type of information long before this bill showed up. It is a huge distraction on top of being an issue to create divide using the false two party system politics. </p>

<p>You will hear people say &quot;Oh the democrats were all against this, see they can be good sometimes.&quot; But they fail to realize they are both on the same side and that these type of votes are always determined ahead of time. Right now we are ramping up war efforts in multiple countries, Russia is expanding its troops into libya and afghanistan. North Korea is doing more nuke tests.. And here we are circle jerking and fighting over an isp bill that changes nothing that they haven&#39;t already been doing legally and illegally. </p>

<p>No I do not support trump or this bill revoking what little protections were tried to put in place. But you have to be in a bubble to believe this is the turning point where they all of a sudden start selling our personal information. It has been going on for decades.</p>

<p>Really though 14 years of my life i did fine, no internet.  Internet goes public, 20 years later it&#39;s so woven into the fabric of society that it would be hard to hide from it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard people say that without a fb profile its impossible to convince people that don&#39;t know you in RL that you are a real person and not some internet bot.   That&#39;s sad. </p>

<p>I actually think i&#39;d like to go back to the days before internet but that may be because as 14 yr old i had a lot more fun </p>

Maybe yes, maybe no, but what I do know is that throughout the whole election the only policy of hers I heard was abortion. Don&#39;t blame Trump Supporters for that, blame the main stream media. The media is why we are here today, the same people trying so desperately to destroy him are the ones who breathed life into his campaign. It&#39;s evident that no protest, no petition, and no articles are going to stop this guy in his tracks if he is the tyrant the left makes him out to be.

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t want to weigh in on this, but the reason most of the people at T_D have congregated and created this &quot;club&quot; is because they were concerned about the things Obama was rolling into motion.  The mass exodus of Muslim countries has <em>not</em> been a beneficial event for most of Europe.  Terrorist type attacks from Muslim Ideological fanatics are happening all the time.  People in America were scared that if Obama and Clinton were to bring in <em>millions</em> like had been planned, we would be seeing crimes here, like as London and Paris and Florida, and be taxed to support them because of course they would be on welfare.  They have No money.<br/>
I can understand <em>why</em> Donald was elected president.  I cannot understand why our choice was between Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich.  Had we more options, I think more people would be happy with the results.  Our country wouldn&#39;t be <strong>so</strong> goddamn torn between factions.   I hate the division of our people, and try to keep an open mind to understand why each side believes what they believe.  There would be much less conflict, and much more resolution to important issues if more people would just stop and try to have a little compassion for their fellow American.</p>

<p>I voted for neither candidate in this election because our choices sucked.  Big time.  But I honesty hope that Donald does what is right, and cuts down this Bill before it can have a chance to be law.  For someone so into fair competition between Health Insurance Providers over state lines, I would hope that he sees the same applies to Internet Service Providers.<br/>
This bill will destroy any chance we have of reversing this ISP monopoly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support Trump and I would never vote for him. HOWEVER, I also understand why someone would based on the choices we had and what he was promising.  To my friends who voted for Trump, now is the time to hold him accountable, not make excuses for him. If he does not veto this bill then Trump has gone a long way toward playing for the establishment and against the people already. There is absolutely no benefit to the American people in this bill, it just strips away privacy so the private sector can gain more power and wealth. </p>

<p>Someone who supports Trump is not a bad person. As a progressive I absolutely hate that so many on the left are willing to put all Trump supporters in one shitty basket. But I am a little concerned with how many Trump supporters I have seen that are making excuses for everything Trump does whether it helps or hurts their cause. </p>

<p>I am a proud Bernie supporter and it would be kinda hard to criticize him, but we have to hold the people who represent us accountable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how people are still being blinded by the fake left and right paradigm. No doubt Trump will create jobs and get more done for the working class, but did anyone really expect him to drain the swamp, get Hillary put down, do anything about 911, or anything remotely close to being the peoples President? Alex Jones is still pushing his agenda like he is a saviour. Even the truth community were dumb enough to get drawn in by him. Clinton would have been worse, but again, the people choose the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>Hahaha. Not to any effect, you won&#39;t. There are people who have said that, people who say they&#39;re gonna fight, but... ain&#39;t nobody gonna fight in any <em>meaningful</em> way. A couple cases to get my point across:</p>

<p>• &quot;Anonymous&quot; threatened Drumpf by telling him to resign by February 28th... and as far as I can tell, nothing remarkable or noteworthy or significant has happened in the 29 days following that has been attributed to &quot;Anonymous&quot;. </p>

<p>• Marches. Various marches. ANY marches. When has a march ever done any good, resulted in any positive and long-lasting action?</p>

<p>• KXL pipeline. Man, that was a mess. Protestors held for days, and when everything finally looked their way... well, nothing. They lost, were evicted, and the pipeline is going through anyway.</p>

<p>The day someone directly affects any actual positive change through fighting this regime (or any regime that makes worse the society I live in), in any form, is the day I get behind that person and fight alongside them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given my wording, you are correct. </p>

<p>However, given my intent, you are wrong. Sure, the march <em>helped</em> certain things along that made life for American citizens better. But in the short run of things? People marched, speeches were had, singers sung, then people dispersed. </p>

<p>Also, amusingly, the ANP staged a 50-person &quot;gathering&quot;/counter-march  to the MLK march, and were &quot;quickly dispersed by police... whereas just last November, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/richard-spencer-speech-npi/508379/">&quot;more than 200 [white nationalists ...] gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This bill levels the playing field in the wrong direction, before Obama this was already the law isps could search your data and so could other companies. During Obama he passed the law that isps could not search your browser history BUT companies like Facebook and Google still could helping his &quot;billionaire friends&quot; .  Trump will pass this bill even though we are going farther from the direction we need to be just so that everything is level. Obama put us in this by having a stationary server that collects data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear OP,</p>

<p>You are a coward who probably gave Obama a pass for his first term in office. Try to at least give President Trump a full 100 days in office before you go pretending this is irredeemable. </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth if you or anyone without a temperament were put in this position of stress, you would have likely already killed yourself out of fear or completely opened up your asshole to the big dick of corruption. Either way, you wouldn&#39;t have lasted the first week...</p>

<p>To all you losers who keep pretending Trump is &quot;keeping the wealth for himself and his inner circle&quot; tell me honestly what good or service have you ever provided your anarchistic &quot;agora&quot; that were actually in demand? Please help me here, I&#39;m lacking examples of where your brand/service was stronger and more in demand than Trumps.</p>

<p>As for him being a former Trump supporter BULLSHIT. No one childish enough to fall out after two months, and a string of victories was EVER a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>(ok it&#39;s possible he&#39;s being hyperbolic in an attempt to curry favor, or it believes he can sway people with this line of bs — ROTFLMAO — yea right)</p>

<p>EDIT 1: it appears the OP was NOT a supporter of Trump</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Oh my now we see the truth. OP NEVER supported Trump, and is trying to appear smarter than everyone else by claiming he was first to spot the truth.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: Petitions on CHANGE DOT ORG or WHITEHOUSE DOT GOV are manginess feel-good BS, grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right that many CEOs are responsible for job losses. What with moving production and business out of the US. Also for hiring cheap illegal labor. Which will all end due to no illegal immigrants to hire, and having to bring business back to the US. </p>

<p>I think the racism stems from both sides. The majority of Trump supporters are not racist. The majority of leftists are not racist. There is racism and bigotry amongst every group. Theres blacks beating white. Mexican beating blacks. Whites beating Mexicans. Muslims beating blacks. The suspension on Muslim immigration is not racist. Neither is the wall. It is not about race. It is about preserving America&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>On the Muslim ban- how is it unconstitutional when the people living in the seven countries mentioned (which are in fact inhabited by many extremist groups and even in the middle of war) are not even US residents or citizens? It is not just Muslims not allowed to come from those countries. It is everyone in the country as a whole. Muslims can still come from countless other countries. Just not the seven mention due to those countries being way too unstable and dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real reason we lack jobs is because all the easy jobs for the masses were automated long ago and only tradition and refusal to change has left them in place for as long as they have been.</p>

<p>The economy has shifted and while there are enough things to do for everyone, those &quot;things to do&quot; largely aren&#39;t about survival anymore (ie: food, shelter, and heat; ie: agriculture, construction, and energy). The economy has been based on need, and most jobs similarly based on need, for a long time. Most of those jobs are gone forever. The want-based economy has been growing for a long while, but we don&#39;t know how to structure that yet.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m for UBI to take care of needs, so that &quot;wants&quot; have room to grow unimpeded.</p>

<p>And I would add that the Trump era is a direct and logical result of the modern Right, which uses fear, division, and misinformation to push an agenda that benefits the wealthy and turns the nation backwards economically, socially, culturally, and educationally. It is not just Trump but the entire Republican Party that is ruining this country.</p>

<p>This is important to remember, because what&#39;s going to happen next is republicans are going to try to distance themselves from the Trumpster fire, and act like they are the better, sane choice. Don&#39;t forget that midterms are right around the corner. They are counting on the short memories and lack of attention of their voting base.</p>

<p>When we offer the worst possible interpretation of his meaning, we open ourselves up to dismissal by the people we want to convince. It&#39;s better to not give them that option.

Politics is a very diligent and purposeful endeavor.  Electing trump to that office thinking he would be successful would be the equivalent of hiring a plumber when you need heart surgery.
There have been trump supporters with proven racist histories much like those who opposed Obama.  Nobody thinks all trump supporters are racists but they do believe they are willing to accept a president that embraces racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interpreted that statement as him doing his usual partial-sentence-then-interrupted-thought-and-bounce-around way of speaking. Like this: </p>

<p><em>“I never said repeal and replace Obamacare</em>--you&#39;ve all heard my speeches--<em>I never said, repeal it and replace it within 64 days.”</em></p>

<p>The sentence, without his interrupted thought, would be, &quot;I never said repeal and replace Obamacare -- [that is,] I never said repeal it and replace it <strong>within 64 days</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see how that can be interpreted in slightly different ways? He&#39;s a horrible speaker when he talks off-the-cuff, and he often does this thing where he repeats the same thing multiple times but adds slightly more context to his meaning. Then, if you take one snippet out and ignore the rest, it&#39;s possible to come to a conclusion that doesn&#39;t mean quite what he was trying to say. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really bad because his words can so often be misinterpreted like this (apart from when he&#39;s just flat-out wrong anyway) because of his stylistic approach to speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are alternatives to trump or Clinton.   There is not voting.
I did not think Clinton was a good choice either.  I feel the same way about Clinton to a certain degree and I believe the Democratic Party has a long way to go.  However you are supporting trump, that is your choice so there must be something you thought he would do.  After decades of self enrichment in his seventies you thought he would suddenly change his whole outlook on wealth and people outside his sphere of influence.  You supported someone with obvious ties to corruption and self enrichment.
I am wondering at what point that support ends.  I am not tying insult or demean your right to choose.  I am just wondering when the fallacy ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a justified case of American exceptionalism.  We&#39;ve <em>done</em> the successful revolt for liberty thing before.  Our culture is different from most cultures due to its advanced individualism, and that makes all the difference when it comes to determining whether a revolution goes full circle.  It isn&#39;t enough to be a warlord in an individualistic society.  Individualism thus agitates against revolution, but makes it more efficacious as a means of change if the necessary threshold is reached.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm">Here&#39;s some info on where that 97% figure comes from</a>. So yes, nearly all with relevance are in agreement.</p>

<p>The evidence says the climate is changing at an extreme, unnatural rate. We know that greenhouse gases cause heat to be trapped, and we know that we produce way more greenhouse gases than would naturally be produced. This theory hasn&#39;t been plucked out of nowhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He uses the &quot;math&quot; incorrectly. He&#39;s a terrible source for anything. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/Monckton_Myths_arg.htm">See Here</a></p>

<p>Okay. Lets do some research then. 
So if we imagine humans never entered the industrial revolution and so we never started burning shit loads of fossil fuels and adding tonnes of greenhouse gasses back into the atmosphere. What would our climate look like today based on what we know. </p>

<p>First of all, what effects the temperature of the Earth? 
1. The sun. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=5">Well the sun&#39;s output has actually been falling, as the graph at the top of this page shows</a> so we might actually be a bit colder if it were just the sun. But there&#39;s other things..</p>

<ol>
<li>Volcanic eruptions. This gets a little complicated because large volcanic eruptions can actually cool the planet, as they release aerosols which can reflect the sun and have a cooling effect. However, this only lasts for 1-2 years. They also release CO2, which as we know is a greenhouse gas and contributes to warming the Earth when there are extended periods of volcanic activity. Fortunately, people who are actual experts have studied the effects of volcanic activity for us...</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html">A number of studies have used a variety of statistica</a>l and physical approaches to determine the contribution of greenhouse gases and other effects to the observed global warming, like Foster &amp; Rahmstorf and Lean &amp; Rind.  And like those studies, they find that volcanoes have had a relatively small contribution to global warming, and in fact, likely have had a net cooling effect over the past 50-65 years (Figure 3).</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>El Nino, the southern oscillation. This only really effects short term temperatures, as it&#39;s a short cycle. So not really worth anything when comparing over centuries.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, there&#39;s nothing to suggest that natural causes have caused any change in the average climate since the 1750&#39;s, and definitely not to explain the current conditions. Without some major events, the climate doesn&#39;t naturally change very quickly at all, we&#39;re talking thousands of years. Since they&#39;re hasn&#39;t been a major event, or any evidence of anything else, we can conclude that the climate today, should be very much the same to the 1750&#39;s. </p>

<p>So if you think it could be natural causes, please tell me what those natural processes could be.</p>

im talking about predictions already made that have been exaggerated. how many times do they need to get it wrong for you to question the prediction </p>
