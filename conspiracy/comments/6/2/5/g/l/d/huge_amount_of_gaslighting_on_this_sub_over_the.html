<p>So... the rule actually let ISP&#39;s sell private data.</p>

<p>The people being gaslighted are liberals and reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So before last October they were free to sell data and we didn&#39;t have any privacy but after that we had it?</p>

<p>ISP&#39;s were selling data just like Google and Facebook before that?</p>

<p>That rule had weak legal standing and was just a cover to empower the FCC to tell the ISP Industry what to do, including what to censor.</p>

<p>Now its being transferred to FTC which has nothing to do with censorship. A new proper legislative bill will be bought in to handle privacy unlike the rule that we have now.</p>

<p>This is pure fearmongering but I have to give the DNC and Tom Wheeler credit for bringing in more censorship regulation under the guise of net neutrality and the plebs on reddit just ate it up.</p>
