       a few users would at all cost deflect the blame off the GOP and say that the DNC are not better and just as bad, at the same time completely write off the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not let them push this narrative, the vote for internet privacy went down party line, it doesn't matter what DNC would have done or not, but ALL GOP vote for it, do not let them get away by saying the DNC are just as bad and deflect off all blame.

       It reverses a rule set last October (&lt;5 months ago) that prevents ISP's from selling private data unless they add some fine print to their terms of service.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... the rule actually let ISP's sell private data.

      <p>
       The people being gaslighted are liberals and reddit.

       So before last October they were free to sell data and we didn't have any privacy but after that we had it?
      </p>
      <p>
       ISP's were selling data just like Google and Facebook before that?
      </p>
      <p>
       That rule had weak legal standing and was just a cover to empower the FCC to tell the ISP Industry what to do, including what to censor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its being transferred to FTC which has nothing to do with censorship. A new proper legislative bill will be bought in to handle privacy unlike the rule that we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pure fearmongering but I have to give the DNC and Tom Wheeler credit for bringing in more censorship regulation under the guise of net neutrality and the plebs on reddit just ate it up.

       This isn't a political forum. It's not a safe haven for feel-good political equality, whatsoever. If anyone just pushed a narrative..it was you. Plain as day.

       Bullshit is the continued ideal that there's two teams here worth discussing as two separate and distinct entities. There's not, at all.

       Are republicans not against governmental overreach? To my knowledge, that's one of their core "concepts". Nonsense, and they just put it on display. Same goes for the other bullshit artists of the "opposing side". I will lambaste them equally every chance I get.

       Perhaps your account caught the diabetes, because that was among the dumbest, scatter-brained shit I've read in at least 3 days.

       Before you commit your jibberish to the public realm you should really contemplate the sensibility of it.

       Lay it out, chief. What's your deal? Do you just insert random bullshit and pray for a favorable reaction from other idiots, or do you have something of substance and merit to discuss?

       We are indeed calling out the bullshit you spout after reading fake news. This is has nothing do with Internet privacy and more to do with dismantling the censorship platform set in place by Obama for the FCC.

       Are you somehow completely unable to even attempt to have a conversation, or reply to what anyone here is actually saying?

       What are you adding to this discussion
       <em>

       aside from labeling people by the subreddits they post in, or implying that they're Russian, and therefore not worth even replying to?

       The subs you post to don't exactly make
       <em>
        you

       look like the least unbiased person in this thread. It seems your entire reason for even being in this post is to dismiss anyone who disagrees with you, which is way shittier than posting in t_d or putting a 'the' in front of diabetes which somehow makes people Russian.

       What exactly would you have my say? Screeching "FAKE NEWS OBAMA (((SOROS))) FAKE NEWS" isn't exactly an onramp to a productive discussion. If someone makes a coherent argument, I'd be happy to respond.

       A few users are trying to add credibility to the Democrat Party by magnifying this one bill. The Democrats are right on this one. But don't forget about all the shit the democrats have done in the past. One party takes half your rights, the other party takes the other half. And by the end of it you're left with no rights. The moment you agree completely with the Democrats or completely with the Republicans is the moment you are brainwashed.
