       If you search Top: All Time under r/pics it's right there but if you do the same for r/all it's nowhere to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being at the top of r/all all time is basically the closest the front page comes to a sticky. That's huge, permanent exposure for this issue that it's NOT getting because Reddit is choosing to exercise censorship here.

       Yea it's totally done on purpose...fucking garbage. I hate r/all and all the stupid fucking cat pictures and dog pictures and photos of people's Indian food and brownies...wake the fuck up. We have the power to share Infornation at the click of a button and the "front page of the Internet" is full of either blatantly emotional sentimental crap (and I think a lot on that shit is clearly faked) and stupid goofy bullshit lmao...

      <p>
       All the politically correct 18-30 year olds who think the "F word" is atrocious and just that whole scene of fake fucking people I cant take...one thing I hate about society is how everyone is so cool with being "trendy" and "cool", listen to bullshit music and God aweful movies and pretend to like it just to fit in and be relevant..I fucking digress.

       You saw the power of reddit during PG and saw what reddit really is when they scrubbed pg and flooded this entire site with astoturfers.  It wasn't even about PG, it was about us organizing, researching, and sharing information without a controlling body governing us.  If PG turned out to be fake, we would organize again and take down the Fed, or voter fraud, or clean house in the Senate.  We scared the shit out of tptb by organizing the way we did.  And that's why they had to show their hand.  We know without a doubt entities like reddit, youtube, twitter, msm etc are owned and work in lockstep with our government.

       The response to PG from people in power did more to convince me it was real than any of the emails or online posts trying to make connections. I've never seen such a serious approach taken for a story they were trying to tell us was clearly nonsense. TPTB clearly didn't think it was nonsense.

       same thing w 911, the current regime on reddit exists because activists were making the profitable fluff difficult
      </p>

       something like reddit but without the profit model needs to exist, or for it yo be run by standup people not a standard israeli corp

       If President Trump signs it the bill will nullify a regulation that hasn't even taken effect yet. It was signed by Obama in Dec 2016 after the election results and has yet to come into effect.

       Because in this very subreddit, there is a majority of comments throwing stones at Trump and the Republicans for this bill, when that is not factual. And people think this sub is pro-Trump, when it really is not in full, aside from T_D users who like to come here.

       are you sure that
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       doesn't just re-compile its /top/ list periodically, and we haven't allowed enough time for that to happen yet? Because it would be pretty demanding for the reddit servers to always have a real-time ordering on
       <a href="/r/all/top">
        /r/all/top

       methinks, since there are so many topics to sort. But I have not tested that theory, just spitballing here :P
