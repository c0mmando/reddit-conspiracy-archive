       If the Russia hired 1,000s, Media Matters, Correct the Record, and Share Blue all pro Hillary Clinton I mean DNC bots and paid trolls must be in the 100s of thousands. Just look at the blatant propaganda being pushed in the Politics sub. Watch all the comments to this, most likely calling me a shill, troll and replying with links so fast, it makes you wonder how they have these links right on hand. I wrote a lot here but they copy and paste stuff so fast it really don't make much sense. Anyone saying MM,CTR,and SB don't exist is just wrong we have the leaks and as a real person who cares about the bullshit both sides do, I can see how much this sub has changed in just the time I started looking here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 9/11 stuff that brought me here. It was a nice little sub at the time 3 maybe 4 years ago. It seemed like over night, the comments started. You're a shill, you troll, this sub is so stupid and anyone who believes anything against the DNC is a trollllllll! Next came some Donald people posting things they couldn't in politics, so I can see how people thought this could be Donald 2. But it really wasn't even then. As people started to dig deeper and actually had proof of DNC conspiracies it became even more shilly. People came his to discuss "Stupid" Conspiracy theories and would NOT call each other down as people do now. People who didn't like this sub wouldn't come here let alone post things.
      </p>
      <p>
       2016 changed ALL of that. The DNC leaks in full force, Trump gaining huge and beating out the establishment Republicans. More and more people coming here and calling everyone stupid for believing in this stuff EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS ALL RIGHT THERE! Shills shouting people down, bots down voting everything. This was the time I started to wonder why everyone was so Anti Trump. I get it, he said things, does things and acts like a big jackass. He's so far up his own ass he can see out his ears. A fat pile of shit and orange how could anyone want to look like an orange? His deals aren't really deals at all just scams to make him and his family richer. Funny thing is replace Trump with just about anyone's name and what I said still fits. Except the orange part, that is weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza Gate makes it first appearance. Anyone with a slight connection is in immediate damage control. It amazed me how this was called fake news immediately and not even thought as possibly happening. If I accused my neighbor of this and didn't even have leaked emails, I'm pretty sure cops would be all over their house in a few days to investigate. None of that happened and the leaked emails were proven to be authentic. If they didn't find shit on my neighbor I'd be in trouble this time. The cops basically asked "Hey, you fuck kids in this place?" Pizza guy says "No" cops are like "Okay see ya... Alright people see its fake you're all stupid now go look over there, Trump tweeted again!"
      </p>
      <p>
       All this just seems so fucked up, yet it's the Russians who hired trolls to influence our election, and I can't believe I fell for it for so long. I don't understand how I was influenced by them? Hillary Clinton isn't shady, a liar, she never did anything illegal and even stood by her husband during a cheating scandal, like any strong independent woman would. I can't believe I fell for the whole code words like Cheese Pizza mean Child Porn. I can't believe I fell for the fact that Comet Ping Pongs Instagram had a kid taped to a table, or the fake #ChickenLover tag or some guy in drag rolling around in blood in a FAMILY RESTAURANT!. I don't think I'll recover from being lied to by these Russian Trolls. With this new information coming it makes me wonder how good they are? They got the woman from CNN blamed for leaking questions to Hillary. They convinced Debbie to step down from DNC chair for cheating so Hillary hired her, I'm so happy she deserves it, after the Russian Trolls ruined it. The RTs EVEN got the DNC to change debate dates and take some off. Even after Hillary wanted more debates, anytime, anywhere she'd be willing to debate, but those damn RTs hacked the DNC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways I'm sorry for believing the RTs I hope one day we can get rid of Trump and get Hillary and DNC back.

       Precisely. If we turned our back to Israel there'd be 10 9/11s. Who am I kidding though, Israel still runs the show, or should I say, the man who created Israel.

       Right. The MSM told me all about the Russians, and they never lie, ever. I love reading about the Russians all day on every major political sub, and every time I'm bored enough to see what the corporate owned MSM talking heads have to say. I'm pissed this sub isn't overrun with Russian conspiracies too!

       I guess many users think it is strange that the only message being pushed by all of the media is your conspiracy theory, and then when someone challenges that narrative you guys start belittling and generalizing the community here. A community that you are part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I don't believe users are disgusted by the sub. I think the plan is to make this sub so toxic that the real users leave after watching their place of discussion die off
      </p>
      <p>
       If they actually discussed the issues instead of attacking the users, I'd be more willing to actually talk to them.

       No. Thankfully cops don't spring into a full scale investigation because of an

       The Russian trolls and bots will go down as the most brilliant, talented, magical wizards in history. And don't despair. Hillary still has a chance! As soon as the MSM proves that Drumpf really does use Russian salad dressing on all his salads, that will be the end of him! The whole election will be proven to be illegitimate because everyone read the emails the Russians released that were engineered to look like the DNC was a corrupt piece of shit, and Queen Hillary will take her rightful place at the throne, because it's her turn, dammit!

       Yep, must be. There is only one correct answer and you'll hear about it first here on CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama administration oldies have been leaking info, disrupting the current president and believes he is a Russian plant. They run a smear campaign without releasing any evidence and Intel community just tells us to trust them.

       This is where I refuse to take the leap of faith because I'm not getting burned again like we did with Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government is going to be run by these 'soft leaks' halting all legitimate investigation. You can't have a real investigation if you're in control of the narrative and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are going to see more of this. This will be our new lives, constantly begging our government to explain while they refuse and create hassle.

       Right. The MSM told me all about the Russians, and they never lie, ever. I love reading about the Russians all day on every major political sub, and every time I'm bored enough to see what the corporate owned MSM talking heads have to say. I'm pissed this sub isn't overrun with Russian conspiracies too!

       I guess many users think it is strange that the only message being pushed by all of the media is your conspiracy theory, and then when someone challenges that narrative you guys start belittling and generalizing the community here. A community that you are part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I don't believe users are disgusted by the sub. I think the plan is to make this sub so toxic that the real users leave after watching their place of discussion die off
      </p>
      <p>
       If they actually discussed the issues instead of attacking the users, I'd be more willing to actually talk to them.
