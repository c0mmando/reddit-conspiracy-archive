        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is ONE generation that has been primarily in control from the 90&#39;s until now. The boomers. No other generation in the history of the US has created such an insurmountable challenge for the people that will remain after they are dead and gone. The boomers are post WWII. They were born into pure hope and promise. The &#39;golden age&#39; of the US. Generally speaking they were born and grew up in a time when everything was gold. What they experienced as natural prosperity they believed was inherently theirs. THEY have labelled every generation after them &#39;entitled&#39; while being the most deluded and destructively greedy generation of all time. Generally speaking.</p>

<p>The Boomers are those born from 1946 to 1964 and they have been in control of the US (some might argue the planet) since the late 80&#39;s and really picking up in the early 90&#39;s when A young Boomer Bill Clinton took office. Every single president since then has been a boomer. In fact the entire government has been dominated with boomers exactly as GDP crashed, debt sky-rocketed, prisons full of younger generations swelled, and an Orwellian surveillance state was born. All to entrench their control and undying lust for accumulation of money and power. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer more than any other time in American history. The rich elite are boomers (generally speaking).</p>

<p>Crisis and awakenings shape generations. And the boomers grew up in a world that they believed was theirs. They whined about and took power from the generation before them that saved them from Hitler. They metaphorically and literally enslaved (surveillance) and imprisoned the generations after them. </p>

<p>They voted for themselves (en masse the largest voting demographic for decades), they raped the country and it&#39;s future and they milked the generations after them of the promise and hope they were given. They lie, they are paranoid, they sociopathic. </p>

<p>Now they are dying and they are clinging with a vast system of prisons, surveillance and a HUGE war chest of wealth they have accumulated. They have entered their bunkers and may take the entire world down with them.. because that&#39;s what sociopaths do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You certainly have a lot of hatred for this group as a whole. Surely you must realize that you cannot accurately categorize the whole boomer generation in this manner, just as my boomer generation cannot accurately categorize all Gen Xer&#39;s as unemployed, lazy, drug addicts, although plenty of you are.
There are as many differences among the people in my generation as there are in yours. We are not all old blind fools being led around by our noses, nor are we all in positions of wealth and power. You seem like a very intelligent person, but this is not a well thought out rant, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was three times in the OP that i was sure to include &#39;in general&#39;. Clearly it&#39;s a generalization.. but it&#39;s entirely accurate. I&#39;m not angry. I&#39;m hopeful. Just pointing out the facts. And the fact is the hold Boomers have is slipping due to the natural aging process. If they don&#39;t drag us into civil and world war due to bitter clinging to power and money then a golden age is dawning. Lots to be hopeful about.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t because it&#39;s not accurate. If it&#39;s true then produce the statistics. I&#39;d say that statistically Boomers are on more drugs than any generations that came after them. If we include alcohol then again Boomers likely come out ahead. In terms of productivity.. Why has debt increased 1000 times over since Boomers have taken power? What happened to the GDP in the US since the Boomers took control of the workplace and industry? Stats are all there. Let&#39;s not mention the effect of the highest prison population in the world.. Also constructed under the Boomers.. Have the boomers rightfully assumed we needed put all these people in prison because they are bad? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are not all old blind fools being led around by our noses, nor are we all in positions of wealth and power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh i can absolutely agree with this. 100%. The problem boomers are in plain sight. The one&#39;s that have been in power for the last 30 years. Whose wealth and power increased inversely proportional to the destruction of the environment, the number of ongoing wars, the explosion of corruption, surveillance statism, massive prison system. We can say it&#39;s all coincidence. But historians and people who objectively look at the facts will see otherwise.</p>

<p>You are in r/conspiracy because you aren&#39;t one of the boomers that make up the demographic being discussed here. There are many like you that suffer the reign of the sociopaths in power... who are also boomers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to write such a well thought out response. I really appreciate it and can more clearly understand your views now.
I guess the real issue for me was that your comments were such a bitter pill to swallow. As a whole, I am profoundly disappointed in my generation. I was certain that we would be the ones to change the world. So many of us were anti-establishment, anti-war, and advocates of a natural, live and let live lifestyle. I have no idea what happened. The current prison situation is a complete disgrace. I could go on and on about the horrors and injustice of it. It truly makes me ill when I think about it for any length of time. 
Greed and corruption seem to go hand in hand with power, and unfortunately, members of my generation do hold that power currently. I just hate to be lumped in with them because of the time period of my birth. I detest them as much as you do- maybe more, because they sold out.
I look at the younger generation and see just how difficult things really are for them. Anyone who tries to tell me that things weren&#39;t really better when I was young...they just seemed that way...is crazy. Things were most definitely better. I feel sorry for anyone who is not of above average intelligence and cannot get a college education or at least have the ability to start their own business. What on earth are they going to do with their lives? Are they destined to work in the service industry until they die?
Even though there are so many things wrong today, like you, I am hopeful. I feel like we&#39;ve finally come to the tipping point. I am confident that significant change is coming. I can hardly wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your message. Since you&#39;ve been so open and honest i should be too! I am a bit angry.. mostly because I am afraid of the incoming crisis that i really don&#39;t see can be avoided. I have kids. I don&#39;t want them to go through what is coming. But i know that what will come after is exactly what everyone should be hopeful about. Growing up Genx i romanticized the 60s. Summer of love. The resistance to power and the hope and dreams of real liberalism. But you said it: the one&#39;s that sold out made a mockery of that true Awakening that held so much promise. It&#39;s sad. BUT i think the following generations can&#39;t settle for shallow truth and intoxicating awakenings. They have to institute the real thing. When the boomers fall from power that will likely be more possible then ever. Sure all these other generations will have their own sociopaths to deal with and the power beyond the power we are talking about will still need resisting and uncovering. </p>

<p>For the REAL flower children this will be a homecoming to the real age of Aquarius! The decrepit and perverted turds can go to their master and pay their dues. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fear for your children. I know that it&#39;s natural to do so, and I worry about my grandchildren going through what is ahead of us. As a mother, I look at the impending crisis as I would an upcoming birth. It&#39;s going to be painful, it&#39;s completely unavoidable at this point in time, but the end result will be worth it. You have to believe that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what your religious beliefs are, but I have a more spiritual outlook as opposed to religious. I have done a lot of research in my 65 years and I have come to the conclusion that I am in complete agreement with those who say we plan out the major details of our lives before we are even born. Psychiatrists and psychologists who work with past life regression with their patients using hypnosis have stumbled upon memories of life between lives. They all recount the same details of soul groups planning their next lives in such a way that all parties involved benefit from the experience in some way, whether it be a negative or a positive experience. Souls have clamored to be on earth at this time in history. Please know that your children know what they&#39;ve signed up for. Be proud of them. And who knows? They may come through the upcoming trials relatively unscathed and lead humanity into the kind of future that we all long for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boomers are largely a victim of corporate lies. I&#39;m regularly amazed how addicted to television the baby boomer crowd has become. There&#39;s no hope, it&#39;s like an addiction. A flow of self-affirming information beamed directly into your brain.<br/>
And for those boomers smart enough to admit it, at the root of this mass psychology is a suicidal nihilism, a internalized helplessness that will never go away. I agree with you... the best option is for that generation to die off.<br/>
The generational gap is most pronounced in the sources of our information, and so also our world view.<br/>

<p>The Millennials are dealing with growing up in a prison where boomers funneled them into their fabricated reality and surveilled them into mindless consumers. When the Boomers are gone and all the infrastructure via laws and bullshit meant to protect it are gone the Millennials will lead the awakening. When they wake up i think they are going to be extremely pissed but the weight lifted from boomers being extinct will fill the world with encouraging hope.</p>

<p>100% agree. And it will come into full fruition as soon as the Boomers no longer hold the relevance in power to stop it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about iGen.. they already live in a world online with a certain amount of freedom the Boomers have no context to understand. The Boomers have their surveillance state as a false sense of security. But i&#39;m really hopeful that when they are gone (due to the naturally aging process) the Millenials and iGen will likely drop the surveillance state BS because it&#39;s not efficient and doesn&#39;t make anything safer. It&#39;s just a control mechanism to help consolidate power for the Boomers. So when they are gone what purpose will it serve? Who wants to sit around and maintain, develop and run it? It&#39;s stupid.. It&#39;ll be like an old fax network. It&#39;s possible that the surveillance system will remain.. but it won&#39;t be as threatening or as much of an issue or concern because no one will really be doing anything with it. Some AI will run it and no one will give a shit. Eventually the natural ingenuity and technology will just grow beyond it. People in Germany don&#39;t stop at checkpoints and have their papers checked as an analogy. Well.. maybe they do again ha!</p>

<p>They are corporate liars. Just look at their fruits. Look at the prisons, ALL the tax laws that have progressively helped them as they aged that destroyed the American dream, their shitty wars, the surveillance state. I agree.. when they are gone there will be 3 generations who i truly believe can work together and potentially undo all the shit.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think American revolution? American Civil War? WWII?  were crisis for America? Are you serious?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a condition of instability or danger, as in social, economic, political, or international affairs, leading to a decisive change.</p>

<p>Umm yeah. Civil war was a stable time? The country was at war with itself. Everything was under threat. We are really going to have to disagree. </p>

<p>The crisis of 9-11 or the economic crisis of 2007 are what are defined as minor, generational defining crisis. Both of those are more significant for millenials. But a grand crisis is one that is defining for ALL generations in a society. And the last one that America went through was the Great Depression - WWII. </p>

<p>Crisis like those that profoundly effect every generation in a society and reverberate into the future happen every 80-100 years almost like clockwork and we are due right now. And it is coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the facts are easily dismissed if you can dismiss the source. These aren&#39;t my ideas or theories. I am re-posting information that is readily available. Like the fact that boomers make up the majority of the government (house, senate etc.) for the last ~30 years as well as the majority voting power. So what have they done with that power? Who are the people occupy wallstreet and the tea party were upset with? If you read my original post i made it clear i was generalizing with regards to the entire generation. But facts are facts. Another fact that many have been blinded from those growing up under the Boomers is that each generation that takes power yields very different fruits. It&#39;s not true that things just &#39;get successively worse&#39; and that &#39;new leadership is bound by the sins of their father&#39;. More debt, more prisons, more surveillance, continuous war and less hope. These aren&#39;t ideas. Take a look at the information.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Skirting responsibility or being deceitful about what one is undeniably responsible for.. that&#39;s the larger issue. Not that someone is &#39;blaming&#39;. Whilst in power have the boomers taken responsibility for what they could have changed or made better? I&#39;m hopeful for positive change. I&#39;m also correctly acknowledging where it&#39;s going to come from and where it hasn&#39;t come from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who was blaming them? The boomers. The boomers grew up in the most prosperous environment the world has EVER seen. And yet they were complaining. haha. What does that say about them? And then they take FULL control of the government for 30 years and what happens? Massive prison system, surveillance state, productivity/GDP falls most ever, environment destroyed, wealth gap rich and poor largest ever, most corrupt government ever, debt EXPLOSION, ongoing war for 30 years. Ok.. so who&#39;s fault is it? They are in POWER right now. And have been for ~30 years. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending there weren&#39;t problems in the world before them. There was. And it came to crises with the great depression and WWII. They just missed that and then grew up in an environment of prosperity that is unthinkable to the newest generations. The didn&#39;t know anything but privileged. As they hoarded they blamed the previous generations for the things they made worse and the generations after them for everything else. They were the least productive generation in modern US history and they are the wealthiest.. while debt increased what.. 20 times in the last 30 years? I guess we know where the money went. It wasn&#39;t infrastructure and industry haha. It was their doomsday war chest. </p>

<p>Watch what happens when they are gone. Their legacy is absolutely shite. They represent the 1% through and through and created a power structure that consolidated their greedy hoarded wealth rather than exposed and change the system that they were supposedly whining about in the 60s when they were all on drugs and not working. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t trying to be difficult. I wasn&#39;t sure what you believed and so whether or not i agreed. And i don&#39;t agree. </p>

<p>&quot;Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country&#39;s wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.&quot;</p>

<p>So the middle class is no longer the majority. Maybe you meant in general here on reddit?</p>

<p>You do understand that the poorest demographic in the US would still be considered wealthy in the context of ~80% of the world&#39;s population?</p>

<p>The information and perspective i laid out shouldn&#39;t be threatening to you in anyway. See where i said &quot;generally&quot; and &quot;in general&quot;. It&#39;s information meant to offer insight into the shared CULTURE of those in power. Generational demographics are a powerful tool for understanding how and why people who grew up in a particular context and who share impactful live events behave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They might not be the root cause but they are the one&#39;s in control of the government for the last 30 years and if you study history you will undoubtedly make some very interesting correlations to their rise in power and the issues of the country (and much of the world). Call it coincidence. It&#39;s completely predictable and part of a cycle that can be traced back for 1000s of years and applied to every empire&#39;s crisis and awakenings. </p>

<p>Yes there is a larger unaccountable system of power.. but they to do not escape the seasons of empire. Just like they do not escape the seasons of life. Except the one&#39;s that aren&#39;t human :)</p>

So what are the fruits of the boomer generation? The facts are the boomer generation have been in control of the government for ~30 years. So what has that group done while in power?
