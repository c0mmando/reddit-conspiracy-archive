       This sub has grown a lot in the last year, especially in the last six months. I think many new users are being easily distracted by the shit show Trump is the center of. Many are caught up with the Goldman Sachs guys, the anti-environment stances, the Russian hack narrative, and others. I think it should be important for every user here to recognize what's really going on. I've been saying this since the election: It's bigger than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a battle for dominance between the
       <strong>
        CIA
       </strong>
       and the Trump administration. This is not the people v Trump. He wouldn't have gotten elected, especially with such an overwhelming margin, if he didn't have popular support. Now, many people get caught up with the details of the Trump administration and feel that that is an important issue to address. I'm no Goldman Sachs fan, and I know Trump is and egotistical douchebag, but I think that it's important to pick your battles and take it all one step at a time. We've known for decades that the CIA is responsible for
       <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/CIAtimeline.html">
        <strong>
         countless atrocities
        </strong>
       </a>
       around the world as well as domestically. We've known for years that the CIA controls the media as a means to manipulate and deceive the public. With that knowledge, we should all know to
       <em>
        not trust the mainstream media.
       </em>
       They've lied countless times and pushed bullshit narratives to distract and manipulate. Now, they're not getting away with it. If
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       would have mentioned the possibility of a "shadow government" even a year ago, you would have been called crazy. That's not to say we should all listen to Breitbart or InfoWars instead, rather we look at
       <strong>
        verifiable facts
       </strong>
       and make
       <em>
        rational and logical
       </em>
       conclusions based on those facts. The CIA saying Russia hacked the DNC does not make it a fact. The facts are that the CIA created their own shadow NSA with the most powerful hacking tools in the world, lost them, and are now trying to cover up their tracks. The facts are that the CIA has lied before and will lie again and again. And judging by how concentrated the shilling effort is to get Trump impeached, we need to concentrate our effort on exposing their wrongdoings rather than bitching about Trump. Where are we going to be after Trump is gone? Still under the CIA and her corporate leaders' boot. We can take advantage of having this man in office and encourage him to take down the corrupt CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       More people are waking up to corruption. But I think it's important to recognize the bigger picture. It's very easy to get distracted by the MSM anti-Trump narrative because it's in your face 24/7. However, we all need to take a step back from Trump, and look at the bigger picture. I'm not saying that Trump doesn't deserve criticism, everyone should be criticized for bad things they do. But we need to remember our history. Just search "CIA" in the r/conspiracy search bar, and you'll have countless examples of why we should focus on exposing the CIA before we expose Trump. We can use this opportunity to bring
       <em>
        real, lasting change
       </em>
       to the U.S. It won't be easy, but we can do it if we as individuals commit to being informed of the FACTS, recognize the BS the MSM and the CIA are feeding us, and actively combat it in an organized fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sick of the political division on this sub, and all of us should recognize the big picture, that is the CIA and her corporate leaders. Trump's "corruption" is a non issue and should be treated as such in order to recognize where the
       <em>
        real corruption
       </em>
       lies. Many may say "why can't we do two things at once?" Just think about it. If we get a concentrated effort going, the purpose of which is to avenge those the CIA has killed, free the people from the bullshit they put us through, and bring peace to countries that haven't seen it in decades, I
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       that we will have an impact. We can take this country back, we just need to stop bitching about the guy in office and focus on who the
       <em>
        actual baddies
       </em>
       are.

       If we expose the CIA, another corporation is going to take over. And if you expose that one as well, another is going to take over. That's the vicious cycle of this world and and imo, it's irreversible. The corruption, greed and evil is this world is waay too deeply rooted.

       Not if we, the people, take power back. Each individual must take it upon themselves to be informed, get off their asses, and put forth the effort it takes to create a movement. We're done with corporations. We're done with corruption. It no longer serves a purpose, and it's no longer a secret. They can't take over if you're not complicit. Stop being complicit.

       Deep state needs to be retired.  We the people are sick of it.  It shouldn't matter if you are left or right on the issues...I think we lost control after JFK to be honest.  Deep state has been getting fat ever since then.  Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting!

       Agreed, this is not a partisan issue, this is about the well being of the people. We can make a difference if we all make the decision to dedicate our time and effort to growing the awareness. Spring is here, summer is on it's way, it's time for protests. It's time for a new social media platform where productive discussion can be had. It's time for the people to stand up and fight for their rights. Year Zero.

       We lost control after WW1, Woodrow Wilson, the establishment of income taxes, and the Federal Reserve. The bankers got a taste of American debt and financing the military industrial complex. This is when they began to rule the country, while using our labor as collateral for the debt.

       I think that the conflict we are seeing is a tug-of-war on American policy (and government). The Bush/Clinton/Giustra wing got whacked in the last (s)election, which marks the end of their effective reign. The question in my mind is, "who are the powers behind Trump?" First off, it was people who knew the details of the aforementioned network. I think that it could include Thiel, Rothschilds, and half of Israel. ... My conspiracy theory is that this is leading toward's Pike's prediction of WW3, in which the forces of Zionism and Islam will destroy each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what anyone believes about the Russia hearings, it will lead nowhere. It is a fact that the committees are red-led, so this is all just theater. I think that the impression of Trump being embattled does more to stir up his support base, than anything. I do think that he will eventually get impeached for
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       (claiming no idea what it is - he has a Nixon feel to him). Still, the idea that he is being sabotaged by blue team will delay the disillusionment of many of his followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that really sucks about the Russia fiasco that both sides believe in the righteousness, omniscience, and omnipotence of the surveillance state. I keep saying this, because it needs to be said,
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       wants to end domestic surveillance on citizens,
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       wants to restore the rights of due process, and
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       is stopping (or even slowing) US military activities throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all in this together. We pay the taxes, We fight the wars, and we are the the actual victims of the Wars on Drugs and Terror. Tell your friends... shit's gonna get a lot worse along the way. Be good to each other.

       Some have all the dirty rags and proof of everybody's closet skeletons safely stored in some remote, huge desert server. Some have the logistics and networks to move weapons and men 24/7 ASAP. Others have control of the crime organizations that bring lots of under the table money. And so on.

       Whoever it is fighting against each other, it's an opportunity that we can take advantage of. While they're fighting over dominance, we as a people can rise up and start making demands. We're sick of the media. We're sick of the CIA. We're sick of congress. We're sick of the corporations. It's so incredibly recognizable, if we don't do something about it now, I doubt we ever will.

       The Russians and Chinese don't secretly undermine the politics of other nations as a pretext to use their military to invade and simply take whatever their corporations happen to want by force and coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They expand their influence by striking fair and mutually beneficial deals with them instead. As a result both of them now have a rapidly growing and expanding middle class, while the middle class in US and in all or the allied countries that go along with way the US deals, are shrinking and falling into poverty.

       There are a lot of unworthy people going through life with evil means who nobody is really scared about.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i mean is this: egoists do not scare people. A man just wanting to rape a kid a month and get away with it is a sick man, but he's not going to panic you, instead he's going to run and hide from you. Conventional evil isn't our problem. It can be managed easily when good is on top.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is spiritual evil. Those that find a mission in evil. Those that are ready to anything we are ready to do for good but instead for evil. This person is a threat. This person probably works for the CIA, too, directly or indirectly.
Evil is a cliché, but those who really believe the inversion "evil is good" instead of "this evil is good for me" of the egoists, are the ones who are going to be hellish.

       Bush in '88. Actually I believe it could be strongly attributed to the support he gained from coal country by promising to bring all their jobs back.

       So all those people who bussed around to different cities flooding the polls, all of the illegal immigrants getting paid to vote, the ridiculous ability to vote more than once in many states, all of those were taken advantage of by the Hillary campaign. Just like the primary. But this time, because that was exposed, it didn't work the second time.

       I think it's probably hard to have hard evidence of that, but based on many cities like Philly and especially Detroit during the election, there was a lot of fishy shit. Then what Project Veritas exposed was probably just the tip of the iceberg.

       Semantics, its called foresight. They still had big cities and rural areas leading them to conceive such a concept. The EC is actually a great system if you take away all the gerrymandering and unnecessary shady BS.

       I agree gerrymandering is a problem. That's why I think we need to get rid of the electoral college because it's been manipulated to such a high degree. Draw the districts in a certain way to make sure it's unfairly skewed so your party's candidate can win the districts. And it seems to disproportionately benefit the Republican Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also need to do away with "winner take all" states. The race in that state could be 51% to 49% and the loser doesn't get any electoral votes at all. How is that reasonable? Combine that with gerrymandering districts and the electoral college gives a hugely disproportionate representation of the country's votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the main reason the electoral college was created is because most of the population was illiterate in the 1700's. So they made the electoral college to ensure that informed/educated individuals have the final say so someone crazy or unqualified wouldn't get elected by an ignorant populace. And in that sense, the electoral college failed miserably this past election.

       It's a lot bigger than even that. This is a movement by many nations against the clutches of globalism. This is why Le Pen is getting the same drilling as Trump. This is happening everywhere: Russia, Iceland, Hungary, Spain, Greece, Italy. This is about the collapse of the new world order. A true paradigm shift. Trump is just one player in something that is huge.

       Right, should we say, rogue criminal elements of the CIA, in conjunction with rogue criminal elements of Massad, MI5, etc.  we throw around terms like Deep State, illuminati, banksters, cabal, etc, but in actuality it's global crime syndicates. And they're not all working for the same goals in fact. Like any mafia mentality, they fight amongst themselves while agreeing on some things.

      <p>
       I think its important to note this. But first, i have a really big broner for Trump. Big fan. Need to be upfront so judge accordingly. I also do seek truth, and Trump, with all his flaws is a force of good. He didnt live a life of a politician. He has baggage. But hes a patriot, i have no doubt. His love and pride for this country and vets is undeniable. And this goes back a long long time. Thats my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But heres what I want to see in his defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody was backing Trump, ok. He did this with his own money and money from the people. Small donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)No saudi money (infact Trump insulted the prince of SA on twitter) “dopey.” "Ahwaleed Bin Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected,". This was after the prince insulted him.
       <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2015/12/donald-trump-a-disgrace-tweets-billionaire-saudi-prince/">
        www.rawstory.com/2015/12/donald-trump-a-disgrace-tweets-billionaire-saudi-prince/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The RNC and GOP didnt back him. Some do now, but like bloody hell, they didnt before. They never thought he had a chance. They laughed,even. They were for Bush, Rubio, Cruz. I dont think they ran any adds or anything for him. Maybe the last week...but doubt it. Speaker Paul Ryan is anti-Trump (hot mic), the never trumpers. The Trump tape was a coordinated hit and exposed many anti- trump within  the GOP
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Obviously the democrats hate him. Theyre on a witch hunt and still in campagin mode to get him impeached and smear him with russian accusation, when, in fact, the democrats are russias best friends(uranium, sberbank and podesta, john podesta and russian energy,  the reset).
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Forbes top 100 CEO's were against Trump!
       <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/no-fortune-100-ceos-back-republican-donald-trump-1474671842">
        www.wsj.com/articles/no-fortune-100-ceos-back-republican-donald-trump-1474671842
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       5) 96% of journalist donations went to hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/18/revealed-96-percent-of-medias-campaign-donations-went-to-clinton/">

        www.time.com/money/4533729/hillary-clinton-journalist-campaign-donations/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Hollywood was against trump
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Silicon Valley was against Trump. Facebook, google, snopes, politifact, twitter, wikipedia. The ceo of google spotting with a hillary VIP badge. President of facebook in wikileaks saying shell do everything in her power to elect hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Of course George Soros and his never ending web of foundations, activist groups, organizations, bought politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) the bushes. George Bush came out of hiding to criticize Trump a little. The left all the sudden like Bush for a week (wtf!). He ran against low energy Jeb.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here is Trump's enemies. 
 -The GOP.
-The democrats (so the entire establishment).
- the tech world(silicon valley).
- hollywood. 
-MSM. 
- Saudi Arabia.
- george soros.
-the clintons. 
-the bushes.
-The Deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure im forgetting about some, but good god, look at those enemies! Look what he was up against. Thats a pretty good list of enemies. Even if you dont like Trump, for conspiracy subs standards the enemy of my enemy looks pretty good, ya?  Trump even goes on alex jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe people forgot or not aware, but fox news wasnt even for Trump. I know the exact day they started covering him fairly. It was the day after the catholic spring emails, that showed top hillary staffers mocking the Murdoch's faith. They were making fun of the murdochs and talking about how they have people inside the church, changing it from within. That explains why the pope is a marxist radical. Fox news was for Cruz, rubio and bush. Trump was always considered the clown, not to be taken seriously. Fox only posted his foibles and drama. After that wikileak, they started covering his message.

       I love how the only way to support Trump is argue that despite all of his corporate serving policies, despite his obvious shilling for the establishment, and because the CIA is rightfully investigating his deep and treasonous ties with Russia, it must be some sort of noble crusade against fake deep state boogeyman and fake globalism boogeyman

       What about Obama, Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, and numerous other members of the IC saying that Russia hacked the DNC?

       That's your opinion, which I think is unfounded. How about everyone stops downvoting Russian conspiracy threads just because they upset people.

       This write-up is one big concern troll piece. "Sure you can criticize Trump, but at the same time you should ignore all criticisms about Trump because we can only focus on one thing at a time (and it should be the CIA)"

       You're in r/conspiracy man, you're not fooling anyone. The CIA is historically the most corrupt and destructive organization known to the world, and just because some clown gets elected simply to piss everyone off, we're supposed to start siding with the likes of Dick fucking Cheney and the rest of the globalist elite?

       Well, I think Obama

        and Trump

       got their narrative that Russia hacked the DNC based on evidence provided to them by the entire IC, not just CIA. And I bet that evidence involved human intelligence, which isn't easily fabricated.

       <strong>
        What?
       </strong>
       Now opposing Trump means you're siding with Dick Cheney and co? No it doesn't, they are separate issues. You seem to think Trump will do something about your globalist bogeymen, but he won't. I 100% guarantee it. He is a billionaire who is profiting off of the presidency. His companies are having deals approved left and right all over the world right now because of his new position.

       Let me know in a few years how you feel after the Trump presidency is over and he's tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars richer, and nothing changed in the world except that he avoided corruption probes because of people like you that thought he would be a useful ally.

We are witnessing the deep state in turmoil, coming up with a bunch of bullshit to try and manipulate the people. We need to stand up and say we're not falling for it.

       Only Wikileaks would know who the LEAKER is, although their actions point to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the FBI were not allowed to investigate the DNC servers (Well that's not shady is it?). They relied on the sketchy Obama/DNC paid Crowdstrike reports that "there were signs of Russian intrusion". How's that for transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vault7 leaks should already tell you that even if there were "signs", Trump was right all along,
       <strong>
        that you cannot tell where the originating hack came from as it is easily falsifiable
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Still the "russsian hacking" , is a red herring, because Wikileaks state it is a leak, and this has been corroborated by political and IC insiders

       If the CIA, FBI, and all MSM is against this guy, and yet to show any viable proof of anything, then he likely poses a huge risk to the corrupt establishment. Is a non-puppet president really that hard to come by?

       Yes. The NSA had a file on Obama since he was a Senator. They have a file on anyone of any significance. Surveillance is not to prevent terrorism as the alphabet agencies have been aiding and likely behind every major US terrorist act for how many years
      </p>

       1.Oklahoma
      </p>
      <p>
       2.911
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Boston Marathon etc
      </p>
      <p>
       these are all suspect when you examine outside of the corporate owned narrative
      </p>
      <p>
       The surveillance is for keeping blackmail records for all potential and future political assets or agitators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at convicted pedophile Speaker of the house Hasterts case (refer to ex FBI Sibel Edmonds), the FBI keep years of records on his child molesting, those "white hat" Feds thought they were monitoring him to collect evidence for a dossier to put him to justice, but the executive/deepstate locked that evidence away until 10 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The deepstate MO is to put only compromised individuals in key positions for control
       </strong>
       . You can see how this all ties in to Pizza/pedogate CIA brownstown operation. We've come full circle.

       Very well said. Thx for sharing.
I just hope Trump has higher ups in the military ready for when the CIA tries continuity of government, which I think is active still, as a way to take out liberty people, our president, etc. and run things openly. I say this as it is starting to look like they are failing. What is their emergency plan?

       It doesn't matter. I'll go off public support. Can't fake the crowds that he drew every single rally over the election. Hillary was too hungover/sick to do anything herself, and Kaine was cancelling his appearances left and right. They couldn't even rig Florida. That's just sad and tells you how many people really wanted Trump and how many people just didn't give a fuck about Hillary.

      <p>
       In the end you have to put trust into someone, because no one of us is capable of getting out there and collect information all by ourselves. Mainstream media are trustworthy not because they have never lied. They are trustworthy because they are capable of collecting information that most other people cannot. Most information we can easily vet with logic. For those that we cannot, it is important to realize the probabilities of each option and the risks of going down each route.

       You are naive to think Trump would be able to take down the CIA, or that he is somehow less corrupt than the CIA.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are even more naive to think corruption is somehow inherently bad. Corruption is the pillar of capitalist politics, and often times people enjoy the result of it without knowing. All the public welfare policies are essentially bribery from politicians to get votes. They differ from private gifts only in scale. The primary reason politicians prefer public welfare policies over private gifts, is the institution of gaining power -- election. Therefore --

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We can use this opportunity to bring real, lasting change to the U.S.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The largest conspiracy in the US is gerrymandering, and the most real, lasting change the US can benefit most from, is electoral reform. CIA is but a small part of one of the executive branch of the government. Electoral reform can have much larger effects by improving the representativeness of the legislature, and thus pass laws beneficial to the most general public. The biggest spy in the US is not CIA -- it's everyone! There is no law in the US that mandates the digital privacy of the US people. Google, Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc., any company is thirsty for your data. That website you do tasks on to get discounts, too. As a result of the Trump presidency, the only regulation that somewhat mandated such privacy was
       <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-sides-cable-and-telephone-industry">
        removed
       </a>
       . This is not a problem with more proportionally represented European countries, as they have much stronger privacy mandates than the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, if the US people truly have legislative power, it would be possible to straightforwardly outlaw secret surveillance on the US people, and command the state machine to stop the CIA. The
       <em>
        actual baddies
       </em>
       are not the CIA, nor President Trump, not even the Congress. They are the electoral system, specifically the redistricting process, the first-past-the-post voting method and the Electoral College.

       Is it not possible that both the CIA and Trump are equally dirty? It's not mutually exclusive to say that both need to be taken down.

       I wouldn't say anywhere near equally. There's no hard evidence against trump that wasn't blown out of proportion. The CIA and trump have been at each other's throats for a few months, especially before the inauguration, so I find it safe to say they're not on the same team. I think we need a people's movement. Not led by any politician or celebrity, but by the masses. The people. Because in the end, were the only ones who are going to change anything.

       I would agree that there has been no hard evidence presented yet clearly showing illegal collusion Russia. My problem with believing it's all a CIA manufactured lie is the extremely large amount of circumstantial evidence that is out there. The Flynn fiasco, the Sessions meeting, what is now being reported about Jarod Kushner, the removal of the position on Crimea from the Republican Party platform, everything Roger Stone has said, and the simple fact that Trump acts like a man who is guilty leads me to believe that there is substance to the allegations. I have no love for the CIA, and the most recent Wikileaks dump shows that they do have the capacity to make everything appear as they want it to, but I absolutely do not trust Trump. As for a people's movement, that is indeed what we need. The problem is that both sides are so entrenched that finding a broad consensus appears impossible.

       We can use wikileaks to rally behind if we need to. The problem is just how incredibly distracting everything about Trump is. And it's meant to be a distraction. You can't trust the MSM and when they push a bullshit and unfounded narrative, along with recognizable shills pushing the same narrative all over the internet, I think it's pretty safe to say that this story is a manufactured distraction. So, let's focus on taking down the CIA and avenging Kennedy. Nonpartisan. r/OccupyLangley

       I am non partisan. Just because I'm not condemning him for unfounded rumors started by the CIA, doesn't mean I support him. I didn't even vote for him. I don't think any of us should rely on him. But we shouldn't and we can't rely on anyone else either. So, this is a good time to have a people's movement to end it all and bring awareness to the bigger picture.

       I'm not saying trump is good, I'm saying that the real bad guy is a lot deeper than trump. It's very short sighted and narrow minded to think trump has all the power and that somehow he's gonna fuck everyone over more than we already are.

       Clearly it appears as if there are warring factions within the Deep State right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm still having a hard time placing Trump in any of this. He has so many ties to the establishment and Deep State and other wealthy powerful families it's hard to tell where he really stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Trump could be planned opposition. The whole Russian narrative and war with the mainstream media could be a designed distraction. Or, the Deep State is purposely making the whole thing up to distract and discredit Trump. Both situations are equally as plausible and we just simply don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Trump fighting the Deep State? Or is he working with them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do agree with is the Deep State has too much power. We don't even really know how big it is, or how much of our lives it has it's tentacles wrapped around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone shilling Deep State pushed agendas and narratives isn't your friend.

       I agree, it's confusing as hell. I think we deserve some answers though don't you? We still have those $65k of hot dogs and pizza used with taxpayer money under Obama that Wikileaks released. And a lot more than that. We deserve answers. We need to organize and demand answers.

       This shits been going on since the 1920's maybe even earlier. So it's hard say what the solution is. JFK arguably tried and died because he tried to fight the Deep State, and he was President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta is clearly talking in coded language in his emails which suggest ties to human trafficking. He's some kind of Deep State slavelord, as someone's still protecting him despite Hillary's loss. The fact Hillary didn't even fire him when he had his emails leaked and said horrible things about her tells you he was more than just her campaign chair, he potentially had authority over Hillary herself. Never seen anything like it really. The fact he's still a free man and not under investigation or arrest is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump actually starts prosecuting these people we will finally know where he stands. But the left will flip out thinking he's some kind Nazi no matter how damaging the evidence is against Podesta and his Deep State cronies.

       I don't think he will prosecute unless the people demand it. The people need to rise up and demand change. He may be the only man to respond to popular opinion if we can concentrate our effort in a non partisan manner and voice our frustrations.

       Trump under constant attack from the Democrats, Republicans, media and intelligence agencies. They leaked a tape on him from 2006 that they no doubt were using to blackmail him. He refused to let them use it as blackmail and overcame it. He constantly points out the corruption in politics, in the intelligence agencies and in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet people on this very thread lump him in the same class as Hillary. 
And as for OP, what is this "Trump's corruption" you speak of? You literally name nothing specific whatsoever.
