       how do I know? I smoke lots of weed. I'm super enlightened. 
Employers shouldn't have a problem with stoners. Yet they do, because weed makes you see the reality of any situation. These businesses are greedy and only want slaves who will not think or question anything. Definitely not a weed smoker who has lots of questions. That probably the main thing about smoking weed, it gives you ideas, or questions. how ever you want to look at it. 
now go out! and smoke some weed! (where legal of course lol)

       Weed keeps you in the present moment which enhances the minds capabilities drastically as far as deeper, critical thinking goes once people get used to letting go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alcohol does the opposite. It constricts the mind while weed gives it more freedom. I'm not surprised that alcohol is legal and MJ illegal. The government does NOT want critical thinkers.

       true not all high paying jobs test for weed. I have been trying to figure out why certain employers opt to test for weed and other don't there has to be a pattern. I'm assuming it's mostly the corporate large companies that will opt for testing. meanwhile they are working to buy up and shut down all smaller competing businesses.

       I don't know of any high paying jobs that drug test, unless the position is one where you are operating some sort of machinery (industrial vehicle, crane, nuclear plant, etc) or where someone else's life is involved (healthcare).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any where else from my experience they don't give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only jobs I can think of that will drug test are low level hourly jobs (customer service associate/rep, store manager, cashier)
      </p>
      <p>
       I never heard of a lawyer, executive, or software developer having to submit a drug test.

       Yeah because when they were peons and interns they got piss tested, so the employer tends to make the faulty assumption that now that the employee has become management they still don't smoke pot.

       I was an intern for my congressman, for morgan stanley, and even worked at a hospital in college, and was never piss tested. The hospital said I was subject to one, but never got one, prb cause I never presented as under the influence of anything. They usually use that tactic to "weed" out the under performers (who usually test positive, anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       After graduating, I worked for two corporations with a national presence, and was never asked or subjected to a piss test, but of course in the contract, you can't be at the work place under the influence, and for good reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time I was piss tested was in high school, for a cashier job at Kmart and another time at a local amusement park.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe my experience was unique, but I know more people with similar experiences than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most places don't care if you get high on the weekends or whatever, as long as you don't come in under the influence of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your argument about being tested as a a peon, if you can't get clean for a week to a month to pass, that says a lot about your self discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't be "chronically enlightened".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't smoke for a few weeks, pass the test, and work your way up to a position that does't piss test. Don't come in high so that they have a reason to administer one. Its that simple if you like to smoke and want to get higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't do that to secure a good job in the long run, you may have bigger problems.

       It's mostly a liability thing for testing for insurance purposes when you start off at a new job. After that it's to "randomly" weed out the "bad" employees they don't want around.

       Yeah. I know my company would test if one of the union employees damaged something in the warehouse . Also, if a salesperson got in an accident. It seemed to me it was more about shifting liability and having something on the employee if you wanted rid of them. Even if they tested positive, they didn't always get canned- it just went in their file for future use.

       For sure, my field tests and that's because there are insurance regulations that require it, but as long as you're careful you can get by. It's sad that drug tests are better at picking out Weed more than what i'd consider to be the actually dangerous drugs.

       Yeah it sucks but it is just the nature of weed. It stays in your system so much longer than drugs that are actually harmful.

       THANK YOU. I've been saying this for ages. From my understanding and personal experience, weed strengths the brain. It makes you seek deeper and understand the root of something, instead of what's being presented to you. I've specifically noticed this with movies/TV shows. For the past year, I haven't watched a movie or an episode of a TV show sober. And I'm a lot more critical now, than I was before. I will get mad when the writers are playing with the viewers intelligence and I only want to watch movies/Tv shows that are sharply written, intelligent and make me think. Black Mirror, for example. And I completely agree that one of the many reasons, if not the MOST important reason, that weed is so frowned upon, is this. It enlightens you. It makes you think. It makes you question the motive behind an action. And this is a bad bad thing for those who USE people are their personal slaves, which is the majority of the population as well as the big corporations/businesses.

       I honestly doubt it. It was easier for the media to present weed as this harmful drug in previous years. But with the internet and so many opinions, research and information available, people are slowly realizing that weed is not what is was presented to be. I really think weed is going to start being legalized worldwide in the coming years.

       The pineal gland naturally secretes DMT. It actually releases a ton when you die and Rene Descartes said this gland is "the seat where the soul meets the mind". The conspiracy is that our government does everything they can to calcify the pineal gland (fluoride in water). But it can be decalcified and mediation can help more than anything. A decalcified pineal gland(or opening the third eye) allows us to be more in touch with the astral plane and allow us to see outside of the matrix. We are all born with this ability but few can use it. Every single living organism on earth possesses the ability to secrete DMT naturally. But why? Perhaps we are all transcendent of something greater.

       that's nice but I mean, it could also just be a vestigial organ. let me try and find the source, but the have been prior who had their surgically removed because of tumors or whatever, and they are still able to dream and everything, it had no effect.

       Before I knew I was targeted I was blessed to have a lot of time and weed to practice astral projecting, it helped A LOT. After few months I was seeing other dimensions and floating. I
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       more vibrations when I smoke weed and meditate, it helps connect people with each other and the universe, once I described this connectedness as God to a friend...namaste OP :]

       I heard you can fight aliens on the astral plane, anyone got links? TY

       There is no "they" in your mind. That's multiple personalities and opinions in your own mind fighting. Next time you smoke and feel pain and shivers, tell yourself "we are not at war, we are not fighting". Work on your core strength, too. It's called the "core" for a reason. It'll keep you strong. Don't worry about things or people, either. Just actions, do as much or little as you want with your actions. The more you do, the more you get back. Thinking about it does nothing and stresses you mind out. Big mistake people make is worrying. Example, other day, girl comes home from work saying someone fainted at her work, 6 paramedics showed up and wheeled her through the store on a stretcher. Everyone stopped and stared wondering if she was okay. Why? She has SIX highly trained paramedics with her. Best hands she can possibly be in. You should feel great! Thank those dedicating their working time to helping, not worry. Now, if you see the lady go by and panic, fill yourself with worry, what happens? You have no fucking clue once she leaves the building. Your mind hates incomplete stories. Why open that book? a lot of people assume the worst now a days, and whatever fate for her you manifest in your mind becomes true to you, even if she went home that night just fine and got her blood sugar fine, or whatever it was. Why carry that guilt and pain? It doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remind yourself of that and you will be fine mang. Pain is only created by the self.

       Worrying and acknowledging are different things. I acknowledge the multitude of atrocities being brought to light, but I don't worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go to the dictionary, as I now often do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worry(v.): to torment oneself with or suffer from disturbing thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
       Why torment yourself with things you didn't do? If someone molests a child and you didn't, why feel that pain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledge(v.): to recognize truth or fact, of existence
      </p>
      <p>
       Which one sounds healthier to you? This is a huge threat to anyone's mental health, and I wish people here could recognize and distinguish between the two.

       I will point out that weed is schedule 1 along side heroin and meth, which is a dramatic over scheduling. It wont even allow for universities or labs to test for efficacy of the drug in medical settings. However, cocaine, is a lower level scheduling and can be used and is used all the time in universities to test for medical capabilities. There is something behind this weird scheduling

       That's absolutely not the same thing as being enlightened. I would agree with this post 100% if you hadn't used the word
       <em>
        enlightenment
       </em>
       , as this gives a false equivalence to what that word actually means.

      <p>
       Marijuana helps you think differently, and I'm an advocate of marijuana for this and other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlightenment, however, is a realization that is beyond thought. Though there are several ways to attain enlightenment, smoking some weed and
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       you're enlightened is a way to fool yourself into thinking you've achieved something that you probably haven't.

       well if you read fantasy books all day while you smoke weed it doesn't really help you get enlightened. This is why america is saturating the world with entertainment. Science is real if I can test it with my hands and eyes. not television science.

       I have a question: what makes you say that you're enlightened? I'm guessing it's not just
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       you smoke weed. so you just have had some thoughts or realizations about reality and existence that would make you think you are enlightened. so perhaps you could share some of this wisdom, otherwise what else would you expect a debate about? you haven't really made any enlightened proclamations.

       well you probably aren't ready to handle the summary of my knowledge. Why should I feel compelled to convince you of your own ignorance? I know nothing about you so I don't know where you are in your own personal journey. Each person has to drop their own ego and realize what is truly important in life. It's not personal possessions , if you love any object too much you definitely are not enlightened.

       Anyone who claims to be "super enlightened" is full of shit. Enlightenment brings humility, and you have none. You are simply a know it all stoner. The world has plenty of those, you're not special.

       Super enlightened people are not so sensitive to criticism. This thread is about YOU and your supposed heightened abilities. Pointing out your hubris is not an attack, it's a legitimate counterpoint. Don't bring the Hyperboreans into this!

       You need to grow a thicker skin if you are going to brag about yourself on the internet. All I know about you is this thread. It's enough to know you are a know-it-all stoner. Remember, this thread is about YOU, if we were talking about anything else I would not have cause to comment on YOU specifically.

       The only thing I'd really be careful about here is saying that weed makes you enlightened. Weed opens your mind and grants thoughts the ability to step beyond what they've once known as their boundary. In doing that, we start seeing the world differently. That's powerful. But, it isn't the weed, per se, that makes you 'enlightened'. YOU are enlightened, the weed was a tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, true enlightenment is absolute silence. Which is why no 'truly enlightened man' says anything about it. He can't. There's nothing to say. There's just.. what is.

       I don't know of any high paying jobs that drug test, unless the position is one where you are operating some sort of machinery (industrial vehicle, crane, nuclear plant, etc) or where someone else's life is involved (healthcare).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any where else from my experience they don't give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only jobs I can think of that will drug test are low level hourly jobs (customer service associate/rep, store manager, cashier)
      </p>
      <p>
       I never heard of a lawyer, executive, or software developer having to submit a drug test.
