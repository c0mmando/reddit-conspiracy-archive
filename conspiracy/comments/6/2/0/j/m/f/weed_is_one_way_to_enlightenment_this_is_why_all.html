Employers shouldn&#39;t have a problem with stoners. Yet they do, because weed makes you see the reality of any situation. These businesses are greedy and only want slaves who will not think or question anything. Definitely not a weed smoker who has lots of questions. That probably the main thing about smoking weed, it gives you ideas, or questions. how ever you want to look at it. 
now go out! and smoke some weed! (where legal of course lol)</p>

<p>Alcohol does the opposite. It constricts the mind while weed gives it more freedom. I&#39;m not surprised that alcohol is legal and MJ illegal. The government does NOT want critical thinkers. </p>

<p>Yeah because when they were peons and interns they got piss tested, so the employer tends to make the faulty assumption that now that the employee has become management they still don&#39;t smoke pot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an intern for my congressman, for morgan stanley, and even worked at a hospital in college, and was never piss tested. The hospital said I was subject to one, but never got one, prb cause I never presented as under the influence of anything. They usually use that tactic to &quot;weed&quot; out the under performers (who usually test positive, anyway).</p>

<p>After graduating, I worked for two corporations with a national presence, and was never asked or subjected to a piss test, but of course in the contract, you can&#39;t be at the work place under the influence, and for good reasons.</p>

<p>The only time I was piss tested was in high school, for a cashier job at Kmart and another time at a local amusement park. </p>

<p>Maybe my experience was unique, but I know more people with similar experiences than not. </p>

<p>I think most places don&#39;t care if you get high on the weekends or whatever, as long as you don&#39;t come in under the influence of anything.</p>

<p>As for your argument about being tested as a a peon, if you can&#39;t get clean for a week to a month to pass, that says a lot about your self discipline. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be &quot;chronically enlightened&quot;. </p>

<p>Just don&#39;t smoke for a few weeks, pass the test, and work your way up to a position that does&#39;t piss test. Don&#39;t come in high so that they have a reason to administer one. Its that simple if you like to smoke and want to get higher up. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t do that to secure a good job in the long run, you may have bigger problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I know my company would test if one of the union employees damaged something in the warehouse . Also, if a salesperson got in an accident. It seemed to me it was more about shifting liability and having something on the employee if you wanted rid of them.

    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU. I&#39;ve been saying this for ages. From my understanding and personal experience, weed strengths the brain. It makes you seek deeper and understand the root of something, instead of what&#39;s being presented to you. I&#39;ve specifically noticed this with movies/TV shows. For the past year, I haven&#39;t watched a movie or an episode of a TV show sober. And I&#39;m a lot more critical now, than I was before. I will get mad when the writers are playing with the viewers intelligence and I only want to watch movies/Tv shows that are sharply written, intelligent and make me think. Black Mirror, for example. And I completely agree that one of the many reasons, if not the MOST important reason, that weed is so frowned upon, is this. It enlightens you. It makes you think. It makes you question the motive behind an action. And this is a bad bad thing for those who USE people are their personal slaves, which is the majority of the population as well as the big corporations/businesses. </p>

But with the internet and so many opinions, research and information available, people are slowly realizing that weed is not what is was presented to be.

    <div class="md"><p>The pineal gland naturally secretes DMT. It actually releases a ton when you die and Rene Descartes said this gland is &quot;the seat where the soul meets the mind&quot;. The conspiracy is that our government does everything they can to calcify the pineal gland (fluoride in water). But it can be decalcified and mediation can help more than anything. A decalcified pineal gland(or opening the third eye) allows us to be more in touch with the astral plane and allow us to see outside of the matrix. We are all born with this ability but few can use it. Every single living organism on earth possesses the ability to secrete DMT naturally. But why? Perhaps we are all transcendent of something greater.</p>

<p>Before I knew I was targeted I was blessed to have a lot of time and weed to practice astral projecting, it helped A LOT. After few months I was seeing other dimensions and floating.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;they&quot; in your mind. That&#39;s multiple personalities and opinions in your own mind fighting. Next time you smoke and feel pain and shivers, tell yourself &quot;we are not at war, we are not fighting&quot;. Work on your core strength, too. It&#39;s called the &quot;core&quot; for a reason. It&#39;ll keep you strong. Don&#39;t worry about things or people, either. Just actions, do as much or little as you want with your actions. The more you do, the more you get back. Thinking about it does nothing and stresses you mind out. Big mistake people make is worrying. Example, other day, girl comes home from work saying someone fainted at her work, 6 paramedics showed up and wheeled her through the store on a stretcher. Everyone stopped and stared wondering if she was okay. Why? She has SIX highly trained paramedics with her. Best hands she can possibly be in. You should feel great! Thank those dedicating their working time to helping, not worry. Now, if you see the lady go by and panic, fill yourself with worry, what happens? You have no fucking clue once she leaves the building. Your mind hates incomplete stories. Why open that book? a lot of people assume the worst now a days, and whatever fate for her you manifest in your mind becomes true to you, even if she went home that night just fine and got her blood sugar fine, or whatever it was. Why carry that guilt and pain? It doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Remind yourself of that and you will be fine mang. Pain is only created by the self.</p>

<p>Worry(v.): to torment oneself with or suffer from disturbing thoughts</p>

<p>Why torment yourself with things you didn&#39;t do? If someone molests a child and you didn&#39;t, why feel that pain?</p>

<p>Acknowledge(v.): to recognize truth or fact, of existence</p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely not the same thing as being enlightened. I would agree with this post 100% if you hadn&#39;t used the word <em>enlightenment</em>, as this gives a false equivalence to what that word actually means.</p>

<p>Marijuana helps you think differently, and I&#39;m an advocate of marijuana for this and other reasons. </p>

<p>Enlightenment, however, is a realization that is beyond thought. Though there are several ways to attain enlightenment, smoking some weed and <em>thinking</em> you&#39;re enlightened is a way to fool yourself into thinking you&#39;ve achieved something that you probably haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>You need to grow a thicker skin if you are going to brag about yourself on the internet. All I know about you is this thread. It&#39;s enough to know you are a know-it-all stoner. Remember, this thread is about YOU, if we were talking about anything else I would not have cause to comment on YOU specifically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I&#39;d really be careful about here is saying that weed makes you enlightened. Weed opens your mind and grants thoughts the ability to step beyond what they&#39;ve once known as their boundary. In doing that, we start seeing the world differently. That&#39;s powerful. But, it isn&#39;t the weed, per se, that makes you &#39;enlightened&#39;. YOU are enlightened, the weed was a tool. </p>

<p>That said, true enlightenment is absolute silence. Which is why no &#39;truly enlightened man&#39; says anything about it. He can&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing to say. There&#39;s just.. what is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know of any high paying jobs that drug test, unless the position is one where you are operating some sort of machinery (industrial vehicle, crane, nuclear plant, etc) or where someone else&#39;s life is involved (healthcare). </p>

<p>Any where else from my experience they don&#39;t give a fuck. </p>

<p>The only jobs I can think of that will drug test are low level hourly jobs (customer service associate/rep, store manager, cashier)</p>

<p>I never heard of a lawyer, executive, or software developer having to submit a drug test.</p>
