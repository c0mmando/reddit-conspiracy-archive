    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s an easy and convenient explanation...  but it&#39;s not the truth.</p>

<p>The truth is, this is r/conspiracy.  This community is dominated by conspiracy connoisseurs.  Many of us have excellent research skills and enjoy debunking conspiracy theories.  the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory is extremely weak.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a whole lot of people who have dedicated much of their lives to deciphering conspiracies who subscribe to the Trump-Russia nonsense...  More often, you&#39;ll find people who have dug so deep into it that they&#39;ve discovered the real conspiracy, a conspiracy to create the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory and a propaganda campaign to push it into the mainstream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Analysis: &quot;The Clinton Body Count,&quot; a paranoia-laden relic of the Clinton-hating &#39;90s, was resurrected in 2007 to coincide with Hillary Clinton&#39;s bid for the presidency. The widely-circulated text insinuates that several dozen &quot;friends&quot; of the Clintons, some of whom conceivably possessed incriminating information about the former First Couple, died under &quot;mysterious&quot; circumstances — i.e., were secretly done away with.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Why is it, we must also ask, that special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars attempting to dig up dirt of any kind on the Clintons, never handed down a single indictment pertaining to these alleged murders?</p>

<p>The answer is plain — because the <strong>accusations are hogwash</strong>.</p>

<p>According to an article by Philip Weiss in the February 23, 1997 issue of The New York Times Magazine, the earliest version of the Clinton Body Count was authored by Indianapolis attorney Linda Thompson, founder of the right-wing American Justice Federation. The list originally contained the names of 26 alleged victims, though it has grown, and shrunk, and grown again since then, with some variants boasting over 100 names.</p>

<p>James McDougal - Friend and business partner of the Clintons, died of a heart attack — not an apparent heart attack — while serving time on a fraud conviction. McDougal had a pre-existing heart condition. Prison guards placed him in solitary confinement after he refused to take a urine test and failed to provide him with the medications he kept in his cell, according to a subsquent investigation.</p>

<p><strong>No foul play was suspected.</strong> (&quot;Report Details McDougal&#39;s Final Hours,&quot; Houston Chronicle, 14 September 1998.)</p>

<p>Mary Mahoney - &quot;One of the first interns to work at the Clinton White House,&quot; according to her family. Not one news source reporting on her murder suggests that Mahoney, a lesbian, was poised to claim &quot;sexual harassment in the White House.&quot; She died of gunshot wounds along with two other Georgetown, DC Starbucks employees during a botched robbery attempt on July 6, 1997. Per police investigations and a written confession by the killer, Carl Cooper of Washington, DC, Mahoney was shot while struggling with the perpetrator over the keys to the safe. A witness corroborated that Cooper had been planning to rob the Starbucks for at least a month before the crime occurred. (&quot;Starbucks Police Affidavit,&quot; Washington Post, 17 March 1999; &quot;Solving the Starbucks Case,&quot; Washington Post Magazine Live Online, 3 March 2003.)</p>

Especially considering propaganda is legal and their contract with the CIA. However this is all political theatre in my opinion. It is a huge distraction employed by both sides in agreement so we don&#39;t talk about the active wars we are engaged in right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trumps response tells me all I need to know.  &quot;Obama spied on me&quot;  oops, no he didn&#39;t.  Actually, your people were caught up in incidental collection because they were talking with russian diplomats that we were watching.  now its &quot;hillary and bill are the ones you should be investigating&quot;</p>

<p>The term is distraction and redirection, and you only do it if you are trying to take the eyes off of you.  He had every reason to buddy up with Russia and they had every reason to help him get in.  When all is said and done, we&#39;ll find out he sold out his own country for a share in the state oil company or that major russian state bank the US sanctioned.  </p>

<p>Republicans need to just do a proper investigation and the democrats need to stop getting out in front and making it look like a liberal witch hunt.  This country deserves to know if its president is working with another country to get him elected for monetary favors, which is really what this looks like.  Republicans, democrats, libertarians, we deserve better and trying to cover it up like its nothing, when its pretty obvious he is, is doing a disservice to any real patriot.  If he&#39;s innocent, I&#39;m sure the republican majority in congress will rightly figure it out during the investigation. </p>

<p>Trump has the ability to declassify anything he wants, provide provable alibis for his entire campaign staff, disclose his full financial profile, put every hater and doubter in their place...yet he has done nothing but say FAKE NEWS and Look at Hillary! and leaking his own 2 page tax return. Condemning the press and public for looking into his shit but essentially leaving them no other option.

    <div class="md"><p>First, Intelligence agencies contract out their jobs like this.  It&#39;s kind of like how NIH contracts out a ton of their work to doctors in the field via grants.  It is rigorous proof when you hire a firm that specializes in that type of data analysis.  </p>

<p>Second, Vault 7 doesn&#39;t do anything to dispute the information we&#39;ve been provided enough.  Knowing that the CIA uses data that can allow them to spy on people does not disprove other data.</p>

<p>Third, you&#39;re right, I should totally trust random people on the Internet with very little information and background as opposed to an array of people from various affiliations and parties who normally don&#39;t work well together but are, just this once, saying the same thing.

    <div class="md"><p>What would Yates have testified about? According to Schiff, about Flynn:</p>

<p>“Today&#39;s hearing would also have provided the opportunity for former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates to testify about the events leading up to former National Security Adviser Flynn&#39;s firing, including his attempts to cover up his secret conversations with the Russian Ambassador,” Schiff said in a statement.</p>

<p>“We would urge that the open hearing be rescheduled without further delay, and that Ms. Yates be permitted to testify freely and openly so that the public may understand, among other matters, when the president was informed that his national security adviser had misled the vice president and through him, the country, and why the president waited as long as he did to fire Mr. Flynn.”</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/326135-schiff-yates-would-have-testified-on-flynn-at-cancelled-hearing">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/326135-schiff-yates-would-have-testified-on-flynn-at-cancelled-hearing</a></p>

<p>So, what looks for all the world like a cover-up that resulted in a man being fired from a critical government position, along with the non-action of Team Trump, which only did something once Flynn&#39;s lie was leaked to the press. Another instance of only responding to something once it was being widely circulated. Otherwise, Flynn would still be Nat Sec, nobody would know about his lobbying for Turkey. I bet Yates would be asked about that as well, including the meetings he attended that discussed extraditing that cleric...but this trail would eventually lead to Nunes, who was at the second of those meetings. So none of it would look good, optics-wise, and this continues to be Trump&#39;s number one concern. </p>

<p>All of this is public knowledge at this point. What Trump doesn&#39;t want is someone stringing these things together in a concise fashion on national television.</p>

<p>House Republicans would grill Yates about the leaks of Flynn lying info to the press, Gowdy&#39;s voice would get mean, there would be tense moments. But honestly, aside from trying to spin incidental collection into directed, partisan collection, and the bloodlust for leakers and journalists, not much going for them with Yates. </p>
