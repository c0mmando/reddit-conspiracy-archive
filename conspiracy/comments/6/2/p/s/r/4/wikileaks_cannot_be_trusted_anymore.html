    <div class="md"><p>Right the DKIM verified emails were altered. If they are altered why hasn&#39;t anyone spoken out to say so? You&#39;re about to get into Donna Brazile territory here.

<p>The cognitive dissonance is real I guess. The emails are not altered and you know that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite interesting how people like you always ignore the vast majority of the other persons argument and try and latch on to one aspect. And here you&#39;ve chosen to latch on to a lie that&#39;s easily disproven. If you really think that those emails are altered then you&#39;re as dumb as people who thought trump would &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;However, some of the emails in the WikiLeaks dump — especially among emails sent to Podesta — don’t have these signatures and can’t be technically verified. And digital signature verification wouldn’t detect tampering by omission, like if the hackers were to withhold certain emails.&quot;</p>

<p>“I’ve looked at a lot of document dumps provided by hacker groups over the years, and in almost every case you can find a few altered or entirely falsified documents,” said Jeffrey Carr, CEO of cybersecurity firm Taia Global. “But only a few. The vast majority were genuine. I believe that’s the case with the Podesta emails, as well.”</p>

<p>&quot;The metadata show that the Russian operators apparently edited some documents, and in some cases created new documents after the intruders were already expunged from the DNC network on June 11. A file called donors.xls, for instance, was created more than a day after the story came out, on June 15&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ouuuu very nice try man. Real subtle too I&#39;ll commend you on that but I&#39;m not a moron.</p>

<p>The &quot;donors.xls&quot; along with all the other documents the Motherboard article claims were altered belong to Guccifer 2.0. And Guccifer 2.0 is a hoax itself and completely fabricated. Spends sometime here and you&#39;ll be forced to conclude that as well, there&#39;s just way too much evidence proving it&#39;s a set up. </p>

<p>And while all the emails released by <em>wikileaks</em> don&#39;t have DKIM verification many of the important ones showing the most scandalous and atrocious actions by the Clinton campaign do have the verification. On top of that there is actually nothing to suggest that any of the emails released by Wikileaks are altered or forged. If any of the emails were altered it would be extremely easy for Podesta or whoever the email is about to prove their falsity. But they haven&#39;t done so, they haven&#39;t proven any of them to be fakes have they? In 10 years Wikileaks has never published a fake. Very nice try I will say but you know for a fact that the emails are real. </p>

<p>ok conceded, whatever.  But just cause they&#39;re real, do they fucking matter?  Yeah a lot of controversy has been successfully drummed up with them, but i haven&#39;t seen any credible report anyone was gonna get arrested over them either.</p>

<p>Frankly they seem to be over hyped.  Yet why they should be released and hyped at all, while  <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/293453-assange-wikileaks-trump-info-no-worse-than-him">assange admits to having trumps emails</a> but decides to gatekeep them frm the public cause they&#39;re &quot;boring&quot;</p>

<p>the agenda is so fucking obvious it hurts.  Frankly i feel in this sub like i&#39;m with a bunch of junkies who all got their minds blown by the arab spring leaks trying to chase the same high, but their dealer got orders from their boss and has cut the product down hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah so now they are real but forget about them right?! </p>

<p>What about Trumps emails! (Irony here is amazing, you started this with whataboutism) Assange said they have some info on the GOP campaign. Doesn&#39;t ever say he has Trumps emails. They should absolutely release whatever they have but to imply they have Trumps emails is just straight up lying. </p>

<p>The real emails from Clinton&#39;s campaign proved through and through that all of them should have never held public office let alone been running for president. And while no arrests may be going down yet, you can bet your ass once the Odebrecht case concludes in Brazil that there will be heads rolling in the Clinton campaign and most likely all over the world </p>

<p>Once you start admitting that Clinton is criminal we can start bridging this gap. If Trump is guilty of anything I want him to answer for it just as much as I want Clinton too. Only difference is I&#39;m starring the evidence against Clinton right in the face. </p>

<p>To sum up what we&#39;ve covered here: the emails are real, Wikileaks did follow through on publish documents on Russia, and there&#39;s massive evidence showing unethical and illegal activity on the part of Clinton&#39;s campaign </p>

<p>the point was the asymmetry, not his emails, but that releasing one but not the other is an action that paints its own picture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>years late on this one.  I was prosanders as fuck, mostly cause hill was clearly a corrupt establishment insider, ie criminal embezzler probably at least.  But trump is scum on a scale that should have never been allowed near office, his villainy is such that i want hug hillary she looks so ethical in comparison.</p>

<p>not to mention competent, god, how many hundreds of appointments has trump still not filled?  Between that and his bull in a china shop diplomacy he&#39;s doing a pretty good job validating the theory that russia propped him up to weaken us economically.  Hell he&#39;s even offering in his budget the same thing that collapsed the ussr, inflated military and drastically fucked services and revenue collection.</p>

<p>he&#39;s guilty as fuck of bribery, and using his real estate biz to launder money for rich russians, and probably a lot more.  But those who should be invstigating him, people who promised to do even more investigations in to fucking benghazi, are openly pretending theres nothing to see. </p>

<p>Right and that was in response to you pointing out the specific tweet made by Wikileaks saying they had stuff on Russia coming and then they released thousands of documents pertaining to Russia. I replied to your other comment with examples from 2016 or Russian related releases from Wikileaks </p>

<p>I could spend hours going over this if you&#39;d like, from the talks of keeping Americans uninformed, Sid Blumenthal General Grange Tyler Drumheller and their private toppling army, the IHRC, banking influence, her general disdain for Americans its all in there. The email I linked you to would make a lot more sense if you educated yourself on Odebrecht and their operation. It&#39;s really clear just how little you&#39;ve researched anything. If you want let&#39;s set up a discord and I can go through everything with you if you&#39;d like. It&#39;s plain as day man, plain as day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i feel like this whole post could be classified as disinfo.</p>

<p>wikileaks is compromised and controlled by russia, anyone with eyes sees that, but OP purposefully doesn&#39;t present evidence, probably because they&#39;ve purposefully ignored it and don&#39;t actually know any of it.</p>

<p>like how rt was the first station to air assanges show, or that they only did that after wikileaks announced they were gonna do a leak harmful to russia, but fsb threatened them and then that leak never happened.  And then he gats a show from them.</p>

<p>i mean this isn&#39;t even hidden practically, those that don&#39;t see he&#39;s distributing info on russia&#39;s behalf are not seeing that on purpose, or their just ignorant and have been tricked into thinking wikileaks is neutral.</p>

<p>it was a tweet from wikileak&#39;s official twitter.  then the threat, then less than 30 days later assange is making excuses in interviews and downplaying the whole thing- &quot;we never <em>really</em> meant <em>go after russia</em> when we said <em>go after russia</em>&quot;*  ANd then he&#39;s got a show airing on russian state media.</p>

<p>&quot;We have [compromising materials] about Russia, about your government and businessmen,&quot; Mr. Assange told the pro-government daily Izvestia. &quot;But not as much as we&#39;d like... We will publish these materials soon.&quot;</p>

<p>He then dropped a hint that&#39;s likely to be nervously parsed in Russia&#39;s corridors of power: &quot;We are helped by the Americans, who pass on a lot of material about Russia,&quot; to WikiLeaks, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from the same day October 26th 2010. </p>

<p>What did Wikileaks release about a month later? Their diplomatic cables series. Among that series there was 30,000 documents related to &quot;Russia&quot;, 3,000 documents relating to Putin, 370 documents relating to the FSB, and 1,200 documents relating to the Kremlin. </p>

<p>35,000 documents on Russia isn&#39;t enough? These documents exposed years of secrets surrounding Russia and Russian relations.

<ol>
<li> global intelligence files:
&gt;On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered &quot;global intelligence&quot; company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal&#39;s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor&#39;s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</li>
</ol>

<p>yeah <em>so</em> embarrassing to russia and not the us, really doing great proving wikileaks ain&#39;t a russian puppet with moves like this.</p>

<p>and

<p>The other issue is can you show any instances of the Russians being hacked? Every Wikileaks release can be somewhat traced back to an attack or intrusion. There aren&#39;t many instances of the Russians being hacked. They were attacked by a Ukrainian group called Cyber Hunta in October </p>

<p>And what they got (2000+ emails) was released just days later. These guys seemed confident enough to share what they stole without the help of Wikileaks. Interesting to think what allowed them that confidence. But the point is there aren&#39;t many opportunities shown for Russian things to be given to Wikileaks as they haven&#39;t been successfully attacked much. </p>

<p>or maybe their confidence was that wikileaks wouldn&#39;t help them?</p>

<p>Wikileaks has never posted a fake. And no one has claimed they have either. They published documents that hurt the bush administration and the Democratic Party, ask yourself who stands to hurt Russia while not being fond of Wikileaks and not wanting to boost their reputation at all? </p>

<p>&quot;Erdogan may think Putin is his ally, but instead, Turkey is falling far deeper under Moscow’s influence than even Erdogan may realize.&quot;</p>

<p>none of that was embarrasing to russia, hell that forbes article may as well have jsut been stroking putins ego.</p>
