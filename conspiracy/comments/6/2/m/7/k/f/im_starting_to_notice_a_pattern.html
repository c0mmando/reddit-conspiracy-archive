        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How the NY Times portrays Nationalist leaders standing outside the NWO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When he was Serbia’s information minister in the late 1990s, Aleksandar Vucic censored journalists, forced media critics out of business and served as chief propagandist for the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman reviled for the atrocities that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How those leaders describe the situation themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every newspaper must have an attitude and in this newspaper Serbia and Serbian national interests always come first,” Mr. Vucicevic said in an interview at an office where a portrait of Mr. Putin in a black fur cap looked down from the wall.While Mr. Vucicevic freely admits to being “old friends” with Mr. Vucic, he rejects accusations that The Informer is a political attack dog.“We are the only independent media in Serbia,” Mr. Vucicevic says. “Independent from the U.S. government, George Soros, the evil European Union, the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Democratic Institute,” he added, referring to Western entities that support press freedom but are often portrayed in right-wing media as henchmen for Washington.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Related: The exoneration of Milosevic buried in the final report. <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/01/the-exoneration-of-milosevic-the-ictys-surprise-ruling/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/01/the-exoneration-of-milosevic-the-ictys-surprise-ruling/</a></p>

<p>How the media describes it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US government publicly announced in October that it was &quot;confident&quot; Russia orchestrated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other political organizations of the Democratic Party in the lead-up to the election.
And in January, days before Trump took office, the US intelligence community concluded that Putin had ordered an &quot;influence campaign&quot; aimed at hurting Trump&#39;s rival, Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how Putin explains it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This anti-Russian card is being played in the interests of some political forces inside the United States with an aim to strengthen and consolidate their positions,&quot; Putin said, without naming anyone.&quot;We are seeing what&#39;s going on. They are preventing the new president from fulfilling his campaign promises on many issues: health care, other issues, international relations, ties with Russia,&quot; Putin said in remarks at a forum in the northern Russian city of Arkhangelsk. &quot;We are waiting for the situation to normalize and become more stable. And we aren&#39;t interfering in any way.&quot;</p>

He gets elected by wide margins in elections widely monitored by international watchdogs.  He&#39;s portrayed as a thug and a dictator in our press. He&#39;s obviously in the cross hairs of the NWO.

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are missing is that the Cold War was an invention of the Dulles brothers (who also happened to invent the CIA). The reality of Russian military capacities and foreign interventions <em>absolutely paled in comparison</em> to intelligence and news reporting of said activities. In this sense, the demonization of Russia in the minds of the American public (to the benefit and expansion of the MIC) is a traditional American conspiracy. Old school conspiracy buffs know this and I think that some of them assume that you do, too. In any case, 20th Century USSR was the bogeyman du jour before Islam... check out the history - it&#39;s weird and interesting af...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, it&#39;s gaslighting both sides for conflict. Headlines are carefully crafted to give plausibility to russia hacking or hoax narratives. MSM uniformity in lefty partisanship ensures that any information that they provide will be disregarded by Trump supporters (the election coverage and result give them even more reason to doubt).</p>

<p>Conspiracy folks have been down on MSM for awhille (something about 9/11, I think). It just so happens that Orange One got a lot of support by &quot;exposing&quot; the partisan hoax MSM. I would argue that it is no accident that this is playing out.</p>

<p>In other news, Mar 15 interest rate hike (the second in a <em>decade</em>) came 2 weeks before Q1 2017 GDP growth expectation was lowered to .9%. All this at a time where legislation to audit the Fed is gaining support in the House. Oh, by the way, the ever-green stock market is starting to falter...</p>

<p>To me, it is interesting how people have trouble seeing that this is all staged*.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WW3 as foretold by Albert Pike... I would use the term predicted, but a reading of the (excerpts of the letter) indicates that it was all planned since the 19th Century (quite possibly much earlier).</p>

<p>Pike claims (in 1892, mind you) that the WW3 will be between the forces of Zionism and Islam (with atheists sprinkled in there somewhere). They are supposed to annihilate each other; this, plus the blame on the role of nationalism is supposed to lead to the establishment of one government, currency, and religion - you know the drill. I am sure you have heard this before.</p>

<p>The vast numbers of Muslims in Europe (an accompanying resentment - also gaslit), plus the chaos of economic decline and EU fracture look like a pretty strong formula for militarization, and eventually war. Also, I think that the one fact that most Trump supporters don&#39;t want to face is that he is probably owned by Mossad. The Roy Cohn connection is too much for me to deny. Russia hearings will probably go on for years and will eventually lead to a political purge (of reps and senators) through the Awan investigation.</p>

<p>I could see a trap being laid, possibly, but I think Russia is definitely preventing any more middle eastern regime changes. And if they are on the side of Iran and Syria, they are obviously firmly the enemy of the Zionists. Which I sou believe is the case. So it may well be a clash between Russia, Iran, and Syria against the U.S. and NATO, but I hardly see that as Islam vs Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right about both points. Not all of it will fit cleanly within the plan (as laid out 125 yrs ago). According to Pike, WW2 was supposed to be between the forces of Zionism and fascism, but the Nazis were both Zionist <em>and</em> fascist. Holocaust revisionists will point to the fact that non-Zionist Jews (back then, the majority of Jewish population) were the most persecuted group of the era.</p>

<p>Russia is tied to Israel through Putin and the Russian mob. Supposedly, there are a lot of Russian nationals who live in Israel (Jew and gentile alike). Of course, there is the well known fact that the Bolsheviks were a Jewish-led group.</p>

<p>Just spitballing, here... if Russia drops Iran and China picks them up as client state, then the picture makes a little more sense. Another way that this could play out is if Russia leaves the MENA region, and renews its focus on the borders with former Soviet states, and the longest protected border in the world (the one they share with China). Anyhow, some developments are going to have to happen before this makes sense as a script.</p>

<p>Mr. Vucic is now &quot;consolidating power&quot; as an &quot;undemocratic autocrat&quot;, because.... he won an election.  NWO has it out for Serbia big time right now, and I can&#39;t even figure out what their offense is other than embracing Putin and thumbing their nose at the West.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is Russia does not do the same.  It does much less, but it is demonized more than the US is.  </p>

<p>It is not about &quot;whataboutism&quot;.  I see that argument a lot, but it is a distraction.  The real issue is the hypocrisy regarding US and Russian behavior.  </p>

<p>The US has about 800 military bases in more than 70 countries.  How many does Russia have?  Fucking 10!  Lol.  </p>

<p>What is that saying about rocks and a glass house?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are missing is that the Cold War was an invention of the Dulles brothers (who also happened to invent the CIA). The reality of Russian military capacities and foreign interventions <em>absolutely paled in comparison</em> to intelligence and news reporting of said activities. In this sense, the demonization of Russia in the minds of the American public (to the benefit and expansion of the MIC) is a traditional American conspiracy. Old school conspiracy buffs know this and I think that some of them assume that you do, too. In any case, 20th Century USSR was the bogeyman du jour before Islam... check out the history - it&#39;s weird and interesting af...</p>
