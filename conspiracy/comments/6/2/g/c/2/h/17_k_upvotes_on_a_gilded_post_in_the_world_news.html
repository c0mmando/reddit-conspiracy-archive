       They should provide an example of this "anti-clinton fake news", because as far as I know the barely-filled high school stadiums, this history of voting flip flops, cattle futures, whitewater, 9/11 vote, private email server, and seizures were all real things that happened.

       I think he is serious, because Clinton has some serious skeleton and her campaign drew no where near as many people as Trump.  Also, she barely campaigned, Obama did more rally's in the last 2 weeks than she did in a month.  Lastly, it wasn't the Podesta emails/Russian influence, it was Comey reopening the investigation that really hurt her chances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is no one is talking about the clear astroturfing that popped up in r/politics 4-6 months prior to the elction.  Or the fact that T_D blew up because it was one of a few subs who actually discussing &amp; combed through what was in the Podesta emails everyday.  You couldn't even discuss them in r/politics, it's the only reason I subbed to T_D was to see the daily threads.  I didn't vote for either btw, just pointing out the reality of that situation.

       when asked about "specific instances" of these fake news stories he noted two specific examples, one where trump quoted and directed people to a fake news site and headline that had been made ten minutes earlier, adn another where manafort cited a fake news story of an act of terrorism to justify one of trumps prospective policies.

well one was from sputnik and had been published literally ten minutes before, throwing up questions about exactly when trump saw it, and has since disappeared from the internet.  The other described a fake terror attack, like wholly made up.

       I suspect he saw it.

       I claim Ockhams razor.

       Think about it, Trump is the equivalent of your dad actually knowing how to use the internet, but trying to cozy up to 16 year olds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that because he himself has delivcered extensive proof. I mean, shit, when haven't his habits to tweet at 3 AM made news?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets face it, he has extensiveply provided that he has the cellphone usage habits of a 17 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea. Hillary spends her last moments before a debate apparently going over her stuff, making sure she is top prepared, while I BET Trump surfs the net, nd gets himself a dose of his own favorite compliments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it so hard to believe that Trump actually does not prep for his interviews / debates, and prefers to last minute surf around? I mean, heck, his ego is swollen, his hairpiece is on point, what's up with the rest?
      </p>
      <p>
       To make this about "Throwing up legitimate questions about when trump saw it" is like going, "The chicken is outside the cage. The door was open, it has a history of pecking the lock open, It has driven 4 owners crazy, can this hicken teleport, legitimate question?"

       Half the shit you just said is fake. One of the top posts on this sub is literally one of the fake stories. It was that story about how CNN faked the angle on a rally to make it appear bigger, but then someone faked their own angle and tried to use it as proof that CNN faked an angle, but then the actual rally was big.

       discord is an app to hop in rooms and audio chat with people. like the other person said similar to skype, but more geared for gaming with friends.

       if your familiar with teamspeak, its pretty much the same type of system.

       Yes, people know who David Brock is.  An American citizen that was trying to get his chosen candidate elected.  And please show me the fake news that was pushed by them, if that's the argument you're trying to make.

       I don't follow breitbart so sorry about that, I'm talking like some of the stuff in vault 7. It literally shows that anyone can leave a digital fingerprint making it look like Russia or another country was involved. They give all their "facts" but do not include anything from Wikileaks. None of these people pushing the Russia narrative mention Seth rich. These people who go on TV and talk about what's going on aren't there to educate you and inform you right? They want you to believe them on blind faith.

       Woah there buster, before you get ahead of yourself. Have you been paying attention? First they said it was Russia that leaked the DNC emails. To try to undermine our faith in the democratic process. The first of the Russian BS. They went with that and didn't even take into account that Seth rich was most likely the leaker. How about you say something with substance instead of trying to shut me down?

       No you're right, you alone are more credible than all of our intelligence agencies. I like how you try and discredit the NSA by saying they spy on everyone. Yes, yes they do. That's pretty much what they're supposed to do. If anything, saying that the NSA "spies on everyone" just lends more credence to their words over a random one month account redditor.

       Yes. They're supposed to do that. Which us why Snowden threw away his career to be a whistleblower about their unconstitutional spying. And the same MSM you have your head up the asses of laughed at trump and called him a liar when he said he was under surveillance. So which is it? We question the MSM narrative here.

       Oh. Right. He said "wiretapped" instead of "Surveilled." I see you play the semantics game too. No, he and his associates werent under surveillance at all. They just unmasked names and leaked classified information that they found under a rock.

       That's the director of the FBI under oath saying he wasn't wiretapped. If you say that he was wiretapped, remember that Trump could just release whatever information he (and you!) apparently have on wiretapping and Comey would be found to be guilty of perjury. So please, present your evidence.

Sources told The Times that Nunes’ characterization of the reports as having nothing to do with Russia appeared to be correct."

       <p>
        What does Russia have to do with Seth Rich
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to the DNC, "Russian hackers" were the culprits behind the initial DNC email leaks. This was pretty much where the whole "Russians are hacking the election" nonsense began. The second set of leaks, the Podesta emails, contains exchanges between Podesta and other DNC insiders regarding the suspected leaker of the first batch, who was admittedly within the party, and how he/she needed to be made an example of. Seth Rich was murdered shortly after.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian hackers/Russian trolls narrative is designed to do three things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Make you question your faith in our republic 
2) Implicate Trump in some kind of fantastical tale of Russian espionage (evidence coming any month now...) 
3) Deflect attention away from their own ineptitude.
      </p>
      <h1>
       3 is important because they claim Russian hackers, but in reality one of two things likely happened. A) Podesta received an obvious phishing email and clicked a malicious link, thereby compromising his personal info (you can view this email for yourself). Or B) Someone guessed Podesta's password, which was literally "p@ssw0rd".
      </h1>
      <p>
       All the Russian stuff is bogus. If it weren't, we'd have something concrete by now. If the Establishment were smart they'd put to good use that software that allows you to leave an artificial fingerprint on any type of digital document. Trump was right about one thing, our leaders truly are incompetent.

       Yea dude this election has been a mess. Canadian and I know all your news is fucked. So i've been cycling CNN, fox, MSNBC and infowars. Couple breibart articles. It's been a long 2 years fallowing but I ain't stuck in the bubble. The thing about Breibart is Andrew Died as we was calling out PODESTA. That alone is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he died I started looking into Breibarts history and it's very interesting. Not a fan of that Milo guy though, he is smart, but annoying. I was impressed with his interview on Bill Maher.

       I'm just going to take that as a no, you can't provide examples.  As I've searched and can't find anything for Brock pushing fake news. I do find plenty of evidence to back up the possibility of collusion though.  Isn't this a place for conspiracy?  Isn't there no such thing as coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or does it just so happen that Trump and his campaign just unfortunately filled itself with people with shady Russian connections, and they all just happen to forget whenever they met these people over the last year+, and they can't never seem to remember why they bothered to meet them?  Yeah, I'm sure that's all coincidence.

       Crowdstrike is the foundation of the evidence.  They produced two reports to support the Russian hacking.  One was just retracted because it was so egregiously fabricated that the Ukrainian government couldn't allow the claims to stand.

       America meddles with so many countries. Even COUPES. And lots. I know it's wrong, but the fact that they're making a big deal when  America is the worst fucking country when it comes to influencing other countries. It's childish and I laugh every time I hear of America whining about other countries doing shit. I honestly beleive Trump will do way less damage to the world than the past 20 years worth of presidencies.

       yeah we've done all that, it's been a part of our foreign policy since WW2 if not before. The key difference is that if Trump who is an American citizen did collude with the Russians that's treason on a Benedict Arnold level.

       With the shit coming out about Hilary and Russia (uranium) and Podesta and the Russians, I highly fucking doubt Trump will be Impeached through russian involvement. If you can find more dirt  on Trump and Russia, tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But think, if nothing came out prior to the election, what makes you think they have something on him? THEY WANTED THEN ELECTION, they been spying on him knowing everything he does, and they still fucking lost. They have nothing. Think. Why wouldn't they of dealt their biggest blow before the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their biggest blow was the pussy thing, the second was the taxes, which was a joke, and the last is the Russians --TBA

       What does Hillary have to do with anything, she's not the president. Trump is, this is about him and what he may or may not have done. 
Do i have an evidence? not at all, I just think it's odd that he want's to be all BFF with Putin and was talking about lifting sanctions on Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that strikes me as odd, why would he do that? What Russia has been doing the the Ukraine is total BS and prior to the election the GOP was on Obama about how we needed to act and that Obama was being weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now trump is in and suddenly it's a totally different tune and he wants to lift sanctions? Why? Add in Flynn who now is asking for immunity while he himself said last fall that if you ask for immunity your prob guilty of something. I get the feeling that something is up...

       Completely changed the topic there, I was just showing the difference between body language so you could see that Trump doesn't show violence, as Bill did with his face. EVERY super power of the world should be involved/worried about Ukraine. Ukraine is a huge deal right now? What are you saying? Just because Russia and USA are "enemies" does not mean NATO's view is right about everything and everyone else is wrong. I'm Canadian, I believe USA is just as corrupt as Russia, and it's about to be revealed.

       Again, you keep bringing up the Clintons and neither are president at this time. And yeah the Ukraine is a big deal, the fact that you are being so dismissive of russia just charging in and annexing part of another country is a bid deal. It would be like if the US decided to do it to the west cost of Canada just because we wanted a more secure pipe line. Or we decided we wanted your maritime provinces  because because we wanted more of that yummy lobster.

       Brock doing what he did is no different than the Koch brothers doing what they do, we may not like it but it's currently legal due to citizens united. Colluding with a foreign nation? yeah that's not even close to being legal.

       Equally odd is the upvote pattern of posters with little to no history of being on this sub that suddenly use the "governments investigstion" of Trumps supposedt ties with Russia as evidence that there IS a substantial relationship, as if conforming to ones anti trump bias makes the government suddenly credible and not one of the biggest lying bodies of government in human history. Hilarious how that works, "OMG THE GOVERNMENT IS SO CORRUOT GUISE!!!"...

       Trump is simply fighting for control of the deep state. He is no better than "them", simply different. The point is to not allow the deep state to oust the current diplomatically elected president of the US. The people chose Trump, for better or for worse.

       It's not like they can just boot him out of the presidency. It's a process. And if he's found guilty of something after going through that process, he should be impeached. Simple as that. I think generally people agree with that and I think the FBI has followed that process so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I don't like about all this is that everyone just assumes that the deep state, MSM, etc is out to get Trump. Could it just be that maybe he's kind of an idiot and actually did something wrong? Most people literally will not even entertain that idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because of Trump, im just supposed to trust him but not trust the msm? Because the msm has an evil agenda and trump I guess doesn't? I mean wtf, no way. I don't trust either of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I do know is they've been caught lying several times regarding the Russian deal. And if it looks like a rat, smells like one, well we might just have some rats on our hands.

       "The answer is still unclear, and Democrats in Congress want to get to the bottom of it with an investigation"
      </p>
      <p>
       The question was for EVIDENCE, not an opinion piece with the pricetag painted over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article, by the way, paints more of a picture of "Everybody who has ever had any connections with russia is suspect". I mean, I agree, but come on, it is 2017. The iron curtain has been down for how many years? Is it illegal to invest in foreign corporations? Or are you now suspect when you drive a car that was manifactured in a soviet country?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the section on wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "OMG, appeared on RT", is given as evidence, and not a single word is mentioned towards "It is illegal to read the leaks yourself" "No need to look at the leaks yourself" "The FBI will have a word with you if you look at the Leaks yourself"CNN, Or the often cited MSM philosophy to act as an ( hopefully) unpaid press station of the DNC (Though after the ringing endorsements of Clinton in the "Gleichschaltung der Presseorgane" 2016.... Little hope remains...).
      </p>
      <p>
       "OMG, he has visited the GRU. " As director of the defense intelligence agency, I would suppose it is their job. Kind of like, when the german head spymaster in chief comes by, you take him on the special tour of Langley, so you can show off a bit. You know, serve him hand roasted Langley coffee, and casually make it seem like you use the good china every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And picture seven... I can play three degrees of suspicious activity as well. I mean, seriously, did you have to drag out the sexual history? You think Billy Boys blowjob was so easily forgotten? I mean, hey, it's cool to go, we respect women, but to then go, "AAH, she is said to have dated Putin ( but she denies it)".... Hey Politico, aren't you "said" to take Soros Money to an extend where he owns you mind body and soul, and you basically have no other possibility then to print his propaganda? Did you just deny it? Can we take that as evidence for a thinkpiece?
      </p>
      <p>
       I usually took Politico as a good source. You know, as someone who still did journalism. Ah well....

       As an anti-Trump person I didn't ignore the leaked emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talked about them all through the campaign.  I talked about the pied-piper strategy, and the Hillary Victory Fund, and the anti-Bernie propaganda, and the Foundation, and Correct The Record, and the Nevada Caucus smear-job, and Hillary's ties to Gilbert Chagoury.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much more I can do to Hillary than I've already done.  We must be careful though that we didn't thwart one corrupted would-be President just to install another.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many anti-Hillary folks want to talk about the Azerbaijan Hotel deal, or Rostneft's ties to Rex Tillerson, or the secret meetings between Jared Kushner and Russian operatives, or the number of Trump campaign officials who met with the Russian Ambassador before the election, or Manafort's ties to Putin's Ukrainian puppet, or the weird transactions involving the Bank of Cypress?

       It absolutely isn't. The T_D trolls are out in full damage control and you can see them in every anti-Trump thread that makes it to the front page. They all spam the same talking points over and over again: "NOTHING TO SEE HERE! WHERE'S THE PROOF? WHAT ABOUT HILLARY?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also notice that every time an anti-Trump post makes it to the front page, there will be a bunch of Hillary/pizzagate related posts to try to distract from it, often with the mods helping do damage control by stickying said posts.

       So what is the end game? There is already a huge gap between social classes, we didn't need Russian intervention there, the education system has been training employees and not well educated critical thinkers. Our infrastructure is neglected while huge corporations manipulate the law and government agencies to establish monopolies. Our leaders collude with leaders of foreign nations, and have done so since the war of 1812.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the end game? Putin becomes the new president? As opposed to Netanyahoo, or some Saudi prince that cuts off the hands of people who draw Mohammad while later on pissing on American prostitutes in his Abu Dhabi pent house?

       Wait a minute hot stuff, Trump-Russia is a nebulous concept, no one has stated end-goals, it's not like the pedo and human trafficking shit. There's actual evidence for that, there's actually an end game to it. Namely slave labor and organs for the rich, and the economy involved in it.

      <p>
       What is the Trump-Russia end game? Where are they going with this, or is that a bridge the CIA will cross once it connives people into red scare 4.0?

       That's because there's been a fucking ton of them lately, spamming anti-Trump bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is coming from someone who hates Trump and believes he deserves prison time for crimes he's committed. Seriously, I even believe the woman who says that Trump raped her when she was 13 years old. But these astroturfers, they spam bullshit hate with no substance, lies about Trump being a Russian spy, lies about Trump fans being Russian bots, etc. And this is new, it wasn't as bad as it is lately even when everyone was talking about the then upcoming election and it would make sense to have the most political shills active on social media.

       I didn't suggest that. Please do not build strawmen. We've always had a healthy dose of pro-Trump folks here.

      <p>
       But that's how I know that real people here in this sub actually like Trump. Because they've always been a consistent presence here as long as I've been coming here regularly. Their presence doesn't disappear occasionally like we see with other astroturf campaigns. Their presence doesn't ever suddenly increase 500 fold almost overnight. And it makes sense that people here would like Trump. People interested in conspiracies are more likely to like Trump due to him having vocally supported conspiracy theories in the past. He calls out the corporate media for being liars just like we all do here on a daily basis. He's not one of us, but with the corporate media's deceptive help, he does a good job of looking like he's one of us.

       Hey my bad man, wasn't trying to build a straw man. I just know people on here act like everything is so anti-Trump. But my honest view on it is that I see way more pro-Trump posts here than anti-Trump. It wasn't until that ISP bill the other day that I first saw waves of anti-Trump stuff. Which was mainly directed at republicans in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the presence of anti-Trump supporters grows in here because this is one of the few places I can banter with Pro-Trump supporters and not get banned right away. That's definitely why I come here, I am extremely confident that is why a lot of other people like me come here too. Hence why the numbers can fluctuate a lot. I also like conspiracies too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since I accuse Russians of having bot farms, it wouldn't be fair for me to assume that in some form the leftists don't have something like that going on too. So I'll give you that for sure.

       The bulk of Russian trolls are on Russian websites brainwashing their own population. Some smaller percentage of course is also on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way that the bulk of Western-Sponsored trolls are on reddit, facebook, twitter, etc... While some smaller percentage reaches out to more foreign websites.

       This is how propaganda actually works. You don't fight the uphill, losing battle against people from completely different world-views, you distort the world-views of your own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the OP is completely right. People calling out "da Russians" while ignoring the fact that their own website is full to the brim with sponsored content and manufactured consensus = hypocrites.

       That ship has sailed when it became ok to pay american trolls to do the same work russian trolls did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if you think "Oh, the american electoral process is sacrosanct, they actively want me to form my oppinion...."
      </p>
      <p>
       And then get told, ooh, putin uses trolls to manifacture consent?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then get told, the democrats use paid american trolls to oust the russian trolls and "correct the record"? But in the ame breadth get told, oooh, Our trolls do not do the same work Putins trolls did, ours are completely different....

      <p>
       The page is 15 MB, but the ads are 200 MB flash downloads. Does not matter who sent the ads, I am angry. If now the people against the ads bombard me with 300 MB ads, in full flash glory of their own, tastefull arranged, I am not going to go, Oh, these people are against ads on my homepage, I must support them and endure the ads; I am going to go, You motherfuckers, Blacklist, YOU ARE THE ENEMY.

       the problem isnt necessarily the sub, but the media headlines. find articles about Brock hiring people to create anti trump posts. You wont find them except for on the alt right sites, and therein lies the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       two wrongs dont make a right, but the media only shows what they want to. in this case, they are more interested in going against trump then they were against clinton. they are both fucking terrible. but who is the more obvious target? the person who has been in politics for decades and was at the top of a party, or the outsider celebrity questionable billionaire business man.

       I think they're just interested in going after Trump because he says a lot of stupid shit. He's easy to like and he's easy to not like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this whole "MSM fake news" thing created by Trump is so ironic too. Because you have all these people criticizing the media for being so anti-trump. Saying everything they publish is made up lies to smear Trump. Fake news!
      </p>
      <p>
       But then they'll go and follow Trump blindly and not question a single thing he puts out there. Instead of the msm agenda, it's the trump agenda. Effectively just doing the same damn thing they're criticizing the media for. The only difference is Trump is the president.

       Actually if you read the substance of the article they get into to the connection between Manafort and Bannon. It also corroborates Watts testimony today that Trump used Russian propaganda systems againt his opponents.

       Equally odd is the upvote pattern of posters with little to no history of being on this sub that suddenly use the "governments investigstion" of Trumps supposedt ties with Russia as evidence that there IS a substantial relationship, as if conforming to ones anti trump bias makes the government suddenly credible and not one of the biggest lying bodies of government in human history. Hilarious how that works, "OMG THE GOVERNMENT IS SO CORRUOT GUISE!!!"...
       <em>
        Trump elected
       </em>
       "GUISE THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING TRUMP WORKS FOR RUSSIA, LETS TRUST THE CIA AND MSM OVER THE GUY THAT CLEARLY GAINED MASSIVE SUPPORT AND SPARKED A REVIVAL OF AMERICAN NATIONALISM!!!". Its so fucking pathetic and obvious
