        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The great masses of the people... will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.

       DNA Extraction from cheek cells
      </h1>
      <p>
       Depending on your curriculum, you may have been shown this straightforward
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaaRrR-ZHP4">
        method
       </a>
       of isolating DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The technique is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Add soap to cheek cells in saliva, to dissolve the cell membranes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Add salt to the saliva, to help the DNA precipitate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Add isopropyl alcohol.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We know that hamburgers lose around 50% of their weight after cooking. This is due to the water content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet when you squeeze a raw hamburger,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/BnDGfksizK8?t=11s">
        you would struggle to release even 1% of all the water in the meat
       </a>
       (notice that zero water comes out?).
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn’t possible to extract any or most of the water in our body tissues, so why would it be possible with DNA?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, stringy saliva is a
       <a href="http://buddymd.com/thick-saliva-sticks-throat">
        known symptom of dehydration
       </a>
       . Adding salt to the saliva produces this effect. No DNA here, just normal clumped up saliva.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be
       <a href="http://www.candidaspittest.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Spit-test-diagram3.jpg">
        fungus
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <h1>
       DNA extraction from fruit
      </h1>
      <p>
       The same procedure is used here and the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/hRiXCKiaE3w?t=1m12s">
        alcohol
       </a>
       is supposedly added to precipitate the DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strawberry contains citric acid, a carboxylic acid. When alcohol is added to a carboxylic acid, an ester is formed. Most esters are insoluble in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The precipitate seen in the video is probably an ester, not ‘DNA’.
      </p>
      <h1>
       X-ray diffraction of DNA
      </h1>
      <p>
       The double Helix structure of DNA was discovered using x-ray crystallography in the early
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/213e5d8dc417eee9e7fcfce53c100857ee96eed7.jpg">
        1950s.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This picture and others like it are the only pieces of data we have regarding the structure of DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If DNA were really a double helix, why are the only pictures we see taken from above?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are there no pictures of DNA from the side?
Why don't we ever see the classic figure of 8 style picture like
       <a href="http://biosocialmethods.isr.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DNA_basesv2.png">
        this?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       X-ray crystallography involves 360 degree rotation, so we should see the DNA molecule in all orientations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming of course, that X-rays are actually real and the images aren’t just CGI cartoons.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Techniques to learn about DNA synthesis
      </h1>
      <p>
       The narrative of DNA helicase separating the strands and DNA polymerase adding bases to the exposed strands, is simply one big story. The microspace equivalent of the stories about the Big Bang, or how the moon was supposedly formed during a collision between the earth and an asteroid etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts related to DNA synthesis were determined through the use of cell fractionation and radioactive labelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       As explained by Harold Hillman in his book Certainty and Uncertainty in Biochemical Techniques, summarised
       <a href="http://www.big-lies.org/harold-hillman-biology/certainty-and-uncertainty-in-biochemical-techniques.htm">
        here
       </a>
       , there are many assumptions behind the use of these techniques. Some of these assumptions have either already been proven to be untrue, or violate the laws of thermodynamics.

      <h1>
       Conclusion
      </h1>
      <p>
       DNA does not exist. They may be able to perform

       </a>
       by examining our bacteria, but there is no such molecule as ‘DNA’ and all genetics science is one big hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘DNA forensics’ is yet another hoax. Something which has been implicitly acknowledged by the MSM.

      </p>
      <p>
       The totally made up ‘structure’ of DNA closely resembles the satanic caduceus, seen

      <p>
       Hamburgers lose 50% of their weight due to FAT, which easily liquifies at cooking temperatures.  Not water content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ground up hamburger meat that has extra fillers in it is not even close to being comparable to human tissue.  What on earth made you think this was some kind of good comparison?

       So what?  What if he would have said all that and someone else said well this is wrong about you're saying but I do believe x is the right thing,  then someone added something else and it turned out something big. 
Imo its good hes thinking. You could have just said something without the ridicule. But hey its your life do what you want.

       The only way to verify the results of PCR would be through the use of Gel Electrophoresis.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the looks of things, there is no way of distinguishing between a tube containing one strand, mixed in with nucleotide bases, and a tube containing the same no. of bases before, but with all bases lined up to from the double helix strand. Both tubes would obviously weigh the same, more complex is the argument over the charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the idea of separating the DNA strands by heating, and those same strands coming together again in perfect alignment when cooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every complex biological tissue is changed irreversibly by being heated, in order to believe in the idea of 'PCR' we have to assume that DNA is a 'special case' in biological sciences. A delicate and easily damaged molecule on the one hand, but also capable of being heated and cooled at will, like a ready meal...
      </p>
      <p>
       I might have to get back to you if I remember anything else that's relevant to your question, but for now, I don't believe that PCR is a feasible process.

       Yeah I always wondered how the opposite strands of DNA just annealed perfectly together just by reducing the heat. You would think there would be all kinds of configuration problems.  You're certainly giving me something to think about.
