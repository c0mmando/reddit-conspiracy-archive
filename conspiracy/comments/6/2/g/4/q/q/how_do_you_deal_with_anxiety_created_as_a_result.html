      <p>
       I’m feeling very nervous and feel powerless/depressed about some conspiracies and wanted to ask for some advice on how to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies I believe(see as true):
      </p>
      <p>
       -NWO/Illuminati/Zionist elite. Planning to exterminate/”depopulate” 6,5 billion people, leaving only 500.000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       -That they have a monopoly of  the banks, media, food etc. and use it to control/manipulate people.
      </p>
      <p>
       -That they use the classic divide and conquer technique combined with investing on both sides(win/win), resulting in in the orchestration of WW1, WW2 and the “Russian” Revolution and other events. As well as distracting us with politics(abortion, gun control, terrorism etc.), while they control both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       -They plan on chipping everyone (mark of the beast), so they can control our money, food and even our life.
      </p>
      <p>
       -They use the media and other tools to create mass integration/multiculturalism because they know that creates conflict.  As well as PC culture, BLM, feminism, white guilt, gangsta rap, pornofication/sexual “liberation”, divorces, drug culture and so on to make us weak and to create a white minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       -They use the “Hollocaust” to make us feel guilty. Our “history” books are manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on but this about sums up most of my concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What I’m asking advice for is:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         How do you deal with the anxiety? The bad focus during most of the day? The feeling/sense of impending doom? And the powerlessness, since I have no idea how I’m going to prevent the Zionist media/banking elite from killing most of us.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How do you deal with telling others(friends, family)? I want to educate them about this so I won’t feel so isolated. (All my friends and family are atheists and are very rational people, looking at things from 2 sides, so that’s a plus, but I’m afraid they’re still not going to believe me or declare me a nut, which will make me even more depressed).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Say I wanted to convince them, how should I do that without unleashing all the theories altogether? Should I go step by step, slowly and calmly or otherwise? I want them to be able to understand that I am aware they think I’m a nut, because I would think the same if the roles were reversed. I want them to look at my points with an open mind but I have no clue how to do this successfully.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And say IF I get to convince (some of) my friends and family, would that be responsible? They would now also feel the same anxiety as I do and I would be crushed if one of my friends/family would commit suicide, get extremely depressed or might get into a (for example) car accident because of the loss of focus.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How do you guys deal with sudden panic attacks(or feeling that you’re about to get down a lot in the coming minutes), especially in a workplace/public/around friends?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       For anyone that can help me with this, I want to say that I love you from the bottom of my heart because I have never felt so bad in my entire life and I don’t know to deal with this. I hope you can make me feel a bit better because I’m going nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: I’m not here to discuss/debate/debunk these theories, I’m here to discuss how to deal them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note 2: I am aware that my list of conspiracies can be a little vague to people that have never heard of them, I’m sorry for that, please realize that I feel very unfocused/tired atm. Most of these are well known, so google if you’re curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm going to sleep now but I will definitely answer/read all the other replies. Thanks everyone though, I feel more calm and sane now :) I wish you guys a happy day/goodnight!

       Surround yourself with positivity, sometimes you gotta do something extra cheesy or borderline out of the norm to get some positive feeling back  in your head. Do some service work with people that are really in need. Those are always positive experiences for me. Play with a kitten/puppy, take a nature walk, something to ground you. You have to snap back into reality.

       Thanks for your comment, I've done a lot of this. Positive thinking. Doing things I like. Comforting myself and complimenting/boosting myself.
Don´t you feel like you´re fooling yourself with all these "distractions"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, you didn't respond to how I should convince my friends/family.
Thanks for commenting any way :)

       I honestly go to r/wholesomememes a lot. Like a LOT. I also have a four year old, 2 dogs, 2 cats, a flock of birds, lizards, and a tarantula to keep me busy and happy. Things can get overwhelming sometimes.

       You are not responsible for the actions of others. All you are doing is informing them of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the feelings you are sharing sound a lot like what I went through in my late teens early twenties. I could have sworn I was depressed, nothing seemed to help and it always felt worse. Eventually the clouds parted and now I feel like a different person. We alk have our journeys. Stay strong.

       I've actually been depressed since I was a toddler (not to "brag") and had a suicidal period for a few years, which is "cured" now through therapy and positive thinking and realistic self reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that I'm not responsible for the actions of others. I'm just saying that if those examples I gave would happen I would feel crushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course "awakening" other people is obviously better than keeping them in lalaland. My point is that, say I convince them, would there be things I can do to make them feel good? Since they're my family/friends of course I wouldn't think it would be crazy to do group activities or telling them how much I love them right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I know how I feel/react to these "truths" it would be logical that they would experience that too once they connect the dots.
I just want to comfort them and cheer them so they know that I know the feeling.

       Relax, meditate, sounds like you are some sort of religious so pray. Most of just enjoy the ride. They want you to feel powerless. They want you to feel fear and dread. Spit in their faces by enjoying what you can while you can. I prefer a glass of chardonnay and a cig. Helps ease the mind.

       I'm actually an atheist, how come you think I am religious? (because of the love from the bottom of my heart part?)
Thanks for your comment. I'm trying to stay positive and do things I enjoy, but I keep getting sudden flashes of visuals/thoughts that totally distract me from it.

       I don't think they care if I feel depressed/afraid, since they've gotten it all planned out and I'm a future nobody.

       Definitely meditate. Remind yourself that these, at this point, are typically all only "theory" (for now.. or not) and should only be seen at face value. Meditation is a great way to ground yourself. Practice fluid breathing and try to focus on positives.

       Thank you for your comment! :) I will definitely meditate in the near future. For now I'm already being very aware of my breathing. Especially since I'm aware of my high heart rate during most of the day(since I've entered the "point of no return").

       If  you have anxiety about the plan of the elite to chip everyone, for example, it's an anxiety that is for the future, not the present. A lot of these conspiracies, which are true, will not reach their fulfillment in our lifetimes, most of us. There is just going to be a gradual decline in quality of life, marked by occasional atrocities such as mass murders and riots. We can ride it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       My anxiety is about the future for my race. I don't want to see what my race built -- Western civilization -- destroyed by a small elite for their own selfish purposes. I worry about what is going to happen ten, fifty, a hundred years from now. I probably won't be directly affected, except that I am a part of my race, and I want my race to continue to prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are certainly correct about the Holocaust being used to make us feel guilty, and the manipulation of our history books.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the main focus of the elite is the destruction of the white race, not mankind as a whole. They want to destroy us because we pose the only real threat to their continuing acquisition of wealth and  power. We can stop them, if we choose. That frightens them, and their fear makes them eager to destroy us.

       For how to reach your family/friends/etc, stick with the second and third one. Those are the easily provable ones:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         -That they have a monopoly of the banks, media, food etc. and use it to control/manipulate people.
-That they use the classic divide and conquer technique combined with investing on both sides(win/win), resulting in in the orchestration of WW1, WW2 and the “Russian” Revolution and other events. As well as distracting us with politics(abortion, gun control, terrorism etc.), while they control both sides.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Until you win them over on these two, there's no point even mentioning the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to how do I deal with anxiety over my conspiracy theories, I try to look at it from a balanced perspective. I spend a little time each day researching and teaching myself new skills, I spend a lot of time trying to learn everything about everything. These are proactive responses to anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes though, I just need to get away, and do something mindless or social as distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the time, I embrace the moment and my own mortality. We all die eventually. What great men/women are concerned with is not death, but life, and being the best version of yourself that you possibly can be.

       Thanks for replying! :)
With saying there's no point in mentioning the rest, do you mean that the other points will follow since that makes sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry to ask you, but can you help me refer to some good resources on the 2nd/3rd point? I'm totally unfocused now and I've gotten books/pdfs from David Duke, but they might be biased because of his past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do you have experience with convincing other people of these points? (Since you say they are easily proven, that doesn't mean convincing other people is easy as well, right?)

       There's no point because the two I pointed out are premises on which the truth of the rest depend, and because they would seem the least far-fetched to someone on the outside looking in. Call them "Gateway conspiracies".
      </p>

       There's tons of information out there on how a handful of corporations run the show.

       As to how both sides are working together, research neoconservatism, the third way, neoliberalism, globalism, tripartite commission, the council on foreign relations, operation paperclip, etc, and just see how far down the rabbit hole it takes you.

For now I'm not going to go further down the rabbit hole to prevent myself from going crazy. I will do it when I'm getting more used to the anxiety and when I've made a more stable environment for myself.

       And I wouldn't use David Duke as a source. Source credibility is very key. It's always better if you can present your argument using sources that the people you are trying to persuade will respect. Moderate, sane, intelligent people.

       You need to do is change the way you view this. I do not have a sense of impending doom. I do not feel that way at all. I've always been a positive person. I firmly believe that Good will defeat Evil in the end. I'm on the Good side. So that means I will win in the end.

       Good post, OP!
      </p>
      <p>
       Gardening is extremely therapeutic (and can make goods).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exercise is also good (also makes you strong and fit, enhances your self-image and sex appeal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Having friends IRL and making the effort to connect with them on the regular is very good. Playing games (not looking at a screen) is also fun and engaging. It's a good idea to give yourself things to look forward to. I also have gotten more into cooking, lately (life is more enjoyable when it tastes good and is healthy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, talking to and taking care of your neighbors is a very good thing to do. It gets you out of yourself and will often inspire a sense of gratitude for the good things in your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers!

       I have been trying to wake my family up for over a decade... I have 3 nuclear family members besides myself, but I have only redpilled my mother. The rest of my family thinks that I am a (sweet and harmless) nutter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, I have succeeded in dropping redpills on professors, though. It's easier than before because I am less emotional and used to being laughed off by the closed-minded. I have found that the best way to approach these things is to find the paradigm to which your redpill target subscribes. From that point, you can deconstruct the beliefs and compare them to realities that disprove them.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more piece of advice: if you should try to take up with a romantic partner, make sure that it is somebody who is at least
       <em>
        willing
       </em>
       to understand your perspective. You don't have to agree on everything, but common ground is incredibly important.

How did it feel when you redpilled your mother? Did you see her acting differently once you she was convinced? And can you really tell she was convinced of her own or do you think she says she believes you out of "pity"? 
What a shame that the rest of your family thinks that way, but I guess there's not much you can do about it (Maybe over time you can). I hope they won't spread too much about you being a "nutter", it could make you feel more isolated and people will have strong prejudices towards you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have an example of these paradigms? I'm sorry but I don't quite understand what you mean by that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the last peace of advice, I hope I will one day find a partner like that.

       It is definitely possible that she was trying to make me feel better. She is in real estate, so that is a bit of a redpill in itself (reality is not nearly as rosy as NAR numbers). That didn't change anything in my mother's behavior - she is the most stubborn person that I know. I don't see any of my family very much (usually once a year)- Each one of us lives in our own time zone.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father and my sister (who both think I'm nuts) keep themselves too busy to pay attention or care about this stuff (workaholics)... They try to pretend that it's not their problem if they don't have to think about it. Funny thing is that they would all agree that I am the sharpest in the family, but that doesn't mean much in their minds when it comes to worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breaking paradigms is the same thing as challenging unquestioned assumptions. Whether people think democracy works just fine, US military interventions are important, or that the president of the United States is the "leader of the free world", you have obvious fallacies that you can deconstruct for others, and expose to be completely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Writing all of that, I think that the idea of somebody being open to the truth (or even different ideas) is a key part of redpilling. Without that, you get stuck with people like my father and my sister. My professors have been much easier to redpill. my anthropology professor I redpilled on Haiti. We were reading a book by Paul Farmer, and it was just really fortuitous that I had been studying Haiti (vis a vis) since Petersen and Webb. For the prof, I illustrated how corporate powers are just enslaving the Haitian people, and using them for everything under the sun. I also illustrated how Paul Farmer turns a deliberately blind eye to abuses by corporations and nonprofits alike. I also showed how his Mirabalais hospital is connected Microloans through Fonkoze. I also redpilled my writing professor by debunking (the late part of) the Cold War. This essay that we read for the class made brief mention of Richard Pipes... he was a key member of "Team B", which was an obvious fear-mongering intelligence-twisting sham of the Reagan/Bush administration. Their argument was that the apparent lack of Soviet military hardware was indisputable proof that they were advanced beyond our comprehension. It was all a ploy to get more money and power in the MIC. I also linked to a BBC docu that makes fun of Pipes' team as being a total sham (Docu was called "the politics of fear").
      </p>

       On the partner thing, I will go ahead and sound ignorant for a second. One thing that people have told me, that really seems to be true, is that we always find our mates when we stop looking. My experience was kind of like that (getting hitched next month).

       To be honest with you, I've dealt with anxiety and depression since I can remember. It slowly and painfully chipped my life away since I was a little girl. Because I've always felt "different" and that I didn't work with this society. Grown ups would mock me for being "too quiet" like it was some sort of contagious and grotesque disease. I'd have what others considered faults picked apart and paraded in front of me to shame me for not complying to "normal" social standards. My social anxiety became crippling because I began to feel that I was trapped in a box surrounded by humans I wanted to connect with, but never could because I felt as if I was made up of something they could never and would never be able to read. It was a terrifying and lonely road.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be honest with you again, truth seeking is one of the main things in my life that kept me sane and it all started when I learned of the Freemason secret society from my father who came from a long line of  masons....and again in 6th grade when I started learning more about Egypt. I was always so unpopular and shy in school, and it always severely affected me, until I became a "truth seeker". I'll always remember how angry my teacher got with me when I would question the narrative she was teaching...but I no longer cared what she or anybody else thought of me in that nature. No teacher could shut my questions up - and they
       <em>
        hated
       </em>
       it, which drove me more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth seeking made me feel a flow that I had never felt. It made me feel that there was a reason I felt so differently - it's because I see and feel things differently. And though I still struggle with anxiety now at 30, I find it's much easier to cope. Because I know my feelings mean something. I know I am the way I am for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for getting people on board to think and feel the same way you do about conspiracies/truth seeking...you simply cannot force them. It's an independent journey, and before one starts it they
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       just consider you crazy. That's okay. Don't let it hurt you. On that note, however, let me tell you that the rise in inquisitive minds has escalated so much compared to my past years, and that feels
       <em>
        amazing
       </em>
       . I feel comfort in knowing that even though it seems people are falling backwards, so many are also rising up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit, that as I age it's getting harder and harder to deal with how money controls our lives and as a society as a whole we are trapped into a slave grind. For what? It pains me to see people I love, yes even strangers, work themselves so much just to serve a machine we don't agree with. I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       life isn't about clocking in and out of work and paying the IRS. It's not about the latest trends or distractions we buy to stay relevant in society. It's so much more yet we get distracted from our true mission because of the system we were born in. And I see it all around me, everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I still smile. Laugh. Love. Because maybe this awful grind is here for a reason, too. Maybe evil exists so we learn how to face it and overcome it. I don't know the answers - and
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       what inspires me and drives me. The unknown. I don't let it scare me anymore, I let it fuel me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear consumed my life for too long, clouding my true beautiful self. This is the quest, and you are on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome, my friend, and may you find peace and many forks in your glorious life adventure. You are apart of something beautiful. Sing. Dance. Write. Paint. Love like you have never loved before.

       Thanks for sharing your story. I'm sorry if I'm going to reply very brief, since I'm very tired.
As stupid as it sounds, it actually gave me an egoboost. I've also felt like a real outsider. Although probably not as much as you do, since I don't have social anxiety. I'm just very introverted but my parents teached me how to socialise, which I am very thankful for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still optimistic that I can convince other people, I think I should just plan it out and try to do it gently/slow. If it doesn't work out, bummer, but it's better to try than not to try.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also see the whole world differently now and I can't go back to my older world view now.
This might probably be a duh-moment for you, but do you feel like you've swallowed the so-called red pill like in the Matrix movie? (If you haven't, I highly recommend it) And that you can't swallow the blue pill anymore now, even if you wanted to (and know it is stupid of course)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I wish you lots of love and luck on your journey! :) 
Thanks a lot for the post!

       I think working gently/slowly is honestly the best way. A lot of us are stubborn by nature so a lot will absolutely refuse anything you have to say if you just bombard them with your own knowledge. I also think different people cause for different plans. For example, my sister is as stubborn as they come. She also enjoys dark and dry humor, so I use that tool to plant small seeds. And they always grow. It takes a long time, but it's always worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I started getting into conspiracy theories at a young age, I didn't get to the point of "no turning back", or swallowing the red pill, until I was in my twenties. I definitely could not consume a blue pill now, even if I did want to. That's another reason why I like the option of planting knowledge seeds for others vs. forcing knowledge, because the red pill is meant to be taken voluntarily, otherwise destruction of self my occur if one is not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading what I wrote and your reply as well. Good luck to you, and I feel that soon more and more people will start feeling and seeing things differently as well; and in which case they will hopefully have large communities of others helping them so they don't feel lost or anxious like we have had to.

       You address an important topic, which should concern everyone here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll explain my advice to you with the following analogy:
Say, for some reason I like drink coffee. Sometimes it happens that I drink three cups, which is too much for me and I get the jitters. Since I know this, I take one cup or two at most. And tomorrow I can take some more.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention, after spending time with some topics you get as response feelings like anxiety. This is the same as with the coffee example. You have to figure out the dosage you can currently handle. (if desired build up tolerance)
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention having the feeling of powerlessness. This feeling may be the response to something (like the jitters is the response to too much coffee). Here this "something" is that you perceive yourself to be unable to change the topics over time. And this feeling increases the more time you spend with these topics. Using the coffee analogy you can try to find a measure that works for you. But there is also another option: Why not try to alter your focus on topics where you can contribute and change the outcome with what you have (and get something positive out of it). On this way you can learn new skills, allowing you later to affect bigger topics which are out of reach - for the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, you can learn - identify the actions and corresponding responses (emotions) and conceptualize them. I call them "learning lessions". By doing so, I can stop identifying myself with them and know that I can modify actions to change the responses (results/emotions).
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all "learning lessons" - a never ending stream. They are interesting, important and will provide you with insight.

       Your initial post shows you are on the right track. Asking questions and looking for answers will bring you further along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hm, I will give you an answer to your question regarding your friends and family:
I apply the examples which I mentioned before to other people as well.
If you push a topic too hard on someone, he/she will feel overwhelmed at some point. For them the "dosage" is important too. What I do is one of the following
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ask if another person is wiling to talk about a topic. (Allowing the other person to choose the time)
       </li>
       <li>
        Use an opener to a topic and let the other person decide if he/she wants to engage. If this does not happen, I know there may be someone else. Try this with several people.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use different opener for the same topic (with some days in between). Sometimes the opener was non-fitting for continued conversation.
       </li>
       <li>
        Try to find a topic which is analogue to my original topic. Find a topic which maps to my problems AND the sphere of interest/knowledge of the other person. (For example the discussion you startet here is not necessarily restricted to conspiracies. People may feel similar with other topics and can provide helpful perspectives.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Sometimes it can be really frustrating if you tried many times to have a particular conversation with someone. At that point I state exactly that: "Many times i have tried to speak to you about X. This is important to me." Then I provide the other person with some further hints: I let the other person know what he/she can specificially help me with, or I state the reason why the other person is affected by a topic, ... .
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Other things that are important to consider
* Is the other person suited for a specific topic (age, maturity, not already stressed out ...)
* Is the relationship with the other person well balanced and capable of taking on more heavy topics
* How can I give the other person control over the conversation? (let him/her choose time of conversation, state I just want to talk X minutes about a topic; ...) This will help alot over multiple conversations and length may increase. The other person does not perceive you / your topic as stressing. 
* Make the environment and conversation style relaxing / non-stressfull. This is basically conditioning of the conversation partner and yourself. Over time you and others can handle increasingly heavy topics alone or together because you can be relaxed when dealing with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway hope these are good pointers to you.

Why 2 weeks and not longer?
Also, do you only mean I should have a back-up of supplies or should I also go underground?

       2 weeks is the minimum and I meant it as back up.  The main point though is the more prepared you feel to deal with prospective situations be less anxiety you will feel..

       If you'd like to chat with me on a personal level, I'm willing to share with you my experiences with this, because I have been where you are, and have seen the bottom of the rabbit hole. It's a wild thing, and good on you for realizing that it's better to heal from these realizations, rather than continue to argue with strangers about what you do and don't believe, because some internet commenters are paid cognitive infiltrators, and have padded bank accounts for spouting corporate opinions and fear --
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoa dude, like -- first off, if you're feeling the realization that the entire world is actually being manipulated by the 5 mainstream (ms) news media moguls, who also have the ability to control all ms tv shows, movies, radio hosts and songs, they get to paint the victim how ever they'd like. It's easy to label and make a certain group of people hate someone when they're in the news (he's a dirty ___, leftist-nut-job, good riddance," is what a cognitively controlled bystander would say.  Once one realizes that our taxes pay people to go on the Internet to scare, anger, and distract people from seeing some of the simple facts weaved into these intricate lies, it becomes hard to adjust to the realization that this Internet is a battleground. It's a War of the Minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all being forced onto a ceramic wheel. Sorry -- bit of my own opinions leaking out. I'm a poet... okay, tips on coping with the worst news of this century -&gt; First suggestion: If you're speaking to someone who doesn't believe in "god/s" then FILTER, filter, filter. Don't mention Hell, Satan, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       SECOND -&gt; Stop talking about aliens. I know. This ones hard, because it's fun to discuss and think about. Aliens are a great way to escape the truth. 
Now.. I'm not saying "E.T. doesn't exist" I'm saying talking about NWO and aliens is a sure-fire way to make a closed minded person shut-down and think you're nuts. You get labeled one of the saddest labels, which is "Oh, so you're one of those guys who believes aliens control the federal reserve. Yeah. Sure." Don't get this label. You don't want it. You're family will never believe you.
That being said, Reptilian/Illuminati is a lie. Bold faced, the lie itself was made up by the ones behind the idea of Illuminati... These pedophile murdering rapists tell the people (mostly children)  that they victimize that "they" (the Illuminati are aliens).. they lie to children, and children are the ones who spread the lie.
For your family, if they are willing I would suggest reading the book written by a child victim of these vile creatures: Mental Liberation In the Age of Thought Control by Kerth Barker. -- Everyone's a victim of cognitive infiltration and control. We were all patriotically manipulated back in 2001, and the experiment is in full force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, sorry. I'm wanting to help. What can you do next? -- Encrypt you emails. Try Protonmail.com. It was created by CERN &amp; MIT scientists, because even scientists are being abused and realize the need for privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, learn and spout these facts
       <a href="http://www.ifeveryoneknew.com/">
        http://www.ifeveryoneknew.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn as many facts about history and what our government has done in the past. Without a doubt, any covert program that was exposed to the public, was shuffled around and changed into a different name, with similar tactics that evolve overtime as new tech. is brought out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're on the right track, and now you've got to be careful about your beliefs. Learn about FBI's covert interactions (harassment) with  Martin Luther King Jr., and realize, our government now uses the Internet to fashion the same sort of tactics on activists, whistleblowers, journalists, celebrities, bloggers, poets, the list doesn't stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay. Once again. What do we do? --&gt; Everything will be fine. Keep calm and keep some of your plans to yourself. Become unpredictable. Do more art. Exercise (I'm serious. If you're feeling sad, you need more serotonin. Jumping jacks, walking, anything). If you can go outside, be outside more often then not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should you avoid the news? -&gt; I don't have a very good answer on that. I use to be a police brutality news junky, and then I took a year hiatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really need a news fix, I'd recommend independent news sources, and stay AWAY from the comments. Commenting with strangers on the Internet opens you up for an "attack" of frustration at someones ignorance -- You want to "school them," but don't. This is a battlefield, remember, the NSA/CIA is under all of our fingertips, and they get to see your comments before they're even posted [[if you're an immediate target that is, they can see you in real-time, making it easy to entrap you. Stay calm they are fools and they don't need your time, they need your knowledge.]]
      </p>
      <p>
       Be a history buff. Seriously. Read, but be careful what you read. Try and stick to less conspiracy, more fact-checking is required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never say "You know this is true" -- this is a discrediting factor. You can say, without sounding crazy, "A lot of people believe this __" and then there's room for a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Practice normal conversation with people. Try and avoid politics. Oh, this is hard, because now I'm saying "Pretend to be brainwashed and everything's peachy." Honest, if you are not able to function in the brainwashed world, you will feel isolated. Don't let this happen. Sorry to say, we have to live in both worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear, I'm sorry that this comment may have not been what you wanted to hear, however... you're not alone, and many victimized people have it a lot worse than you. For me, I'm avoiding telling you my story, because it's a mountain of scary sh*t, and I'm at the forefront of something that I'm supposedly not supposed to talk about because I've got family that are covertly being murdered by these people and I'm not supposed to tell my family they're all on an invisible chopping-block with these shadow fuckers.Uhm. But I guess that's every celebrity and politician in this world. Because they're all honey-pot brainwashed too. 
Brainwash is nothing more than a threat. 
It's the largest threat to humanity.
Good on you for wanting to warn your family. My family won't listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion is tell them things in bite-sized ways.
Slow is better. Small chunks here and there. Stick to historical facts. Don't talk to much about your theories. AVOID any mention of "Illuminati" as we are programmed to laugh at anyone who starts talking about it. Do not get frustrated when someone laughs. Simply end the conversation. Talking about something else, or politely leave.

        Get a hobby that's not technology related. Perhaps a sport or D&amp;D, something fun and time-consuming, with face-to-face interactions. (It's really important to find something. If you're anti-social, it can be as simple as sitting in a coffee shop for a couple hours, because even that's better than sitting at home on the computer (alone). Try not to be too alone.

Ignore it and remember our government murdered MLK Jr. and they never stopped murdering peace.

       Thanks for all the advice!
Very informative!
      </p>
      <p>
       Tbh, I've not yet been at the bottom of the rabbit hole and I will not go there - for now.
Satanists/Aliens/Lizardmen are topics I haven't researched that well, and they are "weird" and "paranoid" to me(for now), but I will keep an open mind.
I will distance myself from those topics untill I feel more stable(also to prevent me from potentially going insane).
And yes, maybe all of these conspiracies are all a lie and there's a whole other thing going on that basically nobody knows about.
I don't know and I can't prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for advising me to encrypt my mail.
However, does it really encrypt since it's in the Android(Google) store?
I don't want to generalize but Google is founded by Jews and Google hasn't been the most trustful company in my view(As in, I assume there are probably back-doors).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't you think talking on reddit about these topics is kinda weird, since you know you're being monitored? (Especially if you're a US citizen)
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you on still acting normal/brainwashed to prevent isolation.
I don't think I will have a lot of problems with that, but thanks for the advice!
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, if that's true about your family, then don't you think it's better to prevent other people from knowing?
I don't know your situation of course but common sense tells me it's better not to ask about these things to a stranger.
My condolences to your family members that have been killed, I wish you lots of love and hope. I wish I could hug you.:(
It's not that I don't want to know about your personal story, I just think I'm not ready for it yet.
Even if I was ready, I would probably prefer face to face talk, what about you? (Somewhere in the (far far) future, but probably never)
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, I will not mention Illuminati because I've laughed at people myself in the past when they mentioned it. Which I won't regret, because it made sense to me back then that it's bullshit.
They didn't really convince me that good, and they started talking aliens very short so I was like, uhmmm right... Let's talk about something else :P
Do you think this goes for mentioning the NWO as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the list. I was already a very sceptical person before I informed myself about the conspiracies.
That's why I would never use an automated car or TV's with cameras on it.
Haha, I will remove phones from the bedroom. I don't think turning them off will change a lot, but I have no way of proving that.

       Yes, thanks for reading everything. You may read my other reddit comments to find more of my story. I'd say stop using Google. Make a fake account for your newsletters. Also use an encrypted web browser and search engine. I use Duckduckgo.com  Here's a helpful 3 min. video

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dXXDy9Rqsc
       </a>
       I will be as brief as possible:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I say what I say publicly? -&gt; First, I have nothing to lose at this point besides more people dying in accidents. However, everybody dies anyway, and my life has become strange, to say the least. In the end, I refuse to give up the Internet, b/c I love people, and this is my country, and the world needs to see the writing on the wall. I am writing on the wall. It's odd to feel like the metaphorical version of Anne Frank, but see, I've got the Internet. Technically, we're all Frodo's and Franks..whether we see it or not. As a poet, I see the war lords are poetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why risk my life? --&gt; I am still alive and need peaceful people to wake up to realizing freewill and destiny are in danger, especially if you're open-minded and wanting justice.
       <br/>
       There's so much injustice in this world. One of the biggest injustices is being punished for reporting the crime. Corporations and war lords play chess, just like all the artists have been saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm writing a book. Our government knows I've got a book to write. They know I'm capable of being a novelist and more. I'm also a musician and a blogger. And of course, it was only ever secret to my family who I am as an artist... BUT our government gets to know me even when I'm at home, proven by vault seven. My government KNOWS the plots to some of my novel ideas (and it was through cognitive infiltration that I was "informed" that my private information was being handed to strangers).
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why I am open. Why shut myself up, when I am still in this world? The reason why I tell the world my family is being covertly murdered, is because I'm hoping my abusers and the agents who are heavily monitoring me, will have empathy and realize what they are doing (spying) is wrong. I hope that they stop. I hope that someone says something, and I'll never get to prove these deaths weren't accidents. I'll never have the money to sue. The people who abused me made it clear that I'd "save the world" if I committed suicide. This is what they did to MLK Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY SHARE THIS?? -&gt; Because I'm a blabber-mouth. Because I probably have Asperger's. Because I believe they need to be stopped. Because sometimes I'm stupid and sometimes I'm smart. Because I know I'm not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're spying on peaceful people.
And they control the headlines.
Which is why a thing like pizzagate can be easily swept under, and everyone laughs at the funny idea of politicians ordering pizza, and laugh at anyone who mentions pizza. because the media is using cognitive infiltration to program our responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I go. 
Another media cognitive infiltration tactic:
The Clown Panic of 2016 -- no more than rich people, paying un-ethical people (usually ex-convicts) to dress up as clowns to scare people. The reason: because it's fun to watch people be scared. Because they want people to be afraid of bright colors. Because they want to use colors to make you afraid. Because fear is the tool. 
Also, because people are on their computers alll day long. They need to make viral videos that compete with real things that happen in the world. They are creating "reality tv" on youtube. Is it taxed? Is it private? Maybe it's a bit of both...I don't know (But, it's the richest old people in this country, you know those mogul people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Damn, I guess that wasn't quick. I might delete this post. Let's see what happens shall we?&gt; I'm the opposite side of the propaganda coin, and my abusers realize I Occupy the Internet with Love. I've already  called the FBI and NSA. They know who I am. And they know that I plan to run for POTUS when I'm of age ~2026. My abusers already ruined my reputation.. so I am both afraid and un-afraid, because I went through an experience in which I thought I was going to die. Not everyone will believe, and at this point, I've learned what it's like to be a celebrity, without actually being a celebrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's fucked. But, there is hope. There really is. Because the one seed I will continue to hold onto is this: There are people on the inside who wish for the people to succeed, but these people , they won't be satisfied unless it's biblical. monumental. it's sick. They could just stop and say "we're sorry for trying to control the world. we just, ya' know believed it'd be fun to play out that whole satan jesus thing." ugh. Honestly, the "Illuminati" mentality reminds me of how children would control the world. "No money? Need money? Smash this town, takes these slaves." They believe war is population control, "better off dead."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep telling yourself, "These are children playing games." I believe it's the people who need to get these kids' game to be exposed, once again, because we're seeing the tail-end of "Project Paperclip"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't heard, please research. It's one of the roots.

       Thanks but I actually already stopped smoking (cigs, weed) and drinking before I was aware of all these conspiracies. I see no purpose of using these substances. To each it's own of course. 
I did deliberately encourage myself to masturbate a lot more to take my mind of things these last days though.
I think humor is a good way to deal with things as well, for some periods of time.

       Thanks for the comment! :) Although I'm an atheist, I can see the value of your message. It's hard to accept things I cannot change, especially if it's (in my view) concerning the extermination of 6,5 billion people. I think it makes sense to want to look at all the possibilities to prevent this from happening.

       The reality is most of us are not in a position to make monumental changes in the world, but if we can contribute what we can, which includes helping others open their eyes to the scary things in our world, then no matter what the outcoming you know you are part of the solution.

       I know the feeling. I experience it most of the time. For me it started when they passed the Patriot Act right after 9/11, so it has been a very long time. I can not offer much advice to you because my own reaction was to become a political activist, which only made the isolation from friends and family much, much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think they will avoid you for bringing up conspiracies? Just wait till the FBI tells them you are a person of interest. Basically it ruined ALL of my relationships. I have had to entirely start over trying to make new friends and find a new family. Good luck to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the up side, people are believing it all a whole LOT more now then they were 13 years ago. We have made some progress.

       What do you mean with the FBI telling them you're an POI?
Unfortunately, I don't live in the US - yet. I'm pro 2nd Amendment and would "love" to own a gun one day.

       Also, why did you say 13 years? Did something happen in 2004? Or is it just a number?

       -Don't let anyone label you. So don't label yourself.
-Step away from the realization that the world is somebodies controlled metaphor.
-Consider a life of knowledge. i.e. spend your free-time at the library, take notes when you read, consider making art that will open people's minds... (if that's something you feel the need to do..) People need art. Consider it, your personal propaganda, to fight the propaganda.. that's what many artists do anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait, I guess I'm spouting the "program" .. err. the problem is, artists that try to expose monarch are lumped in with just another fucked "conspiracy" which happens to be similar to MK Ultra -- 
Puzzle pieces, they've made it easy to spot all the control. They kill whom ever gets close to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Jackson was wanting to tell everyone just how all the celebrities are controlled. I am a mere citizen. Once a troll of the 'net, someone called me a "social justice worker" but i'd call myself an anti-propagandist activist, anonymous to only you, (not the gov. who tries to use everything, they're looking for open-minds)...

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't go on medication. It won't help. Talk therapy is the only way to heal from the realization that our world is truly being messed with.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Consider living an extremely healthy lifestyle. Too much junk food makes a person sad among many other ailments. Kick soda, try out that diet you always were curious about. This will occupy your time. When you're cooking and enjoying your time with yourself, family,whatever, attempt the habit of turning off the TV, radio (commercials suck) all that stimuli can be overwhelming when you realize how marketing works. 
-Learn to live a quiet life. Find peace in the noise. 
-Do good things for people. Realize their is even a small drop of goodness even in the most evil, vilest murderers. Even a parent can forgive their murderer, so I have to find a way to ignore threats that may come.

       Our government threatens everybody, in different ways, every day. That's why I continue to speak and comment on reddit. But I'm not going to respond to cognitive infiltration like I use to.

       I've actually been depressed since I was a toddler (not to "brag") and had a suicidal period for a few years, which is "cured" now through therapy and positive thinking and realistic self reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that I'm not responsible for the actions of others. I'm just saying that if those examples I gave would happen I would feel crushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course "awakening" other people is obviously better than keeping them in lalaland. My point is that, say I convince them, would there be things I can do to make them feel good? Since they're my family/friends of course I wouldn't think it would be crazy to do group activities or telling them how much I love them right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I know how I feel/react to these "truths" it would be logical that they would experience that too once they connect the dots.
I just want to comfort them and cheer them so they know that I know the feeling.
