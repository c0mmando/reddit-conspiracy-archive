       You sound emotional. Do you need a safe space? And what is this conspiracy you're talking about? I've never heard of it before. Except for every time I turn on the news, log in to Facebook or Twitter, posted on nearly every major sub, including this one, 5, 10, 20 times a day, and my phone even gives me news alerts about it without me asking the stupid thing to.

       in a safe space thanks. if you're really wondering what conspiracy i'm talking about, hmm, congress, senate, fbi investigations underway a few weeks into the term? just keep your eyes open, i'm sure it will become clear to you.

       Trump voters were duped,  but so are the fools who think Hillary should/would have won if it wasn't for Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure governments meddle in each others elections and all,  but so far,  it looks like Trump got enough votes without Russia's help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah,  the US election system is rigged.     As is everything else is rigged too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the Russia coverage seems mostly like fake news.    You got something really solid beside hot air against Russia?    So far,  its a witch hunt.

       if the election system proper were rigged to any strong effect, would trump have ended up in the white house? he was not liked by his party elite, and anyone with a brain in finance / industry would have seen that he was too much of a wild card. wouldn't those pulling the strings have preferred status quo over madness? (not to say that his election could be called a "win" over the illuminati or whoever, the only winner here is the kremlin)
      </p>
      <p>
       seems pretty clear the dnc nomination was indeed rigged, not only from the leaks themselves but the reaction to them was resignation instead of denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's long since time a green party gained traction the u.s.. that aspect of the system, the difficulty of launching a third party, also rigged rather effectively.

       strong effect is subject to a lot of guessing isn't it?    Certain rigging in California for example was well documented.    Look at the voting map,  county by county in 2016 presidential election,

       The map shows county by county who won.   It shows the rural areas in contrast to the metro areas.   The easiest place to rig is 30 metros rather than 500 urbans.    Hillary got a lot of the metros,  and in CA it was by letting latino not citizens vote,  partly.

       I voted against Trump.  (Jill)  But some people did vote for him,  probably enough for him to win.    Look at the people who came to see him on the campaign trail compared to Hillary!
      </p>
      <p>
       For sure Trump and his cronies are all corrupt,  but then so was Hillary and all her cronies.    Russia doubtfully made any difference in the election other than a lot of people were turned off by the Hillary Cold War II BS.    We don't need war with Russia.   They are more like us than we want to admit.

       I didn't vote for Hillary or Trump. I was a big fan of Bernie. But yes, HRC would have been a better president than Trump. That's an extremely low bar to set, though.

      <p>
       But re: the map, isn't it just a case of urban areas voting Democrat as usual? Nothing seems very different from past elections.

       Alright sure, I get the two space thing in regards to early typography but I also agree with the argument that a single space with a capital letter is a lot more readable. If I'm reading a wall of text I would prefer it to have a sort of aesthetic breakdown that I can breeze through, as opposed to halting my train of thought to make sure I'm interpreting the spaces the right way.

       Either Choice was a con. Hillary probably would have already been at war with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Russia so evil (could it be they don't have federal reserve banks, like all those other evil countries) ... They may not be the best country, but if you don't think the US is capable of the same level of propaganda... Than you need to wake up. Both sides are messing with things.

       note that "would immediately start a war" is one of the anti-hillary memes, part of the true conspiracy this subreddit has been swimming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       what i'm saying is that this idea and many others are now questionable. one should now be reexamining everything thought to be true that might have originated from the russian misinformation campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       plus, this is the kind of thing i saw on the cover of supermarket tabloids all last fall. if you're here repeating headlines from the weekly world news, then perhaps you're doing it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       [woah, that was meaner than i meant to be sorry, just couldn't help making that point about the tabloids :-) except in the matter of intent and scale, i do agree that there's lots of manipulation being done by all sides.
i think those on the left would more likely be honest about that, whereas the right will be in denial long after trump is either locked up or on the run]

       Also what solid proof has been offered that with out any doubts proofs Russian meddling? What about the reports before the election that everything was checked and secure? Would there have been any questions or concerns if Hillary won?
      </p>
      <p>
       But when the msm drags the line so hard as they have been, you have to ask yourself is there something more going on?

       Is Trump a good fit for president? No, was Hillary or Bernie? No would we really be in a different place now if others won? Nope, Republicans or Democrats;both are evil and want us fighting each other while they continue to screw us already over.

       All people need to rise up and stop this bullshit world wide, no Country, religion or person has gotten us to that point and will probably never in my life time. Everyone's idea of what's right and wrong varies to some extent someone will always see it as us vs them.
