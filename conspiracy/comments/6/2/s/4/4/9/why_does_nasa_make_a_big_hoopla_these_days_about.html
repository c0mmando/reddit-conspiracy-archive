       There are "holes" in the Radiation belt.  Which means traveling past it has to be carefully planed.  NASA wants to develop a radiation mitigation system so we can safely pass through the belt at any time from anywhere.

       Not just bases on the moon, but that the moon is artificial. Alex jones specifically said its a frozen over ball of water covered in dust, and that water is what is required to reach the "next level" of consciousness. I definitely believe that there are based on the moon already. If there weren't, that would be our government's first priority. I'm just not sold on the whole "humanity is laid out like a video game" sort of stuff. But honestly it could be possible, i don't know. It just seems like disinfo to me. It seems too cut and dry, like "that's all folks".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know man it just reminded me of AJ on Joe rogan and he did not explain it well. I've seen talks with max spiers, and most of what he says makes sense, but it's just hard to believe someone who claims to have had their mind fucked with his whole life.

       Just go to the 911 podcast and go to like an hour and a half or two hour in when he drops "the big kahuna". They talk about pizzagate for like an hour and then talk about chemtrail bullshit for a bit and then he's able to say what he wanted to say. There may be a post with a timestamp somewhere if you search the topic in the sub. There's probably a segment of it too if you look on YouTube. But those were literally his exact words I watched it the other day

       For me the base on the moon is more about our history,  or rather forces us to consider our history. Our understanding of who we are is non existent and I believe there are answers if we start asking the right questions.

       Elon Musk was just discussing how he's going to get through the belts. It would require a 70' degree polar launch while the moon is behind the Earth, using the Earth's magnetosphere to block harmful solar rays and space radiation.

       As I just said, Elon Musk discussed his plans for dealing with the Van Allen Belt. If you compare to Apollo flight plans and solar activity, they did none of this. In fact, when Apollo 11 went to the moon, it was at the height of increased solar activity which meant they would have been exposed to solar flares in addition to the belt.

       I'm just trying to figure out why we "can't leave low earth orbit" but apparently made it to the moon multiple times in the 70s and have yet to leave LEO again, with all our "high tech"
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment here someone made about our current tech being "high tech" but more susceptible to radiation seems logical at first glance, but how is really of a higher caliber if it's weaker and incapable of the same performance as "obsolete" technology?

       Oh that's not the only lost technology of the 1960s. Back then, we could put men on the moon with hardly any testing, in a lunar lander made of gold foil and cardboard. We didn't need all this fancy "safety measures" and "rigorous simulations." We even used a computer that's inferior to a modern calculator. No problem..... America was badass back then.

       One of my favorite topics!  But, I have a little twist to it:  How do we know there is an actual radiation belt?  Could there be a completely different reason that we cannot get beyond low earth orbit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I unfortunately don't have an answer, but when I think through what I "know", I always ask myself "How do I know this?".
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, I "know" there is a radiation belt only because I have been told by NASA there is one.  Since I believe our moon landings and Mars rovers are lies, then "knowing" something because NASA told me is not good enough.

       Well, the simple answer is the primitive technology used on the Apollo spacecraft was nowhere near as susceptible to radiation as the technology to be used on Orion, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way: a steam powered locomotive would be unaffected by an EMP pulse from a nuclear bomb, and would keep working, regardless. Meanwhile that high-tech electric supertrain would grind to a halt as its electronic systems were fried by the pulse - unless they were heavily shielded.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Apollo the time spent in the Van Allen belt and the primitive electronic systems that were less likely to fail due to radiation meant that the capsules could survive transiting the belts with little or no real risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Orion spaceship would be different because its systems would rely on very sensitive electronics that are easily damaged by radiation. Sure the astronauts will not die of radiation exposure, but if their power goes out and the air stops flowing, they'll be just as dead as if they were exposed to huge amounts of radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem NASA is trying to solve. It's shielding the electronics that matters, not the squishy things inside.

       FYI Aluminum filters gamma rays. When one filters out the low energy photons of any x-ray beam it increases the "hardness" of said multi energy beam, which has the effect of increasing the penetration power of the beam.  It's very had to believe Apollo would have been awash in radiation.

       I will explain like you're 5. Young man (or young lady), no one has ever left the Earth and never will. It is an enclosed system. NASA is an obvious scam to make you believe like we need to allow the government to steal 15 billion dollars a year from tax-payers for phony space programs, almost all of which go straight to the pockets of "The powers that be," and a small amount to green-screens, underwater sets, cheesy photoshopped pictures, and Zero-G(tm) flights to fool us into accepting the scam. Hey, let's "go" to Mars, and pay 20, maybe 25 billion a year for that deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Earth may be flat. After all, NASA insists it's round!
