<li>Most of you know that the elites are plotting to establish world government. </li>
<li>False flag terror attacks can only do so much to brainwash the sheeple. Whats next is a faked alien invasion.</li>
<li>False scientists, Hollywood and the comic book industry have for decades been brainwashing the masses into thinking that aliens exist on other planets and that alien invasions are possible.</li>
<li>A false flag alien invasion IS coming up. I say this because the elites not only possess hi-tech craft that nobody&#39;s ever seen, but also the technology to project images in the sky. Their goal is to establish world government and a false flag faked alien invasion is the best way to do it.</li>
<li>In the future, hologram &quot;aliens&quot; will replace ISIS as the boogey man thats &quot;out there to get you&quot;.</li>
<li>All they need to do is project alien craft in the skies, nuke a city and have every single news network in the world repeat the message &quot;aliens did it&quot;.</li>
<li>The only people who would know that the &quot;alien invasion&quot; is BS would be the Flat Earthers, who know that the earth is flat and that the heliocentric model is false. Only FErs know that there are no planets in &quot;space&quot; and that there are no &quot;aliens&quot; out in space.</li>
<li>The Heliocentric model that 99% of the world have been brainwashed with will facilitate the false flag alien invasion. Since most people believe the earth is but one of millions of planets and that there are other life forms in space, the elites can effortlessly brainwash the masses into buying their false flag alien invasion.</li>
<li>The only weapon against this future false flag alien invasion is knowledge of the flat earth.</li>

<p>Funny... both the curve and the movement are easily detected. Even experiments carried out hundreds of years ago could detect them, and our ability to do it now is far greater.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure they have all collaborated with NASA.  What makes you so sure they are &quot;completely independent&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forget the fact that experiments proved the Earth to be round thousands of years before America came to exist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m assuming that you are referring to the flawed Eratosthenes experiment that has to use the assumption that the Sun is millions of miles away to explain a globe?  Was that the only experiment that you are referring to or is there another one? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just curious as to why you think NASA is this omnipresent entity that has the resources to run extremely advanced psyops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They get billions of dollars in funding and we get CGI images in return. So you must think that Warner Bros Studio is a super godlike entity since they were able to create the movie Gravity (which has space scenes that look more realistic than what NASA puts out) with a mere 100 million dollar budget.  How could they possibly do something so &quot;extremely advanced&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They receive table scraps worth of funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol.  They get over $50 million A DAY!! That means in 2 days they have the same amount as the movie studio spent to make the entire Gravity movie and you think that it would be some sort of stretch for them to fake some images.  You are unbelievable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tons of other institutions independent of the United States from all around the world state that the Earth is round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure they like their funding.  What does stating that it&#39;s round prove?  That is like saying the catholic churches all over the world agree on an issue and make a statement about it, so it must be true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about private companies that are investing in space travel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you say invest do you mean get millions of dollars in funding from NASA/the government?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they sink all of these resources into advancing space travel if it was all a hoax?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well if they were faking it they wouldn&#39;t be sinking all of the resources into actual space travel would they?  They would sink a tiny amount into showing us bs rocket launches and pocket the rest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about private companies that are investing in space travel? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Branson said that he would have space tourism 10 years ago but he failed.  He couldn&#39;t make it happen even though he is a multibillioniare. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private companies have shot rockets into space my dude, give it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. Ok you saw a space x (the &quot;independent&quot; arm of NASA) video rocket launch and everyone clapping in the control room.  You win that is some hardcore proof, well done.  Please tell me you believe the footage of the space X rocket &quot;landing&quot; on that pad in the middle of the ocean?  It is obviously just a rocket launch played in reverse, it looks so fake.  Show me a rocket launch that &quot;goes into space&quot; and doesn&#39;t just arch toward the ocean until it is out of camera view.  People want to believe in space so bad that they will take anything as &quot;proof&quot; without even questioning it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True! according to the article that you linked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that the given minimum of 35,000 feet (10.7 km) is a plausible cruise altitude for a commercial airliner, but a passenger window probably <strong>WON&#39;T</strong> give the necessary 60° field of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even the article that you link admits that you would not have the 60 deg field of view to see any curve.  So OP was incorrect like I stated.  The op I was calling out also falsely claimed that you can see earths curve from a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RUI45ND-Hts/VMNQx2uD6XI/AAAAAAAAPgY/qIJQf7eGM_M/s1600/flat-earth-horizon-flat.jpg">mountain</a>, lol.  </p>

<p>There is non fisheye lens footage from high altitude balloons that go up to 120,000ft and show absolutely no curve as the horizon rises to eye level the entire time.  Just admit that you have never seen the earths alleged curve for yourself because I already made the other guy look like a fool trying to make that claim. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming that you are referring to the flawed Eratosthenes experiment that has to use the assumption that the Sun is millions of miles away to explain a globe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eratosthenes experiment was not conceived to prove the shape of the Earth. So you are perfectly right, the experiment proves nothing at all.</p>

<p>However, the theory that the Earth was round came long before Eratosthenes. So how did they come to that extraordinary conclusion before the experiment ? Well, I&#39;ll give you the two main arguments (note that these are not the only arguments, there are other parts of the puzzle that all point to the same thing)</p>

<p>The apparent position of known stars change when you go south, that is a fact that even Flat earthers agree on. But you can be more precise than that and tell exactly how much it changes. For example, Polaris go down 1° each time you travel 110km south (wherever you are). In other words, there is a linear correlation between your latitude and the position of Polaris.</p>

<p>Secondly, the relative position of stars do not change at all when you travel. For example the angular distance between Polaris and Dubhe is always 28.71° whether you are in Egypt or in Northern scandinavia. (So you can definitely rule out perspective as an explanation for the first fact) </p>

<p>Ancient civilizations that were travelling around had both these informations. They also had enough knowledge of geometry to see that the only reasonable explanation for these two things is that the surface of the Earth is curved. </p>

<p>Eratosthenes only came afterwards to give a more precise estimation of the curvature. </p>

<p>You are making an assumption that Ancient civilizations believed in a curved earth when in fact they did not and were actually masters of astrology, while knowing that the earth was flat and motionless (ie the mayans and the Vedas). Pythagoras was the one that came up with the ball earth idea as a thought experiment to see if they could reverse engineer the math to make it work.  </p>

<p>You should research into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-P2Et-755E">astrolabe</a>.  It was an ingenious invention from thousands of years ago that was used to navigate on a flat earth among many other uses.  </p>

<p>Ursa Major, very close to Polaris, can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude (the North Pole) all the way down to 30 degrees South latitude.  The constellation Vulpecula can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude, all the way to 55 degrees South latitude.  Taurus, Pisces and Leo can be seen from 90 degrees North all the way to 65 degrees South.  Aquarius and Libra can be seen from 65 degrees North to 90 degrees South.  The constellation Virgo is visible from 80 degrees North down to 80 degrees South, and Orion can be seen from 85 degrees North all the way to 75 degrees South latitude.  An observer on a ball-Earth, regardless of any tilt or inclination, should not logically be able to see this far.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of the existence of the astrolabe. Actually, I said that ancient civilizations were capable of measuring positions of stars in the sky. This is one such measuring instruments.</p>

<p>As I said, Dubhe is 28.71° from Polaris. I would risk it and say that indeed, you can never see Dubhe below 28.71° South latitude.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m quite comfortable with geometry and I see absolutely no problem with the facts you provided. On the celestial sphere, there are stars that are almost aligned with the axis of rotation of the Earth, and can only be seen in the northern hemisphere (for example Polaris). And there are stars that are near the plane orthogonal to this axis, that can be seen from both hemispheres (for example Orion&#39;s belt).</p>

<p>What exactly do you think it should not be logical ?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fantastic quote, but surely you realize that he was refering to the Michelson-Morley experiment, right ?</p>

<p>The expression &quot;optical experiment&quot; is supposed to mean a device that use the  properties of light to detect a movement. It does not mean (as your use of the quote suggests) that you cannot use a device to &quot;see&quot; the motion of the Earth. For example, something like a Foucault pendulum can easily detect the rotational motion of the Earth, but is clearly not an &quot;optical experiment&quot;.</p>

<p>This is incorrect.  If Foucaults Pendulum was caused by the motion earth then the experiment would not be effected by solar eclipses, but they are.  During a solar eclipse you will get different results than if there was no solar eclipse, even when the experiment is done indoors.  Again, an eclipse would not effect the experiment if the Earths rotation.  There are many other problems with that experiment, but the eclipses are the most glaring to me.  Ironically Leon Foucault invented the gyroscope which actually proves earth is not curved.  </p>

<p>So no there is no &quot;optical&quot; or an other observable experiment that shows that the Earth is moving. </p>

<p>You are jumping to conclusions. Why couldn&#39;t the motion of the Earth itself be affected by a solar eclipse which in turn would affect the Pendulum ? </p>

<p>Why would it?</p>

<p>They even admit in this article that it should not effect it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of rotating at the usual rate, as it did for the other 29 days, his pendulum turned through an angle of 13.5 degrees within the space of just 14 minutes. This was particularly surprising as the experiment was conducted indoors, away from the sunlight, so there should have been no way the eclipse could affect it! But in 1959, when there was another eclipse, Allais saw exactly the same effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think is creating the &quot;Foucault effect&quot; that he mentions several times in his article, if it&#39;s not the Earth rotation ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s obviously not the Earths rotation. More likely something tied to electromagnetics and or the Aether Tesla and many other great minds knew about.  Bottom line is the experiment is flawed and should not be taken as &quot;proof the earth is spinning&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The mean curve of our elementary experiment has exactly the Foucault&#39;s slope when the oscillation is in a plane. Thus our experiments are not by any means in contradiction with the general results of Foucault&#39;s as has been claimed too often&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That statement does not prove anything except the attempt to rationalize the fact that the experiment is effected by solar eclipses, why would that be the case if the earths rotation was actually causing the pendulum effect?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this settles the debate to know if the Foucault pendulum is an evidence of the motion of the Earth or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing that is settled is that you are obsessed with &quot;debunking&quot; the flat earth.  You were insincere in an earlier message when you said that you were just trying to get u/mark8 to answer some questions.

There is no way that you (or the others in your group) would possibly be this obsessed over a &quot;delusional fringe conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit: I just noticed that  someone in the known shill nest sub that you hang out it ask the question, &quot;what causes the Allais effect?&quot;.  One moron in there is vehemently arguing that it doesn&#39;t even exist.  Just admit that you guys have no intention of looking at both sides with an open mind.  Your job is to debunk any and everything that does not fit with the current globe model.  There is zero reason to go back and forth with you guys because you are not looking for truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One moron in there is vehemently arguing that it doesn&#39;t even exist. </p>

<p>You will notice that I was not the one that said this effect doesn&#39;t exist. I answered and said that the cause of the anomalous behavior during the Allais experiment was unknown, and this anomalous behavior difficult to reproduce (by the way, have you tried to reproduce the experiment yourself ? Why would you trust Allais over the other scientists that tried to realize the experiment but didn&#39;t detect anything ?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just admit that you guys have no intention of looking at both sides with an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have an open mind. I would be the first to applaud if the Allais effect proved that our understanding of gravitation is wrong. That&#39;s how science progress !</p>

<p>That being said, whatever the cause of the Allais effect is, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the long-term behavior of the pendulum is in perfect agreement with the theoretical result we should obtain on a rotating Earth. While this is not a proof in the mathematical sense, it&#39;s still quite convincing as an evidence ...</p>

<p>The #1 proof religious globe followers love to bring up, an experiment from over 2,000 years ago.  The Eratosthenes experiment of measuring shadows is assuming the Sun to be millions of miles away with light rays all arriving to Earth at the same angle. They don&#39;t. The Sun moves over and around the Earth very close as proven <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcteYfOMgJg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3m">here</a> (notice the hot spot under the Sun, that would not be possible if the Sun were really 93 million miles away) as well as measured by sextants and plane trigonometry, the Sun and Moon are both found to be 32 miles in diameter, 3,000 miles from the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>So the experiment gets the same results (on a flat plane) if you don&#39;t make the false assumption that the Sun is millions of miles away but instead much closer as it has been proven to be.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that you understand.  If you actually measure the distance of the Sun with the proper instruments it will be approx 3,000 miles away.  So the assumption is that the Sun is much bigger than it appears and thus much further away, that is the assumption and not the other way around.  </p>

<p>At the top is a side view of the sun reflecting light off a cloud into the eye/lens of an observer. At the bottom is what that observer would see.</p>

<p>The reflected light would appear as a blurry (because the cloud is not a smooth mirror) image of the sun directly above it.</p>

<p>No, it would not.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I was hoping you&#39;d go there. Actually, its <em>because</em> the sun is actually 93 million miles away that the reflection is not spread out over the entire cloud. Let me show you.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/z3mKZNh.png">Sunlight hitting the earth</a></p>

<p>Here is the sun depicted as a point source radiating light (the yellow lines) towards earth (the green ball).</p>

<p>You will notice that at the top the earth is far enough away that most of the lines do not hit the earth. Only the almost parallel lines pointing directly at earth hit it.</p>

<p>As the earth moves closer, more and more lines hit it, even though they are not parallel to the direct line.</p>

<p>What this means is that the further the earth gets from the sun, the more parallel the light rays hitting earth are. At 93 million miles, all the light that hits earth is moving in almost exactly the same direction.</p>

<p>On the diagram I posted before, you&#39;ll note I only drew in the parallel lines in the bottom &quot;observer&#39;s view&quot; diagram. Now here is essentially the same image, but including light that is not travelling parallel to those lines.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jLycQ9m.png">A nearby sun</a></p>

<p>As you can see, the rays of the sun that are not travelling parallel will hit the clouds at different angles creating a wider reflection.</p>

<p>Put simply, the fact that reflection off the cloud is only in one discrete spot proves that all the light must be travelling nearly parallel, and that is only possible if the sun is a very long distance away. It proves the sun is <em>not</em> close to the earth as the flat earth model requires, and as such it proves the flat earth model is pure bullshit.</p>

<p>That means a lot coming from someone that believes that the sun has been measured by something equivalent to mile markers. Copernicus claimed that he had accurately calculated the Sun&#39;s distance from Earth to be exactly 3,391,200 miles.  The creator of the Heliocentric thought experiment must have also believed systems of measurement are a conspiracy.  I guess about 90 million more mile markers were found to keep the math correct, that&#39;s convenient.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a buried thread with zero points talking to one person?  All I said was he hangs out in a subreddit that is known to use the keyword &#39;flat earth&#39; and brigade every thread, everyday.    </p>

<p>Maybe if that statement were true, but I absolutely did not call everyone in the thread a shill, not sure why you made that claim.  I called out the two people that came from the brigading sub.  </p>

<p>So is there a word that I am allowed to use to call out users that come from another subreddit with the sole intention of brigading a topic?  It happens everyday and there is no way that a group of people (that all come from the same sub) would be this obsessed with debunking a &quot;delusional fringe conspiracy&quot; every single day by going to every single thread that is created on the subject.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious how you came across me using the word &quot;shill&quot; in this buried obscure thread.  Did one of the two actually report me for that word or do you have some sort of keyword finder that goes through every single thread searching for that word? </p>

<p>Regardless of my personal opinions about that sub or others like it, if I were to allow you to start calling people shills because they come from over there then what&#39;s to prevent every thread from devolving into back and forth insults and accusations?

<p>It degrades discussion and cheapens arguments when you have a group of people that do not care about legitimate discussion but only &quot;debunking&quot; and actively brigading threads with an agenda, not for organic genuine discussion.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is a big difference between someone that disagrees and someone that is part of a sub that brigades a topic every single day with an agenda. </p>

<p>It should be known when users flood a thread from a different sub that was put in place to disrupt discussion on a specific subject. </p>

<p>Is it ok to at least point out when someone is a part of a &quot;brigading sub&quot; that actively searches out every single thread with the &#39;FE&#39; keyword in it, as long as I don&#39;t use the word &quot;shill&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the &quot;beam effect&quot; could also be explained as a combination of two effects: 1) the large surface area of the sun - which would send a larger amount of photons in any 1 specific direction, and 2) the refraction/dispersion of the earth&#39;s atmosphere on solar rays would suggest that points directly &quot;underneath&quot; would receive more solar rays than those which are  more peripheral to their path.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a scientist, but I think that the predictability of the orientation of celestial bodies is proof enough for the round earth. I think that the question of the effect does not put doubt into the shape of the earth, rather the distance to the sun (which still might be explained by the aforementioned effects).

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;proof enough&quot;.  All of the ancient cultures (like the Mayans and the Hindus) knew that the Earth was flat and motionless.  They were also masters of astronomy and successfully predicted celestial events/eclipses with extreme accuracy that would happen over 2,000 years in the future.  How could they possibly do this using a system that relied on the Earth being the center with the sun and stars revolving around us if it is just nonsense? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I no longer believe the Sun to be 93 million miles away.  It is pretty absurd if you actually use common sense and start to think about it with an open mind.  To hold the believe that the Sun is that big and that far away takes a lot of faith against observation and logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that the Mayas and Hindus had the predictability down because of extensive records (over a longer period than our modern archaeologists suppose).</p>

<p>The distance to any celestial body is outside the realm of direct observation; yet, these distances are calculated with the same geometry that gave them predictability in Western celestial models. On a flat earth, sailors would not be able to use celestial markers to fix their position on the planet (which they used to do before GPS). In the Northern Hemisphere, Polaris (aka North Star) is the same number of degrees off of the horizon as your latitudinal position on the (north side of the) globe. This also could not happen on a flat earth (unless the star is less than a thousand miles away). The reason for the geosynchronous position of the star is that it is in the same direction as the axis of the earth&#39;s rotation (less than 1 degree difference).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth without leaving Egypt. He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He measured the Sun&#39;s angle of elevation at noon on the same day in Alexandria. The method of measurement was to make a scale drawing of that triangle which included a right angle between a vertical rod and its shadow. This turned out to be 1/50th of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth&#39;s circumference was fifty times that distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of surveying trips. Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Syene and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia (a figure that was checked yearly).[16] Some say that the distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. Carl Sagan says that Eratosthenes paid a man to walk and measure the distance. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Olympic stade of 176.4 m, which would imply a circumference of 44,100 km, an error of 10%,[16] but the 184.8 m Italian stade became (300 years later) the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade,[16] which implies a circumference of 46,100 km, an error of 15%.[16] It was unlikely, even accounting for his extremely primitive measuring tools, that Eratosthenes could have calculated an accurate measurement for the circumference of the Earth. He made three important assumptions (none of which is perfectly accurate)</p>

<p>FYI - he was a bookkeeper at Alexandria Library - He had access to maps and certain (relatively short) distances were already established at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, the clock element is not necessary if they worked from the reference point of the solar peak (which they did). Likewise, using bearings to measure the direction to events such as sun and moon rise or set, would make similar geometrical/geospatial calculations possible.

<p>He didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>He knew that on a certain day of the year, at a certain time of the day, the sun would be directly over a certain spot. How did he know that? Because on that day of the year, at that time of the day - <em>every year</em> - the light from the sun made it to the bottom of a well without casting a shadow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstood what they mean by &quot;measuring&quot; the shadows.</p>

<p>He ascertained that on a certain day and time the sun would be directly overhead a certain well. This was proved by the fact that the sun shone to the bottom of a well without casting a shadow.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/T661Nuw.png">Here is how that works</a></p>

<p>On the left the sun is directly above the well, so the light gets to the bottom without casting any shadow. On the right, the sun is just to the left of the well so the light casts a shadow in the bottom left of the well.</p>

<p>So if you know that on a certain day of the year, at a certain time of the day, the sun will not cast a shadow down a well, you know the sun is directly overhead that well.</p>

<p>What this means is if you go some distance away from that well on the same day of the year and make a similar measurement at the same time of day, you should get the same results if the earth is flat.</p>

<p>What actually happened is that the sun cast a small shadow at that distant location, proving the sun could not be directly overhead.</p>

<p>This means one of two things. The sun is a lot closer, or the earth is not flat.</p>

<p>By itself, this measurement does not prove the earth is spherical. However, other measurements that calculated the distance to the sun, combined with this measurement, prove that the only way these could both be true is if the earth is spherical.</p>

<p>Of course, our ability to make the same kind of measurements today is vastly improved. You and a friend could do it easily using nothing more than a stick and a cell phone each.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easiest way to refute the flat earth theory isn&#39;t to compare sphere earth model with it. </p>

<p>You have to find holes in their model. </p>

<p>First, if everything was density and buoyancy. Over time, everything would level out with it&#39;s own matter. ie their would be levels of density much denser the closer to earth we are. Clouds and rain wouldn&#39;t work unless something kept the materials constantly mixed. </p>

<p>Second, land masses are still the same. Therefore, the sun must be moving 1,000 miles an hour to cover the distances each day to create day and night. If the sun was moving at this rate, where is the sound barrier effect? </p>

<p>Third, there&#39;s a sailboat race every year around Antartica. How are people sailing around it yearly and not logging 60k miles? But are logging the globe model miles. </p>

<p>Fourth, pendulum clocks. If I take two pendulum clocks that are in sync and keep on at sea level and one at the top floor of a tower. Why do they fall out of sync? The only explanation is explained by gravity. Density and buoyance remain the same, especially with a closed system such as a building tower. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth without leaving Egypt. He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He measured the Sun&#39;s angle of elevation at noon on the same day in Alexandria. The method of measurement was to make a scale drawing of that triangle which included a right angle between a vertical rod and its shadow. This turned out to be 1/50th of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth&#39;s circumference was fifty times that distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of surveying trips. Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Syene and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia (a figure that was checked yearly).[16] Some say that the distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. Carl Sagan says that Eratosthenes paid a man to walk and measure the distance. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Olympic stade of 176.4 m, which would imply a circumference of 44,100 km, an error of 10%,[16] but the 184.8 m Italian stade became (300 years later) the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade,[16] which implies a circumference of 46,100 km, an error of 15%.[16] It was unlikely, even accounting for his extremely primitive measuring tools, that Eratosthenes could have calculated an accurate measurement for the circumference of the Earth. He made three important assumptions (none of which is perfectly accurate)</p>

<p>FYI - he was a bookkeeper at Alexandria Library - He had access to maps and certain (relatively short) distances were already established at the time. </p>

<p>read stuff through a little bit... it&#39;s actually pretty interesting.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that you understand.  If you actually measure the distance of the Sun with the proper instruments it will be approx 3,000 miles away.  So the assumption is that the Sun is much bigger than it appears and thus much further away, that is the assumption and not the other way around.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstood what they mean by &quot;measuring&quot; the shadows.</p>

<p>He ascertained that on a certain day and time the sun would be directly overhead a certain well. This was proved by the fact that the sun shone to the bottom of a well without casting a shadow.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/T661Nuw.png">Here is how that works</a></p>

<p>On the left the sun is directly above the well, so the light gets to the bottom without casting any shadow. On the right, the sun is just to the left of the well so the light casts a shadow in the bottom left of the well.</p>

<p>So if you know that on a certain day of the year, at a certain time of the day, the sun will not cast a shadow down a well, you know the sun is directly overhead that well.</p>

<p>What this means is if you go some distance away from that well on the same day of the year and make a similar measurement at the same time of day, you should get the same results if the earth is flat.</p>

<p>What actually happened is that the sun cast a small shadow at that distant location, proving the sun could not be directly overhead.</p>

<p>This means one of two things. The sun is a lot closer, or the earth is not flat.</p>

<p>By itself, this measurement does not prove the earth is spherical. However, other measurements that calculated the distance to the sun, combined with this measurement, prove that the only way these could both be true is if the earth is spherical.</p>

<p>Of course, our ability to make the same kind of measurements today is vastly improved. You and a friend could do it easily using nothing more than a stick and a cell phone each.</p>

<p>That statement does not prove anything except the attempt to rationalize the fact that the experiment is effected by solar eclipses, why would that be the case if the earths rotation was actually causing the pendulum effect?</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s completely impossible to imagine that the movement of the pendulum can be the result of the combination of two things, the Foucault effect (due to the rotation of the Earth) and the Allais effect (due to some unknown phenomenon) ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing that is settled is that you are obsessed with &quot;debunking&quot; the flat earth.</p>

<p>Well, now that you say it, I clearly waste too much time doing this. But I feel that this is more useful than watching TV, and I find it actually more entertaining than watching TV.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact of the matter is you are part of a group that finds every thread with the term FE and brigade them in an attempt to &quot;debunk&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. As I said, I found the post here by lokking at the history of 8mark. I was looking at his history because I wanted to see if he was back on reddit to answer my questions.  I saw you talking about Eratosthenes experiment and thought I might add some context to his experiment. I don&#39;t see how I was dishonest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way that you (or the others in your group) would possibly be this obsessed over a &quot;delusional fringe conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>What can I say. Sometimes, I can&#39;t believe that some people are obsessed with collecting stamps, and yet they certainly exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One moron in there is vehemently arguing that it doesn&#39;t even exist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will notice that I was not the one that said this effect doesn&#39;t exist. I answered and said that the cause of the anomalous behavior during the Allais experiment was unknown, and this anomalous behavior difficult to reproduce (by the way, have you tried to reproduce the experiment yourself ? Why would you trust Allais over the other scientists that tried to realize the experiment but didn&#39;t detect anything ?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just admit that you guys have no intention of looking at both sides with an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have an open mind. I would be the first to applaud if the Allais effect proved that our understanding of gravitation is wrong. That&#39;s how science progress !</p>

<p>That being said, whatever the cause of the Allais effect is, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the long-term behavior of the pendulum is in perfect agreement with the theoretical result we should obtain on a rotating Earth. While this is not a proof in the mathematical sense, it&#39;s still quite convincing as an evidence ...</p>
