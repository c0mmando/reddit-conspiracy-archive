      <p>
       Our world is 1984 2.0
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the screens? The screens that could watch and listen and were a huge part of Big Brothers dominance. They are already here and arguably much more streamlined and invasive then their fictional counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets talk about what phones are to the world now. If you live in a developed part of the world you need a phone. Thats it. Its a necessity of daily life for the majority of the world. You cant have a job without access to texting/email/phone calls 24/7. People will look at you weird or even laugh if you have a flip phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people will argue "well just put the phone down!" It isnt that simple for people nowadays who have only had this advanced tech for a few years. People who had been used to a life free from the glowing screen in your pocket for years are having trouble breaking this new umbilical cord. Besides basically being a gratification machine, and essential to most jobs your family and friends will push and prod you to "upgrade" or "join the modern world" ive personally seen it hundreds of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       So weve established these devices are essential to 99% of people in first world countries and besides being essential people want them. They crave them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People wouldn't even blink at the huge price tags associated. They are happy to pay as much as it takes because they want and need their phones and even if price became an issue for the customer they would call around and just about always get the device they want regardless of overdraft fees or the embarrassment of calling up a friend or family member for a loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr for the previous section
      </p>
      <p>
       people LOVE their phones and will pay out the ass for
      </p>
      <p>
       Now lets talk about what this device you have actually is because a "phone" is an app that takes up a tiny amount of storage and use time on this device.
      </p>
      <p>
       This device scans your vocal patterns whether in your hand or in your pocket or during a phone call and can record audio in full HD
(This feature can be activated while the phone is off in your pocket)
      </p>
      <p>
       This device has GPS trackers in it that are accurate up to a few feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This device can learn your specific walking pattern/style.
      </p>
      <p>
       This device has all your browsing history (what kind of porn do you like? What kind of books do you like? What kind of anything do you like? What do you spend your time researching?)
      </p>
      <p>
       This device has all your messages between friends, family, acquaintances, lovers, and coworkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This devices has your pictures(memories) on it
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look back at that list of features and tell me that isn't 1984 on steroids and the worst part of it is we invite this with open arms. We are living a huge portion of our lives within someone else machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE FUTURE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its going to get worse quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when you could take the battery out of your phone? 
You can't do that anymore if you own either of the 2 most popular phones around and more phones will follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly the immensely powerful device in our pocket will be sealed shut and if you break that seal you break your warranty or heck if it detects a broken seal itll brick itself until repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember how i mentioned how hard it is for people to break away from the device? Whats it going to be like for the man thats had an ipad since he was 4?
It will soon be impossible to break the bond between these devices and ourselves and the companys are pushing that angle hard.p
      </p>
      <p>
       It was my job to use psychology to convince familys to buy their kids tablets. And if they couldn't afford it we could hook up a promotion and give away these tablets (once again aimed at children) completely free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive never had a single person turn down a free phone or tablet ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel so terrible for the new generation born into this. Their parents putting these devices in their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       1984 is here and they pulled the greatest scheme ever to make it happen. They made us addicted to the screens something we couldn't live without and now we all pay big bucks for the privilege of the screen. And were the first generation exposed to it. I foresee many mournful days when im old.

       Don't worry, virtual reality will come around soon and people will gladly give their own life essence and blood to enjoy that, so you'll have nice empty streets and forests and such to enjoy. If there's no killer robots, that is.

       And look at how fast VR has flourished already. A few years ago I remember being all hyped on the Rifts original kickstarter. Now all the major companies are full steam ahead on it. And i think combining VR and cell phones is how it will get into mainstream society. Soon apple will have their own VR headset and Samsung already is regularly giving the gear VR away for free with its phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wait till the day you walk in to get a new phone and VR is part of the package just like the charger and headphones. I give it 5 years.
