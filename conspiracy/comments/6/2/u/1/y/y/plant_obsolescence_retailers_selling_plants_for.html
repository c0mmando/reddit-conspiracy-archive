        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is not an april fools joke, and yes its a minor conspiracy because it doesn&#39;t involved reptoids, nazis or hillary clinton (who happens to fall in both previous categories)</p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this is a just something that happens because the people ordering them are ignorants who don&#39;t understand what they are selling, or if this is some kind of top-down corporate directive of &#39;who give a darn&#39; ism, but it&#39;s very easy to prove that companies are selling plants that are doomed to die.</p>

<p>Any area usually may have +/- adjacent zones within 20-30 miles, so it makes sense that if you live in zone 7a, then you&#39;d have zone 7b and zone 6b perennials.   I&#39;m not talking about that.  I&#39;m talking about being in zone 5 and selling zone 7 outdoor perennials.  Any egregiously wrongzoned plant WILL die from the cold.  We haven&#39;t quite killed off all the polar bears and melted the last iceberg on earth just yet.</p>

<p>There are at least 4 stores now that are selling plants for the wrong zone</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Whole Foods</strong> -- they should know better</li>
<li><strong>Earth Fare</strong> -- they should know better</li>
<li><strong>Lowe&#39;s</strong> -- they should know better</li>
<li><strong>Home Depot</strong> -- they should know better</li>
<li><strong>Ingles</strong> (southern states based grocery store chain) -- they&#39;re pretty much an unsophisticated grocery that does lots of stupid things like shame you if you don&#39;t have a customer loyalty card, so maybe this is a &#39;dipsh*t ordered them&#39; problem.</li>
<li><strong>Ace Hardware</strong> -- they should know better</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are selling non-houseplant (trees for example) that are zone 8 or 9, a zone over or several hundred miles away then you&#39;re setting up that plant to die.</p>

<p>The thing that gets me is seeing ANY citrus trees in NC.  They won&#39;t live. Impossible.  There is one that I have that has survived but it&#39;s specifically zoned and it doesn&#39;t do well. It&#39;s called the flying dragon and it&#39;s the most cold hardy citrus.  I had to get from a specialty place not somehting you can buy from any of the above.</p>

<p>I guess they are thinking that everyone is moving to Florida and they can take a citrus tree along with their kombucha and potato salad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gardening is a contemplative activity ill-suited to consumerism.  A capitalist system can serve gardeners, but it must be an honest system, and that&#39;s not what we got.  Businesses want you to buy and rebuy.  There&#39;s very little political will to go after those who defraud customers like this.</p>

<p>This is why you look up zoning info before buying plants.  Buy some botany and be ready to care for your plants.  <em>Contemplate</em> your garden before sowing it and you&#39;ll do okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, you&#39;ll find when you try to get into growing your own food everyone is trying to roadblock you.</p>

<p>The best defense is to know beforehand that growing food is a skill. Know your zone, your soil, where to get tested non-gmo seed. Learn to understand what kind of things certain species need to do well and compare that to what you have available at home.</p>

<p>Learn how to save seed because the future doesn&#39;t guarantee they can always be purchased.</p>

<p>Growing your own food is an invaluable survival tool that the government would rather you not have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you. I notice that once you get the hang of how and when to plant by seed, the plants themselves do much better than those bought already established. They like to grow where they germinated. Makes for a healthier root system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice a lot of stores also push plants during the wrong time of year. Some vegetables become so bitter they turn inedible if grown in an area that gets real hot summers. Where I live, these plants should be grown late summer/fall but I always see the stores pushing them 4-5 months too early.</p>

<p>Spend the time and find a nicely reviewed local nursery. They still won&#39;t be perfect but odds are they will have at least a couple dedicated long term employees who will enjoy sharing their knowledge. </p>

<p>Find anyone who gardens (at your work, neighbor, family member), they will most likely talk your ear off about it if given the chance. Gardeners enjoy it and most love sharing their knowledge.</p>

<p>The gardening subreddit is helpful, also has a nice list of other helpful subs on the side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Caveat emptor&quot;... let the buyer beware, eh? I&#39;m afraid that there are more than enough customers that know enough about plants and gardening that are going to make all those dealers seriously regret having taken that attitude towards them. </p>

<p>It also looks extremely bad on any of the staff that have to work in those seasonal departments and assist in that fraud instead of honestly advising their customers about what are the best choices to make and some helpful advice on how to take care of them whenever they&#39;re asked or simply conversing with them about what they&#39;re interested in.</p>

<p>Gardening is, of course, a great hobby and a great stress reliever and there&#39;s nothing quite as satisfying as planting and growing something edible that will always taste better than anything you can buy in the supermarket or that simply looks great and brightens things up outside your home but you need to know what you&#39;re doing and always do your research first and make sure you&#39;re working with Mother Nature and not against her so you can sit back and watch her do most of the work because she&#39;s no help at all if you don&#39;t and you&#39;ll never get it done or ever be happy with the results without her. </p>

<p>Moreover it&#39;s always pleasant, interesting, and relaxing research to do ahead of time, too, and you can do that in any season and no matter what the weather is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love your title. Plant Obsolescence - nice. Maybe it&#39;s a conspiracy, but maybe it&#39;s just a combination of greed and stupidity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a zone or two north of you and I have citrus trees in containers that I move in and out of the house seasonally, as well as a number of other tropicals (zone 8+). I get that you&#39;re talking about  outdoor perennials intended to be put in the ground, but people do have greenhouses, cloches, and other ways of extending the season.</p>

<p>Do experienced gardeners buy crap from Lowes and Home Depot? I know I sure don&#39;t. They don&#39;t take as good care of the plants as most local nurseries, so chances of success are decreased using big box store starts.</p>

<p>You want a gardening conspiracy? How about the State trying to shut down our local library seed exchange? That shit was all wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>commissioner Barbara Cross noted that such seed libraries on a large scale could very well pose a danger.</p>

<p>“Agri-terrorism is a very, very real scenario,” she said. “Protecting and maintaining the food sources of America is an overwhelming challenge ... so you’ve got agri-tourism on one side and agri-terrorism on the other.”  <a href="http://cumberlink.com/news/local/communities/carlisle/department-of-agriculture-cracks-down-on-seed-libraries/article_8b0323f4-18f6-11e4-b4c1-0019bb2963f4.html">source</a>   </p>

<p>Agriterrorism is a threat to local seed libraries - lol. Clearly not the sharpest hoe in the shed, this Barbara Cross.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a business that services these plants in Florida.</p>

<p>Lowes and Home Depot are a pain in my ass. If the wrong climate zone wasn&#39;t enough to worry about, the customer is usually transplanted from the Northeast as well.</p>

<p>They will tell me that x plant grew well at my last home. Which I then reming them they had arable soil, not sand, more than 4 hours of winter like Florida, and it was 4 to 5 climate zones away.</p>

<p>Now my approach when signing a new client is to set proper expectations by telling them which plants are going to die because they don&#39;t belong in this climate zone. They will bake to death in 9 straight months of 90 degree heat or drown in the rainy season.</p>

<p>The soil ph is another issue. Ixoras need a soil pH of 4-5 and the grass 5 inches away needs it at 6.5 to 7.5. </p>

<p>Magnolia trees I hate the most. They suffer for the first 10 years from overwatering. These trees are so ancient they evolved before bees. They evolved to be pollenated by beetles. They dont need sprinklers. They only need about 8 heavy waterings per season. Overwatering is the cause of approx 80% of issues here locally. </p>
