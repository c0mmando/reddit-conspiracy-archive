        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a 23 year old female. Succesful business owner, homeowner, and lover of fostering dogs and cuddling kitties. I was abused very badly in jail (march 2016) by some sadistic and corrupted police and correctional officers. They thought I made a fake rape report in January 2016 and were &quot;teaching me a lesson,&quot; they have been gang stalking me ever since and making me feel like I was crazy. Can you do anything to help me?</p>

<p>EDIT 11:37 PM PST:</p>

<p>I am working on releasing as much proof as possible to my website. I figure the more that&#39;s out there and the more eyes that see it the better chance that they won&#39;t try and murder me AGAIN. They already attempted six days ago when my Uber driver kidnapped me for one hour but I GOT AWAY again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly, I had a rideshare driver tell me that he had been a victim of gangstalking shortly before the influx of posts about it here. He didn&#39;t <em>seem</em> like a redditor so if his story was an invention I doubt it was seeded here. But it&#39;s surging within the zeitgeist. Additionally, OP has a post on /nosleep about a serial killer driving for a rideshare service. Just an interesting connection.</p>

<p>Side thought: Assuming that the veil of anonymity is what makes internet &quot;shills&quot; comfortable with the mob mentality and action necessary for the brigading, manipulating, and deceiving performed online, is it much of a stretch to think that &quot;civilians&quot; could be co-opted into gangstalking operations provided the promise of anonymity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, like that guy that kept saying the police want to kill him, even had a highly upvoted thread right here, with pictures of unmarked vans stalking his house and shit. Two days later his house burns down with him in it &quot;by accident&quot;. Nobody ever charged or even investigated. </p>

<p>My advice would be to just move. There is no fighting the cops in a police state, everything is in their favor and against you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried reaching out to legal aid? Women&#39;s abuse networks?  I understand they will spin you off as crazy so get a cheap recorder you can hide and click on too. Or get a call recorder if they call you.</p>

<p>Maybe try contacting internal affairs? But that could risk major blowback so Id start with finding a sympathetic attorney.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been harassed too by a local cop but thankfully my husband bravely but calmly fended him off and I had a lawyer on retainer because it was a whole ordeal.  He did retaliate and make a false report and put my child at risk but the claim was so absurd they couldn&#39;t close down the claim fast enough and he has been quiet since but over a year later and I am still afraid to to outside as the police station is just a bit down the road. We are saving up as fast as we can on one income to move.</p>

<p>I am praying for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can&#39;t say but I choose to believe her.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t believed when I told my parents I had been raped at 5 to maybe 8 I am not sure as my childhood is mostly &quot;gone&quot;.  It was done by my beloved my cousin who was 12 or 13 when it started. It&#39;s probably the worst betrayal of trust after the abuse itself to have your parents call you a liar.  To have no one, not even a reddit/chat room stranger, believe you. I wouldn&#39;t wish that feeling in my worst enemy.</p>

<p>It costs us nothing to be compassionate and offer free advice.  Judging without the facts could cost her a tenuous line for survival.  That one bit of strength it lends having someone believe you.</p>

<p>So... everyone on this thread be compassionate or ignore it if you cannot.  Don&#39;t assume you know for sure and be the person who tips someone over the edge.</p>

The day guys there was one white guy who was pure evil and if I saw a picture of him in a lineup I&#39;d recognize him in an instant. I have pictures of the police outside my house  they have just been following me a lot. A white truck has been following me a lot when I walk my dog I even saw the license plate numbers but I broke my phone and can&#39;t access the note right now.

<p>Here&#39;s what you do. If you&#39;ve got the funds, go to an electronics store and buy: a digital voice recorder, a gopro or similar mobile camera, a large fast-write micro SD card for the mobile camera, and a cheap camcorder.</p>

<p>Document every encounter and upload them same day with as much information gathered by these devices as possible. You yourself would say that you are schizophrenic, correct?</p>

<p>Would you agree that the digitally gathered evidence, which is impossible to doctor between your recording and your uploading, is proof of either the stalking&#39;s existence, or its non-existence? Are you open to the possibility that the patterns you notice are no more than chance?</p>

<p>If you gather reliable evidence of being stalked, you can legally pursue. If not, you may need to focus inward for a solution.</p>

<p>The best anyone can do to help either way is listen without dismissal, and offer solutions. It&#39;s the best chance to either help a victim of gang stalking, or calm the paranoid. If lucky, they may even be able to separate the delusion and find peace.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I&#39;m not trying to diminish what you think or anything, but just read this post YOU yourself made 10 days ago, and think about it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is important is identifying which symptoms impede your ability to function or experience peace and happiness. For ex, if you won&#39;t take your dog for a walk because you are afraid shadow people are waiting for a chance to kidnap you, that is a paranoid delusion that is impeding your ability to function. It can be very difficult to decipher what is effecting your life because we often do not realize (at first) that our psychosis is not matching with reality. This is why having a therapist experienced with psychotic patients is vital. They can help you recognize symptoms you never would have on your own (or at least not for months or years).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like you may be experiencing another &quot;break&quot;. I know this probably won&#39;t &quot;snap you out of it&quot; or whatever, but please try and contact a family member or doctor and tell them what you&#39;re thinking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to distinguish between mental illness and MK ULTRA. MK ULTRA victims experience voices in their head which speak with perfect grammar, have clear agendas, and often reuse &quot;scripts&quot; between targets. For example, dozens of victims near one army base were harassed by a voice introducing itself as Sally. Brain malfunctions (mental illness) can&#39;t do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best thing to do is to DOX your self in a forum that&#39;s allowed, it&#39;s not allowed on here. And leave a USB with a trusted person, lawyer, in case of your death.

<p>Then shut your mouth, pay attention, and behave.</p>

<p>Do not fuck up and get sent to a hospital. In a hospital they have complete control over you. A hospital is worse than a police station. They can drug you till your dead, or drug you and shoot you, say you were resisting. Harvest your organs and make a living off your body. </p>

<p>The better you do, the more they have to distance themselves from you. No one will believe you because of your history. Try to get your self together so you can make some kind of escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He went to jail and is going to be sentenced to death in June 24. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Three people were killed and scores injured in the April 15, 2013 attack, in which Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, detonated bombs near the race&#39;s finish line. In the ensuring manhunt, the brothers killed an MIT police officer and got into a shootout with police, in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On April 18 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released images of two suspects,[11][12][13] who were almost immediately identified as Chechen-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The brothers killed an MIT policeman, kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown, during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; he died soon after.</p>

<p>An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown,[14] residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.[15][16] Around 6:00 p.m. a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.[17] He was shot while still in the boat and then arrested.[18]</p>

<p>&quot;Count on me to show up and do the absolute best that I can. I know how much work goes into productions and will not be &quot;apart of the problem.&quot; I love working. I am not afraid of anything and I will do just about anything for a (cool) role.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I am completely honest with my psychitrist. They let me go when I said I experienced homicidal ideations but decided that I wouldn&#39;t do that. They let me go when I said I think the voices are from spirits. And they know everything about what happened to me in jail and how terrified of leaving my house again and realize that at my stage of recovery, I shouldn&#39;t be doing much better. I am in group therapy 8 hours a day still and have intensive one on one therapy for PTSD 1-2 times a week as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most abusive guards were the ones who watched me at night. For some reason only male guards were working at night. They were two black guards and one was pretty chubby. The day guys there was one white guy who was pure evil and if I saw a picture of him in a lineup I&#39;d recognize him in an instant. I have pictures of the police outside my house  they have just been following me a lot. A white truck has been following me a lot when I walk my dog I even saw the license plate numbers but I broke my phone and can&#39;t access the note right now. The uber driver that kidnapped me for an hour six days ago was in a white truck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am just trying as hard as I can to not be easy to erase from the physical world and the internet. That&#39;s all this whole stupid thing is. I wanted to go back to college without people knowing who I am. I can afford college. I&#39;m not asking for money. I am asking to be in your memory so I can&#39;t be erased. I am a victim and part of being a victim is not getting to choose what people know about you. I just don&#39;t want to be deleted because they are torturing girls to death 15 miles from me and NOBODY WILL LISTEN TO ME. </p>
