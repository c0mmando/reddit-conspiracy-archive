       It seems to me that more people are awakening to the reality of the world we live in. I see a lot of post about exposing the evil in power, but i rarely see any solution to the problems. I just want to hear this community opinions on how to bring about change.

       IMO, there is no solution per se. It's internal, which is the purpose of this "experience". Look within. Tis' all you can do, and is the point, imo...

       The argument to move across the Mississippi, but forgive my doubt that'll amount to anything. MN still has all the oppressive statist institutions I desire to avoid. Just because lands a bit cheaper and it's occupied by leftwing statists instead of rightwing, doesn't mean there's less regulation or taxation.

       It makes sense, stoned or not. I agree, but don't have an answer. It does seem like more people are waking up but at the same time you turn on Fox News or go on Facebook and it seems like more people than ever are taking the fucking bait. It's a mind fuck... sorry I have no answers, but I'm with you.

       That was beautiful. We're capable of doing incredible things but we've got to be held down so people in power stay in power. Or at least thats how I see it

       There's no doubt a strong effort to keep us down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it all comes down to money and how distorted it's made what's valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's valuable is what we can do for each other and our environment... not some lifeless object outside of ourselves (coin/cash/etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the value is separated from the human it can be manipulated/hoarded/stolen/destroyed/etc.

      <p>
       It's going to be interesting :)

       The people have to raise their voices way louder than this. Keep raising the pressure. We can switch to the sacred economics model is they tank the economy. Also we need to find the hoards of resources and technology they are holding from us. That in itself will skyrocket humanity.

       It has to do with competition, and the law of the jungle. Until people can accept one another's beliefs or settle on a moral ground there will always be disputes, wars, and atrocities.
I think humankind is bound to fight until the end of it's  existence unless we get together and decide to build a community that shares common goals rather than self preservation. Sadly many humans have a distinct trait of wanting for self more than their fellow man.

       I would love to think that one day we could come together as a fellowship of man and truly work together to fix our problems, but the older I get the more I realize and believe that it will never happen.  I don't want to argue with anyone who believes it can and will though, as this belief is not one I enjoy, and I'd love to be wrong.  The fact is, we are dumb hairless apes that only just figured out how to flourish, and flourish we have to the detriment of this ecosystem.  I do not believe even a thousand Elon Musks or the worlds best scientists can save us, for a jump to the stars and a Star Trek like future.  We developed too quickly, and in only the span of only about 200 years went from a near pristine world, to disasters too numerous to mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fix our current problems (specifically just our government, USA), it would take mass protest, mass civil disobedience, and people willing to lay their bodies on the machine.  Not enough of us feel compelled to really make that happen-- yet.  TPTB make sure we are tethered to a job and responsibilities, make us fearful to speak out, and have entrenched themselves very well with a militarized police for example.  The problems are vast and myriad, and yet I don't see an urgency in people, not a real urgency.  Sure, people will sign a petition, but who will go sit in a senators office and refuse to move until demands are met?  Who will start demanding answers in a real way from those in charge?  I see Abby Martin and a handful of others, but investigative reporting is almost non existent, and its a very necessary part of fixing our problems.  TPTB are not held accountable, and therefore they are not.  If people en masse surrounded their homes for weeks on end, you would see change.  They would be terrified.  This is what took place in Iceland recently, and change happened practically overnight.  Americans are waking up, but haven't yet shown the strength they really have.  They destroyed Occupy with ease, and DAPL has not gotten the support it deserves.  Too many people instead of cheering on protesters see them as traitors and deride them.  They should be reminded of how fucked our world is and be more willing to view them as patriots that see a problem that they want solved.  "Dissent is the highest form of patriotism."  That needs to be pounded into peoples' heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I firmly believe that there are some at the top that really need to see justice and haven't.  That is why our government no longer works for us.  That is why they laugh at an under 10% approval rating and don't give a rats ass.  They work for the billionaire class, and nothing could be more obvious than that.  If certain people paid for their crimes, our world would be vastly different than the world you see today with zero accountability.
      </p>

       Anyway, I've written too much already and I doubt anyone will care.  Blah.  Just random thoughts I think about way too often.

       For the US, a Constitutional Convention is a possible peaceful solution. Along with a history lesson for those who need the refresher.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original Constitutional Convention was intended to rewrite the Articles of Confederation, not to construct the framework for an entirely new form of government. The Federalists jacked that purpose and pushed through a document that centered power and resources in DC. We are suffering the consequences of that action today, writ larger than any of the founding fathers could possibly have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the "give me liberty or give me death" guy - Patrick Henry? He knew what was up. Refused to attend the Convention because he "smelt a rat in Philadelphia..."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, federalism: we done did that. How'd it work out for us? Madison and Hamilton led us down the wrong path. Mayhap we ought to give Jefferson a try.
