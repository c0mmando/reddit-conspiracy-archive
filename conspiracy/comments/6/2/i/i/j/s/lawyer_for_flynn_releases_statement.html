<p>I&#39;d like to discuss the statement from Flynns lawyer it reads as such </p>

<blockquote>
<p>General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he <strong>very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.</strong></p>

<p>Out of respect for the committees, we will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place. <strong>But it is important to acknowledge the circumstances in which those discussions are occurring.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The middle paragraph just details his career and accomplishments, the details of which aren&#39;t important here so I&#39;ll leave it out but you can read it in the link provided) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding his life of national service, <em>the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason</em>, and vicious innuendo directed against him. He is now the <em>target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated</em>. <strong>No reasonable person who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against their unfair prosecution.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now could someone please explain to me why people think this is so huge? Especially considering the lines I&#39;ve highlighted. I&#39;m no legal expert but that doesn&#39;t really sound like it&#39;s going to be very helpful to the people who think this is the beginning of the end for Trump. I want to put this situation to bed as much as the next person and I would be equally as thrilled to have definitive evidence for any outcome of the situation, but I just don&#39;t see how this is the &quot;big break&quot; or even slightly helpful. By the sounds of it Flynn wants to tell his story but is asking for immunity because of the &quot;witch hunt&quot; and &quot;highly politicized&quot; circumstances. In other words he doesn&#39;t trust that he will be subject to fair judgement. It really looks like Flynn is gearing up to claim his innocence through and through. And for anyone who says &quot;innocent people don&#39;t need immunity&quot; I say that&#39;s extremely naive. </p>

<p>&quot;So, roughly six in 10 people acknowledge that they have done nothing more than read news headlines in the past week. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/19/americans-read-headlines-and-not-much-else/?utm_term=.3cedc9757341">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/19/americans-read-headlines-and-not-much-else/?utm_term=.3cedc9757341</a></p>

<p>A recent study confirmed this phenomenon isn’t in our heads; in fact, 59 percent of all links shared on social networks aren’t actually clicked on at all, implying the majority of article shares aren’t based on actual reading.

    <div class="md"><p>I blame public school indoctrination. They taught us not to read.  It&#39;s barely required outside textbooks and a few books a year considered classics especially for social justice.</p>

<p>Then they teach is ro open a book and read the table of contents and then each headline or title and then fo back and actually read it.  But people are lazy and because they didn&#39;t dive right in and actually get interested they stop with the titles, pictures and captions whenever they can hey away with it.  Then base tests for novels off cliff notes and everyone is programmed to parrot, shallowly scan any reading and move on etc.</p>

<p>Now I am sure things have changed as I turn 40 this year but I bet this still goes on and made worse by that Common Core travesty.  And I am comparing my various states and cities of learning and this is a common practice in Dallas and Ft Worth, Euless,  san jose and san diego, orlando and houston.</p>

<p>Look at the curriculum and tests from 19th century and even someone as well read as I am barely scratches the surface.  And the learned folks had much better language skills and broad vocabulary too.</p>

<p>I am not at all surprised people rely on headlines same as sound bytes.  They also conflate satire people with the real thing. The times SNL Palin gets quoted as real Palin well I&#39;d have my new house already if I got a $100 bucks for each time.  Hey I want land for my sustainable family farm =)</p>

What&#39;s a play here? That&#39;s what has to be asked because besides that there&#39;s nothing else to imply his guilt in anything. The phone call was legal and innocuous why lie about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely and that&#39;s really just what we all want which is answers. And as far as why make the dramatic statement? Well the news of the meeting made it to the press and the media immediately spun it to confirm guilt and they released the statement to quell the theories but most people won&#39;t even read the letter just the headlines that came before it. They only made the statement after the media ran with the meeting/immunity request </p>

<p>So where&#39;s the fire?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a conflict of interest. Besides, it is a dangerous a ludicrous fallacy to believe that, just because people think he is guilty, there must never be an investigation into his potential guilt.</p>

<p>If that were true, then nobody would go to court until every single person already knows they are guilty!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah who&#39;s calling for no investigation? If there&#39;s grounds for an investigation that go for it, but the letter here is pretty firm in stating that there is no grounds for such investigation. That is obviously a biased claim as it comes from his lawyer but it puts the ball in their court to prove that their is grounds for an investigation which we will hopefully see. And that&#39;s not calling for evidence that&#39;s calling for the bare minimum required to start an investigation. </p>

<p>You just seem to be missing the key points:</p>

<p>Flynn is asserting his innocence </p>

<p>He will testify to his innocence but only if he&#39;s given immunity</p>

<p>He wants immunity because of the current climate, he feels that there&#39;s unfounded rumours and claims against him and only a fool would testify under such circumstances without protection. It&#39;s really naive to assume that he shouldn&#39;t be asking for immunity if he&#39;s innocent and that&#39;s what this really boils down to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not protected if you commit perjury while testifying under immunity. So give him immunity and if he gets up there and says &quot;I&#39;m innocent and there&#39;s no Russian involvement&quot; and he&#39;s lying then he&#39;s fucked and he won&#39;t be protected from further legal action. If you give him immunity and he gets up there and spills the beans on some grand scheme involving Russia to undermine the election and his/any trump persons involvement then what&#39;s happened is you&#39;ve sacrificed giving Flynn immunity to bring down the whole house of cards. If giving Flynn immunity blows the whole lid off the situation then I say fuckin go for it. What&#39;s there to lose giving him immunity?  </p>

<p>If you have been given a legal assurance that you wont be prosecuted, then you have been granted immunity. &quot; Assurances against unfair prosecution&quot; is just his lawyers way of spinning it.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely and that&#39;s really just what we all want which is answers. And as far as why make the dramatic statement? Well the news of the meeting made it to the press and the media immediately spun it to confirm guilt and they released the statement to quell the theories but most people won&#39;t even read the letter just the headlines that came before it. They only made the statement after the media ran with the meeting/immunity request </p>

<p>&quot;So, roughly six in 10 people acknowledge that they have done nothing more than read news headlines in the past week. &quot;</p>

<p>A recent study confirmed this phenomenon isn’t in our heads; in fact, 59 percent of all links shared on social networks aren’t actually clicked on at all, implying the majority of article shares aren’t based on actual reading.

    <div class="md"><p>I said around 50 percent never read more than a headline, its actually closer to 60. And if around 60 share articles without reading more than a headline, then it&#39;s safe to say more than 70 never finish an article. So mad. Lol. </p>
