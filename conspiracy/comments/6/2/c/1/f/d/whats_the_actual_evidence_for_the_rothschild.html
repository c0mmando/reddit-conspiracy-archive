        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a longtime skeptic that has decided to open his mind up more. I have observed my mind very carefully and noticed that the only reason I immediately dismiss conspiracy theories is a conditioned response. It&#39;s like I want to believe things are running exactly as they&#39;re supposed to, so considering otherwise is an unpleasant thought that I avoid. It also seems that the general public has a negative image they associate with conspiracy theorists. Rather than examining the evidence itself objectively, they equate the conspiracy extremist with the content of the conspiracy itself. It almost seems engineered, like it was intended to stop the TRUE conspiracies from arising.</p>

<p>It seems that in every ideological dichotomy, there are two &quot;extremist&quot; poles. On one end, there&#39;s the radical conspiracy theorist touting illuminati/occultism, citing the owl on the dollar bill and on the other end, there&#39;s the hard skeptics that immediately deny it. Both poles paint the other side as the most absurd, which puts most people in a position where they&#39;re either one or the other, no in-between. I&#39;ve come to realize that TRUE skepticism is a complete openness to the truth, whatever it may be. It&#39;s being skeptical of your own skepticism, being able to recognize your own wishful thinking and it&#39;s effect on your beliefs. </p>

<p>The Rothschild Conspiracy is the most fascinating to me and I have been investigating it myself. In the confrontations on YouTube, he certainly looks concerned when NWO is brought up. So in my searching for truth, it seems that I can only find information from one pole or the other. Either it&#39;s manic ramblings with no real sources, or skeptics immediately debunking it with information that could be fabricated, or missing the underlying points altogether and appearing to have debunked it only on the surface. For example, the debate on how rich the family actually is. The skeptics say that their wealth can be traced, citing Forbes and other methods of measuring wealth. But the true skeptic in me realizes that OF COURSE this family&#39;s wealth won&#39;t be easily traced, that the information itself could be falsified given the family has the magnitude of power theorized. </p>

<p>So how would I go about investigating the TRUE OBJECTIVE facts? The actual connections between things and events? I want whatever primary/secondary sources I can find that will let my intuition do the rest. Where can a skeptical conspiracy theorist go for objective and factual information that can be sourced and linked?</p>

<p>As far as I know there is no specific way to research true objective facts. But you seem to be developing a very solid grasp on things; keep using your intuitive logic and if you hang around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> long enough you will begin to identify the big picture in the sea of nonsense.</p>

<p>It is my personal opinion that all of the symbology, Satan worship and occultism is bullshit to hide the control mechanism, which is so simple that it&#39;s laughable. They may have their hidden histories and secret societies, but without the control of the currency, all of that is &quot;meh... nice Babylonian rituals you assholes are perpetuating. The rest of the world would like to evolve, thanks.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think objective facts are hard to come by. You should try to brush up on history as much as possible and then put together things yourself. When the truth is hidden and rendered obfuscated, you have to use your eyes and ears, and find the truth yourself. There is no truly hiding it, only masking it, there are many ways to confuse yourself into it being one thing or the other, something other than the truth. You don&#39;t need it told to you. The history is right in the books. There is enough to see, plainly in view, that will show you everything isn&#39;t really how it&#39;s claimed, you don&#39;t need it to be objective like a rubber stamp. Nothing is truly objective, even in science everything is falsifiable. What is life but a perception of events occurring one after the other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trick is using your own discernment. Look at people like JFK and ask yourself what was he doing before he got shot in the head. He wanted to bring back the United States treasury (instead of a Rothschild Federal Reserve)(you do know the federal reserve is a privately owned banking corporation?) He wanted to dismantle the CIA. (The director of the CIA good ol HW Bush didn&#39;t like that.)</p>

<p>In fact, look up the speech that got JFK killed. Don&#39;t listen to what people tell you. Look up people that got shot in the face. They have the most to say. And the most that somebody else didn&#39;t want them to say.</p>

<p>We were all conditioned. It&#39;s like Malcolm X used to say &quot;Who taught you to hate a man because of the color of his skin?&quot; Well when you&#39;re thinking of something ask yourself who taught you to think like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude black people can go to college so easily, theres more scholarships simply for being black than for any other reason. That coupled with financial aid (which is currently paying me to go to school, and by that I mean they&#39;re overpaying by $300 which means money in my pocket this semester), it&#39;s a little ridiculous. There&#39;s plenty of opportunities to better themselves. Most people who live in the ghetto choose not to improve their lives. They choose to be violent, while the CIA does bring drugs in there, they aren&#39;t forcing anyone to commit non drug related crimes or acts of violence. For that matter, blacks are the only people I have ever met who when selling drugs view their customers as not even human (have heard this sentiment more times than I can count in rehabs and outpatient counseling), slavery basically reversed in that sense. You don&#39;t really see poor white people going around shooting people and whatnot. </p>

<p>To simply blame the government and hold an entire race unaccountable for acting like complete savages whenever they all live together is absolutely ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called social engineering. That is my point. Why do you think a certain race of people are just more prone to violence? They were taught through social engineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never mentioned white people for one thing. So don&#39;t buy that. I&#39;m not selling it. I never said people in the ghetto don&#39;t have to take responsibility for their actions. I&#39;m saying that there is a criminal element that at one point in time didn&#39;t exist. It was introduced by the CIA. It was engineered to promote &quot;thug life&quot; through media. (Project mockingbird) Blacks are racially profiled. And believe it or not the CIA has black people that work for it to. </p>

<p>Basically if you want to eliminate the problems that the CIA caused, you should probably stop the CIA from banking off of it first. If the problem is that you&#39;re too wet. You might want to get out of the rain before you start drying off. </p>

<p>If you can find any this sub would truly appreciate it. </p>

<p>If they are in fact silent partners with the central bank of the central banks you have all the proof of a worldwide  conspiracy one could ever need.</p>

<p>edit</p>

<p>In 1930 the Bank for International Settlements was established by &#39;agents of the Rothschild family&#39; and then the BIS went on to fund the Nazi&#39;s. How strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Montagu Norman was Governor of the Bank of England. The Rothschild family controlled the Bank of England since the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. How much proof is needed to actually believe? We sit at our computers, with minimal access to actual financial records and documentation, and many do not have the accounting acuity to trace a shadowy paper trail through covered up bribes, holding companies and philanthropic maneuvers disguising the backroom deals. I mean, the Rothschild family had monetary interests in both Germany and England. They were (and may still be) court factors for both royal fiefdoms and the Vat ican. There&#39;s circumstantial evidence through investigative literature throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, but to access actual financial records is probably near impossible for the general public. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what proof would be needed to make people believe.</p>
