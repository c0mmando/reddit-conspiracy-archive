        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I went for a night walk yesterday, was very surprised to see a setting <del>Venus</del> Mars <em>rapidly</em> changing colors like an RGB led light. Very surreal. </p>

<p>My best explanation for it is that the new chemtrail mix (which has been described here as more sparkly and I noticed that too during this month) works as sort of a prism. </p>

<p>As the chemtrail cloud cover moves in front of the stars, different particles reflect different parts of the light spectrum, so it gives stars and planets the blinking/color change look.</p>

<p>Just remember: before they start telling us that it&#39;s aerosols from balloons or whatever, the effects where here <em>before</em> the balloons.</p>

<p>The stars more affected by this phenomenon are the stars that are about to set; as those stars move closer to the horizon, they have to pass through more of the atmosphere which means through more chemtrails. That makes the blinking and color effects much more pronounced. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? You don&#39;t have to. Go for a night walk and see it with your own eyes or go on a walk during Sunday midday where everybody&#39;s eating at home (that&#39;s they time they chemtrail the most and not with commercial flights). Witnessing the cloud-grid  change into cloud-cover should convince anyone who watches it happen.</p>

<p><strong>edit and note for shills:</strong> thanks for the instant engagement and balanced downvoting to 1 point, it&#39;s good to have a theory validated every now and then.</p>

<p>The lullabye <em>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</em> was written before planes were invented. So no planes, no chemtrails - Yet stars were still seen to twinkle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should enroll in an astronomy course at a local college, or at least google your thoughts before posting. Stars change color through the visible spectrum because of shift in frequency of an object from the point of the viewer; also known as the Doppler Blueshift/Redshift. Meaning that objects (stars) moving away from earth appears red, objects moving towards appear blue. Since speed is also a factor, an object would only appear solid blue (red) if it was coming at us (away from us) if it was traveling at tremendously fast speeds. That&#39;s why they twinkle in terms of color and appear to shift colors, partial wavelengths are received as &quot;normal&quot; and some are received as the shifted version because they aren&#39;t moving &quot;fast&quot; enough..

    <div class="md"><p>According to what you posted, a change in the consistency of the clouds (in this case aerosols that refract different parts of the light spectrum) is actually the only explanation for the intensity and rapidity of the change in color of the stars.</p>

<p>Blueshift/redshift doesn&#39;t happen like an RGB LED light on cocaine, because the atmosphere and clouds have consistency in what they&#39;re made of (water and oxygen).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even know what the atmosphere consists of bud, educate yourself before you come back hot lmao the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, with less than 1% containing: &quot;a variety of things, including minute amounts of neon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, iodine, ozone, xenon, ammonia and carbon monoxide. At lower altitudes, water vapor may also be present.&quot; Now, all of these elements are capable of separating incoming light into your &quot;Fabled&quot; RGB LED light show.

<p>Yes they are.  Get a cheap telescope and you will see the twinkle of stars and color changes.  They change from red, blue and white and some times even yellow or orange.  This is from looking at the star through the atmosphere.  A cloud over head passing over a star is filled with moister and the moister act kind of like a prism and separate the light by wavelength(color).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m not disputing the prism effect of the clouds. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that it is the <strong>cloud composition that has obviously changed</strong>, because you don&#39;t even need a telescope to see the stars change color these days. They went overnight from normal yellowish twinkling stars to full-on disco spectrum party lights.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called atmospheric refraction, and it&#39;s been common forever. Sirius, in particular, is known to do this. The closer a star/planet is to the horizon, the more of this rainbow blinking you&#39;ll see. (Since the light from the object passes through more air.) </p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer in chemtrails, btw. But there&#39;s another explanation for the phenomenon you observed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fucking shit man, I&#39;m using the exact same words to describe the phenomenon don&#39;t you think I understand how it works? </p>

<p>This is about the <strong>intensity and speed</strong> of the refraction ie it&#39;s a QUANTITATIVE ISSUE not QUALITATIVE ONE. The light is refracted much more intensely (bigger color range) and much faster than it normally does this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, an increased number of particles in the atmosphere might explain this. And I, too, believe that the increased number of particles might be due to chemtrails. </p>

<p>It&#39;s geoengineering to reduce the effects of climate change due to  co2 emissions. The point is to act as a sun shield since we need a reduction in solar radiation of 1.5% to reduce global temps to acceptable levels. </p>

<p>If geoengineering works, the fossil fuel economy can keep on keeping on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct; they&#39;re spraying glyphosate/RoundUp on the food of the plebes (processed foods and non-organic produce). I never said they&#39;re spraying to control the population, couldn&#39;t you find a better strawman to post? This is the most unimaginative shill tactic of the whole thread. Try to be more like the doppler redshift guy, please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no astronomer, but biggest &quot;star&quot; (planet in this case) in the evening sky is Venus[<a href="http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury">http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury</a>], hanging under Mars (which is also very visible and had a similar strobing effect) and you know what&#39;s hangin under Mars... Ur<em>anus</em>.</p>

<p>Quote from my source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This month, in March 2017, it may be possible to see Venus as both the evening “star” and morning “star” from northerly latitudes for a few to several days,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not only you can&#39;t read, you also demonstratively don&#39;t know shit about what&#39;s up there. An idiot and a liar! Unless of course you&#39;re one of those flat earth geniuses who thinks we all have the same night sky. Which would make you &quot;just&quot; an idiot, albeit a pretty big one.</p>

<p>And btw, the name of the planet doesn&#39;t even matter. A few days ago, a group of people I was with noticed the stars were strobing like disco lights.  In the past they didn&#39;t. People will watch and they&#39;ll see for themselves.</p>

<p>Cat&#39;s out of the bag buddy, now fuck off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you are outright lying and presenting your ignorance as fact.</p>

<p>From your own link (I&#39;m surprised you are incapable of even understanding pictures): <a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2017/03/2017-march-28-29-30-moon-mercury-mars.jpg">http://en.es-static.us/upl/2017/03/2017-march-28-29-30-moon-mercury-mars.jpg</a></p>

<p>On March 29th the object hanging under Mars was the Moon (you can see that in the image as a crescent, perhaps you don&#39;t know what the Moon looks like either).</p>

<p>The next image which you may be referring to is from March 1st, you can note this because under the image is says &quot;March 1st&quot;.  This is where Uranus is under Mars and Venus is visible.  Note, yesterday <strong>was not March 1st</strong> it was March 29th.  Try to keep up.</p>

<p>Moreover, from the same article which you seem to have lied about reading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From mid-northern latitudes (U.S. and Europe), Venus sets about three hours after the sun in early March and disappears from the evening sky by the month’s end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So again, you are lying and ignorant, nice try though.</p>

<p>There is nowhere on the planet Venus is currently visible at night.  You are making up lies because you don&#39;t understand how the sky works.</p>

<p>In the morning, not at night.  Find me a single sky map which shows Venus visible last night in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
