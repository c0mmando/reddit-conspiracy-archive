<p>I highly doubt that. When Bibi spoke in front of Congress, he got more standing ovations than anybody else who has ever addressed Congress (29, I think it was). The Israel Lobby is the most powerful lobby in Washington. No Arab lobby comes close. Jews are everywhere in Washington; not Arabs. The Senate just passed an &quot;antisemitic bill&quot;. There is no &quot;anti-Arabism bill&quot;. Politicians are scared shit-less of pissing off the Jews. They are not afraid of offending Arabs because they love to keep bombing the shit out of them.</p>

<p>Some on this subreddit believe that the reason the Gentile politicians kiss Israel&#39;s ass is because Mossad has the &quot;goods&quot; on the politicians for engaging in sex with minors, and so the Israel lobby blackmails Gentile politicians. What do you know of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bibi got the standing O&#39;s IMHO because the majority of Congress hated Obama and wanted to shove Bibi as far up Obama&#39;s ass as possible. </p>

<p>Without question the NRA, AARP and oil lobbies are more powerful than AIPAC. Why? Because if you want to get reelected in either chamber you need their votes &amp; money before you need the Jewish vote or money. If AIPAC had the power you think arms sales to ME countries would be a fraction of their current level and Tehran would be rubble.</p>

<p>As for compromising material... I have zero direct or indirect knowledge. <strong>Zero.</strong> Instead I observe that corruption of all kinds in Congress is almost a fact of life. Hastert, Gerry Studds, Keating 5, the list is so long. And the list of foreign and domestic forces that probably had hooks into Congress is equally long. I sometimes wonder if you become Majority Leader, or Speaker, or Committee Chairman without those kinds of hooks into members. Ever wonder how Barney Frank became chairman of Ways &amp; Means when the Dems had the House?  So, to somehow think AIPAC has inside knowledge, or inside knowledge that isn&#39;t beltway common knowledge is nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Power and money are (most) often obtained through fear. Fear of government by leaders who lack imagination. Fear of an external force, by those with imagination and finesse. </p>

<p>Much money is raised and power consolidated in the name of combating Israel, Zionism, the Jewish conspiracy... The concept appeals to millions of people whose attention and money would otherwise be directed against their own corrupt governments.</p>

<p>The strategy is at work everywhere, not just against Israel/Jews, but against American conspiracies in China &amp; Russia; against Pakistani conspiracies in India; against Indian conspiracies in Pakistan, etc. Everywhere you look in the world you will find groups manipulating others by claims a certain group has rigged the game.</p>

<p>I believe the Jewish conspiracy is convenient for Iran, gulf states, etc. In the US its one of several buttons pushed to galvanize conservatives (of which I&#39;m one) against a liberal elite totally out of control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question, you don&#39;t believe any primarily jewish interests collaborate on schemes, which may negatively impact other groups, in general? </p>

<p>Bear in mind, I have nothing against Judaism. It is this thing about the human condition, wherever money and power concentrate gifted psychopaths are drawn like bears to honey. So, being <em>extremely</em> wealthy and powerful, I presume these jewish alliance groups are no different than any others, and they prey on those around them using the advantage imparted by their tribal relationships. </p>

<p>I guess I should say I don&#39;t think there is anything exceptional about jews. Their abuse of power will be proportional to their access to power. And tribalism is absolutely a component of that. And the rest of the world is in the wrong tribe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q1: I can&#39;t even think of a basis for accusing Israel of genocide, and I&#39;m trying. Is the plight of Palestinians worse as a result of Israel, yes. Is it at least 1/3 Israel&#39;s fault, possibly. Its also 1/3 Hamas &amp; PA, and 1/3 Arab states doing. Nothing coalesces support like a common enemy and Israel is nothing if not that for many Arab leaders. I can&#39;t even point to incidents that qualify as genocide. The Sabra-Shatilla massacre (750-3500 killed) was by the hand of Christian Lebanese, but Israel&#39;s inaction probably contributed to it. Its ugly, horrific, wrong -- but 1,000 times that number have died by Russian, US, British, etc., etc., actions and inactions. Genocide label really ought to be reserved for circumstances that warrant it.</p>

<p>Q2: AIPAC is internally divided between status quo believers (current boundaries), negotiated settlement advocates (perhaps lesser boundaries), and those who favor existing and possibly increased settlements. I don&#39;t speak for AIPAC, but my sense is there&#39;s an effort to pander to all three sides to achieve the larger/more important goal of maintaining status quo or near status quo.</p>

<p>Q3: It takes a certain amount of time and/or money to make a difference in these groups. Money in particular to have meaningful influence. I&#39;m not much of a follower and haven&#39;t the time to stay involved. The big donors make the big decisions also, and while that makes sense on a practical level, it makes participating less fun.</p>

<p>I accused APIAC of furthering a &quot;genocidal agenda&quot;.  (I did not accuse &quot;Israel of genocide&quot;.)  Right?</p>

<p>unintentionally or not, your complete avoidance of the term &quot;greater israel&quot; in your response to my question about that specific term / agenda -- speaks volumes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If, by &quot;greater Israel&quot; you mean an Israel that is outside the current borders + existing settlements that concept is a fiction. Its a fiction because the Jewish population in Israel, and globally, doesn&#39;t require additional land: 27,000 people per square mile density in NYC vs. 7,500 people per square mile density in Israel with 2% population growth per annum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the issues to criticize Israel for this one makes the least sense to me. AIPAC isn&#39;t calling for an expansion of the current borders into Lebanon, Syria, Egypt or Jordan. Israel&#39;s greatest threat is more than 1,100 miles away (Tehran). I can see where in 1967, possibly 1973 there would be something to this... but in today&#39;s proliferation environment distance doesn&#39;t matter much.</p>

<p>I could be completely wrong about that, I can&#39;t say as I have ever sat down and correlated the 2 groups. In fact if it is true and jewish people are excluded from membership, I would consider that a very interesting bit of information.</p>
