        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe I&#39;ve gone off the deep end but the conspiracy forum has a rule set that ENSURES if there ever were a conspiracy here against this sub&#39;s users, it would succeed. </p>

<p>In fact, were someone to find themselves influencing the mod team from within, the mere allegation might be considered ban worthy. </p>

<p>What concerns me is that I recently wrote to a mod, possibly the mod that stickied the anti AJ thread, I expressed disapproval at sticky-ing politically partisan posts, rather than explain his side of the story, he down voted me and ignored me. </p>

<p>I rarely post here but I&#39;ve been a lurker for 6 years here, I really dislike what is going on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>User posts a thread full of circumstantial evidence making pretty ridiculous claims against Alex Jones, standard amateurish connect the dots sort of post</p></li>
<li><p>Mod stickies this</p></li>
<li><p>Mod then justifies this by stating &#39;he&#39; or other mods felt people SHOULD read this</p></li>
<li><p>Mods are now encouraging people to read partisan theories</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line is that mods should NOT be stickying anything remotely partisan, when you do, it makes it look like you have an agenda and you aren&#39;t the moderators to fulfil an agenda but rather to moderate. Let the actual users decide what they SHOULD read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just a blatant misrepresentation of what was going on, many of the people being called out clearly were not participating here in good faith. Let me run you through this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reddit is filled with 1000s of paid astroturfers, ATs have been here for years pushing video games or even the vive, more recently, for politics</p></li>
<li><p>r/conspiracy shares a platform with 1000s of astroturfers as a result</p></li>
<li><p>Even though we are forced to co-exist with fake users, you want a rule that provides protection to fake users</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I frequent many subs that don&#39;t have our rule 10 and they don&#39;t have issues without the rule. On the rare occasion someone gets accused of being a shill, either the accusation looks reasonably correct and the person stops posting, or the person retorts and you engage them in convo and determine they&#39;re real and move on.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re doing is providing protection to people with bad intentions simply so that your eyes don&#39;t have to gaze over words that resemble a shill accusation.</p>

<p>Yes, but this isn&#39;t about Alex Jones and you certainly don&#39;t see Alex Jones videos stickied around here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People need to leave them alone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well no, I had a very specific grievance with them and the mod&#39;s response was to down vote me and ignore what I wrote. So I don&#39;t personally care whatever your general sentiment on them is, leaving them alone is certainly no solution for what I&#39;ve explained, nor for remedying my personal grievances.</p>

<p>None that are active. &quot;If you don&#39;t like the rules here, go live in Antartica, I hear that is also a landmass&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Rule 10 doesn&#39;t accomplish jack shit, I frequent plenty of places that don&#39;t have it. Even r/politics had minimal shill accusations when the rule went into effect, the shills tripled overnight once they made the rule. Now reddit is openly working with Shareblue.</p>

<p>There is a cabal of power mods that sneak into unsuspecting subreddits and internally take them over, I have very little way of assuring that doesn&#39;t happen here but Rule 10 serves to protect the bad people, not the good people. I&#39;m a real user and I&#39;d rather read 10 shill accusations than read 1 shill comment, what about me? </p>

<p>T_D doesn&#39;t need the rule because we call shills out and drive them away. Works pretty well. Occasionally we get it wrong and everyone moves on. We probably get less shills because we don&#39;t protect them.</p>

<p>Things T_D has disagreed on in the last week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tomi Lahren and whether its fair to call yourself a conservative despite being pro-choice</p></li>
<li><p>Whether Trump is better off shunning the Freedom Caucus in favour of allowing bi-partisan healthcare </p></li>
<li><p>Whether Le Pen has a chance or not in France</p></li>
<li><p>Whether we should be promoting old school people like Shapiro over guys like Milo</p></li>
<li><p>Whether Cali should secede</p></li>
<li><p>Whether its worth doing something about climate change in small steps over 100 years vs larger changes over the next 20</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the healthcare bill did enough to promote a free market on healthcare </p></li>
<li><p>Exactly what socialist policies are acceptable within a free market (cops, public schools, firefighters, etc)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>T_D agrees on very few things, there is constant disagreement amongst users, you&#39;re only banned for coming in as a non-supporter and then being disrespectful. Non supporters visit frequently to have respectful discussions and there is a ton of discourse within the comment chains. I frequent T_D because I hate echo chambers. The only things people there agree on is liking trump, disliking CNN and hating most of the democrat leadership/platform.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been posting here for that long but my general conscious is that a lot of people on here are against the Zionists. So I can see why they stickied the trump rothchilds connection, but that whole post is literally just guilty by association and speculation. </p>

<p>I like how the fact that we HAVE shills is also the same reason as to why we need to protect them. </p>

<p>No one here can make the statement that &#39;r/conspiracy does not have shills&#39;, we absolutely definitely do. But it sends the wrong message to your actual users/contributors when you punish them for defending their community from outsiders with bad intentions.</p>

<p>If someone knows what &quot;they&quot; have and have not found, that person could sell probably a half million copies of an e-book by end of day tomorrow, or make a quick few million with an exclusive interview. </p>

<p>The problem that person would have is that much of the material, especially the recordings, are classified as part of FISA warrants, plus the SF86 forms, statements to federal agents and financial paper trails. </p>

<p>But, all of these in possession, its content proving clear nothingness, the money&#39;s in the bag for that person. </p>

<p>So one of two possibilities exist: </p>

<p>A person making this claim on a message board has absolutely no basis for said claim....or,</p>

<p>A person with very, very high clearance and inside knowledge of sensitive information is chatting on message boards, with no intention whatsoever of providing any documentation for what has or has not been found. </p>

<p>Based on the fact that the second option is not only extremely unlikely, but would also be boring as hell for them...well, option 1 is the more likely scenario 9.9999 times out of 10.</p>

<p>But certainly in the unlikely case of option 2, the claimant would be required to prove the claim to be taken seriously. Many millions worldwide are waiting anxiously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s still just a word that shouldn&#39;t carry more emotional weight than &quot;loser.&quot;  That it&#39;s singled out the way it is is suspicious.  This is <em>EXACTLY</em> how the CTR takeover of r/politics began.  I was able to express my nascent personality freely and call people scumfucking shills when it suited me as I would to their own face.  But then suddenly I was banned for &quot;shill accusations&quot; and they through up that obnoxious AutoMod sticky on every thread about not calling people &quot;shills.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shilling&quot; is a verb.  It&#39;s an action any person or group can undertake at any time.  Calling someone a &quot;shill&quot; isn&#39;t in any way defaming or discriminatory, it accuses them of an action.  They&#39;re shilling for someone or something else in their argument and they appear disingenuous.</p>

<p>The more words like &quot;shill&quot; get banned outright, the more it appears the icy grey hair of David Brock; Alpha Shill, is in charge of this entire goddamn site. </p>

You&#39;re arguing semantics. * Downvote, RES tag, and move on. Like others said, you can&#39;t prove it, so why even bring it up? To most people who spend time daily here, shills are very obvious - I recognize usernames of people whose comments I have seen and I have begun to use RES tags.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your points, but I disagree.  Unchallenged propaganda is effective propaganda.  And you can&#39;t rigorously argue every shill post.  You spend an hour finding links and supporting evidence, meanwhile the shill makes 50 more posts.    </p>

<p>But, I digress.  The 2 reasons cited for why you can&#39;t call out shills are preventing insults/personal attacks, and improving quality of discussion.  I find both reasons invalid.  As I said above, shill isn&#39;t an insult.  Also, I don&#39;t think leaving shills unchecked is good for the quality of discussion, and the alternative (debating every post) isn&#39;t realistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, thank you for actually responding with examples.</p>

<p>The problem is that in that thread you linked to me, there was absolutely no proof that any one user was a shill. What there was, was a bot that looked at how likely a user was to comment on a given topic (this being GMO&#39;s).</p>

<p>The problem is, I might be reading a topic about GMO&#39;s and (not have an account prior) make an account for the purpose of chiming in. I might use that account a few more times because I&#39;m continuing a discussion about GMO&#39;s and then I might never use that account again.</p>

<p>Showing that someone has written mainly about a specific topic is not in anyway evidence that they are shills. A shill is someone who is paid to promote an agenda. Many people just have specific interests and don&#39;t necessarily discuss other things- on reddit. This doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re employed to discuss what they discuss.</p>

<p>As far as shills existing, I have not once argued that they do not. Nor have I asked for any &quot;hints&quot; that someone may be a shill. I know these things. I want these people who are 100% sure they can identify shills to point out a specific shill and prove to me that they are one.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see that as a likely happening. </p>

<p>My personal opinion: The number of subscribers on here, the topics in this sub, and the number of astroturfing organizations out there guarantees that shills will be present in this sub. Maybe not daily, but they are here. I assume they concentrate on the top post (depending on what it is) because that is the one that goes to everyone&#39;s front page feed. This sub averages about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic/">40,000 unique users on desktop per day</a>. &quot;Traffic Stats&quot; <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5w2obo/is_it_correct_that_mobile_users_are_excluded_from/?st=j0u5kh47&amp;amp;sh=2f787a79">only tracks desktop users,</a> which are 50 percent of traffic, so it&#39;s actually about 80,000 per day, mostly in the top thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent comment. We haven&#39;t taken a poll, but I don&#39;t think any of us on the mod team doubt that shills participate regularly, probably daily, on this sub. The issue is how we combat it. </p>

<p>A naive approach would be for all users who suspect another to be a shill to just call that person a shill. Seems fair enough, but what that inevitably leads to is long threads where the accused tries in vain to defend themselves against a charge that no one can actually disprove. It just derails the conversation. When these accusations become more prevalent, and come from both sides of the partisan divide, they lose all meaning anyway. </p>

<p>A far better approach is the one you suggest: informing users of the existence and tactics of shills. The only way we could rid this sub of shills completely would be to shut it down, and that would benefit no one but those who hire the shills in the first place. The best we can do is try to limit the direct accusations, focus on the <em>content</em> of posts and comments, and keep our userbase informed that we exist amongst shills, and probably always will as long as there&#39;s an internet. </p>

I stand by that logic in a truly fair and impartial Meritocracy.  <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, that means we should also have the absolute freedom to point it out and engage with it freely on their own level.  A shill shouldn&#39;t be able to basically show up, duck quaking like a duck, and you can&#39;t point it out without a removal or ban.  I fucking hate subs that turn into all </p>

<p>You might do that, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d assume anything about me. The viewpoints in those subs, at least news, are more representative of people in general than this sub. </p>

<p>Considering pretty much every shill accusation is bs it just hurts, if someone is a shill their argument probably isn&#39;t right and you&#39;d be able to point that out. If I was a shill I&#39;d just call other people shills as often as I could to derail even more. </p>

<p>You can point out someone is spreading misinformation, you can point out they&#39;re engaging in a narrative blitz or forum sliding, you just can&#39;t call them a shill to shut the argument down. </p>

<p>Good faith? Is that a joke?</p>

<p>Have you ever tried debating against pizzagate on this board? You&#39;ll get accused of being a shill and labeled a pedophile sympathizer the moment you show any criticism or skepticism of the theory. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not surprised you bring up shareblue and CTR either. That&#39;s the go-to copout response every single time this conversation happens. Hilary lost the election 5 months ago. What the fuck would CTR be doing right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you raise a good point here, and if I was the mod you mentioned who dismissed you I apologize. I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t downvote anyone who responded to me in either the sticky thread or the thread about it, but if I did, again I apologize. I think I tried to address most serious inquiries directed toward myself. I do think you have legitimate grievances about that sticky (which I did vote for), and I&#39;ve addressed them elsewhere and I can link them if you wish.. I won&#39;t be voting for similar stickies in the future.</p>

<p>I say you raise a good point here because if the mod team were compromised, in whole or in part, how would a user who suspected this or even had proof go about exposing it? I do think if you had solid enough proof, you could expose it widely enough outside of this sub to get most of the users&#39; attention, between voat, t_d, 4chan, undelete, and a few other outlets. But what if you just had strong suspicions? You could still try those outlets, but I agree it would be hard to gain momentum around the claims. </p>

<p>I would like to present the other side, though, the case for Rule 10 (this is my personal opinion, and does not necessarily reflect that of the whole mod team, hence I won&#39;t be distinguishing this). I believe with high confidence that shills regularly participate on this sub. I also believe that those who hire shills would love one or more insiders on the mod team, though I have no evidence or current suspicions that this has happened. I know <em>I&#39;m</em> not a shill, but with internet anonymity that&#39;s about all I can say for sure. </p>

<p>Yet I think the nature of these shills needs to be addressed. I can think of at least three broad categories of shills: a) hired by a company for PR reasons (think GM0 companies and the like), b) hired to support a particular candidacy (this would be CTR or some similar organization for Trump if it exists), and c) shills hired specifically to disrupt a community such as this one. </p>

<p>The first two are relatively benign to the person who&#39;s aware of them. If someone&#39;s repeating the same talking points for M0nsant0 or HRC, it is what it is. They might be paid, or they might just really believe in that product or company; I don&#39;t think it really matters much in practice. If the arguments are bad, they get shot down; if they&#39;re good (at least on the face), they&#39;re contributing to some extent. </p>

<p>The third is the one that&#39;s really problematic IMO, the one that just wants to disrupt. I could see potential employers being CIA, GCHQ (JTRIG), whoever&#39;s behind &quot;the cabal,&quot; etc. They don&#39;t have a specific goal like protecting a candidate or company, they only need to disrupt the conversation, lead people down fruitless paths, and in general keep the community from exposing real corruption and conspiracy. These organizations exist above the synthetic left/right divide for the most part, and their goal would seem to be simple divide and rule. As such, it would be hard to identify their accounts from their post histories, as they wouldn&#39;t be harping on the same few talking points. They might even contribute good content from both sides to gain credibility. </p>

<p>Now imagine your in charge of the shill accounts for one of these organizations. Would you want rule 10 or not? Keep in mind most of <em>your</em> shills would be fairly difficult to catch easily. Let&#39;s say arguendo that this sub was getting too close to a particular conspiracy that you needed to keep hidden. I imagine you&#39;d use a multi-pronged approach: you&#39;d (a) have some accounts providing legitimate-sounding reasons why the conspiracy theory doesn&#39;t hold water, you&#39;d (b) have some accounts calling those who believed it &quot;tin-foilers,&quot; idiots, and the like, and you&#39;d (c) have some making wild claims in support of the theory that made it look ridiculous. In other words, you&#39;d be manufacturing responses on all sides of the debate. And this would be fairly effective. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s say rule 10 doesn&#39;t exist, what could you do then? If I were running this scheme, I&#39;d have some of my accounts with credible post histories start calling all three of my first types shills, and use my vote bots to get these comments to the top of the threads. I&#39;d have the accused accounts get into long, drawn out arguments defending themselves, and other accounts come in to either defend or attack both users. Some of these accounts would have clearly shill-like post histories, giving more credibility to those accounts who called them out. I&#39;d have various accounts calling out the mods for either promoting or defending the theory, and have threads and posts spawned around that. Real users would start jumping in on either sides of these discussions, too, amplifying the forum slide. Give me 10 employees with 200 or so real-looking accounts and maybe 500-1000 voting accounts, and I could make sure every thread that popped up on this sub was drowned out in utter noise. Sure, there might be some decent comments toward the bottom, but I&#39;d make sure 95% of readers would never see them. </p>

<p>Rule 10 does nothing to stop these employers from using the a and c type accounts, and might even allow them to be marginally more effective. Rules 4 and 10 allows us mods to have some ability to fight back against the b-type accounts. But what rule 10 does allow is for us to somewhat limit the scenario I described in my last paragraph. It helps keep the discussion focused on the content and merit of the theory itself, rather than getting forum slid into oblivion. </p>

<p>You might say you&#39;ve never seen this level and sophistication of shilling, but I&#39;d say that&#39;s in part because of rule 10. We generally stop this from happening before it starts. You could say that <em>your</em> shill accusations are legitimate, that those who you call out as shills are really <em>are</em> shills, and I&#39;d likely agree with you in specific cases, but it leaves that door open for exactly the scenario I described. And if I can come up with that strategy in half an hour, you can be damn sure an agency with a black budget the size of several countries and some of the smartest, most devious minds at their disposal can craft far better. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the end of the discussion; it&#39;s the beginning. I&#39;m more than willing to explore this idea further with you, the various pros and cons of each approach. I do appreciate this post, as it draws attention to an important issue that affects everyone who uses this sub.</p>

<p>The problem is, I might be reading a topic about GMO&#39;s and (not have an account prior) make an account for the purpose of chiming in. I might use that account a few more times because I&#39;m continuing a discussion about GMO&#39;s and then I might never use that account again.</p>
