       Unless you're bypassing the flash, a userland app won't work, even with root. Remember, these bits of malware are in the
       <em>
        silicon
       </em>
       now, not just installed with the OS. This is how they survive a re-flash and reinstall/upgrade of the OS. It's been that way for many years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, many phones, televisions have 'fake off' modes, where the device is awake, but there are no lit LEDs or screen activity, but it is on and recording/transmitting the data.

       We already know that the biggest hurdle facing Big Data gathering methods is not the amount of data that has to be gathered and stored but how to flag and categorize what is considered important.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's so worthless in it's current state. Yes, the government can and does collect all of the data but they cannot effectively use it. That's why it's so ineffective. Big Data just leaves them with infinite fields of useless data until they find a way to actually categorize and flag whatever they consider a real threat. The NSA has miles of servers just filled with years of private data.
      </p>
      <p>
       This came to light because of Snowden and we know it's still an issue today. Inevitably, one day there will be a way for Big Data to work effectively but I think it will take quantum computing power to make an effective algorithm.

       But if they want to target one person it's easy... this is the real danger. Anyone who is a threat to them they can just go through their data and find some way to attack them.. This is why I think the way to attack them is to pump out so much data from each person, to sift through it all would be counter productive. But I don't know if it's possible to do.

       Big data gathering methods are not utilized to target an individual, hence the name. It's a surveillance method used to acquire information on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a government alphabet agency is targeting a single person, the sky is the limit really. For example; They can access back doors installed at the hardware level of all your smart devices, plant illegal documents, and alert the authorities before you even wake up for work in the morning.

       What I am thinking of though is like let's say keyloggers... imagine if you had a device you plug into your PC and it randomly generates all kinds of noise data. The same could be done with email and all the data they would want to try to access. Same with phone calls.. random data constantly pumped out that they have to sort through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I thought that's why they collected all the data.. if they want to target one person they just access that data collection point and they have all their data sitting for them to do whatever they want with. Find something incriminating or that they can use to discredit people.

       The reality is if you were targeted by an alphabet agency, you have no defense against their methods and advanced tech. Flooding your devices with worthless data will only put a strain on your CPU and slow you down. Encryption can make your data unreadable but even the best VPN's can be cracked with time and effort. Encryption is also worthless if you're already considered a threat since the whole point of encrypting information is to keep you off the radar. Ironically the intelligence community considers simply using VPN's as suspicious activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, all of this is irrelevant if you're already being targeted, since ALL of your tech is compromised at the hardware level and can be accessed remotely via installed backdoors without your knowledge.

       This has been a solved problem for many years. Entry-level data analytics tools can do this, and the more-advanced tools are even better.

       You don't need exabytes of storage to store the data, you discard at input time, what you do not need, and store/compress the rest, in a format that is already been through a pass or two of filtering and initial analytics.

       Big data is literally data analytics. You can apply this system to hospital patient history or for consumer tracking with great success. The issue is applying this on a much larger scale for mass surveillance. This is found to be ineffective for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about the fact that exabytes of storage is unnecessary in data analytics for commercial use. But the NSA is back logging years of data to form the global footprint of the internet. The NSA believes that all data is useful data and that this is the only way to effectively monitor cyber space. Which is insane but if they successfully find a way to categorize and catalogue ALL information then they will be basically omnipotent in the digital world.

       The goal has always been establishing patterns. The digital equivalent of 'micro-expressions' in our behaviors. Also to establish past crimes, uncaught, that could lead to future behaviors or convictions.

       Pretty much useless, since a.) any entry-level analytics can filter those out, and b.) searches are excluded from the results that ISPs are handing/selling to law enforcement and other companies, since they are all communicated over https. They'll get the domain, but not the search terms.

       See below, they can't get your searches. Period. Full-stop. Nobody can, unless you've allowed them to, through insertion of their root cert which allows them to introspect your data.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if it wasn't searches, it would be pretty easy. The larger the dataset, the
       <em>
        easier
       </em>
       it is to get specifics about individuals, because you have more datapoints to derive patterns with.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because that's how HTTPS works. All search engines use HTTPS, which means they're using SSL, and ISPs can't see what happens after session negotiation, other than you hit a domain 'google.com' or 'bing.com'. They literally cannot see anything after the domain part, unless they've forced you to add their certificate into the trusted chain, which then would allow them access to your unencrpted SSL traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they've specifically mentioned that search is excluded in the data gathering.
