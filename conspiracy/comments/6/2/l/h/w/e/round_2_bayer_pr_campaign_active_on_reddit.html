No, there is no, (PAID FOR BY BAYER) anywhere on this site. By design. Thats why Reddit is so popular among corporate advertisers. Thats how it works.</p>

Can&#39;t even do your job well.

</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The above are in response to <a href="/u/shillgambitoverfact">/u/shillgambitoverfact</a> who I very wrongly and incorrectly accused of bad things. I was ignorant as to the rules of this subreddit, and for that I apologize. I was wrong, as evidenced by his... umm.. his claims, he is without a doubt, 100% a genuine independent user of Reddit, whose only purpose is to vote, and comment on user-generated content.</p>

<p>I would not have reposted them in this edit if I was notified my comments were deleted.</p>

<p>So its common knowledge corporations are becoming increasingly innovative in their quest to placate the masses into traditional buy,consume,obey lifestyles. Well the kurgefuck video on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> (didn&#39;t bother watching it, you can just tell that whole platform is being co-opted by corporate interests, as is the rest of advertiser friendly CorporateTube)</p>

<p>I just wanna rally all the PR agents to one place. So, when you think of Monsanto, please stop! They&#39;re Bayer. Its Bayer now. They killed all the bees and now they wanna fuck the soil, and create a completely sterilized factory farming operation. </p>

<p>Over in the <a href="/r/AskScience">/r/AskScience</a> thread, where I was directed by a GMO-advocate to put forth my genuine question: Is conventional farming destroying the soil health, and if so, at what rate. My first comment was asking for sources concerning the level of soil health depletion in conventional farming vs. sustainable farming. Because all types of agriculture damage the Earth, but as evidenced by the past 10,000 years of human agrarian based society, there is a way to do it sustainably that doesn&#39;t fuck over future generations.</p>

<p>So after throwing pretty much every existing study at the GMO-advocates pointing to the very apparent reality that conventional farming is destroying the soil ecology at a higher rate than organic farming (organic farming is not sustainable, its just USDA Certified Organic) but the studies are still useful in terms of tracking the damage conventional farming is causing.</p>

<p>Here is why I know its  a PR campaign. People go to AskScience to get the facts, supposedly from people&#39;s whose job it is to know these things. So when I asked for sources, and hard data showing that I&#39;m wrong, the panel was only able to give me a bold-faced lie. This the PR campaign in action. People who want to trust GMO&#39;s see my blabbering, but when the moderator of the thread puts it to rest with a simple;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conservation agriculture, which contributes to soil health, is now widely practiced due to the advent of herbicide-resistant crops which eliminate need to till the soil. Soil is definitely benefitting from widespread use of GM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/62e54o/discussion_kurzgesagts_newest_youtube_video_on/dfmbp0y/">https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/62e54o/discussion_kurzgesagts_newest_youtube_video_on/dfmbp0y/</a> </p>

<p>The people on the fence see that, and walk away thinking the LIE that is &quot;soil is benefiting from widespread use of GM&quot;</p>

<p>I would like to ask ya&#39;ll to do a simple thought experiment with me. You might have never actually been to a factory farm, or  sustainable farm; but I&#39;m sure you can imagine what those two entail. Put your hand into the &#39;soil&#39; at a conventional farm. Now put your hand into the soil at a sustainable farming operation. Which one is healthier. Which  one would you be okay with feeding your family with.</p>

<p>I have my sources, where are yours, proving that conventional farming is benefiting the soil.</p>

<p>Then we got buttmunchs like <a href="/u/joatmon-snoo">/u/joatmon-snoo</a> who I&#39;m sure aren&#39;t actual PR agents , but they are so deluded into hating the &#39;natural&#39; argument that they can&#39;t accept that they are on the same side of the fence that climate change deniers are. I provided a wealth of information proving my side. Where is the opposing links, the opposing studies saying, &quot;nah conventional farming is actually good for the soil, heres some data.&quot; There isn&#39;t any folks. Don&#39;t buy into the PR campaign. Buy locally grown, non-GMO produce from sustainable operations. </p>

<p>Its an absolute atrocity that normal, healthy food is being relegated to the Artisan level. How do you expect normal people to eat healthy when they have to buy Artisan quality food.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.schoolofartisanfood.org/page/what-is-artisan-food">https://www.schoolofartisanfood.org/page/what-is-artisan-food</a></p>

<p>NOW PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG WITH SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. Not like <a href="/u/joatman-snoo">/u/joatman-snoo</a> who refuses to offer a shred of evidence saying that the soil ecology is not becoming more toxic due to conventional farming methods (which GMO is the centerpiece of)</p>

<p>Remember Idiocracy? Brawndo, its what plants crave! We are literally creating that reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not a matter of opinion. I am not discussing whether or not GMO is healthy or not. I am discussing the magnitude of damage to the soil ecology that is being done through conventional farming (GMO) is on a massive scale and is being studies concerning that FACT is underfunded in favor of distractions. Like the argument that GMOs are healthy or not. </p>

<p>People are placated by scientific studies. If the scientists (or doctors recommending Lucky Strike) deem it acceptable, the consumer deems it acceptable. Thats the PR move. It takes the attention away from the real damage being done by conventional farming, which is REAL. Yes, sustainable agriculture damages the soil too, but not at the level we are seeing on factory farms.</p>

<p>The top panelist on the AskScience thread posted this response when I was specifically asking for <strong>scientifically</strong> backed information that proves that conventional farming is not damaging the soil ecology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conservation agriculture, which contributes to soil health, is now widely practiced due to the advent of herbicide-resistant crops which eliminate need to till the soil. Soil is definitely benefitting from widespread use of GM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats a lie bro. Bold-face, bright as a day lie. As further proved the scientific literature I provided. I responded to that comment three times, asking for scientific data supporting her claims. Nothing, nada. Why? Cause that data doesn&#39;t exist. The only data that exists supports the idea that conventional (GMO) farming is damaging to the soil ecology, and as other panelists pointed ot to me, modern technological innovations only serve to extend the lifetime of the soil, not actually create sustainable methods.</p>

<p>Who funds this shit bro? Huh? Fucking Bayer get real dude. Who funded the 600-man hours for the kurgefuck video?</p>

<p>We KNOW Reddit is a corporate mouthpiece, it has been for years, that is common knowledge. I&#39;m just bringing to light the most recent one. Do you know how it works right? Theres now way to &#39;prove&#39; it, by design. Their just content creators, and reddit accounts, but you really don&#39;t think corporate interests use Reddit and other social media to advance PR agendas? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they dont disagree with me. They are telling lies. Why are they spreading lies that conventional (GMO) farming is not damaging to the soil ecology (as proved above, the top panelist LIED about that point)? Because they are in professions in which their paychecks depend on Bayer and other agricultural conglomerates. If you are a plant scientist and geneticist, chances are your employed at either Bayer, or another agricultural conglomerate that stands to benefit from improved public perception of GMO. Every single panelist on that thread was defending GMO on every point, even going so far as to LIE. Why would they lie? Its in their financial interest.</p>

<p>Yes, there is no evidence of Bayer funding a PR campaign on Reddit, as by design of the system. Its a wonderful ploy to convince users they are receiving information from independent content creators. But your showing your true colors a bit too much man, you are a Bayer shill. You know it. I would stop here.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;re telling me I should start digging into Bayer subsidiaries and start tracking the money flow? I doubt I would find anything concrete, your whole job is to obfuscate how the money gets from Bayer to shills like you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not actually. But that childish accusation says alot about your absolute lack of concern for any standards of evidence.</p>

<p>That would be a start. Investigating claims before making them is usually the honorable and honest way to go about something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But thats my whole argument.</p>

<p>The panelists on the AskScience thread are all in careers that financially benefit from improved perception of conventional (GMO) farming. They all unanimously support GMO, in every facet of its implementation, focusing on public health.</p>

<p>My argument is that the science (they are scientists) PROVES that the main issue with conventional (GMO) farming is not public health, as framed by PR, but soil ecology. However, I was actually lied to by the panelists, as proved by the scientific literature I provided, with no countering scientific literature from them.</p>

<p>Now, when do scientists favor fiction over fact (as proven by history). When there are financial incentives. Who provides these financial incentives....ta-da! Bayer, or some other agricultural conglomerate profiting off systematically raping the Earth.</p>

<p>The only argument that someone can provide, is prove it. Prove it with what? Transaction records between Bayer subsidiaries and shell companies. Or that geneticist and plant scientists literally collect their paychecks from Big Ag?</p>

<p>Bayer.</p>
