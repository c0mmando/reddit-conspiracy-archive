<p>Conspiracies are being created all the time. Evil people meet behind closed doors and plan illegal activities. If that isn&#39;t the case, why are the prisons so full? </p>

<p>I think conspiracy researchers are some of the most honest people on Earth. I&#39;d like to think they are also the most decent human beings you&#39;ll find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how you wake them up. I hit everyone with random facts and have been massively successful. It&#39;s all based on what they say. Whatever they say think down their thought paths and show them. My opinion on the world is that everything is bullshit and that the second the people get the real power we will fix everything. I tell everyone that straight up and no one thinks I am straight up retarded.</p>

<p>I just tell them to look at the world. We owe bankers 200 trillion in debt because they control the money and charge us interest.</p>

<p>We are in war in the middle east because they were fighting against the central banks.</p>

<p>Once you start telling people the world is stupid they&#39;ll do it themselves and they&#39;ll talk themselves, just treat it as a joke. The world is truly a joke because the earth is actually flat. Tell people problems cause right in our face everyone ignores. It&#39;s a thought path but I am serious when I say if you know how to talk you&#39;ll be able to talk to women really good. Guys are cool but I&#39;d say only 1/3rd or less are truly worth being friends with currently but thats just me. Talk with all.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;n way different and I have yet to realize it yet, i feel like that might be the case lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive recently dropped out of all friendships. We have open discussion on conspiracies but it doesnt get passed banter or &quot;high&quot; coversations. The problem is they will slowly influence you with thier bullshit desires to drive lambos and wear gucci. Maybe Im going crazy but I cant tolerate the bullshit anymore. It gets lonely but get yourself a dog and you will be fine. Also financial stability is more important than socializing if you want to keep your mind free so I just focus on achieving that first. 
There is a taoist saying that a secured nation begins with the individual to the family to the cities and to the entire state. Become that beacon of hope and freewill, dont give in to those who wish to sway you from the righteous path. I cant enjoy movies and clubbing or any of that shit knowing 80% of the human population is living worst than a bum on the street. </p>
