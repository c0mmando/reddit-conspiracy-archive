       I'm glad to see there's some free thinkers on this sub but I've found it hard to find them out in the real world. We can talk forever on here but real change comes from us banding together...I think anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a gen x life is pretty tough. It's like no one is awake and your just expected to drown in debt.

       I find that just about everyone has at least one "classic" conspiracy theory that they believe in... Just look at the organic food movement... that's technically just a huge empire built on a conspiracy theory.

       Conspiracies are being created all the time. Evil people meet behind closed doors and plan illegal activities. If that isn't the case, why are the prisons so full?

       I think conspiracy researchers are some of the most honest people on Earth. I'd like to think they are also the most decent human beings you'll find.

       I'll say reality is all fake, their consciousness decides how much "all of reality" is.

       Here's how you wake them up. I hit everyone with random facts and have been massively successful. It's all based on what they say. Whatever they say think down their thought paths and show them. My opinion on the world is that everything is bullshit and that the second the people get the real power we will fix everything. I tell everyone that straight up and no one thinks I am straight up retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just tell them to look at the world. We owe bankers 200 trillion in debt because they control the money and charge us interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in war in the middle east because they were fighting against the central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start telling people the world is stupid they'll do it themselves and they'll talk themselves, just treat it as a joke. The world is truly a joke because the earth is actually flat. Tell people problems cause right in our face everyone ignores. It's a thought path but I am serious when I say if you know how to talk you'll be able to talk to women really good. Guys are cool but I'd say only 1/3rd or less are truly worth being friends with currently but thats just me. Talk with all.

       Maybe I'n way different and I have yet to realize it yet, i feel like that might be the case lol.

       Why does it poison the well? If you're referring to "normal" folk thinking conspiracy theorists would be crazy if they occasionally question the shape of the earth (biggest conspiracy of all time, if true), don't worry yourself too much. They think we're crazy anyway, until they come around on their time.

       I ran into a 70 year old guy getting breakfast one day. He was paying ahead of me and made a comment about the Federal Reserve as he was giving the cashier cash. I said something and was amazed how redpilled he was. We talked for another half hour.

       A good ice breaker is talking about the economy and interest rates and how there is nothing federal in the federal reserve... I always get a head tilt, then see the wheels turn. Or name drop Mr Burns and his uncanny resemblance to a Rothschild.

       If you're in the US, go travel abroad. I met so many awake people recently overseas. The propaganda here is really extreme, so most people can't break through the conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I agree with other posters-- you just gotta drop a couple of small things to test the waters. I also have a really broad base of knowledge and can talk on almost any subject, so people are willing to listen to me. And I smile a lot - it helps warm them up.

       Ive recently dropped out of all friendships. We have open discussion on conspiracies but it doesnt get passed banter or "high" coversations. The problem is they will slowly influence you with thier bullshit desires to drive lambos and wear gucci. Maybe Im going crazy but I cant tolerate the bullshit anymore. It gets lonely but get yourself a dog and you will be fine. Also financial stability is more important than socializing if you want to keep your mind free so I just focus on achieving that first. 
There is a taoist saying that a secured nation begins with the individual to the family to the cities and to the entire state. Become that beacon of hope and freewill, dont give in to those who wish to sway you from the righteous path. I cant enjoy movies and clubbing or any of that shit knowing 80% of the human population is living worst than a bum on the street.

       You have to let people know you're awake. Most don't have the DGAF attitude needed to talk openly.

       Besides egotistic losers and people who feel threatened, the only people that attack others for their beliefs are paid shills. They want to scare you so that you won't talk about this stuff irl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand that the vast majority of people won't attack you for your beliefs like they do online. And the ones that do area generally the least intelligent.
