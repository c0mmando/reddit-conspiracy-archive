    <div class="md"><p>Just look at the damage caused by the wings of the aircraft on the WTC. There is nothing to correlate with the damage seen at the Pentagon. If the wing didn&#39;t cause damage because of reinforced concrete walls where is the debris on the outside of the building? </p>

<p>Many debunkers will claim the lack of plane parts is simply explained away due to the extreme speed and energy of impact, claiming it all vaporised instantly. If this is the case why when a similar aircraft hit a building in Iran nearly the entire vertical stabilizer was sheared off and landed in the street among numerous other identifiable aircraft parts? <a href="http://danamotor.ir/Tehran_C130_Plane_Crash_Mehrabad.jpg">Link to Iran crash images</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a c 130 not a commercial plane. It also had engine trouble and was trying to do an emergency landing, not a 500 mph dive into the building. That outside wall of the Pentagon was reinforced concrete with 2000 pound blast windows with more steel to support their weight. Wings aren&#39;t anything but a small skeleton with a thin sheet on top. They absolutely can be obliterated when hitting something that hard and stationary. They still did quit a bit of damage too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting you go back to the speed at which the collision occurred to support your narrative. Luckily we have a great example in the plane that hit the WTC. In 2013 a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/26/us/new-york-9-11-plane-part/">piece of landing gear</a> was found in NYC. Now please tell me how you can reconcile this huge piece of evidence with the fact the plane should have been obliterated at those speeds. Not to mention the fucking passport found lying in the street.</p>

<p>There are many parts of the wing made of solid titanium that were larger than that landing gear price, where were they?</p>
