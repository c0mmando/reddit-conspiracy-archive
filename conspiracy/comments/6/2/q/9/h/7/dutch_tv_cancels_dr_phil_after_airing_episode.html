        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“Dr. Phil” has been on television since 2002 and made Dr. Phillip McGraw one of the most prominent mental health professionals in the world.</p>

<p>Recently, however Dutch company RTL has decided to pull the plug on the Dr. Phil Show, and the timing of this action couldn’t be any more suspicious.</p>

<p>Only a week ago, Dr. Phil had aired a show where he interviewed a woman who claimed to have been trafficked around the world, to the most elaborate events and parties, as a sex slave for rich and powerful men.</p>

<p>Is the canceling of the Dr. Phil show in the Netherlands connected to the airing of this episode?</p>

<p>Consider – the Netherlands has been under the microscope in recent years for pedophile activity at the highest levels of society. In 2014, a Dutch pedophile society even wanted to challenge a Supreme Court ban on their society, saying that banning them is a violation of their freedom of speech.</p>

<p>As English-speaking Dutch media NL Times reports, political leaders, including a mayor and justice official of the Netherlands have recently been brought to court by alleged victims of child sex-trafficking, further illustrating that pedophilia is happening at high levels of Dutch society.</p>

<p>Did Dutch TV Cancel Dr. Phil Because of His Stance on Pedophilia?</p>

<p>According to a translated quote from Dutch media, RTL decided to cancel the Dr. Phil show because they made “different choices in programming.” The timing is what is most suspect about this decision, coming several years after Dr. Phil’s first show in 2002, and just one week after he aired a show, which if true, will be the first mainstream source to expose the international sex-trafficking scandal.</p>

<p>And re: the pedo association, I&#39;m not necessarily against that, seeing as you make it easier to find out who&#39;s who and try and keep things &quot;above ground&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many within elite circles that practice occult ritualistic black magic. We all do at some level. We participate in a society that makes us sick. One that was molded by tyrants, using greed, fear and dark spiritual forces to terrorize and enslave us. </p>

<p>The Lord of the Rings, Saturn, Satan, Kronos, El...are a few ,of the many names, of the occult elite&#39;s  main deity. This asshole &quot;God&quot; is known throughout history to demand child sacrifice. I believe the epidemic of human trafficking is highly associated with members of this Saturn worshipping death cult. </p>
