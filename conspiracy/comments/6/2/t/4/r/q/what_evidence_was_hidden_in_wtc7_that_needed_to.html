    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was all about that insurance $$$. The major conspiracy was war in the Middle East, but Larry Silverstein got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein">over 4 billion</a> from insurance after 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon after the September 11 attacks, in 2001, Silverstein declared his intent to rebuild, though he and his insurers became embroiled in a multi-year dispute over whether the attacks had constituted one event or two under the terms of the insurance policy, which provided for a maximum of $3.55 billion coverage per event. A settlement was reached in 2007, with insurers agreeing to pay out $4.55 billion, which was not as much as Silverstein had sought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t sure on this either, I looked it up for this post. Found this on his wiki</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1980, Silverstein won a bid from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to construct 7 World Trade Center, to the north of the World Trade Center site. Silverstein was interested in acquiring <em>the entire World Trade Center complex</em>, and put in a bid when the Port Authority put it up for lease in 2000. Silverstein won the bid when a deal between the initial winner and the Port Authority fell through, and he signed the lease on July 24, 2001.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also the one who said &quot;pull it&quot; in reference to WTC7 that day wasn&#39;t he? Or am I getting that mixed up</p>

The Los Angeles Times reported that &quot;substantial files were destroyed&quot; for 3000 to 4000 of the SEC&#39;s cases. The EEOC reported that documents for 45 active cases were destroyed. Before the attack, SEC investigations of corporate fraud by companies such as Enron and Worldcom were the subject of many news reports - reports that virtually vanished in the wake of the attack.</p>

<p>George Soros and a group of Bush appointees would begin to destabilize the ruble by fronting $240 billion in covert bonds called the Durham Trust.</p>

<p>The Bush faction of moles in the CIA (Vulcans) needed to destroy the evidence of the Fake $240 billion in &quot;loans&quot; backed by looted gold from dozens of nations which the US invaded since WW2 under the guise of the Cold War. The bonds were used to fund the covert war that brought down the USSR. The NSA allowed 9/11 to happen because if the true origin of those bonds were discovered, it could cause our economy to crash. This is also why the Housing Bubble was allowed to inflate for so long until collapsing in 2008. If your economy hyperinflates, $240 billion no longer seems like the biggest fortune in the world compared to losing $10 trillion dollars in worthless real estate.</p>

<p>The plan:
1) Theft of the Soviet treasury
2) Currency destabilization of the Ruble
3) Funding of the KGB Generals’ August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, and  4) Takeover of the key energy and defense industries in the Soviet Union</p>

<p>The Vulcan’s drive to bring and end to the Cold War was fueled by a covert war chest invisible to congressional oversight. This war chest would be known by several names: Black Eagle Trust, the Marcos gold, Yamashita’s Gold, the Golden Lily Treasure, the Durham Trust or Project Hammer.</p>

<p>The 1991 coup against Gorbachev was engineered by KGB General Vladimir Kruchkov who reported to General Victor Cherbrikov.  Both of these men were business partners with Robert Maxwell, a British financial mogul, a documented Israeli secret service agent, and a representative of U.S. intelligence interests. </p>

<p>Robert Maxwell&#39;s daughter was the Madame procured of girls for Jeffrey Epstein, which explains why Epstein is untouchable. The Vulcans are not protecting Epstein. They are protecting Ghislaine Maxwell to prevent any evidence about this from coming out.</p>

<p>This is truly the Mother of All Conspiracies. Now you can see why so many co-conspirators guilty of great crimes against humanity are never removed from the corridors of power. Now you can see what you&#39;re up against. You could have 100 new Snowdens, 12 Trump clones and anarchist mobs rioting in the city streets and you still wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against the Vulcans.</p>

<p>Enjoy your fishbowl of silly little Infowars variety shows of Crisis Anchors and daily soap operas of formulaic theatrics by a rotating roster of Managed Personas. Even if you knew The Horrible Truth, there is nothing you could do to stop it. My advice to you enthusiasts of Alternative Facts is to give up chasing this conspiracy like Storm Chasers driving into Tornadoes.</p>

<p>The Vulcans represent forces too big for you to comprehend and you&#39;ll only hurt yourself in the end. Probably with 2 gunshots to the back of the head in a Motel6 room with the door locked from the inside. Take up a nice hobby, play with your kids, and fuck your wife.</p>

<p>We own this town.</p>
