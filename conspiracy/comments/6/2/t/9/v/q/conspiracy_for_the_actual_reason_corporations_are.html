       I believe they are boycotting YouTube for the simple fact, they can't control the narrative of the population anymore. It is the classic strawman to blame everything on ”hate speech". When in reality there hope is to stop everyone advocating getting money out of politics. Weather it is left or right media they want it to stop, that is the root cause of all our problems. This is just a theory though. Any thoughts?

       Not only that but people are turning off their tvs.  A lot of us only pay for access to the internet.  So not only do they have more competition, the MSM doesn't even really have an outlet anymore.  They have clumsily tried to infiltrate the internet to spread their narrative, but it falls flat. The gig is up

       They're boycotting YouTube because the Wall Street Journal's dopey journalists made it seem like YouTube is harboring some kind of KKK/Nazi fanatic's wet dream. Advertisers like Coca Cola simply do not want to be associated with racism because it hurts their brand. The Wall Street Journal knows that the news and the mainstream media is dying, so they put out a hit piece to force Google into a hard place.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing is WSJ and it's ilk in death throws mode. They're about to do anything to try and discredit any site that isn't them/MSM like WaPo and NYT did with the term "fake news." They need you back and you don't want to go back- so they're going to try their hardest to force you to think that if you don't choose them, you're wrong. The first step in that plan was "fake news", the second step is yanking the advertising revenue. Google is controlled by the same alphabet agencies that run WaPo/NYT- the CIA, but the CIA doesn't have control over YouTubers, so they want control back in the form of making you go through MSM to get your news.

       I'm new to his channel so I haven't really made my mind up completely but when he does the wretch/cough thing I can't help but laugh. I also really like that he's calling out stupid prank channels that fake their content to push racial division.

        The WSJ is not exactly the one behind the YouTube Ad Crisis (They did contributed to it big time though), a guy named Eric Feinberg is the one who has been contacting the media and giving them examples about ads playing in extremist videos.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He did it for a reason... MONEY... see, this guy created a patent that is able to find ads playing in extremist videos, as soon as his work was patented, he developed a plan to put Google in a position where they'll be forced to license his patent (He claims that google won't be able to develop a way of finding ads playing in extremist videos without violating his patent, so they'll be forced to license it from him).

       That, and the kerfuffle that Netflix,Hulu, and all the others started when they created a grey area; "is it a television show if it never airs on television? Can we as a TV network use streaming numbers from other services to determine our networks ratings? What do we do with the Nielson system? Do we shoehorn into streaming and push back?". They're all terrified, and the news is probably affected just as much as most other cable programming. I know the news networks obviously get their money from ad revenue and what, private benefactors? So I'd imagine that's a big buff for the network as a whole, as that's less money out of pocket to produce the new show(s).

       That, and the kerfuffle that Netflix,Hulu, and all the others started when they created a grey area; "is it a television show if it never airs on television? Can we as a TV network use streaming numbers from other services to determine our networks ratings? What do we do with the Nielson system? Do we shoehorn into streaming and push back?". They're all terrified, and the news is probably affected just as much as most other cable programming. I know the news networks obviously get their money from ad revenue and what, private benefactors? So I'd imagine that's a big buff for the network as a whole, as that's less money out of pocket to produce the new show(s).

       It's obvious the concern is fake, for rather than asking YouTube to not show their ads on particular videos, they are asking that YouTube censor those videos altogether.

       This would make so much sense. Lots of advertisers would want their ads to run on Infowars or piewdiepie etc. They could easily make everyone happy, but instead choose to outright censor one side.

       Youtube is huge. Are you asking them to check every video or channel manually? Automatic checks are way more efficient, but always come with false positives.

       Good post and some thoughtful comments.
       <br/>
       I agree that the boycott of YouTube may be for reasons other than stated publicly.  Corporations losing control of the narrative and being outcompeted by Google in the new media space seems more likely.

       There are so many sources now proving in real time that our government does the bidding of corporate donations that they are taking direct action to the messangers the only way they can. Cutting the money. It would be nice if YouTube said "good riddence" and advocated free speech instead.

       Youtube needs to change its strategy.  There is an attack on Youtube because they are the media's biggest competition.  However, the media does not realize that they are losing subscribers hand over fist because they do not know how to maintain relationships well with their audience.  They end up alienating them over a faster agenda.  What has happened is that these shady outlets took advantage of it and said what they wanted to hear and eased them into their agenda.  Now they have them.  They cannot figure it out because they don't know how to build and maintain an audience like they had to in the 80s-00s.  They double dip too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube is the future of entertainment.  Ads are less relevant.  What youtube needs to do is use red to be able to have users be able to superlike a video where the video owner gets 50 cents for the user's like and the user of youtube red gets 20 likes a month for 10 dollars a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM has too many double dipping paid PR stunts and not enough content that builds and maintains a strong relationship.

       I can chip in and contribute as an insider what-not. I represent a brand that spends a considerable amount on online advertising - think multiple millions per month. YT is an important channel for us, because it allows us to get our content seen by millions of users every single month. While 99% of the people to convert (buy) initially, we can later on start running display ads (banners) to people that have viewed our stuff. Once they click through (click on the ads) we can reach those users again across different channels - Facebook, Twitter, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are an advertiser or even a user / channel owner on YT, the platform will very quickly penalise and kill your account if you will use a copyrighted song or if someone will intentionally report your content. The algorithms are quite sophisticated. When it comes to advertising on YT, platform is basic as fuck. I can exercise some control in terms of doing managed placements and displaying my videos on videos that I choose to run my ads on, but if I want to scale (move away from micro-managing) things get tricky and my TrueView and Discovery ads could be shown next to all kinds of crazy shit that I don't want to be affiliated with. Multiple this case by few hundreds and that's your boycott.

       This is about the broader censorship of creators talking about anything controversial​. They are censoring anything and everything political. If you follow any political channel you would see them freaking out about this. This is an attempt at a hostel takeover of all critical thinkers.

       1% of  clicks sounds like accidental clicks to me, no better than mobile ads on android games. Is advertising like throwing a plate of spaghetti on a wall and hoping something sticks? I have never watched a video on youtube and, after being interrupted by an annoying ad, thought "oh thanks for stopping my video, let me see what crap you're selling." Millions of people watch youtube videos, but  I'd wager they want to actually watch the video, not commercials. Then again, I'm not in advertising.

       Youtube is a Google property.  Google is not as nice as they want to appear, but they're also noticably less evil than most corporations.  They've got some x-risk innovations that they haven't shared with the world.  Some of them target the wannabe kings.
