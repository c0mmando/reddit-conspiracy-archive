       April fools!
      </p>
      <p>
       That was actually John Podesta Hillary Clinton's campaign head. In 2014 Podesta left a company called Joule Unlimited Technologies. When he left they gave him 75,000 shares and John Podesta, as confirmed here in this letter from
       <em>
        his own lawyer
       </em>
       , took measures to prevent having to report the shares to the Obama White House.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When John Podesta joined Joules board of directors he helped them secure a $35 million dollar investment from Rusnano, a Russian State venture capital and equity firm. Anatoly Chubais is the CEO and he is directly appointed by Medvedev. Podesta also worked side by side with two other Russian banking executives while working for Joule the now Kremlin funded company.

       <p>
        Vice Chairman
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Grigorian is an internationally experienced investment banker and investor. Most recently, he led the merger of the leading Russian independent investment bank, Troika Dialog, with Sberbank, the country’s largest financial institution, and the follow-on integration across all business lines. In addition, he had run a leading real estate private equity fund, as well as various proprietary cross-border projects and transactions. Mr. Grigorian began his investment banking career in the mid 1990s with Salomon Brothers, then continued at Goldman Sachs. He has worked in London, Frankfurt and Moscow.

       I truly believe that this letter from his lawyer is one of the biggest legal/political gaffes I've ever seen. His lawyer has issued an official letter clearly stating that John Podesta was fully in his legal right to move his shares with this Kremlin connected company so that he wouldn't have to report to the Obama White House that he had them. Read the letter, that's what his lawyer is arguing very strongly. I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
      </p>

       Happy April 1st

       Not pushing per se, but rather adapting the populace to the idea of warring with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moral relativism and the conflicting views can help to justify the war both in its beginnings and towards its conclusion (homophobia vs pro-homosexuality, anti-theism vs pro-Christianity, xenophobia vs multiculturalism, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Generation Z = conservatives is probably just propaganda, Trump was ordained to fall and once he does countless generations can be programmed to be anti-Trump and therefore in favor of diminishing civil liberties and collapsing societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-Trump will be akin to coming out publicly as being homophobic.

       People on the left don't want war with Russia. We don't want any war. Didn't want it in Iraq. Don't want it in Syria. Don't want it in South China Sea. Don't want it in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because we think Russia doesn't have America's best interests in mind, doesn't mean we want to go to eat with them. There's like a billion degrees between wanting to suck Putin's dick and wanting to go to war with Russia.

       Yeah, it's almost as if people here are still concerned with the contents and circumstances of the leaks and see the whole anti-Trump/Russian hacking narrative as just a means of putting as much distance between the Dems and the truth as possible.  You won't find a lot of (genuine) love for Trump at r/conspiracy, trust me. You will find lots of people who would rather deal with his actual wrong-doings than upvote propaganda designed to protect corrupt politicians whatever party they come from.

        This is usually what trump supporters resort to. Whatboutism that paradoxically insists the thing he's been accused of is fine, whilst also insisting that you need to focus on this other person that did(n't) do something sorta like what trump did because they're worse. The Russian connections are the most frequent, but they'll do it with trump's ignoring of Saudi Arabia on the terror list and Clinton's supposed ties to the Saudis. And they'll do it with his "kill the familise of terrorists" whilst also saying everyone want's us to go to war with Russia.

       Not a Trump supporter thank you very much, and whataboutism? I don't think so, I don't believe I've said anything about ignoring anything. Nothing should be ignored and my post here is bringing attention to the fact that Podesta has now admitted to working to deceive the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hadn't noticed there's a congressional investigation going on into possible collusion between Trump and Russia, something the leaders of the IC have said there's no evidence of. I'm confident that if there's anything legitimate to be found tying the Trump campaign to Russia that the House will find it. BUT I'm not seeing any investigation into the absolute treasonous actions and behaviour of Hillary Clinton and her campaign and I'm bringing awareness to that. Until both sides acknowledge their issues no one is going to take anyone seriously. As it stands right now there is no concrete evidence tying Russia to anything, whether it's "hacking" or collusion, but if concrete evidence shows up I'll be the first to stand for it. Hillary supporters or anti trump people need to admit that the Clinton campaign was an atrocity. Just read how she and her people talk about everyday Americans. They might as well be trash. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. From Haiti to Odebrecht, and Podesta's lobby network to taking Millions from the Saudis there's a sea of verifiable crimes and wrong doings on her part and no one on the other side will acknowledge that. Trump and Clinton are two sides of the same coin, one side of the coin just has the blood of thousands of not millions smeared on it.

       I don't care if Trump is sucking Putins fucking cock. It still has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the contents of Clintons emails and their implications. Wikileaks has done releases on Russia.  It has said that Russia is not the source.  A British diplomat has said he met the leaker and that they certainly weren't Russian.  But that's not enough for the likes of

       right, exactly, i think trump is so fucked up and corrupt and incompetent and compromised that I, a liberal raised basically fucking communist, have joined forces with dick cheney (whom i regard as a cyborg monster who's already robbed the country of billions, but left us alive after) and bush willingly and knowingly.

       thats not cause this side is evil, its cause the trump side is so evil even villians are like "nah fuck this shit i'm with my old enemies"

        We generally misunderstand the role of money in politics, which is rarely about direct bribery. Instead, it's about building a relationship, to Trump's point, ensuring that when you call, the politician picks up.
The Bondi situation looks like something more than that

       this i find most interesting because while it does say "shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock." it never says she's getting prosecuted for it.

       to repeat, he's clearly broken the law, our corrupt AG has been forced to recuse himself from the investigation or would have already openly halted it most likely, Nunes has obstructed the house investigation as well as colluding with the whitehouse to obstruct same.

       one of which "forgets" money from russia.  yates informed the administration that flynn was compromised and was fired for it, then once things started hitting the press the came up with the bullshit line "he lied to pence" and fired him.  Weeks after being informed.

       No, you just plain dropped it. President Trump is as guilty as Will Smith, a fact that you are incapable of responding to because it exposes the idiocy of the allegation. Are you calling for the prosecution of the Fresh Prince? Still waiting for a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bondi story is another example of fake news. From Politifact, another outlet I thought you'd be aware of:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Associated Press reported in a Sept. 6, 2016, article that Bondi had "personally solicited" Trump’s contribution several weeks before her office was made aware of the lawsuit. This account means Bondi wouldn’t have known about the Trump investigation. Steven Cheung cited a New York Times article that said the investigation was never brought directly to Bondi’s office but instead was considered by lower-level staff members, who opted not to pursue the case. Bondi spokesman Gerald Whitney Ray reiterated this point to the Tampa Bay Times and PolitiFact, saying Bondi was not personally aware of the Trump lawsuit when the donation was made to the reelection campaign.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why do you propagate lies? Your receptiveness to conspiracy theories has me deeply concerned about your mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the other baseless mud-slinging:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The Sessions non-event is a topic I've won many arguments over, I'm curious if you'll be the first person to provide a substantive response (not likely). I watched the hearing and it seems pretty clear that Al Franken's question (which was very poorly phrased, he could barely articulate it) was centered around Trump surrogates talking to Russia about the election. Since both meetings with Kislyak were under Sessions' capacity as a senator not a surrogate, I just don't buy that he lied. At least one of the meetings was set up by the Obama administration, and in neither of them were the two alone together. How should he have answered? And regardless of the semantics, what is the endgame? Is there any evidence that Russia had an influence on our election? If not, what exactly would an investigation entail?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I have two big problems with the Nunes accusations that far outweigh your vague allegations of "obstruction." The first, which is a crime on-face, are the actual felonies being committed when confidential information about the Trump administration gets leaked. This is far more substantial than any of the McCarthyist accusations bleated daily by fools such as yourself and the leftist/never-Trump establishment. Most of these leaks have been either false or mischaracterized to the point of being useless. Did Trump actually get in a row with the Australian PM? Do we need to hear about how Spicer asked to confiscate his staff’s phones? Did he really hand Angela Merkel a bill for NATO expenses? The answer is no in each instance. Have any of the leaks actually led to substantial claims of wrongdoing? It seems more like sedition to me. My second concern is that the FBI is actually doing the obstruction in this case. They are ignoring requests by the Gang of 8 for essential information, and even refusing to attend meetings regarding the investigation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We don’t actually know yet officially what happened to General Flynn," Nunes said of how communications from Gen. Flynn's calls were leaked to the press. "We just know that his name leaked out but we don't know how it was picked up yet. That was one of the things that we asked for in the March 15th letter, was for the NSA, CIA, and FBI to get us all the unmasking that was done. And I'll tell you, NSA is being cooperative," Nunes continued, "but so far the FBI has not told us whether or not they’re going to respond to our March 15th letter, which is now a couple of weeks old.” Contrary to earlier media reports, Nunes clarified that the surveillance was not related to the FBI's investigation into possible collusion with Russia. This surveillance, he emphasized to reporters, does not "have anything to do with Russia."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do you respond to these two concerns? It should be obvious to anyone capable of critical thought and analysis that
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       crimes are far more serious than
       <em>
        speculative
       </em>
       crimes. And while you're at it, please describe in detail how Mr. Nunes' actions are "obstruction" and what law he is in defiance of. Good luck 😉
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence for HRC's pay-to-play scheme regarding the Uranium One deal is laid out in detail in the NYT article, which I'd refer you back to. Are you asserting that the NYT publishes fake news? In case you don't feel up to the task of reading / honest analysis, which honestly wouldn't surprise me, I'll highlight a few choice sections.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.
       </p>
       <p>
        The New York Times’s examination of the Uranium One deal is based on dozens of interviews, as well as a review of public records and securities filings in Canada, Russia and the United States. The episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation’s donors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The remainder of the article substantiates every step of this process in painstaking detail. Perhaps you just don't understand a matter of this complexity, and resort to insults when you're up against the wall?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Michael Flynn goes, no wrongdoing has yet been proven. I get that you are very excited about finally having the prospect of Real Evidence of Russian ties to President Trump's administration, since nothing of value has yet been produced. But let's save the speculative flights of fancy for a time when more is known. How exactly would you prove that Flynn's lies to Pence are false? Again, your willingness to engage in baseless conspiracy theory concerns me. I'd like for you to outline what laws or statutes have been violated in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways Antivote, I eagerly await your reply 😄 Good luck, you'll need it. If you want to get a petition going for the arrest of Will Smith, I may consider signing it if the evidence is there. But until then, Trump will continue to make great real estate deals...he's inhabited your psyche for free 😘

       Second, why would a billionaire launder money for someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, the onus of money laundering is on finding a scalable plan, not a one off deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, the WIRE TRANSFER is the money laundering part, not the selling of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever bank brought his money into the United States did the actual money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it's only money laundering if Russia says it's stolen money. The billionaires own their money, unless russia says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in Russia usually wash their money our of their company, effectively sucking money out of it illegally. This is to evade russian taxes. Literally, Russia can stop it's corrupt oligarchs at any time, past, present, or future.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is clear from your text is that you have buried yourself in a world of conspiracy theory and anti trump media. It's not surprising, every channel has the same narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump people like me have our own conspiracies. The best and most accurate one thus far is the blog of Scott Adam's, the original writer of the comic Dilbert.
      </p>
      <p>
       His most recent important post detailed the genius of letting Ryan Paul's healthcare reform fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because now the narrative will change from "OMFG TRUMP IS LITERALLY A CORRUPT RUSSIAN PUPPET WHO IS LITERALLY HITLER" to "meh, Trump is ineffective and stupid and dumb" and that is much healthier for the life of every American citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Families are tearing themselves apart. Friends are fighting each other because of politics. I'd hate to put the blame on one side, but the irrational fear leftist have of Trump made them see the worst in everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, that guy who lost his job, or the mom who lost a daughter to a drunk driving immigrant, they weren't just trump supporters... no... they were all racist, Islamophobic, homophobic, xenophobic, evil, white patriarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your failure to understand and have an open mind to Trump and his supporters is the reason you lost and the reason you will lose again, but even harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't any of these things. The states that put trump in the office also voted Obama into office, 2 times in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people also voted to further deregulate marijuana, and the love gay marriage. In fact, Trump is our first president who publicly supported gay marriage BEFORE entering office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your casual dismissal of all of our collective individual problems pushed all of us onto the Trump Train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people just care about bringing jobs back, some people hate that their insurance doubled in price, some people think we aren't letting the right people into our open society.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of those people is the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. She wrote a famous letter that is literally hidden from your view. They don't want you to know of its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this letter, she openly writes about the economic problems facing the African American community are exacerbated from cheap foreign immigrants. They tend to do the same jobs, prevent wages from needing to rise, and absorb social services.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, the republicans were the ones who WANTED cheap Mexican labor and NO WALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone 30 and older remembers this. Obama switched the domestic policy and continues what "the racist republicans" wanted to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You young energized people just don't know this because they don't want you to know it. Look it up. Google Emilio Gonzales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton kicked him out of the country because democrats were the ones fighting to protect the poor minority communities from cheap labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you stop watching so much TV and expose yourself to the donald and in 4chans famous/pol/.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a battleground of ideas, good and bad. Anonymous people fighting each other over who has the best ideas, and after each war, the bad ideas are burned to ashes leaving a solid diamond behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this phenomenon exists on all forums without censorship. They all gradually become extremely central politically and protectionist policy wise. These are literally the policies of trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be said that liberal forums can only exist in a place with censorship. This is why Spez changed the algorithm to keep the Donald from getting to the front page and changing the subscriber number(or lying to advertisers which would be much funnier).
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone was forced to see one random pro trump information each day, it would shatter the narrative they are trying to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know? It's a science. Here is your experiment: next time a new scandal starts, usually on a weekly basis, check The Donald and see their take on it... then, see what ends up happening. The main stream media is lying. There really is no other word for it. But hey, it's not the first time. They sent us into Iraq. Where are they trying to send us next? Russia?

       they try to expose the public to trump accomplishments everyday, but are incapable of doing so without lying and inventing accomplishments to fill in for all the time and taxpayer money he's wasting and giving directly to himself, mostly due to a lack of material to promote him with.  The man is stunningly incompetent, and what few "accomplishments" he has are either naked giveaways to big business or naked pandering to racists and muslim haters, and even that shit isn't making it through the most cursory court challenges.

       yeah but not with any kind of convincing argument, so the owner of this company fucked with t_d, good.  I expect it was cause that forum is such a swamp, carefully maintained through rigorous suppression of free speech, that it was starting to make reddit look bad.  In other words t_d, much like coontown or the /jailbait before it, are an embarrassment to all around them, so much so that the owner of reddit steps in to edit you people's shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       really convincing argument there for liberalism needing censorship to survive.  Really counters the examples of t_d or /conservative who ban anyone who doesn't tow the line, as opposed to /politics or whoever the rightish snowflakes are whining about disturbing their safe spaces today, who engage even disparate viewpoints in fair debate.

       You see, a bunch of "Uncle Tom's" as you racists call any black person that is friendly and rational to other white people, LITERALLY VOTED DONALD TRUMP as one of THE FEW WHITE PEOPLE EVER to earn, let alone be nominated, for that award.

       You and your establishment friends have done a Manhattan Style disinformation campaign using every media channel and outlet to portray him as a racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic, xenophobic monster who is literally Hitler.

      <p>
       So, let's get away from all that, and let's get to the most important issue of our time: immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       MLKs daughter wrote about immigration. Fuck, even the Democratic party was pro-wall and pro-am pro-immigration reform. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       BECAUSE IT WAS RACIST REPUBLICANS WHO WANTED NO WALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       RACIST REPUBLICANS WANTED TO FLOOD THE COUNTRY WITH CHEAP MANUAL LABOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the establishment still does.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people hurt the job prospects and prevent wages from rising for the people they compete against. Who did they compete against? The uneducated and the minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are literally fucking them by adding in more competition for their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to import people? Import teachers and doctors. It will reduce the cost of education and healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, don't expect your doctor friends to survive. They will literally kill themselves, like statistics show on levels of that of minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The imported people don't have huge student loans to pay off. They aren't used to living in big fancy houses. They are willing to work ANY job for much less, and they are easily able to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open border policies are the policies of racists. Designed by racists and for racists.

       This is actually fake.  Read the letter and you can see that he was not required to disclose the asset.  He then burns the site for not actually reaching for a comment.  Trump's collusion with Russia was not disclosed.    Podesta may have creepy and weird tastes but he is not under any federal law breakings.  He disclosed all that he needed to.  This is a deflection from Trump's dealings in Russia.

       I did read the letter.  He had a legal right to do so and properly disclosed it with the Jouele Global Holdings.  The fact to is that the site did not even try to reach out to John Podesta for a comment on it.  To me, that means that the site is not a news site but a commentary site.  They did not even attempt to reach out for a comment on the allegations.

       At the time he left the company on the board of directors they gave him 75k shares as in severance pay for being on the board.  This would have been public knowledge when he was selected to join the Obama Administration.  He immediately sold the shares of the company.  When he was required to file form 278, he did not own any shares.  Then, according to the cease and desist letter he still placed the 75k shares on it in the options field.

       Well here is his actual form. And it says that he was a board member with Joule but specifically states that he has no current holdings and doesn't mention the 75,000 shares anywhere.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line here is that John Podesta did not tell the White House about the shares. John Podesta helped Joule secure $35 million dollars in backing from the Kremlin. After that two big Russian state executives joined the board with John. He received 75,000 shares in that company when he left to work for the White House and he absolutely profited from those shares. If this were a trump person we were talking about this would be enough to hang him in the high streets by the media.

       The shares were from the company that he left the board. You do not have a lot of experience with board of directors and C level corporate levels. This would be a standard package that would occur and would not really impact anything that he did. Directors tend to get awarded shares fairly regularly.Hence, why Obama and any other democrats are not fuming and have not taken it. Only sites that want to stir the pot and use emotional manipulation without actual context. This is not an issue.

       No Trump's collusion with Russia is not the real estate. It is a lot more than that. CNN only has table scraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's connection matters when it is going against the American people while clearly trying to state that he is for the people when he isn't.

       The details of Trump's collusion is a lot more than what you think. Obama already knew how connected Trump is to Russia when he had his security briefing as he told him not to discuss this with Russia.

       Care to enlighten me on the details? I don't think you realize the real scope of the situation and would be quite shaken if you opened your eyes. Don't hold your breath for anything legitimate, the dominoes are already falling that will up end the situation completely. There's time still so you'll be able to milk more out of the idea that Russia now runs America and pulled off an election heist but just be aware that the day when everyone will have to answer is approaching

       Russia does not run America. They did pull off one of the greatest election manipulations in existence. They used misleading articles about Clinton and hired people to fulfill their agenda. They targeted key demographics that were undecided. Also, you are trying to use hypnotic terms on this with little substance. The terms open your eyes, don't hold your breath, etc are user in hypnosis to create a trance like state.

       Most likely you have an agenda with this. The details will be out soon about the Russia/Trump collusion. By the end, congress will end up with more power.

       Except you have zero hard proof of this.  Russia did not put people in the voting booth and have them vote Trump.  It's a vast overestimation of Russia's capabilities and predicated on wilful ignorance about our own CIA's capabilities (Vault 7?  Any of those implications sink in yet?) and it's storied history of meddling in political processes.

       Please show me these misleading articles about Clinton. You do realize that her campaign was unaffected by "fake news" stories right? It's is demonstrably untrue to say Clinton lost the election due to anything except her own mistakes. Please lay out for me the lies spread about her, please show me this. Hint you can't because it was her own fault.

       You're so full of shit it's insane. Keep talking nonsense about "hypnosis" all you want while you stand there empty handed with no evidence to support your argument whatsoever.

       This was posted to T_D during the election and was passed around in swing states to imply that Clinton was racist.  He was a Senator and this was a Senate connection without any evidence other than awkward photos.

       This is a post during the election:

        https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4g97oi/the_clinton_campaign_is_paying_1000000_to_have/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This was also another one which is a bit more valid:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdDcw9VMMic&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdDcw9VMMic&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted there are actually better valid points on both sides.  But to imply someone is racist by association is the same type of stuff with Russians and Trump.  BLM has had paid people from out of state.  Democrats tried to use race on a macro scale.  Republicans tried to use race on a micro scale where they needed the vote.

       Flynn wanting immunity is probably the most damning thing about the Trump/Russia connection.  No one would request immunity if there was not something illegal.

       Also notice how they mention 'Trumps dealings in Russia'.  As if it's fucking strange that a multi-millionaire property tycoon has business interests there.  So what if he does or did have?  That is still a completely separate issue from the DNC leaks and says nothing whatsoever about Russians 'hacking' an election.

       could be. but weve seen clear evidence that during the campaign they wanted trump to win. They did not think he would win, nobody did. They just wanted to to weaken hillarys win (claims of election rigging by trump before election day, releasing emails that made her and democrats look bad) so that there would be big controversy and angry right wingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When trump won they celebrated, then looked around and said now what?

       Why did Podesta leave Schedule B blank? Because that’s what the instructions said to do. “Schedule B” is “not applicable” for “new entrants,” like Podesta was at the time he was filling out this financial disclosure form.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition.
Podesta exercised his stock options, purchased these shares at a discounted price and then transferred the lion’s share to a shell company, essentially gifting these shares of stock to his daughter, and sheltering from scrutiny the fact that he’d owned and transferred this asset.

       If you can tie any of this to the Chaika scandal, you've got a slam dunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice in the Global Intelligence Leaks, Chaika is indicating Sergei Ivanov may be a shot caller, but most roads are leading straight back to Medvedev.

       Wow you just ignored the entire core of this post. Sure he wasn't legally required to disclose the shares
       <em>
        because he took measures to make sure he could deceive the White House

       Again cognitive dissonance is real here. Read the letter. He's asserting he had legal right to hide the shares from the White House

       Yeah, it's almost as if people here are still concerned with the contents and circumstances of the leaks and see the whole anti-Trump/Russian hacking narrative as just a means of putting as much distance between the Dems and the truth as possible.  You won't find a lot of (genuine) love for Trump at r/conspiracy, trust me. You will find lots of people who would rather deal with his actual wrong-doings than upvote propaganda designed to protect corrupt politicians whatever party they come from.

       Second, why would a billionaire launder money for someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, the onus of money laundering is on finding a scalable plan, not a one off deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, the WIRE TRANSFER is the money laundering part, not the selling of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever bank brought his money into the United States did the actual money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it's only money laundering if Russia says it's stolen money. The billionaires own their money, unless russia says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in Russia usually wash their money our of their company, effectively sucking money out of it illegally. This is to evade russian taxes. Literally, Russia can stop it's corrupt oligarchs at any time, past, present, or future.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is clear from your text is that you have buried yourself in a world of conspiracy theory and anti trump media. It's not surprising, every channel has the same narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump people like me have our own conspiracies. The best and most accurate one thus far is the blog of Scott Adam's, the original writer of the comic Dilbert.
      </p>
      <p>
       His most recent important post detailed the genius of letting Ryan Paul's healthcare reform fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because now the narrative will change from "OMFG TRUMP IS LITERALLY A CORRUPT RUSSIAN PUPPET WHO IS LITERALLY HITLER" to "meh, Trump is ineffective and stupid and dumb" and that is much healthier for the life of every American citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Families are tearing themselves apart. Friends are fighting each other because of politics. I'd hate to put the blame on one side, but the irrational fear leftist have of Trump made them see the worst in everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, that guy who lost his job, or the mom who lost a daughter to a drunk driving immigrant, they weren't just trump supporters... no... they were all racist, Islamophobic, homophobic, xenophobic, evil, white patriarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your failure to understand and have an open mind to Trump and his supporters is the reason you lost and the reason you will lose again, but even harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't any of these things. The states that put trump in the office also voted Obama into office, 2 times in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people also voted to further deregulate marijuana, and the love gay marriage. In fact, Trump is our first president who publicly supported gay marriage BEFORE entering office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your casual dismissal of all of our collective individual problems pushed all of us onto the Trump Train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people just care about bringing jobs back, some people hate that their insurance doubled in price, some people think we aren't letting the right people into our open society.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of those people is the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. She wrote a famous letter that is literally hidden from your view. They don't want you to know of its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this letter, she openly writes about the economic problems facing the African American community are exacerbated from cheap foreign immigrants. They tend to do the same jobs, prevent wages from needing to rise, and absorb social services.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, the republicans were the ones who WANTED cheap Mexican labor and NO WALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone 30 and older remembers this. Obama switched the domestic policy and continues what "the racist republicans" wanted to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You young energized people just don't know this because they don't want you to know it. Look it up. Google Emilio Gonzales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton kicked him out of the country because democrats were the ones fighting to protect the poor minority communities from cheap labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you stop watching so much TV and expose yourself to the donald and in 4chans famous/pol/.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a battleground of ideas, good and bad. Anonymous people fighting each other over who has the best ideas, and after each war, the bad ideas are burned to ashes leaving a solid diamond behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this phenomenon exists on all forums without censorship. They all gradually become extremely central politically and protectionist policy wise. These are literally the policies of trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be said that liberal forums can only exist in a place with censorship. This is why Spez changed the algorithm to keep the Donald from getting to the front page and changing the subscriber number(or lying to advertisers which would be much funnier).
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone was forced to see one random pro trump information each day, it would shatter the narrative they are trying to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know? It's a science. Here is your experiment: next time a new scandal starts, usually on a weekly basis, check The Donald and see their take on it... then, see what ends up happening. The main stream media is lying. There really is no other word for it. But hey, it's not the first time. They sent us into Iraq. Where are they trying to send us next? Russia?
