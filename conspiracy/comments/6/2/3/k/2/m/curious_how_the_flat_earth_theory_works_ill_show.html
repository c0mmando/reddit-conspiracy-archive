        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will not respond to ignorant comments at all. 
I will not say I believe this is actually how the earth is or not. You make up your own mind. 
I wont post up everything in this description, just the basics. If you really want to know more you can find it. </p>

<p>There are a few different scenarios.  I will be demonstrating the most plausible way I have found. (I will speak of this as being from North America viewpoint) </p>

<p>Ok here we go: </p>

<p>Look at this image: </p>

<p><a href="https://planetruthblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fe-model-antarctic-earth.jpg">https://planetruthblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fe-model-antarctic-earth.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is the flat earth model. </p>

<p>1 The outer white part is what globe earth calls Antartica.  It is not a continent, it goes around the flat earth and (as far as know) extends all directions indefinitely.  </p>

<p>2 North is still North.  South is still South.</p>

<p>3 If you look closely you can see the sun and the moon. The sun and the moon rotate the earth clockwise completely around the circle of earth (which would be 24 hours) . The moon rotates a bit slower than the sun (this is why we have moon during day at times) </p>

<p>This is not to scale, only so you can get an idea of how it looks: </p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LWIGKnsnXY/hqdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LWIGKnsnXY/hqdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>The sun moves northward (outwards)  then around in the summer. The sun moves south (outwards) and around during the winter. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R52_PdZlSq8/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R52_PdZlSq8/maxresdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>4 The sun and moon do not rise and set. They come toward you (appears to rise), goes over you, then goes out of site (appears to set).  Vanishing point. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDHB6aXQJMI/hqdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDHB6aXQJMI/hqdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>5 The flat earth has a solid actual firmament (dome) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.testingtheglobe.com/images/hebrew_conception_of_the_universe2.jpg">http://www.testingtheglobe.com/images/hebrew_conception_of_the_universe2.jpg</a></p>

<p>(That isn&#39;t the best picture but all I can find in a pinch.) </p>

<p>Ok I found this also:  </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TTpH8bG.png">http://i.imgur.com/TTpH8bG.png</a></p>

<p>I believe the stars are on the outside of the firmament (as well as water) as opposed to what is shown in the other.  However the dome doesn&#39;t go under the earth like in this picture. </p>

<p>Well this the gist of it. Theres more to it but I&#39;m only trying to give an idea of what this theory looks like. </p>

<p>Again in not trying to tell anyone what to believe. Make up your own mind. Also again in not saying I believe this or not that is my choice. 
Lastly:  EVERYTHING HERE MAY NOT BE 100% PERFECTLY ACURATE.  Just done this to spread some info. Use it however you will. </p>

<p>If you want to know more I have three youtube users that I think are the best: </p>

<p>Search &quot;Eric Dubay&quot; and/or &quot;Jeranism&quot; and/or &quot;Stinkycash&quot;</p>

<p>Disclaimer:  I don&#39;t know everything there is to know about this theory, so I won&#39;t have all the answers. </p>

I know you didn&#39;t say definitive proof and I saw all the distance you put between yourself and your proposed theory. I&#39;m just going to bow out here and let you sit in your puddle of smugness (if only there were a place you could be smug all day with others that share the same conviction to the theory, like a subreddit or something).

    <div class="md"><p>No. That is a fact. That is how propaganda works. Moreover, the belief that opinions should be respected is nonsense. I respect that you have an opinion, but it&#39;s not an accurate opinion. Disinformation like Flat Earth helps discredit this community, it discredits this movement, it is just one more absurdity that people can think of when they&#39;re faced with true conspiracies and shrug them off as just as absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it is. I notice the guy did not do the zoom <em>after</em> sunset.</p>

<p>But more to the point, less than an hour before these images, the sun was much higher in the sky... what caused it to get lower in the first place? You say &quot;perspective&quot;, but the sun doesn&#39;t appear smaller the lower it gets, that video says it appears larger, if anything.</p>

<p>So if the image appears larger, why is it getting lower? If it is receding into the distance, why does it appear larger at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If the sun and moon aren&#39;t setting but disappearing into a vanishing point, it would get smaller and smaller until it vanished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A deeper analysis shows this assumption to be incorrect.</p>

<p>As size of the sun is around 32 miles in diameter (in flat earth model), it would take around 300 thousands of kilometers to shrink into a dot. So half of this path would shrink sun into 50% of size (150 housands km). So 30 thousands kilometers is 10% of diminution. So 3 thousands kilometers is only 1% of diminution.
As you can use simple Pythagorean theorem in flat earth model, you can easily calculate, that from noon to sunset sun is doing only few thousands of kilometers before it sets below horizon.
From OBSERVER&#39;S VIEW sun traveled from 5 thousands km away (starting distance) at noon (from observer) to 11 thousands km from observer at sunset. So difference is 6 thousands km.
In 6 thousands km the sun will not change it&#39;s size noticeably. As vanishing point for the sun is supposed to be 300 thousands km away from observer (then sun is supposed to become a dot for observer), 50% drop of size is to be when sun travels 150 thousands km. Cant you see that simple dependency?
In 6 thousands km sun should drop only max 2% of angular size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main reason why there isn&#39;t much transit across Antarctica is twofold: 1) its remoteness from major population centers, and 2) the prevailing winds blowing from West to East (observable in the general movement of clouds and weather) make that direction of travel more efficient. Notice that anytime you fly Westward, the trip is longer than going Eastward. Good explanations from pilots on this topic can be found <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-any-airline-flights-fly-over-Antarctica">here</a>.</p>

<p>Antarctica is own little type of conspiracy. It was heavily protected by the UN before environmentalism was politically popular. It&#39;s remoteness and limitation of access to people connected to major institutions add lots of fuel to that fire. I am open to the possibility of some major agenda being associated with the place, but there is no end to the round globe (it is finite, but infinite in any direction - circular reasoning for you...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose that it is the equinox.  On the flat earth model, that means the sun is directly over the circle of the equator.  Now, let’s calculate the sun’s altitude.  At 45 degrees latitude, at exactly noon, we measure the angle to the sun.  If you have an accurate measurement, it will be 45 degrees.  If we draw a line from where we are standing, to the equator, then to the sun and back to us, we’ll have made a nice right triangle.  Since one angle is 45 degrees, we know the other is as well.  That means that the distance to the equator from where we are standing MUST be the same as the distance to the sun from the equator.  Incidentally, that’s a little over 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Now, let’s pretend, at the same time, we have another person in Antarctica, making the same measurement.  But they’re going to wait until their local midnight.  This means the sun will be on the opposite side of the equator, its maximum distance.  It’s about 6213 miles from the north pole to the equator, so we can triple that distance to get Antarctica to the opposite side of the equator, 18639 miles.  But, we now have another right triangle!  Let’s just plug in what we know in <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">this</a>   handy calculator and find out the angle to the sun.  Side b will be the 18639 (the observer to the far side of the equator), and side a will be 3000 (the height of the sun).  Angle A will represent the angle to the sun.  This is the LOWEST the sun will ever get for that point, since we waited until local midnight.</p>

<p>I got 9.14 degrees.  To give some context, the width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10 degrees.  That means the sun should be no less than a fist’s width above the horizon at all times for the equinox.  For basically every city in the world, it should be MUCH higher.</p>

<p>How is this explained in the flat earth model?</p>
