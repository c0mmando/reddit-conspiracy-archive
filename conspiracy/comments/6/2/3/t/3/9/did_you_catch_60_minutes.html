       The story getting most of the attention from 60 minutes is the Cernovich part of the story on fake news.  In the first story 60 minutes proved another believed conspiracy to be true.  The Dallas investigator seemed like he was awakening on camera.  There were many questions he wanted to ask the FBI, but he was unable to get any answers.  The story was about the 2014 shootings in Garland, TX.  Where two terrorist planned to kill a lot of people at a contest to draw the prophet Mohammed.   For context :
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/garland-texas-prophet-mohammed-contest-shooting/">
        http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/garland-texas-prophet-mohammed-contest-shooting/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       An FBI agent was in contact with these individuals months before the attacks, the agent was in Garland at the time of the attack, and the agent followed the two in a car to the site of the attack.  60 minutes did all but say the FBI helped plan the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I question why this was on 60 minutes so open and in public.  The media is now driving distrust between the public and law enforcement, which generally means the people in power want it to be this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this was interesting, it is the first story on the show.  Check it out for yourself.

       I believe there is at the very least a war within/between agencies like the FBI and the CIA. A hit piece on the FBI by 60 minutes is probably a CIA job. They are trying to do this without the public catching on because that would be bad for everyone.

       The only Yuri Bezmenov I know of, defected from the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War and died about 25 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that what he had to say about those Soviet agencies is true about any of the strictly Russian ones at this point in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian nationalism and all the more ordinary conventions of freedom of religion, private ownership, open markets and competition in business have all been completely restored in Russia on the same footing as exists throughout most of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short there no longer is the kind of unresolvable ideological conflict between diametrically opposed systems ruthlessly fighting against one another for turf and dominance in the world any more. China is slowly but surely moving in that same direction as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US, however, is determined to prevent Russia from rejoining and re-engaging the rest of Europe on an equal footing as any of the other nations in it because it would strengthen the continental community enough to stand up against being dominated and controlled by the US and Wall St. in particular against it's own best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the massive bank fraud and financial crisis engineered by Wall St. and  that went completely unpunished by the US government caused all the nations in Europe to lose over half of their value on paper literally overnight and plunged them into the financial mess that has everyone wanting to bail out of the EU and abandon the euro for their own currencies and control over them due to the way the euro was hit by that fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rather pointed and potent demonstration of who their boss is. Forcing them to agree to placing sanctions on Russia has only rubbed their noses even more in the dirt and cost them billions more in lost trade on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of ordinary Europeans have no grudges against Russia and fully understand what it was protecting the people of Crimea from and also wants to protect the ordinary people of the Donbas and the eastern Ukraine from... namely fanatical nationalist extremists bent on destroying them because they're Russian speaking Ukrainians and with no regard for the fact that their livelihoods have always been dependent on cross border trading and commerce with Russia for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of the Crimea who are also mainly Russian speaking have a successful and well established economy that is dependent on two major things, the Russian naval base with 25,000 Russian personnel rotating through it and nearly two million tourists from the Russian Federation that vacation there every year. You cut those off and they'd have virtually no source of income or economy at all, yet that is precisely what the US installed government in Kiev wanted to do to them and still intends to do to them if they can ever regain control of the peninsula.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm slightly off topic here, but these facts are all important to know and understand as well as the kind of underhanded activities the US government has actually been involved with and what's behind the so-called Russian narrative that's being promoted by ex-officials, politicians with an axe to grind, and all the mainstream media.

       All the recent Comey/FBI hate coming from both mainstream and internet media lets me know that FBI really are the good guys in this soap opera... maybe it is just confirmation bias... but it feels good to see FBI hit pieces... cause it prolly means the FBI is a threat to the CIA/MSM disinfo campaigns. Out of all the USIC, FBI is prolly the only ones to have the data to backup their claims.

       Yeah... no one can get a bead on Comey... cause they are so used to politicians being all up in their politics... I think he's a straight shooter... and thats why he is so hard to figure out... no one is used to seeing someone nonpartisan all up in the middle of their party politics.

       See, I lean towards him being legit as well because of the simple fact he pisses off both sides. In a partisan driven world, that almost smells like objectivity. This probably won't be a popular view because

       I think you may have missed this one as well as the only possible conclusion that can conceivably explain Comey's actions and more importantly his inaction in the face of very clear evidence of numerous federal laws being consistently and deliberately broken and just as consistently lied about and denied by the guilty party.

       Comey is not a good guy. CIA operates in the media and is nearly 100% compromised. FBI is torn apart with moles and few trying to do admirable work. Comey is keeping the good work from being put out and suppressing info too protect criminals in government. There is a lot hanging around from the previous administration and people in government trying to scorch the ends. FBI needs a new FBI director so they can issue a special prosecutor to rid the government of these ass hats working for the elite.

       But why would the agent be so involved in the lives of these people, follow them to the event, and say nothing to anyone about the possibility of an Attack.  Given the context of the event you would have to assume the possibility of an attack even if you weren't following the terrorist directly to the event

       Not sure about his wife, but he certainly hasn't been loyal to his oath.  He could have nailed Hillary to the wall, and instead he covered for her.  Also, good cops don't cover up the Weiner laptop.

       He didn't cover for her... you are just being brainwashed by the chopped and screwed Comey remix the MSM circulated prior to the election...
       <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">
        Here's the full statement
       </a>
       . The specifics of her email server's configuration aren't important and there is ample evidence to get the case tossed out for lack of intent... he's got much more important things to nail her to the wall for... like espionage and he's gonna conduct that investigation out of the public eye... just like the Wiener investigation. FBI ain't gonna tip it's hand in such and important case... we won't hear any shit about it until charges are filed. FBI don't comment on an open case. He's not covering up shit... FBI Vault just re-tweeted his statement about what is assumed to be the Weiner case a week ago... just so people know that there is an open and "unrelated" e-mail case still in the works without touching on anything specific.

       Don't buy it.  Comey had evidence of intent, and even if he didn't believe that Hillary and her staff discussing using private servers to bypass government observation was intent he certainly had a case for gross negligence.  And yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary and Bill will never face charges, they're too rich and connected, and they likely have leverage on Comey.  If I'm wrong please remind me later, but I doubt that will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Weiner laptop is as bad as members of the NYPD implied then he should have been serving warrants ages ago.  Nothing will come of it because the FBI under Comey is a political organisation, not a law enforcement agency.  Nothing will come of it, but please remind me if it does.

       I've read enough of the FOIA state dept releases to know that HRC literally doesn't even know how to use a computer... literally. There are enough e-mails from other people outside of her CCs setting up all the server shit that it would be easy to argue that she had no fuckiung clue what was going on behind the scenes... and also enough evidence to show that the rest of the state dept. was up to some shiesty shenanigans and knew they had to hide certain emails from FOIA requests...

       But she lied under oath about the email server. She said those emails were on her server because she didn't know they were classified. Comey even said that what she did was illegal. Which is hilarious because you don't need intent at all for that charge. A lot of people can see what went on, like too many people, and it was probably the reason she didn't get elected. The only thing I'm waiting on is reading the juicy emails she had.

       Yeah the email server case is so small that it wasn't reasonable to even bother with that case... they will nail her to the wall for espionage... she didn't hide those emails too well... the FBI has 'em... the server was just the busted tail light on a car full of cocaine and dead hookers... it was just the foot in the door to get the ball rolling.

       I hope so. I can't personally see any reason not prosecuting would hurt an investigation. On the contrary, I feel like her being in prison with limited contact to give orders would help a lot with investigating. She's certainly free to destroy any evidence of anything by not being jailed right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do wish what you're saying is true. I'm just not sure of a reasonable time frame to give the fbi, and that makes me uncomfortable.

       The Benghazi Report took like 5 years to compile... and that is just one "little" incident... shit like this takes time... and it would have been dumb to try to charge her with anything with fuckin' Loretta Lynch running the DOJ... cockblocker in chief right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read like 1500+ pages of the FBI Vault files about the HRC server case... she ain't destroying shit... FBI has it allllllll on lockdown at Quantico... they even ended up getting shit
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       thought was deleted... but Platte River had a little "glitch" where they accidentally kept 60 days of emails no one at all knew were there until they stumbled upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If ya read thru the vault releases it becomes pretty evident that they have vast piles of data... I honestly think they may have had the NSA and her phone companies in on the surveillance... but that is pure speculation on my part... but I can "psychically" see thru some of the redactions from too much FBI reading room time.

       And 5 years later, she still wasn't held accountable. You can understand why some people are skeptical about her not getting charged right? Especially with everyone saying just wait just wait. I believe the trump admin will do their best, but I don't think that they get any control over Intel agencies.

       Well there are only really three schools of thought... she innocent, shes guilty and will get away with it, she's guilty and will be held accountable...
      </p>

       I ascribe to the 3rd school of thought... We're just gonna have to wait... but I don't blame anyone if they belive the first couple scenarios... 99.999% of the population doesn't have the time or attention span to decipher heavily redacted FBI documents and cross reference the redaction codes.

       Not really... it would be cool if someone out there had done a teardown of the entire Vault series... but from what I've seen only T_D really digs into those files with any fervor... and it is like 15 shitposts for every good piece of info.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Huma Abedin has been under investigation by the FBI since 2013 and the Counter Terrorism Unit took interest her actions lets me know that something big is cooking... but it is weird that they didn't redact that info from the 05 release... really the whole thing should be locked up till like 2040, but they had 3 officials sign off on a special "early declassification" exemption like 4 or 5 months ago... it was included in HRC 05 I think...

       She's gonna die pretty soon... so it is a possibility... maybe she will be found dead like Vince Foster... with a "suicide" to later magically materialize saying that Obama did no wrong and the media and FBI is full of liars and Dick Cheney is a great man and she's not cut out for a world where people can talk shit about her besties like that.

       Yeah he works for the FBI... and they have rules that must be followed to successfully prosecute thru the DOJ... he's not gonna fuck over entire years of investigations just to satisfy some internet nerds and a bunch of aged partisan hacks.

       That's with one thing and not close to what I was alluding to. FBI has done just as much to fuck up movements as the CIA. They are bought and paid for. I get it though, carry on.

       I dunno about that... the FBI's meddling seems to be focused squarely on the United States... CIA fucks up countries all over the globe... compared to the schoolyard bullies that are the CIA, the FBI comes across as the loving Big Brother that puts you in a headlock once in awhile.

       Yer gonna have to back off yer whole "The entire world is corrupt" schtick to really have any credibility... cause if everyone was totally fucking terrible why would any of them even need to pretend to be good anymore. It would just be full on 1984... but if the bad guys still have to pretend they are good then there must be some actually good good guys they are hiding from. Those good guys are the FBI... along with the vast majority of law enforcement and a good chunk of the NCOs.

       So why are the FBI always around when terror strikes? Why are they so closely connected to the Boston Bombing and other forms of terror? Because they're just as complicit.

       Zomg! Why are the police always there every time someone is caught for speeding!? Just wait and see... FBI 2.0 is pretty fuckin' badassed... stop focusing on the bad apples... I know it is easy and thats what you've been bred to believe... but my personal conspiracy is that the FBI is working on being the the real heros of modern history... but keep on swallowing that CIA propaganda while at the same time professing how much you hate the CIA... such a smarty-pants.

Badges are bad, m'kay?" and work yer way up to picking out the good guys amongst all the bad apples... I'm sure yer not ready yet... so in the meantime you can go off and do some podesta pedophile pizza parlour ping pong posting.
