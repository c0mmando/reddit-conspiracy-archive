       Hillary Clinton might still be free. Rothschild may still have his money sucking tumor, the Federal Reserve, attached to Americas forehead. James Alefantis may still be running a pedophelia operation openly in DC. John McCain may still be visiting Alefantis at that very pizza shop but the truth is that this setup continues enfuriate the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Day after day, the people watch the Cabal in disgust and the cabal continues to operate in lesser and lesser capacity but, they are still operating is the problem. I think Mussolini was hung upside down with fish hooks after he fucked Italy up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that enraging the people always ends badly. Every morning the people wake up, turn on the TV, and see the same cabal in power instead of in jail. The entire cabal cannot hide. They exist in the media, Hollywood, in our government buildings, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       All these black hat actors should be swarmed by pitchforks every time they pop their heads in public. We can do this now or wait until we are more pissed off before we do. Either way, it is inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were them, I would be planning an exit strategy because no amount of damage control can fix this mess.

       We need to do 3 things nonstop.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anytime we see anyone in public that is even loosely connected with the cabal, we swarm them with accusations of pedophelia, world enslavement, etc..  while another passerby records it all on a cell phone to later upload. Hopefully media cameras will catch it to. This is most similar to the "Bill Clinton is a rapist" strategy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nonstop redpill ads on the form of bumper stickers, graffiti, inked in cash money, and any other form possible. Short and sweet stuff like "Mossad did 9-11" so that the sleepers intellect gets stimulated enough to google it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every single person we meet has to be redpilled in a brief conversation of maybe 5-10 minutes max. Just drop it on them and leave it be. They will wonder about this later.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       By doing just these 3 things, we can shake the foundations of this country. We are forcing the media coverage by approaching cabal members on the streets nonstop with accusation while redpilling as many people as possible. Once the majority are redpilled, the momentum will swallow up the cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about having fun with it and being as creative as possible. It has to be a hobby that is practiced regularly. Also, I have realized that we cannot wait for others to act before we do ourselves. Ultimately, all that matters is that we, ourselves, do it and act as a good example to others.

       I feel like if I do all of these things I'm gonna get locked up in a loony bin in a real hurry... you got a pair of those magical They Live glasses for me so I can spot these cabal members on the street? Cause all I see around these parts are normal people... and Angus King... is he a member of the cabal? Or just a dude that likes paninis?

       Well, keep in mind that most of us rarely ever see the cabal but there are 300 million of us so we ALWAYS see the cabal at the same time. I'm talking about people like chuck Schumer, obama, Hillary, McCain, Alefantis, Rothschild, CNN, MSNBC, or anyone we know about being a connection. As long as enough people participate, we can swarm them every time they leave the house but first, we need to spread the fad like the Bill Clinton Is A Rapist fad spread well thanks to Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is to wear them out while waking up our fellow humans that further perpetuate this behavior resulting in a compounding effect which equates to a gradually intensifying pressure against the cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I urge people to focus on themselves. People will jump in on it naturally. You may never run into the cabal, but you have to always be prepared for it. The redpilling can be done by anyone at anytime. The more we do, the faster we get to our destination.

       Best case scenario is I get maced
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       being sent in for a psychiatric evaluation or prison time... but if I happen to see Obama out in the middle of bumfuck Maine I'll be sure to let him know that Bill Clinton is a rapist.

       They can't arrest you for free speech. If I saw Obama, I would yell this nice and loud for everyone to hear:
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama! We know who you are you globalist scumbag. You sent us through perpetual war for personal profit. The people know Obama. Your prescious legacy is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If obama hasn't ran away from me humiliating him live in public, I would simply continue the rant as creatively as possible knowing that people will see it. If another person beats me to the punch, I'll bust out the cell phone. Very simple and a fun hobby especially for people living in DC right next to the cabal. It's productive and once the fad spreads, it will be a popcorn fest.

       The true cabal will just drown the world, Deluge style way before it got to any of that, imo. People have no idea who they should be talking about when discussing the "Cabals". If you think the politicians and pieces of shit henchmen like Rothschild are the cabal... You're sadly mistaken, I'm afraid...

       Arrests must be made. And soon! And not just nameless illegal aliens. And in plain sight. And mandatory broadcasted on TV. So much people to de-program , so little time.

      <p>
       I reckon big negotiations are being made in the shade. Who to excuse and who to be sacrified. But it must be done.
