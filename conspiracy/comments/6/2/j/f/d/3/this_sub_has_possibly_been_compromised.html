       Again and again and again and again and again, the mods here ONLY tag posts about certain topics in this sub. It's incredible watching what has happened here. There are now mods spamming posts on the sub daily, while commenting on sticky threads ATTEMPTING TO DISCREDIT A CONSPIRACY. One mod makes a sticky trying to discredit the topic, even though the source is arguably the most unreliable source possible at the moment, and another mod acting condescending to users and attempting to discredit the topic as well. Suddenly comments are being deleted nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO, has this sub gone from conspiracy haven, to some censored not alt right but kinda alt right sub that tries to discredit its own users in an attempt to maintain a certain narrative. Was this sub not originally about NO CENSORSHIP, DOUBT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, ALL CONSPIRACIES WELCOME, QUESTIONING EVERYTHING. And now we're supposed to just ignore the mod's abuses and believe that is okay for them to push a narrative on the very sub meant to destroy narratives?? THIS HAS TO CHANGE, and it starts with every user in this sub who is really here for conspiracies, not about political motivations or trolling or being paid to infiltrate the sub (thanks shareblue and Russian employees), but bringing this sub back to how it's supposed to be, not how the mods are attempting to push us to be.

       You seem to only post in T_Dork and here... where have you seen "alt left" stuff (whatever this means)? And there's a difference between a political divide coming semi naturally, and mods of a sub that should have no bias towards anything about the very government they should always be wary about, yet we see the very opposite. That's not how a conspiracy sub is supposed to function

       ..... where did I attack the user? I questioned both parts of his comment, one that he used alt left, which I've only ever seen in a certain type of subs, and the second I questioned and brought my own argument. Where was their an attack? Also since when are post histories private? Is that not a part of transparency?

       Maybe a while ago before the best left. I'd say there's still 1 or 2 left (personally think u/assuredlyathrowaway is fantastic here) but to look at that disaster of a thread in the Flynn immunity talks, I'm disgusted and saddened that mods are now tagging, stickying unreliable as fuck comments to discredit only certain types of posts, and then other mods dissenting upon their users with bs comments that try to further discredit only one side of opinions, furthering a divide that they're supposed to stay away from or bring together. Sorry this doesn't bother you

       Best is subjective though. But I understand we have different experiences and I respect your opinion, just giving mine and don't wanna be laughed at like I'm over exaggerated when there seems to be legitimate concerns about the motives of some mods

       It is subjective, true, but the one's who left where not objective, imo. One left because of shit (not saying much more), others left because... Other reasons... The one's left are objective, imo. I push boundaries. If we want to see this place come back, I'm happy to agree with the current mod team. If you now anything about me, on here, you will understand why I say this. I say fuck all...

       Because instead of posting maybe both quotes, he uses the quote by none other than representative Nunes, while disregarding the more accurate senate information about a deal being made with Flynn. Why is one quote being stickied using an incredibly dishonest politician as the source? That's not a conspiracy thinker type of modding

       I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  I believe that flat/concave Earthers who support Trump and spread communist propaganda to actually be problematic for the sub.  It also isn't surprising that people who spread these beliefs are in cahoots with the mods.

       I don't necessarily see eye to eye with him, but he has quite the record over on alternative history as well. I just worry we are turning into a sub that collapses like a dying star.

       So many users, very few are regular posters. We have people getting into conspiracy from r/politics and The Donald and whatever else that are a bit more close minded. They're quick to call BS on anything that's said on here right out of the gate. I don't necessarily believe that we are infiltrated merely because, by society's standards, we are the outcasts. Society sees us as overly paranoid, crazy, conspiracy theorists. Who's to benefit from some sort of infiltration? Half the point of this thread is that we live in a society where the second a post gets anywhere close to the front page,  the average Joe sees the r/conspiracy label and downvotes it to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that we are monitored heavily to make sure we don't put out information that "they" don't want to get out, but not that there's some sort of special brigade of thousands of shit posters and downvoters. The real post conspiracy are the posts we don't see because the second it goes up the guy gets shadowbanned or the post is removed

       Absolutely, but I personally believe that it's actually coming from the top and not from the bottom.  Just look at how many threads are now littered with mods deleting posts due to the ridiculous amount of rules that now exist here, there is no room for discourse any more.

       Eh, I do see where you're coming from. I think, from a mods perspective, we walk such a fine line around here that they have to make sure this place doesn't turn into some sort of racist, personal attack shit show. That said, I have noticed quite an increase in post removal and whatnot that has been unheard of in times before!

       Look, I think they're fair to a certain extent. I used a derogatory word on someone, I got warned. I went into a fight with someone, went totaly off-rails and biased , got banned. Asked kindly to get unbanned, apologized, waited, got unbanned. It was all plainly written in the rules.

       And if you think that pinned topics look alt-right, it's just that alt-right alignes themselves at the moment with most of the topics that actually look like a serious conspiracies. But there are topics from other side of spectrum that get some fruitfull discussion, too. I've seen it go both ways for pinned topics. There will be more, as the enthusiasm for Trump thins out.

       Maybe they think if we believe they're trying to sensor anti trump stuff, it'll make the _d /altright members get suspicious about trump and turn on him faster?

       Or do they generally just not want people discussing/forming trump conspiracies? Either way, it's ridiculous.

       I like the mods here. At least the ones i know of. Ive been here a while, and maybe i just agree with their views, but i think they're great. There is not censorship in this sub unless youre spouting hate speech. I'm pretty sure they stickied that trump post because a lot of you trust him way too much when he's given us no good reason to trust him. I gave him the benefit of the doubt but he's not doing anything differently point. Same shit different toilet.

       I would love to be able to come here to talk about actual conspiracies, especially a specific one that you're mentioning and not have to go to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       to do so which is pretty heavily biased towards one party and is extremely ignorant of how far this rabbit hole goes. I mean this specific conspiracy that we're not allowed to discuss goes so far beyond political party affiliations at this point, people have no fucking idea how bad it is. For example, I would love to be able to share here my latest discoveries of Russian botnets and their tactics that I've found, but I doubt that the mods will ever allow that.

       Mod opinions aside, I don't think this is a safe place to discuss that. I'm pretty sure some of those Russian botnets come here. It'd be like going "here Russians, this is how I managed to find you". Kind of a dumb idea.

      <p>
       "QUESTIONING EVERYTHING".

       Keep it simple, stick to that.

      <p>
       You haven't elaborated on what exactly it is that has got you upset.  On the face of it it seems like you're angry that the mods are allowed to have an opinion? They're not allowed to question everything too?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's intellectually lazy to put forward an argument in this sub and to then not expect to have to vigorously defend it whilst remaining completely objective.  We are all human and emotions play a part in communication so you should expect at least some abrasions.  Expect the devils advocate, expect snide comments, examine your own argument and learn how to deal with having your tree of knowledge shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what this sub is really all about IMO.

       Without trying to be rude, it seems like you're not prepared to put in the work and are screaming "THERE'S A FIRE GUYS! FOLLOW ME!".

       Absolutely, but I personally believe that it's actually coming from the top and not from the bottom.  Just look at how many threads are now littered with mods deleting posts due to the ridiculous amount of rules that now exist here, there is no room for discourse any more.
