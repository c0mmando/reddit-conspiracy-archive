        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is no Neo from the matrix. But if one were to arise the systems in place would effectively deal with it. They always have. There are firewalls in place. Surveillance, individually tweaked online and meatspace manufactured subjective reality, lilkely physically represented in the brain. Unless you have a birth defect or a particular trauma (may need to be physical) you cannot develop a truly clear perspective. Without a clear perspective you cannot see what is. No one can.</p>

<p>Meditation. Why do all people who meditate for the purpose of self-realization (&#39;seeing&#39; objective reality) all come up against the same firewalls? I&#39;m not talking about meditation for relaxation. Or mediation for magical and spiritual &#39;treasures&#39;.  I mean meditation to break free of deep deep cultural, subjective mind control. I am not talking about adhering to ANY spiritual nomenclature or fairy tales that are all literally mind control firewalls. Worshiping anyone or anything. I am talking about deep focused introspection of what is until actual liberation takes place. If it&#39;s even possible. No one on this planet has ever provided another human being with actual liberation from the mind control every single person is born into. No one can. The instinctual habit of looking outwards for signs, conspiracy, alliances, help.. are all firewalls set up to control you. us. </p>

<p>This means that if we look to anyone to free ourselves from our own torturous mind control, fabricated subjective reality, we are simply running the program. Looking here and there of &#39;how they do it&#39;, who&#39;s part &#39;of the system&#39;, what the &#39;system is&#39;. Even my own motivations for posting this.. mind control. Although i am not doing this in a dramatic way. I can make light of it.. because mind control.</p>

<p>Historically we can see whenever any potential threat or aberration is discovered or unfolds into the social consciousness, through the culture, that threat is categorized and pushed into the &#39;rabbit hole&#39;. You have legitimate conspiracies and theories, people being imprisoned, tortured, put through literal direct mind control (pop-culturally Kayne West&#39;s breakdown). And still these things lead nowhere. You can KNOW many of the details.. the who, the what, the when, the why and still there is more. Always. The rabbit hole itself is a firewall. It doesn&#39;t go anywhere.</p>

<p>If you were somehow able through extreme will, luck, providence or accident truly liberate your mind you would find an objective reality so foreign that it would have no bearing on what you identify as self, as human beingness, as &#39;reality&#39; that there is no way to share or communicate it or even be it. In culture you can identify people who work their way to the point of uncovering a physical manifestation of the deeper firewalls and they return defeated. Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Dave Chapelle, Kayne West, on an on an on. And it seems like whatever they do after that is simply going through the motions. The drive and motivation is gone. Some are labelled &#39;shills&#39;, &#39;co-intelpro&#39;, &#39;traitors&#39;, &#39;fake&#39;. If they aren&#39;t defeated only to return to a passionless robotic existence they are taken out in meatspace. If they keep pushing they become the victim of an actual conspiracy. Killed, smeared into ruin, threatened into neutered nothingness. </p>

<p>There is no reward for liberation of your mind in this fabricated subjective reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to be morbid, but it&#39;s reasonable and logical to assume that there can be no &#39;true&#39; anything in a world that is completely fabricated. On a more practical level.. if we remove ourselves from threat by stopping seeking &#39;justice&#39; and &#39;truth&#39; to be happy then we are consciously accepting delusion. I mean.. i know how to do that and i do do that. I have children. I am not going to push so much that they are openly threatened.

It&#39;s more like seeing something that is through googles that completely distort the image. Virtual reality.

<p>Only in a material sense, and even then, if you are aware of the world&#39;s distortion, then it stands to reason that you might be capable of seeing through it unfiltered.</p>

<p>How so? If you take off your goggles, then you still possess a consciousness. You are still connected to all that is, was, and ever will be on both the physical (your ancestors and descendants) and psycho-spiritual (your individual consciousness as well as the collective unconsciousness) levels It often seems like nothingness and meaninglessness are prevalent in others when we are too fixated and single-minded on one particular path or tao. </p>

<p>Read it the other way. When you see/are objective reality you hold the diamond and will never go back into a virtual world to hold the turd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The turd is to choose the only lie </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The turd is the brainwashed, mind controlled reality we accept. The diamond is reality. If you reach for the diamond while holding on to the turd you will have your arm cut off. We don&#39;t all give up our safety and the safety of our families to march without backing down until the global pedophile cabal is destroyed for example. We don&#39;t take on the real power to any real effect  because they will destroy the comfort of the virtual world they&#39;ve given. And so we busy ourselves with right vs left, conspiracy theories, USA vs Russia, immigration, jobs, terrorism, the NWO, the illuminati, the global bankers, war protest. This is the firewall. You cannot mount two horses. You can&#39;t hold the turd and the diamond in one hand. People who truly resist the real dark power in this virtual world are easily destroyed in the virtual world they themselves are committed to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting this is the ONLY TRUE perspective to have, adopt or believe here. That my belief is the be all and end all of truth. But most that are drawn to the rabbit hole would likely agree that there is a power here that remains unchallenged. One that many believe is holding them hostage in an otherwise utopian and free world. That power has control not over reality but rather our experience of the virtual reality we resist within. </p>

<p>When Hitler was defeated in WWII was the world order extinguished? The &#39;Illuminati&#39;? The &#39;World Banking Elite&#39;? Whatever you want to call it.. Nothing happened to &#39;them&#39;. We are about to go through another crises. Another winter right on schedule. Me personally, i will not be on the front lines fighting other mind controlled slaves. i will be running, cuddling my turd out of fear. hahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I thought you were saying the opposite.</p>

<p>Yes, you cannot cling to the veil and simultaneously embrace the inner truth of being. Fear and anger are themselves distortions.</p>

<p>You must choose. </p>

<p>Either let go, and grow your inner consciousness, in the hopes that one day, you will become capable of helping and freeing others who are trapped by this world&#39;s evils. If you choose this path, then you must understand that the resistance will be weakened by your absence in the near future.</p>

<p>Or you must focus on bringing the fight to the deceivers, with the realization that your own ability to make a difference is limited and potentially endangers those that you love.</p>

<p>It sounds like you should focus on self growth and family for now, but get away from your anxieties for a couple of days and think about it, and other potential solutions.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding defeatist.. we are choosing (if we have a choice) and at this stage of my life i can admit what it is i am choosing. I&#39;m &#39;alive&#39; and safe. Comfortable.</p>

<p>I can tell you with absolute confidence that anyone who presents any real threat to the true power structure is in danger. There is no consequence in the context of reality.. but the danger is real enough in the world we are invested/enslaved/whatever in.</p>

<p>Thanks. I live with this perspective however accurate or not. It&#39;s nothing new. There is no urgency. My attention on it comes and goes without effort. I am fully aware of existences and lives that are truly hellish, unmanageable, insane, scary, horrible, lacking, unbearable compared to my own. I live in and reap the benefits of a life that is truly blessed. That is 100% the case.. speaking from the perspective of the virtual world. We are the lucky one&#39;s. I know this. First world problems :)</p>

<p>I only tell you this to share and relate. Not to elevate myself or whatever. But yeah 30+ years wondering the rabbithole. And this is definitely part of the cycle of uncovering for me. Recognizing the drama i find myself in and shaking it off. You can start to think the world has gone nuts. And really get absorbed into the drama and urgency. That said I really do believe winter is here. There are some extremely difficult and dark times here now and this is the first frost. Civil war, world war, financial collapse, empire collapse. And for sure, on the other side of that is an equally dramatic unfolding of newness and hope. But.. just here putting my snowshoes and parka on. Collecting wood for the fire.</p>

<p>I agree that mounting any kind of real assault against the true power in this mind controlled virtual reality will mark the end of one&#39;s existence in it. Multidimensionally, metaphorically speaking :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to liberate your mind, all you really need to do is follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Imagine a better society (what could you imagine that would be better than now?  I.e. No debt - free health care - better nutrition - increased personal wealth, ect)</p></li>
<li><p>Sit down and draft up a working plan to make it work - you need a societal technological advancement that will incur growth on our society (beyond the lackluster 0-2% growth we are seeing, which is intentional to keep our current system from crashing under its own weight) - you need to work out all of the loose ends; you aren&#39;t just changing one thing (more jobs) - you are changing the root, increasing growth, which has a cascading effect and grants you all of the things that you want to see come to fruition - but you must consider all of the contingencies that come with changing the current system.</p></li>
<li><p>Protect yourself - you need to enact a protocol to make yourself and your associates more valuable to keep alive than to kill - if you make a great plan, but don&#39;t protect yourself, then your enemies will just kill you to prevent you from seizing their power (or at least kill you out of fear of you crashing their system).  One way to do this (might?) be to set up a dms that will release your plans to the public if you are killed - if the public sees these plans, they will realize they are being fucked over by the current regime ---&gt; non-compliant public ----&gt; system crash</p></li>
<li><p>Enact your plan - hopefully your plan elevates everybody to your level; otherwise, you didn&#39;t really achieve the initial goal, which was to bypass the system firewall that you mentioned - all you did was move it slightly (a suppressed public will eventually come back to bite you due to awareness/non-compliance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The real firewall we face at any given time is any action (or inaction) that will lead to system crash.  A good system will have proper safety nets that soft-limit you (absorb the blow) from crashing it - a bad system will hard-limit you (assassination) from crashing it - in all instances, crashing the system is the worst case scenario, worse than the evil that comes with the good to make the system operate at its present baseline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your thoughts. I don&#39;t agree that this leads to true liberation. This represents a resistance to institutions that naturally occurs as part of a cycle of birth and death and rebirth. Of cultures, society, empires.

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is mostly just doom porn - really, all that liberation is, is breaking free from the system that you are in now, and taking control of the narrative to drive the system in a new direction - you have the ability to think for yourself and you have the ability to act for yourself - if you have an idea to make things better, and you plan accordingly and bring it to fruition, you are a free human-being.  </p>

<p>If part of your idea for a better system is freeing peoples&#39; minds from the propaganda and lies and ambiguity that are fed to us on a daily basis, then you need to build a system that can successfully operate (without crashing) without the use of propaganda - propaganda is (unfortunately) an essential evil in our current system that provides order; without it, we would crash.</p>

<p>This happens naturally just as spring turns to summer. True liberation is existence beyond the changing seasons. Which is what drives people into the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>Honestly, not suggesting anyone needs to change course on their efforts for a better system. If we look to history for clues on how things unfold into &quot;better&quot; systems then we must acknowledge the death of what is old.  It happens over and over like a changing of the seasons. Empires rise and fall within a predictable time period. Same with institutions. Like seasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like your definition of liberation is death, to me - the &#39;changing of the seasons&#39; is life - liberation, in my opinion, is persistence through change aka adaptation.  If you aren&#39;t adapting to the seasons, you are dying - and then, I guess, you a &#39;liberated&#39; in <em>some</em> way</p>

<p>Death of illusion. Sure. Changing of the seasons is birth, young adulthood, middle age, old age. </p>

<p>Well yes you will be killed. For sure. If we believe the &quot;NWO&quot; must be destroyed! And we fully commit ourselves with a reckless urgency we become fodder. It&#39;s like pretending it&#39;s summer or thinking by wearing shorts out in a winter blizzard we will make it summer.</p>

<p>haha yeah. </p>
