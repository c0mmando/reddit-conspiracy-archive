    <div class="md"><p>Its important, because him talking about it puts more pressure on Trump vetoing it.  The reason why Jones and Trump have allied is because Trump gets to use AJ as a platform to talk to the non-establishment crowd- a big reason he won. If that crowd turns on him or see him doing things that are establishment it erodes support for him when he badly needs it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But doesnt Alex Jones break a lot of stuff out to the open? 
I dont think I would be as informed without his channel but his support for trump is getting rediculous. He has segments on sjw garbage but this bill is insane and hes not talking. Without infowars I wouldve had zero knowledge on subjects like tower 7, why would they give so much knowledge? Is this 4d illumnati chess? </p>

<p>Also where is a good place to get information now that I cant trust infowars..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The agent is put in a position of controlled opposition. In this way you control its perception amongst the general public. Alex offers up about 80% truth as a rough estimate, but slips in something toxic on occasion like Saudi Arabia did 911. They do all that legwork just to slip in a falsehood and a piece of propaganda. His latest assignment is to elevate the legitimacy of the phoney terrorist attacks. This benefits Israel and the pentagon&#39;s war on terror operation. Infowars woke me up too to a point. But it was Alex&#39;s ADHD and outrageous fits of temper that forced me to look for other sources. Overtime you develop strong discernment and see patterns and can spot the messaging and the lies. I would still use infowars for the time being, but just know they&#39;re defenders of the greater Israel project and the phoney war on terror. This means that they no longer call out the false flags like Orlando and San Bernardino, Charlie Hebdo etc. This means they have deep military connections through the US to the Mossad as it is more than likely that the Mossad is running these Gladio ops. 
For info sources:
I listen to Mike Rivero on RBN daily of WhatReallyHappened.com
Mike is far from perfect and is found to be stubbornly wrong on a few things, but he does offer good analysis on globalism, US politics etc. And he doesn&#39;t shriek in anger into the mic.
Another FANTASTIC source is Patrick Henningsen of 21st Century Wire. He has the Sunday Wire program. Henningsen is outstanding. His critical analysis on the media is second to none as is their coverage to wars in Syria and Yemen. Patrick&#39;s strengths are in geopolitical analysis and the media coverage it receives. He calls out the false flags very well too. The guy can spot them. Daily shooter he calls them. He&#39;s really, really good journalist and I pray that the show keeps growing. In all my years as a truther, he&#39;s the best I&#39;ve come across for intelligence, integrity and delivery.
Also on YouTube I go to TruthStreamMedia, run by two former infowars employees. They&#39;re very good at piercing the veil.
Two up and comers of late are the Michael Trimm show and Sibel Edmonds&#39; Newsbud organization.
Sibel is an FBI whistleblower and Trimm is really coming into his own as a gifted conspiracy and political analyst. Watch Sibel&#39;s recent video where she recaps her case and discloses a few shocking things. She&#39;s the real deal and is deserving of a wider audience.</p>
