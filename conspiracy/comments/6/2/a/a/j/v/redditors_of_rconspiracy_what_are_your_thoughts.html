    <div class="md"><p>When people listen to Alex Jones over an extended period of time they tend to notice a pattern of him talking in vague circles that actually do not challenge the status quo. Ever since Trump has risen to power he has sounded like an employee of Fox, which is bizarre considering he used to denounce the left/right paradigm. Now he equates the globalist to the left, which is divisive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m old, been around the world, and pretty much seen and heard it all, and so it gets easier to spot charlatans as the decades go by. I can remember when Jones&#39; radio show started 20 years ago. I listened in sometimes, but as the years went by it became more and more evident that he was a plant, an agent provocateur, a stooge not really much different than Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage (née Weiner) or Glenn Beck in that he has a clearly conservative political and religious agenda. The only difference is that he found his niche in the conspiracy genre. To that end, not everything that he says is a lie, but since he pretty much takes the shotgun approach to conspiracies, then <em>yeah</em>, he&#39;s occasionally gonna hit something, though I&#39;d take any of it with a grain of salt. Basically, it&#39;s conspiracy theory for dummies. That said, given the modern Information Age (aka internet), my advice to you is to do your own digging from as many different sources as you can, from the left, right and everywhere in between. The truth behind various conspiracies is always difficult to discern, and rarely if ever revealed in full, but you can get a better sense of what the truth is by not gravitating to any main source, including this sub, although it&#39;s one of the better ones if only because it&#39;s crowd-sourced. Oh, and <em>good luck</em>, because no matter how much you dig, you&#39;re always bgonna need some of that. Like I said, there&#39;s nuggets in them there hills, but hard as hell to find.   </p>

<p>Jones tells the truth about those he called &quot;the globalists&quot; as he knows it, or thinks he knows it, while staying away from third-rail topics that could get him booted off his network.
