       I discovered him through the meme compliations people make of him, and I've started actually watching some of his videos. I'm curious to know what y'alls opinions are on his beliefs in the globalist agenda, chemicals in the water, brainwashing, pizzagate, etc.

       When people listen to Alex Jones over an extended period of time they tend to notice a pattern of him talking in vague circles that actually do not challenge the status quo. Ever since Trump has risen to power he has sounded like an employee of Fox, which is bizarre considering he used to denounce the left/right paradigm. Now he equates the globalist to the left, which is divisive.

       I look at him like controlled opposition, kind of like how Glenn beck used to be. Where he will give you just enough information just to make you think then downplay the rest. Once he goes off on his tangents, yeah he has made people independent thinkers, but then he goes off on his male vitality crap which turns people off.

       I'm old, been around the world, and pretty much seen and heard it all, and so it gets easier to spot charlatans as the decades go by. I can remember when Jones' radio show started 20 years ago. I listened in sometimes, but as the years went by it became more and more evident that he was a plant, an agent provocateur, a stooge not really much different than Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage (née Weiner) or Glenn Beck in that he has a clearly conservative political and religious agenda. The only difference is that he found his niche in the conspiracy genre. To that end, not everything that he says is a lie, but since he pretty much takes the shotgun approach to conspiracies, then
       <em>
        yeah
       </em>
       , he's occasionally gonna hit something, though I'd take any of it with a grain of salt. Basically, it's conspiracy theory for dummies. That said, given the modern Information Age (aka internet), my advice to you is to do your own digging from as many different sources as you can, from the left, right and everywhere in between. The truth behind various conspiracies is always difficult to discern, and rarely if ever revealed in full, but you can get a better sense of what the truth is by not gravitating to any main source, including this sub, although it's one of the better ones if only because it's crowd-sourced. Oh, and
       <em>
        good luck
       </em>
       , because no matter how much you dig, you're always bgonna need some of that. Like I said, there's nuggets in them there hills, but hard as hell to find.

       He is a genius and the way they are using him is genius. Not saying i agree with him. He is a manipulative social douchebag that can improvise for 5 hours straight just talking into a microphone. Perfect person to make the face of Conspiracy theorists to further ensure they are regarded as nutjobs by the general population. Toss some truth along with a shit ton of fear mongering will ensure the truthers are always on edge and biting onto whatever propaganda is thrown at them that supports their beliefs.

       He talks and talks and talks but doesn't say anything. He uses buzzwords to dog whistle like he's on to something but never follows through with any complete thoughts. Total fear monger in it to enrich himself. Falling him a shill or tool is giving him too much credit. He's a con man.

       He's a man with a brand and a business. His underlying intentions (if they exist) are not important to sit here and repeatedly attempt to analyze. If you think he's spouting nonsense, your first goal shouldn't be to lazily define it with speculative bullshit--it should be to explain to your peers what is at the heart of his operations. Like most things, it's money.

       If you can manage to relay that simplicity, effectively, people will begin to see it for what it is and have no need to "dig" any further.

       What I seriously think of Alex Jones is that he is a NOC who is given good info with the intent of mixing it in with other crazy untrue info to precondition people to the idea and make the possibility that it's a reality a silly thought to people. Tom Clancy is another good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less seriously and more because it's just a fun theory that seems kind of plausible is that Alex Jones is actually the late Bill Hicks.

       I don't have anything against Alex Jones. He's not perfect, but who is? He won't really criticize Israel because he's terrified of being labeled anti-Semitic, and losing his show. Well, who can blame him? Suppose he came out tomorrow and told the truth about AIPAC and the Zionists ... how long would he be on the air? A month? A week?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones tells the truth about those he called "the globalists" as he knows it, or thinks he knows it, while staying away from third-rail topics that could get him booted off his network. He's not going to confront the police outside his house and get himself shot. He's not crazy.

       I used to listen to his podcasts, but hes so angry about everything to the point where his shouting would hurt my ears. He would also latch on to everything, any incident which could potentially be a false flag and would yell about how he was right and that was proof. I do find it interesting that he's backed off from pizzagate when he's never backed off or shut up about anything.
