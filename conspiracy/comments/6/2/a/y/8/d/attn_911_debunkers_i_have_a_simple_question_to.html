       I'm sure this question has been posed before, but I'll ask it again because I haven't seen it on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did a hijacker's passport survive nearly totally intact to be discovered on the ground by law enforcement when the plane crash and fireball that followed was so destructive that it
       <em>
        destroyed
       </em>
       the (up-until-9/11) indestructible titanium black box? And brought down a 110-story skyscraper with 47 core columns and a rigid outer skeleton. And brought down the 47-story skyscraper across the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: before you say that the black boxes were found, I would like to remind you that according to the final report of the 9/11 commission, the Flight Data Recorders, or "black boxes", were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       recovered from flights 11 or 175.

       The important thing here is that I, along with many, many others draw a clear distinction between Jews and Zionists. There isn't an anti-Semitic bone in my body, but I'm not afraid to call a spade a spade.

       I'm not "resting my case". There is much stronger evidence pointing to deception surrounding 9/11. I'm simply amused to see how strong the cognitive dissonance is. It's amazing to see the lengths people will go to defend what the government and mainstream media tell them is true.

       Where's the baseline? How can you assert one line of "truth" without effectively disproving the other side--or what you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       is false?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you've misused this term: cognitive dissonance

       First, the baseline is fact. The amount of evidence which points to deception surrounding the events of 9/11 is overwhelming. It has nothing to do with belief. I don't know what happened. I wasn't there. I do know that there is a mountain of solid evidence which points to deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort an individual encounters when faced with  information that contradicts his or her belief system or worldview. So I think I'm just fine on the "knowing what I'm saying" front. Thank you for your concern though.

       You've not established fact. Your definition of adequate evidence is of course a belief regarding this particular subject. Many people, think many things.

       I don't think there's anything further I can say that will change your stance. I would encourage you to research this topic further. Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth (a group of over 2,500 experts in architecture and steel-frame high-rise design, metallurgy, engineers, etc.) just released a great video featuring a former employee of NIST(National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology, the US government body that was tasked with investigating the buildings' collapses) that I would highly recommend. I'll link it below. It was good to talk to you.

       I don't have a definitive stance. I've been down this road, many times. Funny you mentioned that NIST employee. If you skim through that post that was stickied here weeks ago, you'd see I thoroughly pointed out why it's of no significance. Really, you should go look! The sub didn't like it, but I was most certainly correct. Not many certainties around here...but that was one of them.

       Okay. I'll say this: your ability to logically articulate an argument is masterful. While I don't necessarily believe there's an "ulterior motive" at play, I do agree that they might as well be interviewing the night janitor. I think the reason they're running with Peter is simply due to the fact that NIST is on his resume. The video does feature some great slow-motion footage of the tower being blown up that's very well put together, but aside from that, I'm in full agreement. Overall I think the video in its entirety
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be effective in creating more skeptics though. I'll be blunt--not all people think like you. I'm not kissing your ass but it's obvious that you're dealing with some substantial firepower when it comes to reasoning and critical thinking. 95% of the general population lacks that sort of ability to reason. So no, I don't think it's "dangerous" per se, but you certainly hit the nail on the head with your presentation of your argument.

       I mean no antagonistic harm, usually. I just try to prompt people to "up their game". I only see beneficial outcomes in promoting that. There's no negatives, and it weeds out bullshit in the process. I dunno about you, but my digital travels are vast and I haven't much time to invest in obvious misdirection or lazy presentations.

       Full disclosure, Im no debunker. I fully believe that although the buildings were hit by planes, they were not the cause of their collapse. Im also no physicist, but I am fairly intuitive, and buildings that were MADE to withstand those kinds of impacts would not and should not have fallen, let alone at freefall. There are just too many unanswered questions, and those that DO have answers either do not make sense or are not answered sufficiently. Too many things lend themselves open to question, and we should have the right to press for answers considering we sent our brothers, fathers, children, and in my case, ourselves, to a war that yielded so little but bloodshed. But i digress...
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the simple answer is: it couldnt have. Most people would agree, but the rational person would say that it is "possible" for such a thing to happen. But for me, the probability of that is so minuscule that we can consider it to be in the "impossible" category.
