    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really simple. About a year ago, the Trump campaign came to r/conspiracy to advertise. The campaign never left. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Trumpsters, many of the people who gave him his thin &quot;win&quot; in 2016 are recognizing that they were duped. Unfortunately for us, the desperate Republican brown shirts will continue to fill this sub with their partisan campaign. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why a long-time Establishment Republican like James O&#39;Keefe -- literally funded by Koch brothers, Robert Mercer, and even Donald Trump himself -- is presented as an alternative to CNN.</p>

<p>Most everyone here knows about CNN&#39;s war lies and its generalized censorship of important issues.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s Republicans have no concern at all for accuracy about anything at all.</p>

<p>In the old days, both parties and MSM would lie to go to war, but they weren&#39;t lying about <em>everything</em>. All lies all the time is a major step in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s new videos were exactly that -- total lies -- and that&#39;s before we even consider the editing. The first one was some &quot;producer&quot; who, when pressed, espoused an opinioin. The lie attached to this was that CNN doesn&#39;t believe its reporting. The second one was even worse -- the lie there was that Van Jones was somehow &quot;exposed&quot; when his views were already known. </p>

<p>These Republican brown shirts don&#39;t care one bit about conspiracies either. If they did, they might want to spend at least a comment or two in their typically one-year histories to consider that Donald Trump may have done something wrong. They may want to look at their precious Republican Party and notice that it is the same party that caused 9-11. These partisan sources like James O&#39;Keefe that they use specifically <em>deny that 9-11 was a false flag operation</em>. </p>

<p>Then, there&#39;s fraud outsider Donald Trump. He has supported <em>only</em> the Koch brothers agenda since the inauguration. He is a full-fledged Establishment Republican.</p>

<p>This is nothing new. Back in the days of George W. Bush, internet forums began to fill with Republican brown shirts. I am saying these people here today are the same people who did it then.</p>

<p>Anything for their <em>cause</em>.</p>

It&#39;s just different levels of defense from different levels of C

<p>Ok, so let me get this straight: FOX, Breitbart, Alex Jones, Zerohedge, Russia&#39;s and Iran&#39;s state-owned news outlets can report lies and propaganda all day and nobody here bats an eye. CNN reports something incorrectly, fires the people responsible and that is &quot;proof&quot; that all msm is fake news?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice false equivalency.</p>

<p>Alex Jones, Breitbart, Zerohedge, etc aren&#39;t equivalent to CNN. I&#39;m sick to fucking death of hearing about fucking Breitbart—no one I know even reads it or has even heard of it and it&#39;s only ever mentioned by Democrats when they need a punching bag. We get it, you need a Boogie Man.</p>

<p>So now let&#39;s scrap that BS equivalency away. If the president were a Democrat and the tables were turned and Fox News was branded by many in the media as well as the population as FAKE NEWS and they legit came up with sources and a story like CNN and got caught of course they would fire the journalists behind it to save face. They would have to, just like CNN or they would risk solidifying Trump&#39;s fake news claims.</p>

<p>And between 2009 and now we have witnessed the rise of activism on the right which we haven&#39;t seen before in our lifetimes—where the right has started to have the equivalent to the left`s younger political activists. Republican hipsters. Youth movements. Alternatives to the typical old men religious right stuffy Republicanism. Having someone like Milo around and popular is like the Republican party&#39;s cherry being popped. Not only that but hopefully it will start to get rid of some of the homophobia on the right.</p>

<p>Yes, all corporate media are bad and they all have agenda. Being selective of their news. CNN in this case is that they KNEW its fake and still pretend it real and keep broadcasting it 24/7. Most of cases, news outlet just ignore the ones are hurting their agenda. CNN is not in this case. They made up stories and provoke people protest and demanding investigation on something they knew its FAKE. This is awful in so many levels. Usually major outlets wont keep talking about something they not sure its fake or real because it will damage their brands. CNN is very obvious political driven in this case and make up stories and betray its audience&#39;s trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question, especially if you take his upbringing into consideration. He was raised in a situation where he cared for children, and born into a family of actors. He had a gay brother too and was pretty tolerant, I remember seeing a photo of the two vandalizing a church sign someone posted on social media.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t really look like the boots, jeans, and pickup truck type in any of those photos except the one that caught the <a href="http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161205004855-comet-pizza-arrest-exlarge-169.jpg">day of the event</a> and one that was used as a <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/WNT/161205_wn_thomas1_16x9_992.jpg">press release.</a></p>

<p>But, If you google it now all you&#39;ll see is the gun photo and a picture of him in a cowboy hat. It was weird how all his little brother&#39;s photos seemed to have disappeared. I guess I&#39;m crazy.</p>

<p>I mean there is also the Washintonian article which appeared hours before the shooting too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When direct links to Fox, Breitbart, or Infowars are posted here, they tend to get plenty of flak for being propagandistic/essentially state-endorsed outlets to be swallowed with massive grains of salt. However-- and this seems like a critical point-- the ideas and narratives these outlets promote are widely embraced here, echoed in less popular sites (like zerohedge, gatewaypundit, various op eds, blogs) and therefore spun into not being MSM. For instance, I&#39;ve seen plenty of non-MSM articles here that simply repackage or summarize a Breitbart article, upping the salty language, thus representing the ideas as populist or anti-establishment. It&#39;s a clever propaganda technique that I know users who promote such things know they are running with. </p>

<p>Or you have someone like Kaitlin Johnstone, a freelancer &quot;leftist&quot; who almost solely reproduces alt-rightist perspectives that might as well be AJ authored, targeted in order to further divide leftist readers. </p>

<p>CNN is trash, full stop. Seeing their general credibility suffer is awesome-- but when it&#39;s all done in attempts to &quot;destroy&quot; the Russia story or imply they are making it all up, there&#39;s a clear goal that ignores the very real investigations. Fake stories don&#39;t launch federal investigations. If CNN/WaPo/other media were the sole promoters of these suspicions, they&#39;d be easier to tar. But <em>real</em> investigations are what they&#39;re &quot;reporting&quot; on, jumping the gun at times, for ratings, sure. It&#39;s to be expected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something I have found to be interesting...</p>

<p>I think Breitbart is complete shit, it is click bait bullshit that omits the facts that don&#39;t support their narrative....but they are no different than the Huffington Post with their embarrassingly bad headlines and biased narratives</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Find me a Breitbart Article that flat out lies</p>

<p>I had never heard of Breitbart prior to Trump winning the election (maybe a few weeks before he won)... but I have seen them called a &quot;white supremacist&quot; lying rag of bullshit from the moment I first heard about them.</p>

<p>I personally consider myself a moderate in real life but fully admit on reddit I come across as conservative because when it comes to politics I tend to lean in the direction of devils advocate.</p>

<p>If the echo chamber is pushing A...I tend to push  back against it.</p>

<p>What I really hate is false narratives....</p>

<p>And Breitbart is another in a long line of bullshit media that pushes their narratives by framing the facts in such a manner.  But both sides have political rags pushing their agenda....Breitbart is no different.</p>

<p>What people won&#39;t be able to find me is Breitbart articles that flat out lie...You will find Horseshit Headlines, and many will JUMP to a story about Breitbart claiming X amount of muslims did something and call it a lie.....(but you will ignore that Breitbart reported that another media outlet reported x amount of muslims, a common tactic of things like the HuffPo and WaPo when pushing their narratives....</p>

<p>But hey...You guys are so sure....show me Breitbart lying....</p>

<p>Good luck</p>
