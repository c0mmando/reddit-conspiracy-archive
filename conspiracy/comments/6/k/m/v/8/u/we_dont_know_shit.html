       Everything you hear, everything you see, all of the conspiracies that have been fueled by government are only at least half truths. It's a distraction. If the government didn't want you finding out about something, you won't ever find out about it. The wikileaks dump on Hillary, the twin towers, Podesta, all of it. We are supposed to see it and the powers that be always drop subtle hints to fuel our suspicions even with their misinformation campaigns so we never focus or pay attention to the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracies it's just adding fuel to the fire we try to put out with a cloth while they set fire to the room around us. It's all theatre and we don't get to see what's really happening behind the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all conspiracies are false. Many have proven true and many have alot of evidence... But what if that is their intentions. Take the CIA for example, the vault 7 dump is massive news and barely anyone cares. The CIA betrayed the people (again) and they're doing so much worse than what we even know about but we don't pay attention to that because there is a long, steady stream of "leaks" coming from the CIA which attracts our attention.

       In my personal opinion, the real dirty deeds of the government things that of came out would really start a civil war or revolution. Do you honestly think that the government isn't doing anything that they would want to keep secret from absolutely everyone? I bet what we know from all these conspiracies we have ever discussed and confirmed are just the tip of the iceberg.

       The reason the Pedophile 'matter' will not be easily revealed is BECAUSE it reveals the truth about Satan, his hold on the elite, the power he gives them.  Believe this...Satan does NOT want to be revealed..and people like you make it easy for him. Get your soul straight with God...there is a big awakening coming...and crystals aint gonna do it.

       Vault 7 is 100% bullshit, a distraction (as you note somewhat), the CIA/Mossad/Black Cube silenced Assange and now they are pretending Wikileaks is operating business as usual.

       Vault 7 provably contains malware that starts making networking calls. I'm not joking, someone went over the symlink in this sub a while back.

       Even if Vault 7's content are legit, I still think they were leaked on purpose. It's so much data, over a long period of time that's getting no mainstream attention right now. The CIA would be taking this opportunity to carry on with their extremely disgusting operations while we're all paying attention to Vault 7.

       I suspect they are legit. But they aren't damaging whatsoever to the agency. They haven't released any code, only documentation. And everyone already knew they were spying on everyone anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they needed to pretend they hadn't rushed the embassy and needed content for wikileaks so soft leaking on themselves was the easiest thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this, what happened to the rest of Wikileaks pre-election leaks on the cabals chosen candidate? They vanished and it took 7 months for "Assange" to come out in public.

       I've always had a feel this was the case as a child but the more I read the more real it seemed. Been doing experiments with dice and chance trying to influence my odds. I've done 4  so far with results that I'm super excited about (will post about it.all soon) have you been to the holofractal sub? So much to read there. Will keep you busy forever :p

       I've always thought some, not all but some, drugs are actually good for you. Some may open areas of your mind you never could before, some may heighten your senses and generally unlock your consciousness such as weed, DMT etc.

       Alternate idea on the same thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people believe they drop hints to what they are doing because of some Karmic order. Basically by hinting at what they are doing, we are let it happen, and then they don't accumulate negative karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not reall a Karma guy, but if its real, this idea makes a little sense i guess lol.

       Actually yeah, by making the public at least suspicious of the on goings then I guess they can justify it in their own way. Good theory, man.

       I agree. So much of it, even if true, is used for gaslighting. The conspiracy community still has its divisions.

       I say this all the time! It is all entertainment and distraction. The elite write the scripts and the leaders of nations act it out. Just like with movies the director only lets you see what they want you to see, otherwise you're left in the dark! ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?

       Category 1: You do not read or watch any conspiracy related material about the world we live in. It just does not interest you at all. You're not in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Category 2: You read and watch as much conspiracy material as you can possibly absorb. Your self-image is defined by what you think you know - but someone out there wishes you didn't. You're a fan of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Category 3: You are drawn to conspiracy because certain things just do not seem to "fit" into the normal perceptions you grew up with, and you want to figure out why. You're looking for answers to your life's trajectory by watching the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Category 4: You secretly wish it was you that got to decide how and when to spring some new ripe conspiracy on the unsuspecting conspiracy public. You're hoping to be recruited into the game, first as a breathless commentator, but eventually as a real agent of the secret societies, good and bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Category 5: You have found a way to both believe and disbelieve everything you have ever heard or seen, especially about conspiracies. It both happened and it didn't happen. It means nothing by meaning everything. It matters tremendously but it doesn't matter at all. You have won the game. For now...

       Well maybe fucking kids... There's alot of evidence to show that's a real problem with the elite. Don't really care much for the religious side of the conspiracy, how are people supposed to take you seriously when you bring religion into it?
