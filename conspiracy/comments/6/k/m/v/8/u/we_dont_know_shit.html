        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everything you hear, everything you see, all of the conspiracies that have been fueled by government are only at least half truths. It&#39;s a distraction. If the government didn&#39;t want you finding out about something, you won&#39;t ever find out about it. The wikileaks dump on Hillary, the twin towers, Podesta, all of it. We are supposed to see it and the powers that be always drop subtle hints to fuel our suspicions even with their misinformation campaigns so we never focus or pay attention to the <em>real</em> conspiracies it&#39;s just adding fuel to the fire we try to put out with a cloth while they set fire to the room around us. It&#39;s all theatre and we don&#39;t get to see what&#39;s really happening behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not saying all conspiracies are false. Many have proven true and many have alot of evidence... But what if that is their intentions. Take the CIA for example, the vault 7 dump is massive news and barely anyone cares. The CIA betrayed the people (again) and they&#39;re doing so much worse than what we even know about but we don&#39;t pay attention to that because there is a long, steady stream of &quot;leaks&quot; coming from the CIA which attracts our attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect they are legit. But they aren&#39;t damaging whatsoever to the agency. They haven&#39;t released any code, only documentation. And everyone already knew they were spying on everyone anyway.</p>

<p>But they needed to pretend they hadn&#39;t rushed the embassy and needed content for wikileaks so soft leaking on themselves was the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this, what happened to the rest of Wikileaks pre-election leaks on the cabals chosen candidate? They vanished and it took 7 months for &quot;Assange&quot; to come out in public.</p>

<p>Some people believe they drop hints to what they are doing because of some Karmic order. Basically by hinting at what they are doing, we are let it happen, and then they don&#39;t accumulate negative karma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Category 1: You do not read or watch any conspiracy related material about the world we live in. It just does not interest you at all. You&#39;re not in the game.</p>

<p>Category 2: You read and watch as much conspiracy material as you can possibly absorb. Your self-image is defined by what you think you know - but someone out there wishes you didn&#39;t. You&#39;re a fan of the game.</p>

<p>Category 3: You are drawn to conspiracy because certain things just do not seem to &quot;fit&quot; into the normal perceptions you grew up with, and you want to figure out why. You&#39;re looking for answers to your life&#39;s trajectory by watching the game.</p>

<p>Category 4: You secretly wish it was you that got to decide how and when to spring some new ripe conspiracy on the unsuspecting conspiracy public. You&#39;re hoping to be recruited into the game, first as a breathless commentator, but eventually as a real agent of the secret societies, good and bad.</p>

<p>Category 5: You have found a way to both believe and disbelieve everything you have ever heard or seen, especially about conspiracies. It both happened and it didn&#39;t happen. It means nothing by meaning everything. It matters tremendously but it doesn&#39;t matter at all. You have won the game. For now...</p>
