       of Trump hate and pro-MSM rhetoric. I enjoyed this sub so much in the past but it is getting beyond tolerable at this point. It is becoming so similar to r/Politics it's hard to come to a conclusion or state an opinion without being attacked by never Trumpers. If anyone has a good alternative sub or website where deep thinking and new opinions/ideas are encouraged instead of attacked, please message me.

       Conspiracy drifts in the troughs between the waves.  Just when you get too comfortable with the trough you're in a wave breaks and two troughs merge together exposing you to other wayfaring drifters who almost certainly have a different PoV.

       How am I wrong for stating the truth? Politics is one of the  best divide and conquer strategies there is. Keep people fighting over who they think the best mob boss is and those at the top continue to in-act their agenda with little problem.

       The dialog is no longer constructive and any theory that isn't backed up by a MSM news outlet is heavily down voted and brigaded. Not sure how anyone can consider this T_D 2.0... Even this thread, it is about being anti-anti trump, not about being pro trump. Mention something about the CNN tapes that came out, instant attacks on your comment trying to discredit a tape that is literally video evidence of a conspiracy. The community of this sub isn't for bringing conspiracies to light anymore, it is about shutting them down.

       Trump is no savior. We are our own saviors. Trump has been buddies with known criminals for years, that's enough for me to tune out the MSM and focus on the truth. The evidence.

       Why was my comment moved? I'm confused now. Anywho the fact that people "need" a president to save them from themselves is a conspiracy in and of itself. I'm sure the second coming of Christ is just around the corner too if we just hang on for another 4 years. /s

       We "need" a president because someone in that position is the only one with enough power, your average person has no leverage, no pull. According to your logic why even elect leaders at all?

       We shouldn't need to elect leaders at all, I mean where are they leading us too? As far as I can tell into an early and shallow grave for our species and many others because people are afraid of taking responsibility and ownership of their actions, choosing to differ it instead to only ONE man or woman instead of their own common sense.

       So he lies and you can't take anything he says seriously? I mean I already knew that but usually his supporters like to dance around the issue a bit more. I've often heard dishonesty is a key trait in any good leader.

       I understand that you don't like Trump, that your desire is to frame any conversation about him, any comment about him in a negative light.  I completely understand why you're doing this, and I agree with the reasons that most people need to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want you to understand something.  The people who support Trump have seen past the media, that have seen the sun set on good guy politicians generation after generation while we as a nation just keep mindlessly marching towards globalization.  There is absolutely nothing you can say at this point to convince a Trump supporter to jump back into the MSM narrative about Trump being unfit for office, criminal in his business practices, inhumane to the poor, disrespectful to women, racist towards minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen this message played over and over again by people who showered Hillary Clinton with adoration.  Their word is poison, their credibility is quicksand, their eyes are blankly reading from a teleprompter which has been staged for them by a room full of writers and psychologist with the sole intention of winning people's minds without ever offering them anything of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing that they say will ever again sound like anything other than a mockingbird.  A cheap imitation of the real thing.  And like a mockingbird they are protecting their territory, they could care less about what is good for the country or the poor or the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the bad that can be said about Trump, there are 100 equal or worse things that could be said about his detractors.  For all the nasty things that Trump himself says, it provides an uneasy comfort in knowing that a think tank of political scientists backed up with propaganda specialists​ would NEVER approve one of their puppets to say such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       His flaws are his strengths, his painfully awkward mistakes is his pedigree of being​ a real person.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are comfortable having a billionaire fighting for them because he's going to be fighting against other billionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you ask yourself what kind of leader you need when you're fighting savages, you need a Savage of your own.

       Let me just start by saying this is the best explanation and defence of Trump's support I've read so far. Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy people are turning away from the empty suits that perpetually promise change yet deliver nothing but a strengthening of the status quo. I applaud them and can't blame them one wit for not supporting Clinton (in general at least).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, genuineness in itself is not enough. Equal standing with those he must take down is not enough. He must also be capable of understanding how to take them down with the ability and intent to do so. What good is knowing he's not controlled by the propaganda specialists if he is incapable carrying out the radical reform of not only our policies but our system of governance. At no point has he shown anything but a vague, surface-level understanding of important social and economic issues. He has yet to stand up to congress or do anything but support and work toward McConnell/Ryan's goals. As far as intent, nowhere in his life has anything but a motivation for his own personal enrichment been evident, why should anyone expect different now? We desperately need that genuine leader, perhaps even your savage leader, but Trump is not him.

       That's odd because if you look at the media reports on Trump before he put his name in the POTUS hat, he did a shit ton of stuff that wasn't for personal enrichment.

       As far as Bernie Sanders is concerned... I think Bernie is a very honest fellow.  I think he is an honest communist and I think he is way too easy to push around to achieve his goals on the global stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't personally like his goals so I'm glad he didn't win just in case I'm wrong about his abilities.  I think Bernie Sanders is one of those "good guy politicians" for the left, and I think the left just watched the sun set on him just like the right had to do with Ron Paul.  Ron Paul was a good guy politician for the right, and he would have been a much better leader than Trump.  Unfortunately he wasn't​ the Savage guy needed to actually win an election against TPTB.  God knows we would be in better hands right now if he had whatever Trump managed to harness to win.

       Whereas I feel the same about Paul re not personally liking his goals. Maybe we can combine them all into a frankenpolitician, might need to throw in some young blood to keep him vital tho. Flip for lefty or righty end goals.

       No thanks I won't flip for left or right end goals.  I'll work towards what I believe in.  My point is that I don't like Bernie Sanders policies but I don't have to hate the man.  And I don't.

       I never understood why people would come to a conspiracy subreddit, where the very topic and nature of the discussions would be people disagreeing with each other on:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Whether or not something is an actual conspiracy or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) People might have different ideas as to which faction/group/conspirators are behind certain actions, or who would benefit most.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Complicated scenarios where half of any theory requires guesswork and connecting-of-dots that may or may not actually be connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when disagreement happens, people on both sides want to either turn this sub into an echo chamber, or they want to direct you to an echo chamber to get rid of alternative ideas and thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we come to terms with the fact that not all of us agree, and the very nature of our disagreement would lead to discussion where truth and possibilities would be revealed though discourse, rather than just shutting down anything that doesn't conform to your already established bias.

       Everything from 9/11 to JFK to the moon landing is questioned here.  Nobody puts a lot of stock in the MSM official story for those events either.  Rejecting the official (MSM) narrative is one of the few consistent themes here.  You're kidding yourself if you claim not to see that.

       Here's one right here, ready? :D
      </p>
      <p>
       James O'Keefe, a long-time heavily paid Republican operative who owes his organization to Robert Mercer, the Kochs and even the Trump fund put out a partisan troll video to prove something everyone already knew ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Namely that Van Jones is not a supporter of the Russia collusion claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Van Jones had said that publicly, so there was nothing new there!
      </p>
      <p>
       First trick: use a secret camera to catch someone saying something that he already said publicly and pretend you caught them admitting something secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the Republican operatives who have filled r/conspiracy since about a year ago used that false revelation to bandwagon a community that largely despises MSM toward a Republican partisan alternative -- namely, the even more fake, court sanctioned discredited total liar and paid thug James O'Keefe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second trick: take something people don't like and pretend to be on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can tell the post in question is heavily trolled out by Republicans by the way the comments are voted. There is one comment saying we can be against both CNN and James O'Keefe -- it has double digit down votes. Now who in the world would down vote that? Pretty much
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       Republican operatives or partisans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, these Republican government supporters cry constantly about shills and Democrats -- even while the overarching changes in this sub plainly show that Republican operative types are the infiltrators. :)

       Some people talk about Trumo being on our side others refute it. Good. The more evidence people bring up, the closer we get to the truth.

       Why do people Trust that fuck? They kill genuine truthers, genuine men of integrity. Eother that or they destroy them. Trump is here to usher in economic collapse, just wait. There are bubbles getting ready to pop, he is their scapegoat.

       I see it in terms of it being the New World Order Globalists verses the Nationalists.  People confuse things, either intentionally or unintentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people here are anti-Establishment (i.e. anti-New World Order Globalist), but this gets confused with being pro-Trump.  It just happens that Trump does and says a lot that is against the Establishment agenda.

       I cannot connect Trump to Freemasonry, the Illuminati, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, or the Council on Foreign Relations.  Can you?

       No, but my thoughts were that he swiped the throne from the globalist, which they did not expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I believe Obama said that spiel about there not being any meddling in the election in October and that Trump should quit whining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone had it set for Trump to fail and be the shining example of what should happen to old racist white men. The media ran it, campaigns pushed it, and then the debates turned into absolute shit shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda believe they thought there was no way to lose, so they had plans to make lots and lots of money. Classic Clinton deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rise of Antifa post election and the Berkeley riots, who all support the EU and globalist ideals of open borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       This helps me understand the media reaction a bit better, they are playing ball for the globalist.

       Clinton was the globalist choice, and they are pissed.

       I think it is much more accurate than saying it is Liberals verses Conservatives or Democrats verses Republicans or Left verses Right.  None of those labels take into consideration the true people in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a normal Presidential election, both the Democrat and Republican candidates are New World Order Globalists.  This last election was different because only one candidate was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people at the top of the pyramid want a one world government under their absolute control.  They want to reduce the population to about 500 million people.  I think they want the world to be like China-a small group of people with absolute control, and a larger group of people who work as slaves and are happy to just be alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       For us to have a meaningful discussion, we have to agree on who is really in control of the world.

       Yes, I have heard that.  And reptilians, too.  I think they are playing on people's superstition.

       It is like when kings used to claim that it was their divine right to rule.  People were very religious, so they would not challenge the king's authority for fear of retribution from god.

       Then what reasons are there to dismiss Trump being part of the overall Elitist conspiracy? You made a post which basically suggested people shouldn't make anti-trump comments or pro MSM. What gives you the right to deny free speech, especially on a conspiracy forum, just because it doesnt gel with your beliefs?

       It's not that it doesn't gel with my beliefs, it's that it runs the same lines as the MSM. There's plenty of room here for a Trump elitist conspiracy. But when every comment and thread is brigaded with posts saying the same, it destroys the integrity of the sub.

       Trump is president, His actions are pro war, his policies have big impacts, his character is flawed and shady....Ofc he will dominate the conspiracy forum.

       Looking at the front page I see 3 posts about trump or directly involving trump and all 3 are positive....So where are you coming from?

       No people aren't allowed an opinion against Trump, this is the secret Reddit police. You get one warning.

      <p>
       Watch this, Trump sucks dick and I fear he may bring more war to our front door. He has promised jobs but sadly the economy still seems to be in a weird hesitant state of stasis, maybe if they would actually read the healthcare bills instead of blatantly trying to push it through like they did with Obamacare it would be more acceptable for the American people. I hate the fact that McConnell is basically saying this bill or Democrats when that is counterproductive to the system.

       Globalist?  How do you figure?  Trump is a Nationalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Establishment (i.e. the trillionaire class) are New World Order Globalists, and being a Nationalist directly conflicts with the New World Order agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why they wanted Hillary to win.  She is also a New World Order Globalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Trump is in conflict with the CIA.  The CIA is the government arm of the Establishment, so they are tasked with making sure the New World Order Globalist agenda is moved forward by the politicians, the media, and the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New World Order Globalist organizations that create policy are Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations.  I cannot link Trump to any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot link Trump to Freemasonry or the Illuminati, either.  The Illuminati are Luciferian, and I cannot link Trump to this religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ton of misinformation as to what Trump's role is in this play.  Trump was supposed to be the dupe who handed the election to the New World Order Globalist shill Hillary.  It did not work out that way and now they are doing damage control.

       On the surface sure. But I bet all his nationalism achieves is more discord, distrust and hate amongst the people, Which is something globalists are very eager for.

       Fair enough.  Time will tell if he is in bed with them or not.  What sways my opinion is his ongoing feud with the CIA and the media.  Could it be a false flag?  Sure, but why go through such great lengths at this point in time?  It makes more sense to me that they have to keep a Nationalistic President in line with the New World Globalist Agenda.  They are afraid that Trump will throw a huge monkey wrench into their plans.  Worse is that Trump will actually tell the American people what a scam the whole thing has been.  Then the Establishment will have to deal with an informed and non-compliant armed population of pissed of Americans.

      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe in that.  So, who is the puppet master?  I think I know.  They still do not have as much power and control as they like.  Look at Brexit and the TPP.  The outcomes of both are against their interests, so they are not as powerful as they want to be.  You saw the video of the Dutch banker?  If not, I can provide you a link.

      <p>
       Yes, I am aware.  The Luciferian Illuminati.  I think that sometimes their arrogance trips them up.  Trump was supposed to be a joke, and they never imagined he would actually win the election.  Back in the primaries, there were several prominent Republicans that said they would vote for Hillary if Trump was the Republican nominee.  I believe they said this because they are associated with the Council on Foreign Relations and so is Hillary.  Trump is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think TPTB are trillionaires.  The billionaire class are mere pawns.  They do the dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall that there is a bill in Congress to audit the Fed.  We will see where that goes.  If Congress passes it, but Trump vetoes it, then we will know for sure.

       To counter the first point, could Obama gotten anything off the ground with the massive media backlash that Trump is getting?

       The Obama stuff died out pretty quick after the inauguration, besides the birthers.

       Actually communism has been destroyed by despots who don't leave power after. Venezula's problem's are a capitalist construct.

      <p>
       They decided that they are bigger than Texas and have massive oil reserves to sell off. Naturally that's America's territory. So destroy their economy and blame it on communism again.

       Such a limited view of what communism can actually be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see even from Marx, the technology just isn't there yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to replace what I call the "lower class" not as inferior but the bottom of a pyramid, of farmers and food producers by robots or highly automated factories. Which they are doing right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can have a half communism/half capitalism like Marx said would happen which then leads to full on communism because the human workers will be obsolete.

       You missed the point completely, it does not need to be pro-Trump. It just need to not all be anti-Trump, pro MSM. There are plenty of subs where that is the case and this sub never used to be that way until 3/4 months ago.

       I don't get it, the MSM apologists/advocastes have been relatively quiet the last several days. 2 weeks ago, sure I would see your point, but we seem to be doing alright right this second.

       I dunno, maybe I have just become inured to their presence? Pretty sure the sub has been highly readable last few days though. And I am able to read the entire sub multiple times in a day again. The volume of posts is way down.

       What pushed me over the edge was the amount of people defending CNN even though it is the most obvious piece of liberal propaganda this country has ever seen. Even in the face of cold hard evidence there is still so much brigading. How does one not lose hope?

       The sooner you learn none of the people in power are divided, the better you'll be.  They all work together.  The division is a smokescreen.  The concept of one side or another is an illusion meant to keep us, the cattle, from actually working together for the greater good of humanity.

       Everything from 9/11 to JFK to the moon landing is questioned here.  Nobody puts a lot of stock in the MSM official story for those events either.  Rejecting the official (MSM) narrative is one of the few consistent themes here.  You're kidding yourself if you claim not to see that.
