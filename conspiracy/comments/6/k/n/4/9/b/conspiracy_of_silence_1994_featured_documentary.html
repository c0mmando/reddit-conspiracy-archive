<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy of Silence is a documentary which was originally listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, and was to be aired on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994.</p>

<p>This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada.</p>

<p>At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.</p>

<p>A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to those who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6kbetr/what_documentary_should_we_feature_on_rconspiracy/">participated in the documentary vote thread</a>, and to <a href="/u/ArchonFall4All">/u/ArchonFall4All</a> for the suggestion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are totallyright about this. Liberals never discuss the franklin scandal as a political cover-up, though, for some reason. If only more liberals would see this doc and see that Republicans are JUST AS GUILTY, then maybe more liberals would start fighting in the cause against this. We need all people of all political persuasions to fight this shit. Sadly a lot of liberals do not trust alternative sources of info because they come from largely conservative operations. I am a staunch traditionalist, but still we need friends from the progressive side of the isle to fight this stuff too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. It&#39;s very clear that powerful forces are behind this and they are fully capable of eliminating any threats towards its exposure. A person&#39;s life, regardless who that person is, means nothing compared to their desire to keep this a secret from the public. They obviously don&#39;t like anybody anywhere talking about it, but they also have the means of destroying the credibility of any venue that dispenses this information. The fact that it is only widely discussed in conspiracy forums and fringe media is probably considered a reasonable comprimise. </p>

<p>I was discussing this &quot;death to the messenger&quot; topic recently in another thread about Stanley Kubrick recently. The famed director may have been trying to expose this world of elite depravity in his final film &quot;eyes wide shut.&quot; Four days after his  first screening he died in his sleep and the movie was recut. Exposing this topic to the world is one of the most dangerous things you could possibly pursue in this life. </p>

<p>Here are some links discussing the franklin scandal, the Dutroux affair, the finders case, and Iran Contra. The warning for ISGP is just for some disturbing content in the article, but it is one of the more important sites listed as the whole site is a treasure trove of info about the deep state and elite pedophilia. I do not always agree with the guy, but he has great info. Also Wikispooks is another wonderful source of info for all of this stuff. I highly suggest checking their website out.</p>
