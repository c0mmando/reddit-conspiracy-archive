        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have seen quite a few articles in the MSM recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/27/homeopathic-products-should-not-be-sold-in-pharmacies-review">such as this one</a>, as well as several threads on reddit about homeopathy. The tone and wording used in the comment section to talk about homeopathy reminds very much of that used in the comment section related to a shared article about vaccines. It involves lots of insults and sarcasm towards people who believe in and consume homeopathy products.</p>

<p>Now, I am neither for or against homeopathy. I vaguely heard about it. I have never consumed it and I have absolutely no idea how effective/good it is, or what it is made of.</p>

<p>However, all this MSM and social media bashing tickled my curiosity. I mean, I have never seen such bashing about acupuncture/herbal medicine, although those don&#39;t qualify as &quot;modern medicine&quot;. Or, I don&#39;t know, no MSM is pushing for the ban of soda at the food store, although soda is not food and has no nutritional value (and is not even properly labeled).</p>

<p>Why would the system want to ban the sale of homeopathic products in pharmacies, or ban it entirely ? If there is a market for it, and if it is properly labeled, I don&#39;t see the problem. I mean, if you don&#39;t like homeopathy, then you don&#39;t buy it. You buy the stuff from bayer or gsk if that&#39;s where your faith is, and you shut your mouth. Beside, there is lots of ineffective crap sold in pharmacies (such as those cough syrups), that still fill the pharmacy&#39;s shelves. No one is asking to ban the sale of all these ineffective &quot;medicine&quot;. Also, my local pharmacy sells whey protein, creatine, shampoo, even candies (believe it or not), and tons of vitamin supplements, which many doctors say are a waste of money. None of this is medicine, yet it is for sale at the pharmacy.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist in me thinks homeopathy may actually be effective and is being demonized by big pharma and its shill army as a consequence. And so, it may be worth learning what it actually is.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your opinion ? Have you used homeopathy ? Did it work for you ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>Homeopathy states that dilution can be to an extent where there&#39;s no longer any molecules present of the original element - Like Whale piss in my water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homeopathy claims that dilutions to extreme levels can have a medicinal effect - Even if the level of dilution is beyond Avogadro&#39;s number. </p>

<p>So when I drink water, there&#39;s a possibility it may have come in contact with whale piss at some point - But you&#39;ll never know. Because even if there&#39;s no whale piss molecules present, that doesn&#39;t mean homeopathy isn&#39;t still in play. </p>

<p>This is true but it doesn&#39;t prove water memory is real. It is one of the chemical properties of water. But the dissolved minerals can be measured. The idea that water holds the &quot;memory&quot; of something that used to be there is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe that is a correct description of the purported functions and mechanisms in homeopathy? It seems a little biased. Even as someone who doesn&#39;t use homeopathy there is no reason to denigrate peoples beliefs or knowledge, or misrepresent the stated outline. (If it actually works for some  people - they would know by using it - they then know it works for them.) If you are simply adversed to it for beliefs you are choosing to believe something.</p>

<p>Plenty examples of legal pharmaceutical medication <em>not working</em> in fact, harming people. Yet there is a silence when applying the same rationale. All because &quot;experts&quot;, &quot;science&quot; and &quot;studies&quot;. Which is an appeal to authority fallacy.</p>

<p>Note the same companies are constantly being charged with criminal fines for fraudulent data. Yet the <em>beliefs</em> are treated as infallible. </p>

<p>A study proved (or supported) water memory but was later &quot;debunked&quot; by James Randi (who had complete control over the experimental materials). A magician who worked with CIA/Mossad operatives purposely attacking anything outside of establishment narratives. Nothing strange about that at all.</p>

<p>Note: The idea that people are flushing contraceptives down the drain is absurd. Previous research unequivocally stated that drugs were being found in water supply which were introduced by urination. Even if we assumed they were being flushed, the water supply is so large in respect to the amount of drugs in them, what then is the mechanism for the very few &quot;molecules&quot; having a wide impact across an entire range of wildlife(?)</p>

Failure to fold into native structure generally produces inactive proteins, but in some instances misfolded proteins have modified or toxic functionality. Several neurodegenerative and other diseases are believed to result from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils formed by misfolded proteins.[5] Many allergies are caused by incorrect folding of some proteins, because the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures.[6]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment gave me cancer. If you take more protein than your body needs, it gets peed out. Thats why bodybuilders and others in need of protein ( recovering muscles from broken things and so on) like to take more than really needed because there is no real overdose. </p>

<p>You ask why there are protein supps in the pharmacy? Because there is a market. </p>

<p>Why is homepathy products in an pharmacy... because there is an market... </p>

<p>Why MSM pushing homeopathy as bad is no conspiracy... some guys make millions by fooling millions that it is working, but it does not. 
The real reason why ppl need to get that info is simple.. ppl thinking homeopathy works and therefore postpone to see a real doctor ( studying for years and years instead of a weekend crash course in Alabama) and when they finally do, sometimes it is a little too late. </p>

<p>Where I live, we have a saying: you only vaccinate the children that you wanna keep. Same goes for any sort of homeopathy. </p>

<p>just my 2 cents </p>

<p>And no study has been able to prove the homeopathic treatments are any more effective than a placebo.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting article  - Reuters - December, 2013:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-antidepressant-idUSTRE7BK1ZU20111221">Antidepressant, talk therapy fail to beat placebo</a></p>

<p>QUOTES:</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Neither antidepressants nor &quot;talk therapy&quot; were able to outperform inactive placebo pills in a new clinical trial on depression treatment -- though there were hints that the effects varied based on people&#39;s sex and race, researchers report.</p>

<p>The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, add to evidence that people receiving &quot;real&quot; depression treatment in studies -- from antidepressants to St. John&#39;s wort -- often do no better than people given a placebo.</p>

<p>A recent review found that a minority of antidepressant users even fared worse than placebo users.</p>

<p>In this latest study, researchers randomly assigned 156 depression patients to either take the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft and other brands) daily for 16 weeks; undergo a form of psychotherapy called supportive-expressive therapy (twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for 12 weeks); or be in a placebo group given inactive pills.</p>

<p><strong>After 16 weeks, there were no overall differences in how the three groups fared.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>More at the link.</p>

<p>Of course pharmaceutical antidepressants do offer patients something that placebos fail at providing - SIDE EFFECTS - which in the case of some of these can be utterly horrific - especially when patients try to QUIT after using them for some time. </p>

<p>Weaning off of some of these drugs can take MONTHS, and even then, patients often have to take weeks off of work due to their inability to function.</p>

<p>When the users of Heroin or other opiates experience such trauma, doctors say the are suffering <strong><em>&quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot;</em></strong>... but that is such a NASTY phrase - loaded with negative connotations - so when antidepressant users suffer similarly, doctors call it <strong><em>&quot;Discontinuation Syndrome&quot;</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Has a much nicer ring, don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending the pharmaceutical industry. If the discussion is corruption in the pharmaceutical industry than I am in full agreement. I have a major mental disorder (schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder) and have been through the medication song and dance for several years. There&#39;s plenty of over-priced and ineffective medication out there *cough* Abilify *cough* that&#39;s pushed by these corporations, over-prescribed and heaped on unsuspecting patients by an equally corrupt medical industry. It&#39;s called an &quot;industry&quot; for a reason. The goal is to make money, not help people. I&#39;ve lived through this first hand. It&#39;s fucked up. But I can also tell you first hand that not all medication is ineffective. Some of it works. And I&#39;m not in any way making the argument that natural cures don&#39;t exist. They exist. There&#39;s no shortage of naturally occurring compounds that are scientifically proven to be effective. But we need to base our reasoning on the effectiveness of any treatment on facts, not hyperbole. Homeopathic treatments never work. They can&#39;t. It&#39;s pseudoscience. It&#39;s just a placebo effect. You could just meditate or use positive affirmation and statistically it will be equally as effective, if not more so, and it&#39;s free. The pharmaceutical is greedy and corrupt but homeopathic practitioners are just charlatans. Modern day snake oil salesman. They sell a bottle of wishful thinking. You can hope and wish for free.</p>

<p>Obviously.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I could list many that not only have a long history of traditional use, but have also been shown to be safe and effective in studies and controlled trials. But there is a PROBLEM with bringing naturally occurring compounds into mainstream use - and that is being able to make medicinal claims: The process of getting ANY product through the bureaucratic gauntlet to achieve FDA approval takes YEARS, and can cost BILLIONS - and this must be paid for by those who seek approval, and sadly, no one is going to invest the time and money required unless they can PATENT the product with the expectation of making significant PROFITS.</p>

<p>There is a reason that drug companies SYNTHESIZE natural compounds - even when the natural products outperform the synthetics: Natural products cannot be PATENTED, synthetics can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But we need to base our reasoning on the effectiveness of any treatment on facts, not hyperbole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How are the benefits of natural products discovered? Who will invest in running them through the bureaucratic processes described above - which is a disincentive? AND you can be certain that IF a natural product threatens the profits of the RX Giants, they will FIGHT YOU every step of the way. </p>

<p>I just have a bug to pick...</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of homeopathic products are not advertised to help allergies, which could very well be an effective use of the centesimal dilution process. I could definitely see how introducing very small amounts of an allergen could help condition the immune system to tolerate it. </p>

<p>Homeopathic treatments claim to cure all types of illnesses and shit(not allergies) with plain water or alcohol containing an imperceptible amount of actual substance in it. They are charging brand name prices for water/alcohol in a fancy bottle with maybe a few molecules of something and claiming it will cure your cold.</p>

<p>It is a pretty well-known fact in healthcare that people react differently to different antidepressants, and it is not surprising at all that some people may have little to no response to them.</p>

<p>Also worth nothing: some of the researchers involved in this study have disclosed receiving funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Maybe this will dispel some of the big pharma nonsense (probably not).</p>

<p>Coconut oil and olive leaf extract aren&#39;t homeopathic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you see, that&#39;s a big part of the problem - most people don&#39;t understand difference between homeopathy and herbal or other types of non-conventional approaches. In their minds, they are all part and parcel of the same theorem. </p>

<p>Regarding Homeopathy, the Wiki article begins as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy"><strong>Homeopathy</strong></a> is a system of alternative medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of <em>like cures like</em> (similia similibus curentur), <em>a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds far fetched, and perhaps it is - god knows the theory has been mercilessly mocked ridiculed by the practitioners and proponents of so-called <em>&quot;normal medicine&quot;</em> in Western societies.</p>

<p>But consider there is mounting compelling evidence that &quot;Like cures like&quot; - at least in the case of some potentially deadly food allergies:</p>

<p>From Science Daily - 2016:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160810104017.htm"><strong>Oral immunotherapy is safe, effective for peanut-allergic preschoolers, study suggests</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Nearly 80 percent of peanut-allergic preschool children successfully incorporated peanut-containing foods into their diets after receiving peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT), a clinical trial has found. Peanut OIT involves eating small, gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein daily. Low-dose and high-dose OIT were safe and equally effective at suppressing allergic immune responses to peanut, investigators found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s right - even those with SEVERE, potentially life-threatening food allergies can potentially be &quot;cured&quot; by ingesting extremely small <em>(almost homeopathic)</em> quantities of the substance, and gradually increasing exposure over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the relevance of that study is. You said it yourself it is in &quot;almost homeopathic&quot; amounts, whatever that means. Therefore the substance is detectable. If homeopathy was backed up by a paper like that I would support it but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything wrong with the theory of &quot;like cures like&quot; the problem comes when you apply that to substances that have been diluted so far you can&#39;t even prove that any of the substance remains. Coincidentally we already have treatment for disease that uses the &quot;like cures like&quot; idea, they&#39;re called vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, vaccination isn&#39;t the same as homeopathy.  Vaccination works by giving the body dead bacterial cells and viruses to promote an immune response to them.  Radiation works by killing the cancer cells by overdosing them with radiation.  That happens to normal cells too, but they do it in such a way, over multiple doses, that the cancer gets the full dose, while the surrounding skin only gets one or 2, so it doesn&#39;t die.  Amphetamines are a stimulant, and they stimulate the part of the brain that helps people concentrate, and calm down.  Also, the does is far lower than you&#39;d take to get high.  Also, homeopathy main problem is the magic water, wherein most homeopathic remedies contain not a molecule of the original active ingredient.  It doesn&#39;t matter if their claim of like cures like if their other claim is that you can magically charge water with the properties of something, and then dilute it ad infinitum and still keep the properties of the original substance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most that is not &quot;pharma approved&quot; doesn&#39;t have much basis in science or is actively deceitful. Because of people that sell fake medicine like this or even &quot;medicine&quot; that could actually hurt people, pharma has control over nearly every medically relevant molecule.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>And its legal for medicinal use in how many states? Why?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because on Nov. 5, 1996, <strong><em>the PEOPLE</em></strong> of the state of California passed a PROPOSITION that would legalize Cannabis for Medicinal Use - in spite of this being in  <strong><em>utter defiance</em></strong> of both State and Federal Law - and they succeeded in having the law enacted in the face of fierce opposition from State and Federal agencies.</p>

<p>Following California&#39;s success, the people of other States exercised THEIR RIGHTS, and followed California&#39;s lead.</p>

<p>Federal legislators and bureaucratic agencies/ regulators such as the DEA and FDA are corrupt, hand have long been little more than puppets  - PRETENDING to act in the &quot;public interest&quot; when in fact they do the bidding of Pharmaceutical Giants and other corporate and similar entities that have a vested interest in maintaining their profit-intensive monopoly on &quot;medications&quot;.</p>

<p>As you MAY have noticed, the Federal Government CONTINUES to peddle their bald-faced lies WRT the medicinal properties of Cannabis <em>(and other Schedule 1&#39;s such as &quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)</em> even though these have PROVEN to offer therapeutic benefits that are, in many cases, virtually &quot;miraculous&quot;.</p>

<p>These benefits were finally brought to light NOT because of any change of heart or clear-headed thinking by government regulators, on the contrary, even STUDYING these drugs was strictly FORBIDDEN under Federal law, and it was only DEFYING Federal Tyranny that brought these blessings to the people.</p>

<p>Once criminalized as a &quot;Demon Weed&quot;, Cannabis has been &quot;normalized&quot;, and is now increasingly accepted as <strong><em>&quot;medicine&quot;</em></strong> by the practitioners of conventional medicine - much to the chagrin of Corporate Mobsters and their lackeys (HELLO JEFF SESSIONS!) </p>

<p>You <strong><em>seem</em></strong> to be implying that this change came about thanks to the &quot;normal channels&quot; of &quot;Medical Science&quot;, followed by a rational response from government entities. IT DID NOT. It came about thanks to the willingness of <strong><em>We The People</em></strong> to take a stand against corruption and tyranny for the sake of our own best interests.</p>

<p>This should serve as an example to ALL of us - that we do NOT need to cower in the face of oppression by corrupt governments that knowingly act against the interests of The People - whether it be depriving us of access to therapeutic alternatives, or spilling the blood of our sons and wasting TRILLIONS of dollars fighting wars that only serve the interests of backstabbing foreign &quot;allies&quot; and Corporate War Pigs.</p>

<p>Any further questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many modern medicines are synthezised, stronger compounds derived from plants. There&#39;s this weird view now that if it wasn&#39;t synthesized in a lab, it can&#39;t possibly be effective medicine. Except it can be. Yes, some remedies are bogus, actual homeopathy is nonsense, but herbal and food remedies often work, are cheaper, and may have fewer or no side effects. What do you think people did for medicine before we had pharmaceuticals? You think medicine didn&#39;t exist until the 20th century?</p>

<p>&quot;Alternative&quot; simply means it&#39;s not pushed by the the high-tech medical establishment. Often, this stuff predates it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about homeopathy is that those who push the stuff tend to make a lot of unsubstantiated, unscientific claims about the products, so they come off as snake oil salesmen. On the other hand, there are lots of well known benefits derived from natural ingredients like herbs and spices that should not be so easily dismissed. Obviously, big pharma would prefer that people rely solely on their products because that&#39;s how they make money, but I believe that the best approach is to be as well informed as possible about both options. It&#39;s important to know the difference between a minor ailment that can be treated with natural substances, and a more serious condition that needs to be treated with pharmaceuticals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chronic diseases can and are treated homeopathically. To understand the process in which homeopathic remedies are made and how it yields such a tremendous healing effect, you have to learn some basic chemistry and physics. Homeopathy is a complete science with well
Documented provings. There are many homeopathic medical universities around the world (England, Russia, Greece, Canada, India ect). These homeopathic physicians treat deep diseases on a daily basis. Suicidal depression, eating disorders, paranoia, rheumatoid arthritis, narcolepsy, the list goes on and on. There are so many documented cases of successful healing and no pharmaceutical medication is administer at any point in the process. You are right that many &#39;homeopathic practitioners&#39; who don&#39;t know what they are doing and haven&#39;t been given the proper training who definitely give
Homeopathy a bad name. Don&#39;t judge homeopathy by a homeopath. The science and teachings are quite brilliant and have a tremendous healing effect when administered properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using my throwaway as I imagine I&#39;ll end up banned on other subreddits for posting here.</p>

<p>Radiation damages cells. The idea of radiotherapy is to target the area of the tumour with radiation and damage cancer cells to the extent that most of the tumour cells die, while minimising the damage to healthy cells. You might end up creating some cancerous cells, but it&#39;s a cost/benefit procedure.</p>

<p>Saying this is a case of &quot;like cures like&quot; is  a bit of anoversimplified here (not to mention &quot;LCL&quot; is just waffle really )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Radiation works by destroying DNA. Cancer cells multiply much faster than normal cells and have little ability to repair damage to their DNA. The damage is then passed on via cell division, and eventually destroys the cells. </p>

<p>Radiation causes cancer in a similar way. It attacks the DNA in normal cells, albeit the damage occurs over a much longer time and the cells are able to repair some of the damage before dividing. Eventually though, a gene that protects against oncogenesis is irreparably damaged, leading to cancerous growth. </p>

<p>Homeopathic solutions are severely diluted, which somehow makes a smaller dose of the active ingredient stronger. Radiation is divided into fractions because the total cumulative dose may be harmful or even fatal if delivered at once.</p>

<p>So yes, the mechanisms of action are similar, but it is not a case of &quot;like cures like.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta think of the long con. What pharma companies want to do is ban sales of <em>all</em> competing non-industrially produced medicines. If they attacked something with more proven efficacy - herbal concentrates or whatnot - they would run into a lot of popular and scientific opposition.</p>

<p>But if they attack homeopathy - which is arguably very easily disputed - they have the highest possibility of enacting an actual ban. And once precedence has been set where one type of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; has been banned, &quot;the ducks will be in a line&quot; for the banning of other competing products.</p>

<p>Before tylenol what did we do? We had a homeopathic remedy that wasn&#39;t as strong but still worked. People would chew certain leaves or drink ground roots of plants that might numb the pain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. A lot of modern medicine is based on natural sources (interesting fact: a lot of chemotherapy drugs are derived from natural sources such as tree bark or flowers). There is a difference between natural and homeopathic. The entire basis of homeopathy is that as a substance becomes more and more diluted, the water &quot;remembers&quot; this and retains that substance&#39;s effects.</p>

<p>Modern medicine has nothing to do with dilution. Another poster in this thread tried to argue that radiation causes cancer, therefor radiation therapy is homeopathic. It has nothing to do with dilution. The total radiation dose is divided into fractions, because otherwise it may be high enough to be fatal or cause severe radiation sickness if delivered at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homeopathy is the idea that taking a small amount of whatever causes a disease and diluting it in a ton of water can cure that disease. I&#39;m sure you can see the problem with this. It&#39;s straight up wrong and completely disproven, and if it&#39;s sold as medicine, that&#39;s false advertising. </p>

<p>On top of that, there are vulnerable, uninformed people that might use homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot; as a replacement for actual medicine, and this can be incredibly harmful to someone trying to treat something life threatening. The worst case scenario of this is if a parent uses homeopathic treatments for a child. The child has no say, and since these treatments don&#39;t work, the problem will get worse until he or she gets actual medical treatment. </p>

<p>Homeopathy is demonized because it&#39;s evil. It&#39;s wrong to sell what&#39;s essentially just water as medicine, and for a lot more than it costs to make. Other kinds of alternative medicine might be a different story, but homeopathy is complete bs. </p>

<p>This is the biggest problem with homeopathy, and alternative medicine in general. It preys on the uninformed and can delay proper care, which can have devastating consequences.</p>

I have had homeopaths try to explain what is really going on and I&#39;ve tried to get behind it. I even went to one a few times. Took my sugar pills from the nature store.  Not much changed. 
Any homeopaths want to explain it to us?

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I&#39;m not a doc, no matter how many times people say I should be one, but here&#39;s my opinion. I&#39;ve actually been harmed more by modern medicine than by alternative medicine, still, there are quacks and snake oil salesman on both sides and we should be aware of that. Why is it only alternative medicine seen this way? It would be nice to see them both come together more because I believe in both. I think in some cases where pharmaceuticals have a large amount of side effects, alternative medicine should be tried first Instead of synthetic hormones for examples (when possible). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been chronically ill for 15 years, bedridden mostly and I had to be my own advocate to get anywhere. Needed to do my own research, find the right doctor willing to work with me and run all the tests I asked for. I was ruling things out one by one because I knew there was a cause, I trusted my body. Most doctors would say things to me like, &quot;Stop looking, some times there is no answer.&quot; At first they said I was depressed and that I had this and that and loaded me up on meds. No plan on trying to figure anything out, easier and more profitable just to treat with profitable medication. One doctor actually dropped me for looking into other specialists and alternative doctors. He thought I was anorexic and dressed in black (it was an invader zim shirt come on) because I was depressed, that&#39;s what he wrote in his notes. I couldn&#39;t eat because I was sick with stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. But they were wrong, it took years but I found some diagnoses, the problem was, they were all idiopathic idk blank diagnoses. I did the whole, &quot;Oh you just have to deal with it&quot; thing for awhile but then I figured, I didn&#39;t have chronic fatigue, gastroparesis, IBS, SVT, POTS, upright back pain, headaches, brain fog, vascular symptoms and fibromyalgia, etc at a young age for no reason. There has to be a reason and if there&#39;s no cure whatever I find, so be it. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t blame people for running to alternative when it&#39;s hard to get western medicine to help for real. Oh and the cost and lack of insurance... I was turning purple for years and they still didn&#39;t care until I found a podiatrist that said, &quot;Um this isn&#39;t right...&quot; I still see him today. I know of conditions that doctors haven&#39;t even heard of because of all the things I&#39;ve ruled out. Example, Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma can be misdiagnosed as panic attacks. I had that ruled out because my adrenaline levels were 4 times the upper limit but who thinks to run the tests instead of jumping on the zanac and beta blockers? I realized that it couldn&#39;t be pheo though because the tumor couldn&#39;t be found, it didn&#39;t feel right, and I got the feeling that the adrenaline could be from my body just stressing from all the bullshit my body had to put up with. I was right somehow but had a lot of help on the way. </p>

<p>Turns out it all stemmed from a bad spine and a low sitting diaphragm, I found out I had more than one thing and all apparently rare but I highly doubt they are as rare as they say and are just under diagnosed. Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS, a vascular and nerve compression in the stomach, multiple false negative tests until I sent my scans across the country to an expert), May-Thurner Syndrome (Similar to MALS, it&#39;s a vascular compression in the illiac vein), and a Spontaneous CSF Leak (causes upright fatigue, headaches, confusion and often misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue, pots, fibromyalgia, and chiari malformation.) Putting it very simply, bad spine = multiple vascular compressions and a csf leak all masked by idiopathic blank diagnoses I&#39;ve listed that most doctors do little about. </p>

<p>All of which are treatable with procedures, not meds. I&#39;m half way treated and it&#39;s changed my life already. Hoping to get off disability soon once I&#39;m fully treated and recover. I want my life back, I want to work but most doctors seem okay with me living a poor quality of life on little money and pain meds when my meds cost way beyond what I&#39;m given. Without help I&#39;d be screwed. Heck, I&#39;ve been screwed over a lot but I kept at it so if you&#39;re in a situation, don&#39;t give up. I&#39;ve had a vascular surgeon drop me because I was talking that I might have a vascular compression in my stomach. He scoffed at me! He was wrong, I was right. What&#39;s worrisome is that there are many patients basically having to rule things out on their own because their doctors won&#39;t. Docs like the more easy cases also so maybe they&#39;re not so bad, they just don&#39;t want to deal. </p>

<p>There are limits to what alternative medicine can do but it has helped me recover faster while modern medicine has taken care of the surgeries. I receive acupuncture for free because my acupuncturist offers it to those who are really sick but cannot afford treatment. He has never asked for anything in return. He has also warned me against fake acupuncturists. Before my surgeries it could only do so much but it has helped my body heal that I can tell and it took me awhile to believe, I just went with it for my mom. At first I thought it wasn&#39;t doing anything, it took 6 months of going weekly to benefit in the long term. You can&#39;t go just once and be done with it, it may only help temporarily or you may actually feel worse for the first time. I heard that the Mayo Clinic was working with acupuncture too so it must be worth something. </p>

<p>Other things I do, I take chlorella, chaga extract, and tart cherry juice, it&#39;s alternative yet it worked better than the stomach meds my GI gave me. I do not knock either side though because I rely on them both. I take both pharmaceuticals (although I try to keep it low) and alternative medications. I would be off even more if I could use cannabis oil but even after legalizing it in Florida, it&#39;s almost impossible to get it legally. The ultimate goal is to get off everything eventually. Western medicine has its worth and could offer us so much more but the system and closed minded egotistical doctors doesn&#39;t allow it. Not all doctors are bad with an ego, the system its self makes it hard on doctors as well. Pretty sure there&#39;s a TedTalk about that somewhere. Doctors need help too. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I am currently in physical therapy which I started after my first major open surgery and I got really lucky that my PTs are also into interesting alternative methods. They use something called Myofasical Release Massage and Cranial Sacral Therapy. I highly recommend it (as long as you research it), every time I walk out my heart rate is much lower and my pain better, same with acupuncture. But we shouldn&#39;t take alternative lightly, those therapies can make you sleepy and they suggest you drink a lot of water after. I wish I could share more but this is already too long. </p>

<p>Not to mention how potent alternative medication can be when it&#39;s not snake oil and that can be dangerous when not taken seriously. I would be far worst from where I am now had I not realized I needed both. I think it&#39;s important we change the system and bring patients closer to their doctors and alternative means (that actually work), working together with open minds. But that&#39;s just me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a sad, paranoid view on life. Do you trust any expert in any field at all? Do you really think every single person who is greatly knowledgeable in any subject is that corrupt?</p>

<p>Modern medicine is not perfect. Pharmaceutical companies are companies that exist to create profits. Yet medications are withdrawn from testing or even from the market if they are shown to be harmful. </p>

<p>For how much you keep arguing for homeopathy, you seem to have very little understanding of how it “works.”</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;ve contested so far is your use of &quot;water holds minerals&quot; as evidence that water memory is a real thing.
