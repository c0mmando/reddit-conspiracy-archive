       Logically we could also deduce it may be a natural phenomena and this is meant as a cover story. However, it does say the sat is only temporary. Will have to wait and see.

       There is not ONE SINGLE picture of a 'cube-sat with large pyramid-shaped reflector'
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of articles. Yet there isn't a single piece of photographic evidence that would incline me to believe they actually built this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before it goes into space, and you tell me a bright light is this pyramid satellite. Remember you have no idea what you are actually looking for, as you have not seen it for yourself. Nor do we have any actual evidence of it's existence.

       Because a covert operations group could never manufacture a cover story that students are developing a

       satellite launch.

       It was published $20 Million for a passenger ride on Soyuz. What do you think a payload costs? Not hard to engineer a feel good student story.

       Sure they could, I'm not disputing that. What is the point of it though? They could just as easily do it in secret, without tipping of the "go getters" of this sub and places like it.

       I don't know what the payload cost. I'm sure you could email Moscow Polytechnic and find out very easily.

       Flat Earthers not attempting a crowd funding campaign actually surprises me now that you mention it, but of course they would find payload space for it.

       Fair enough, the NRO isn't. I don't know if there are companies that offer science organisations the means to get their satellite or experiment into space and I can't be bothered looking into it. Maybe SpaceX will be the first one.

       There was a very long response to this but its probably not suitable for this forum without causing a big slide or nuking the thread. In summary, the intelligence services and military and shadow brokers have a very long history. In some sense its very perversive in others its very mundane. It's everywhere and nowhere. Private and public companies are wings of power groups (Alphabet INC for instance, its in the name) and nearly any mundane thing might have a much deeper story to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If its publicized, its being released for a reason. Either to create a narrative, to send clandestine messages to other groups, to socially engineer people (psy ops) or distract, or something. All information has purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realize we live in causal reality you realize that literally everything is connected. A cliche but an accurate one. Believing or applying in interpretation without context or insight would make someone seriously paranoid. With context its more of a realization that things are like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       One way to look at it anyway.

       Nibiru is a meme. There could be space objects of all kinds cloaked or otherwise in space or other dimensions (if you believe mainstream narrative you must account for the type II-V civilizations which could accomplish this). Still, Nibiru in the Sumerian myths from what I can tell is another realm (dimension) or possibly something located in another realm or even a ship depending on how you interpret it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "debunkers" of Stichin use some really mental-bending to try and prove him wrong, which is evident if you closer scrutinized their scrutiny. However some of his stuff really seems to stretch the narrative to fit whatever agenda or personal beliefs he had.

        I, the fast runner, summoned my strength and, to prove my speed, my heart prompted me

        as if it were only the distance of a double-hour.

        </strong>
        The north wind and the south wind howled at each other. Lightning together with the seven winds vied with each other in the heavens.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Notice in this one the narrative is talking about returning to Nibru and there were storms that came down at the same time. Anyone who's investigated dimensional portals should find that interesting. Note when the King reached Nibru:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I drank beer in the palace founded by An with my brother and companion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another interesting note in the official translations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Suen put in order the food offerings and, after he had taken them to Nibru
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They brought food stores to Nibru.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        . Let the magilum boats of Meluḫa transport gold and silver and bring them to Nibru for Enlil, king of all the lands."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They brought gold and silver to Nibru.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will note that official translations translate Nibiru as a shrine, but in other contexts its a city, and some its a
       <em>
        place
       </em>
       or moving place.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        den-lil2-le iri-ni eš3 nibruki-a a-nir ba-ab-ĝar
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is translated as Enlil lamenting in
       <em>
        shrine
       </em>
       Nibiru.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is Mother Nin-Lil lady of the Ki-Ur shrine. But there is no descriptive verb denoting it a shrine in the Nibru text.
      </p>
      <p>
       ama dnin-lil2 nin ki-ur3-ra-ke4 er2 gig mu-un-še8-še8
      </p>
      <p>
       Temples have a modifier "ra" or "ra-ke" but that modifier is not used for Nibru. Not in many of the texts at least. So Nibru being a shrine is simply translators deciding that and adding their interpretation.

       Interesting. One caveat found in prophecies if one subscribes to the
       <em>
        Overlord
       </em>
       hypothesis or
       <em>
        Controlling Religious Influence
       </em>
       is that if these powers exist they also exist to modify or create prophecy and will attempt to make them self fulfilling. If they created it, and those who believe it oppose them, they are simply falling into the Controllers trap. Food for thought.

       Not sure about the 2012 but it states the destroyer is not star/nibiru or whatever so not sure where sites get that from.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Doomshape, called the Destroyer, in Egypt, was seen in all the lands whereabouts. In colour it was bright and fiery, in appearance changing and unstable. It twisted about itself like a coil, like water bubbling into a pool from an underground supply, and all men agree it was a most fearsome sight. It was not a great comet or a loosened star, being more like a fiery body of flame. 
Its movements on high were slow, below it swirled in the manner of smoke and it remained close to the sun
whose face it hid. There was a bloody redness about it, which changed as it passed along its course."
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like these I think.

       Mayak was designed and built by students from Moscow Polytechnic. It's housed inside a standard 3U CubeSat, meaning it measures 340.5 x 100 x 100 mm (13.4 x 3.9 x 3.9 in) and weighs about 3.6 kg (7.9 lb). That little package contains a power source, control system, and most notably, a set of solar reflectors that will unfurl in orbit, giving the spacecraft its characteristic sheen.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Mayak's makers have a few goals in mind. As a student project that relied heavily on crowdfunding, it's designed to show that space is accessible to small scientific teams, much like many CubeSats. Once it's up there, Mayak's brightness will be used to study how best to calculate the apparent magnitude of small spacecraft, and at the end of its run, an aerodynamic braking device will be deployed, testing a new system to halt the satellite's orbit and "dispose" of it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mayak is due for launch aboard a Soyuz-2.1a rocket on July 14.

       Just because they "crowd funded" it publicly does not mean the people involved are even behind the project.

       I could easily hire or use young people to promote publicly an operation like this while it was backed by shadow money and interests. Don't believe everything you see on the news. In other words.

       I think thats an angle worth investigating. There's also a lot of pyramids in Russia.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OokfuNA5y0">

      <p>
       With all the psyops, misinterpretations and disinformation people are very confused as to who represents what symbols or structures. The subjective views can be convincing so long as they do not stand up to any other. e.g. the idea pyramids are evil and represent the pyramid structure of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without going too heavily into metaphysics, it's worth noting that plenty of people have investigated Pyramids for various types of energies, some claiming they found them. Resonance is interesting and the pyramids in Egypt resonate to certain frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what pyramids are revered around the world and exist within multiple civilizations so there is something to that structure. It seems to have many meanings across different beliefs.

       Timeout. This is the problem. They tell us they are sending something up there, but all they show you is an artist's rendition. Where is the actual Pyramid satellite? Like an actual picture of it right now, before it goes up.
      </p>

       So far, I've found a dozen articles relating to this, and not one single picture of the satellite. Is that too much to ask?
