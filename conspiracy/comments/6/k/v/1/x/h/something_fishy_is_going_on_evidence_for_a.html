        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">266</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-07-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zunh.html">Zunh</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post argues a simple idea: that something fishy is going on.</p>

<p>By &quot;fishy&quot; I mean that the fundamental truth behind our physical and social realities is not what is obvious or apparent. That is to say, there is a meta-conspiracy, meaning I do not know what the actual conspiracy is, but whatever the truth is it is either not obvious at all or is being hidden from us.</p>

<p>While misinformation and dead-ends make it difficult to find a cohesive, holistic theory, the suspiciousness of it all remains. There are too many loose ends.</p>

<p>Whatever accounts for the mysteries outlined in this post is something beyond the unsatisfying answers spoon-fed to us by the TPTB.</p>

<p><strong>DMT</strong></p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gol5sPM073k">Jordan Peterson - The Mystery of DMT and Psilocybin</a> for a short intro to the unexplainable and mind-blowing nature of DMT and Psilocybin.</p>

<p>The incredible experiences reported by DMT users cannot be hand-waved away, and there does not exist satisfying scientific-materialistic theory for these experiences. </p>

<p>Then we have the stifling of DMT research along with it&#39;s illegality around the world. Why does the scientific community for the most part ignore DMT? Why is it banned in so many countries? </p>

<p>This beautiful mystery sits right in front of us. It&#39;s a not a secret base in the ocean, it&#39;s not a portal in antarctica, it&#39;s right fucking there. Anyone can take DMT. Anyone can see it for themselves. And yet the truth remains hidden and our governments actively prevent research.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Dreams</strong></p>

<p>I think dreams are a big clue into the nature of reality, but occur so commonly that we forget how incredible they are. </p>

<p>Consider if you were an outsider, not yet born, and were described what earth was like: the ecology and biology of plants and animals, all the science behind mother nature, etc. Once you knew all this - would you be able predict that all mammals dream? Is it all obvious? Of course not, which is why no scientific 
 theory predicts dreaming. All science has given us is after-the-fact explanations.</p>

<p>So what is the answer? How come every night our consciousness dies a sort of death, we perceive a new reality, and then several hours later our normal consciousness returns?</p>

<p>Then we have to consider group dreaming. Entire villages have woken up having all had the same very specific dream. Google &quot;collective dreaming&quot;, &quot;group dreaming&quot;, or &quot;shared dreams&quot; to find more on group dreaming. There are numerous credible cases you can look into.</p>

<p>There is also some evidence that dreams foreshadow events. People will laugh at this, until they&#39;ve had it themselves. They experience a very specific and hyper-real dream, see it acted out in real life, and <em>just know</em>. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Near-death Experiences</strong></p>

<p>Like DMT, near-death experiences are largely ignored by the scientific community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The medical community has been reluctant to address the phenomenon of NDEs, and grant money for research has been scarce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Research">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Research</a></p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem odd to you that one of the most remarkable experiences which is reported by millions of people worldwide and throughout history is largely ignored?</p>

<p>Why would this be? Has science already have it figured out? Am I making much ado about nothing?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at wikipedia again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neuroscience research suggests that an NDE is a subjective phenomenon resulting from &quot;disturbed bodily multisensory integration&quot; that occurs during life-threatening events</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that sound like an answer to you? </p>

<p>Is &quot;disturbed bodily multisensory integration&quot; at all satisfying? </p>

<p>The truth is that nobody really knows what near-death experiences are. What we do have are thousands and thousands of personal accounts of what are in most cases irrevocably life-changing experiences. Experiences that are reported to feel &quot;more real than real&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>UFOs</strong></p>

<p>Aliens and UFOs are a topic that has trapped many intellectuals. What starts as a curiosity becomes all-consuming, as it becomes apparent the journey for truth on this topic is endless. Were it a submarine mission to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean would be bottomless.</p>

<p>Like all topics on this list the answer is not obvious, but there are some facts we can agree on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unknown lights and flying structures have appeared in the sky.</li>
<li>Government explanations for these objects are unsatisfactory, contradictory, and/or non-existent.</li>
<li>Numerous officials and whistleblowers have come forward with explanations for UFOs/aliens. As a group, their answers are also contradictory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if we accept the simplest explanation, it would still mean our governments are lying to us, that secret technology exists, and that among us there exist hidden groups with hidden motives.</p>

<p>In short, something fishy is going on. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Music</strong></p>

<p>I believe music is evidence for some sort of spirituality in humans.</p>

<p>The fact that sounds make us feel emotions is so inconceivably bizarre I have to wonder why it is not brought up more in subreddits like this.</p>

<p>Most animals have sight. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. The survival benefit is obvious. The benefit to music is not obvious. Google &quot;evolutionary explanation music&quot; and what you&#39;ll find are dozens of guesswork explanations. We don&#39;t know why music has the multitude of effects it does. </p>

<p>It would make more sense if music wasn&#39;t a thing. It would make more sense if humans throughout history did not spend countless hours practicing an activity that has no obvious survival benefit. And even if music should exist, why is the experience transcendent? We enjoy candy without feeling like we are moved to a higher place. Why should music be any different? Music moves us in a way in should not be able to. It&#39;s fishy as fuck.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The technology curve</strong></p>

<p>This is an original argument, which I will briefly outline here. I saved it for last because it is difficult to explain.</p>

<p>In short, the laws of this universe, along with our place in it, are to our benefit far beyond what is required for our existence.</p>

<p>If we are to exist, the laws of physics must be constrained to allow the sun, planets, biology, natural evolution, etc to be possible. That is a given. Likewise, the earth requires certain features for the possibility of our evolution. We need a specific temperature range, access to food, water, and to materials and environments sufficient for our evolution, just to name a few.</p>

<p>But why should any technological advancement beyond this be possible? Why are the laws of physics and the materials available on this earth such that it is possible to build and fly an airplane? I can conceive of a universe where air density works slightly different, making flight impossible. But yet here we are. </p>

<p>Flight is just one example. We can ask the same for most modern technology: cars, skyscrapers, bridges, phones, satellites, submarines, boats, the internet.</p>

<p>Imagine a universe where we invent the internet, turn it on, but laws of physics are such that moving information through copper (or any other material) is an order of magnitude slower. In this case, a large portion of internet activity becomes impossible. But this didn&#39;t happen, did it?</p>

<p>It appears to me that nearly all technology that humans could possible want just so happens to be attainable. Okay, so not instant teleportation, and not perfect medicine. But for the most part, everything that can be imagined has turned out to be possible.</p>

<p>The earth just happens to have billions of gallons of oil which is perfect for combustion. And oh look, silicon makes for great CPUs and it just so happens to be the most abundant compound in the earth&#39;s crust. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if a technological path has been prepared for humans, laid out for us to discover like a tech-tree in a video game. We explore the mountains, then the oceans, then the sky, and oh look - a moon closeby for our first step into space exploration.</p>

<p>Why were we not forever doomed to live as apes? </p>

<p>I put some mathematical constants and equations in this category also. As you alluded to, if some of these constants were off by even a small amount, stars would not form and therefore life wouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ask someone lime Daniel Dennett, he would argue that the evolutionary process gets applied equally to biological life and technology (and culture for that matter).

But, even more broken down:  Reality is composed of language and information, possibly also <em>intrinsic</em> intentionality, and material reality (spacetime) is just a subset.  Time is how we organize our experiences, but (because Reality is information) there are resonances that are created via meaning/association.  </p>

If a proton and a neutron were the size of a basket ball they would be flying around a big ass circle like a mile apart everything else is &quot;empty space&quot; iron is more empty space than it is solid matter.

Put a black piece of paper over a sub woofer and put some sand on it. Slowly adjust the frequency and the sand will form some very intricate shapes at different frequencies.

<p>This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t happen because we invented fiber optics and use those for long distance transmission instead.  Your hypothetical is literally true, and was a real physical limit that had to be worked around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a misunderstanding. Let me restate the argument a different way.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s create a set of all technology that humans might want. Nothing super specific, but in general. It would include items like: perpetual motion machines, instant communication, medicine that makes pain go away, flying, etc.</p>

<p>Now as a thought experiment we generate a random universe, but within the constraints that human evolution must be possible. </p>

<p>We create our universe and humans now evolve on a random planet.</p>

<p>At this point, how many items in our set of desired technologies would you expect to be possible? A few? Most of them? All of them?</p>

<p>Remember, it&#39;s a random planet in a random universe. The only constraint is that human evolution must be possible.</p>

<p>The argument is that we have access to way more items in that set than we would expect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the pattern is, that which empowers the individual is disencouraged legally and socially with large guns and loudspeakers.  </p>

<p>that which is poorly understood, the same.  </p>

<p>the path to truth by definition disregards everything false or misleading or which discourages advances forward.  things like guns pointed at you or idk, laws made by some dude who has no idea what he&#39;s talking about.  like bill hicks talks about, the drug czar has never done any drugs, so he&#39;s unqualified to speak much less enforce laws or write them.  </p>

<p>but the path to truth is dangerous because it disregards things like self-harm, so it&#39;s good advice to treat it like taking dips in a deep mysterious pool, or sticking your arm in someone else&#39;s closet blindly, than it is to jump in head first without even a safety vest or rescue line.  </p>

<p>we are more like lewis and clark, better to go forward slowly than ever have to risk going back.  </p>

<p>there are forces out there now, however, mechanical, nation-states, religious cult nation-states, secret societies, a few eyes of sauron type things, huge piles of money, ancient bloodlines, and things like ultimate euphoria and life after death through science on the line, as well as mind reading and mind control.  </p>

<p>so things have gotten wierd.  i dont plan to be drinking from the firehose, ill be sipping from a cup down the street once i see no one turned into a zombie.  </p>

<p>start thinking about which delivery mechanisms you are attached to, for ideas, for what you put in your body, for how you meet people, for how you consider what is good and bad.  </p>

<p>When you find huge forces pushing in the direction opposite to the values you determine best, start wondering, what could their possible interest be?  </p>

<p>And having watch the news, i personally see a force pushing for human extinction, or for the survival of 2 races in particular, the chinese and israeli zionists, and perhaps some mad bankers.  as in, i see in those particular death cults the potential for the most supreme evil.   dr strangelove would be middle school level shennanigans by comparison to what those two forces might do to the global population in order to be the last ones standing.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding DMT and to some extent dreams too:</p>

<p>One of the reason why so many people report similar experiences when doing any kind of hallucigenic and especially DMT is because when they are tripping they are letting go of their conscious mind or consciousness and &quot;gain access&quot; to their subconsciousness (like we all do when we are dreaming).</p>

<p>Most people that do DMT or any of the &quot;harder&quot; hallucigenics usually won&#39;t do so without reading or hearing about other peoples experiences (Trip-Reports) and once they trip their experience forms around this subconsciously and consciously stored information. 
I&#39;m sure that is why so many people are reporting similar experiences, especially when doing DMT. 
You go into the trip subcounsciously expecting or wanting something to happen and often that is what you get.
Just like when you&#39;re having doubts or are scared of a bad trip, chances are high that you might get one.</p>

<p>I used to love reading trip-reports, especially about dissociative hallucigenics and so often people would mention the same or at least somewhat similar stuff. The machine elves, communicating with or seeing higher beings, the clockwork etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think that &quot;all of this&quot; is at the root based on something &quot;fishy&quot;. I have rather come to believe, that it is based in a somehow flawed definition and understanding of what &quot;technology&quot; really is and constitutes.</p>

<p>I am not yet ready to fully formulate it, but essentially it somehow comes down to the existence of several classes of technology and their interactions. </p>

<p>Each class of technology follows guidelines of intelligent design (in this case it has nothing to do with &quot;intelligent design&quot; religious beliefs), it being either &quot;emergent&quot; out of nature or &quot;non-emergent&quot; out of the human condition.</p>

<p>Like for example in the broadest terms &quot;the human mind&quot; represents one class of technology and &quot;music&quot; is a representative of another class of technology and through their interaction, a new technological complex (what you call spirituality and emotion) is formed, which then generates new effects of its own.</p>

<p>It is not that a technological path has been prepared for mankind (or any other intelligent civilization in this universe), but rather the universe works by some technological propagation principle itself.</p>

Infinity is not interesting, it&#39;s nothing; it&#39;s sickeningly bland and uninteresting. We need limitations to make things interesting.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s perfectly possible for you to experience it. I believe our consciousness expands and contracts like a flower opening and and closing. (as an aside I think that&#39;s why fractals are so commonly experienced during these psychedelic states. Fractals have a non-integer dimensionality. 3.1d, 3.4d. ect. Fractals are our subjective perception of our consciousness flowering up into and through higher dimensions.) When your consciousness is expanded, as it were, I do think we are more fully able to grok things like infinity. And that we can bring some of that knowing back with us.</p>

<p>I would like to say that, thanks to Cantor, we know there are many types of infinity. Infinitely many.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe is binary, there have always been two points. The universe is a vibration, an oscillation between two points, nothing and everything, light and darkness, sound and silence, positive and negative, 1 and 0. </p>

<p>We are experiencing a transition between each point, we were at a peak, billions of years ago, at the big bang, a singularity, everything, the 1. Now, we slowly dissipate back into 0, entropy taking us to an inevitable heat death, and inevitable normalisation, an inevitable nothingness. Once we reach this nothingness, the wave returns, slowly back to the point of singularity, and so it repeats forever, infinitely. </p>

<p>Like a wave, the scale is infinite, zoom out at the largest scale and planets are like atoms, orbiting each other, keep zooming out and they form massive, large complex structures, even conscious entities of life. Zoom out of your current wave and you see all those vibrations you thought were large are just a smaller components of even larger, greater vibrations, and this can continue infinitely. </p>

<p>Zoom in far enough, and the fundamental particles of the universe are like planets, orbiting each other with large space between, and forming complex structures and life. You see that zooming into a peak or trough gives you further vibrations within that line of vibration, that you can keep gettig infinitely smaller. </p>

<p>And life? Life is nothing special nor magical. Entropy wants to take us to heat death, to 0, as quickly and efficiently as possible. Life is an entropic mechanism that speeds up the increase in Entropy of the universe. It is energetically favourable and inevitable and happens everywhere. We are just a method for the universe to revert back to nohingness quicker. </p>

<p>In essence, there is no meaning to life, nor is there hope in survival. We are part of the universes attempt to normalise itsel, just like how electrons must orbit protons, and molecules must react to achieve stable low energy states, life must happen in otder to encourage entropic death. </p>

<p>At least, that&#39;s what smoking DMT at the peak of a 500ug acid trip taught me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>before two (duality = universe) there was One. One splits into two, and two is the basis for all this universe. </p>

<p>Baphometz, the illuminati, all that jazz is trying to turn that Two, back into One. The problem is this is artificial and pointless because those Two are already One in the first place. It stems from the intellect, or ego seeing itself as split from this reality. The illusion of being split from the true One.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet</a></p>

<p>The forces which do this are nicely described by the Baphomet concept... mixing of polarities into one muddy mixture of slop. </p>

<p>The point of the universe is to have polarities because thats what makes it function. If it is all the same thing, it will do nothing. It will be an artificial version of the One. Demi-urge? It is trying to make itself One (a &quot;god&quot;), but in a strange artificial way, and which will end in pointlessness and create lots of suffering on the way which we see.</p>

<p>You can even see it with games these days... older games had high polarity, for example WoW which each class had their distinct spells and abilities, everything was different, and everything had their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Later versions of WoW saw class homogenization which made the classes boring, and it ruined the game pretty much. It is a soul-less version of the older WoW now. Soul-less and empty... boring.. it has no polarity. </p>

<p>You can see this in relationship dynamics. When women and men are at their own polarities (think strong masculine male, gentle feminine woman), relationships are great and everyone is happy. When there is mixing (think feminists and beta-males) neither one wants to mate with each other. It becomes soul-less, empty.. hollow. </p>

<p>Why? Because it is trying to turn Two into One artificially, when in reality everything is already One because the Two came from One. That&#39;s why eastern philosophies, namely Zen says to not defile the Mind by trying to become One... you are already One. Enjoy the awesome polarities of this creative universe, rather than trying to grind it to a halt and turn it into an artificial, false knock-off of One. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our own consciousness is being hidden from us. I have recently unlocked something very large in my own awareness that makes me able to see my real self. And my real self transcends this physical plane.</p>

<p>I am also seeing why the overall control scheme tptb implement through almost all channels of info we receive. It is very symboic in nature and has to do with them trying to control the plane of existence slightly less dense than ours, the astral plane.</p>

<p>This plane, it&#39;s really more like an area of Own Conscious Minds. The astral is another layer of consciousness we are directly connected to. This is our real soul, or spirit, and our connection to our gestalt awareness. A gestalt awareness includes memories and recognition of how vast your own consciousness is.</p>

<p>Tptb, I should say the secret societies and the brotherhood and the illuminati are only enlightened because they hide your own enlightenment from you. They invert it, flip it, twist it and basically show you everything in a way to mock you. It&#39;s an evil trick.</p>

<p>Space is the astral plane. That&#39;s is a major part of the consciousness deception. The whole NASA show is completely opposite of what space is. Space is veil to other dimensions. It&#39;s a reflection of the consciousness of dreaming. When you dream you go to another area of your own consciousness. The idea that that area is actually a Part Of Our Physical  Reality. A subjective area of consciousness is Space.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one deception, NASA, it&#39;s huge. Another is the symbolic way in which they subliminally indoctrinate the masses through art and through an intentionally dumbing down of everyone. </p>

<p>Nobody is taught consciousness. Dreams, inner senses. Perception, and basically any involved with a person&#39;s own self awareness. I see now that&#39;s because they have intentionally not wanted anyone to know who and what we are and why we are here. The reason no one can definitely answer those questions is because They know, and they ain&#39;t telling us.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The incredible experiences reported by DMT users cannot be hand-waved away, and there does not exist satisfying scientific-materialistic theory for these experiences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve spoken to a few neuroscientists who suspect that a lot of those experiences are due to what they call &#39;a loss of scale&#39;. Basically your senses are designed to analyse things on a scale thats relevant to you, to help you in your daily life. You don&#39;t need to view things at the scale of an ant, or a planet, that&#39;s not going to help you stay alive. </p>

<p>But if you give someone something like, say, ketamine? Well they&#39;ll tell you that they just spent half an hour living in the world of the light switch. There was an entire <em>world</em> on that light switch! but the drug wore off and now its gone?</p>

<p>That makes sense though when you consider the scale on things universally. On a scale of planck to universe, we are extremely large. If we were smaller, we&#39;d probably agree that the light switch is indeed a world of its own. So the drug just lets use escape our extremely limited perception for a short while. </p>

<p>But when you start viewing things from such wildly different contexts, the world turns out to be far different from the way you typically view it. Things aren&#39;t really distinct from each other at all. All people, things, objects etc are like variables in a chaotic and dynamic system. They aren&#39;t individual really, they are massively intertwined with all the other variables, interconnected at a fundamental level. In the abscence of the system, they break down. </p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t surprising that people see an interconnected reality... because that&#39;s exactly what reality is, even according to science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then we have the stifling of DMT research along with it&#39;s illegality around the world. Why does the scientific community for the most part ignore DMT? Why is it banned in so many countries? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s illegal for the same reason as all other durgs are illegal: control of power. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course not, which is why no scientific theory predicts dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern neuroscientific thinking <em>does</em> predict dreaming. You can&#39;t turn a brain off (well... you can, it just results in death), so it instead has a default resting mode. Like any system is needs to remain in constant motion, kind of like alpha waves when you rest. The brain just kicks into rest mode until it needs to do something. </p>

<p>But the brain does more than just wait, it has to do a lot of shit, even when sleeping. It continues to process information, which is why sleeping on a problem can actually work, your brain can literally solve problems in its sleep. If consciousness is an emergent phenomenon, then there&#39;s no surprise that a still-active brain results in often fragmented and disjointed conscious experience while asleep. </p>

<p>TL;DR, You can imagine yourself doing things without doing them, when your asleep those mechanisms don&#39;t stop because it&#39;d kill them, therefore you keep experiencing them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem odd to you that one of the most remarkable experiences which is reported by millions of people worldwide and throughout history is largely ignored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. </p>

<p>AFAIK when a person is about to die their brain dumps shit tons of neurochemicals all at once. Some of these chemicals will fuck you up (in a good way hopefully, event DMT occurs endogenously IIRC). When people die, experience the crazy brain dump, then come back, it&#39;s not surprising that they recall some crazy-as-fuck shit... because their brain gave them one mother of a high. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, something fishy is going on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of UFO&#39;s i do agree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that sounds make us feel emotions is so inconceivably bizarre I have to wonder why it is not brought up more in subreddits like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After looking at things like cymatics, or the effect of different frequencies on things like tissue regeneration, I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s shocking at all. Part of my job is studying human brain waves... oscillating frequencies. Considering that the human brain has many mechanisms at play, all involving different frequencies and waveforms, it&#39;s not surprising that sound can effect it. Especially considering we have equipment evolutionarily designed to turn sounds waves into brain signals already (ears). </p>

<p>Frankly, it&#39;d be more shocking if sounds <em>didn&#39;t</em> effect us in someway. </p>

<p>Actually I think sound/frequencies/vibration/resonance is one of the things science needs a lot more of. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were we not forever doomed to live as apes? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Complexity evolves where ever resources allow. </p>

<p>On earth, resources all more complexity. </p>

<p>Therefore, we evolved to this state. </p>

<p>And things are not actually that ideal. The climate changes regularly, we are running out of oil, moving things to orbit is expensive, we are carbon based (which ensures that we age and die), our bodies are fragile and can only percieve a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, the moon is slowly moving away from us and FTL travel may well be impossible. </p>

<p>The most compelling areas for further study:</p>

<p>-The movie &quot;Martyrs&quot;
-Quantum Physics &amp; Psychedelics &amp; black magic
-Mass Communication
-Principles of MK Ultra &amp; False flags
----namely the idea that serial killers are all MK Ultra, and school shootings (Columbine is where the real compelling stuff is--seriously)
-Bohemian Grove/Bilderberg/CFR
---definitely a group of people guiding word events
--the concept of technology as a life force</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dreams do foreshadow events. To give a personal example.... I was having dreams (at 15y/o) that my father would kill my mother and then himself. I kept getting these dreams for weeks even to the point where I would cry and hug my mom but be too afraid to tell her that I was having such morbid dreams. Weeks after these dreams, my father commits suicide. He also left a note that he bumped his head and was trying to avoid hurting us. He had a plan to kill my mom as well. </p>

<p>One more example is when I was 5, I had a dream my dad was having an affair (even though my parents were briefly separated and actually allowed to see other people). In my dream it was a maid. I told my mom, she half-believed me, called my dad to find out....and I was right.  </p>

<p>Dreams 100% foreshadow events. This is not the only examples I have of this. It has always been crazy to me but I never put much thought into it until this post... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I believe that a huge amount of information has been &#39;kept&#39; from the public -- not unlike how the concept of &#39;zero&#39; was a &#39;secret&#39; for centuries</p>

<p>e.g. The physics taught in schools and universities is severely lacking YET it&#39;s taught as gospel!</p>

<p>I have read a lot of scifi which has touched on these ideas but there are three books which stand out in my mind as being <em>so close</em> to The Truth that I can never forget Or ignore what I learned in them</p>

<p>Combined with my personal experiences and IDK wtf to think (well, I do, but it&#39;s not easily explained)</p>

<p>The three books are: Ursula.K.LeGuin&#39;s &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;  --- it&#39;s about &quot;dreams&quot; becoming &#39;real&#39;</p>

<p>It was THE book that got me into scifi -- she is an amazing author</p>

<p>Next is Red/Green/Blue Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson</p>

<p>How the fuck this guy writes about such thinggs is mind blowing! The technology in the series <em>is all currently available</em> but the whole story is SO &#39;precise&#39; that it&#39;s like the guy <em>lived there doing it</em>!</p>

<p>And last BUT <em>far from</em> least, is the most amazing tale by a lady named Doris Lessing called &quot;The Syrian Experiments&quot; -- which cover <em>almost every aspect</em> of the current schools of thought about ET&#39;s and their purpose &#39;here&#39;!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a 5 book series But you only need to read the first two, Shikasta and The Syrian Experiments!</p>

<p>Mind blowing, and ALL of them were written <em>decades before</em> much of these &#39;theories&#39; became mainstream!</p>

<p>check them out, esp you OP, I think you&#39;ll really enjoy them</p>

<p>My experience was mind-blowing for me. I dreamed of 3 kittens. One white. One orange. One mixed white and orange. Following me everywhere. I wake up happy as i love felines in general (not just cats) and the day continues normally until the evening. I come back home, meanwhile climbed stairs. Went to my appartments door. Open it and as i make my way to enter a kitten shows up right besides me. A fucking orange/white mixed fur. I saw no kitten on my way up the stairs. No meows and no neighbour had any lost kitten. It just was there and i froze. A multitude of mixed feelings from deep terror to cheerful joy.</p>

Has honestly happened to me over 8 times, sometimes the dream has happened over 5 years before the event and then when the event is actually happening I just get that weird feeling like &quot;wait a sec, I&#39;ve been here before&quot;, and then remember that exact moment from my dream as it is happening now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music is an easy one 
The way we decode sensory information in the brain is inextricably linked with the amygdala, the region so said for being responsible for emotions. </p>

<p>A great example is our sense of smell. We have all experienced a certain smell reminding us vividly of a memory. This occurs due to the process of percieving chemical particles (odours) interplaying with the hippocampus, a region said to be linked with memories. </p>

<p>Therefore, we could say Music, having a profoud effect on our mood, is another important example of how the processes of sensory interpretation in the brain can be influenced by other regions relating to memory, mood and obviously realms more. </p>
