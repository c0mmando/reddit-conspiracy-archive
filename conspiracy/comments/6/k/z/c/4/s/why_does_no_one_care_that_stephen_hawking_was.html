       The man should be dead... and he most likely is dead. He was pretty obviously replaced by a body double after his death. His teeth, eyes, ears, hair have all changed since the days when he was still producing cutting edge science and all he has really done for the last ~25 years is spew pro-establishment propaganda. Right now he is currently telling the world how President Trump is going to turn our planet into Venus.

       In the same way CNN occasionally brings up corruption. Until society's desires are explicitly demanded from our politicians (arrest the bankers/invest in productive projects) they will only occasionally mention possibilities of them being fulfilled.

       The 1st space elevator link in my comment is obviously outdated. In my opinion they're lying when they say it can be completed within 10 years using that model. This is why I posted a link to Paul Birch's model, which would utilize a kevlar based Orbital Ring, for which carbon nano tubes would not be necessary. If you can find any flaws in his math I'd love to hear it:

       Teeth do change without braces/retainers or cosmetics. My top front teeth were severely turned in as a fourteen year old and my bottom set were perfect. Now at thirty I have a tooth on my bottom set that is crowding its neighbour and my front teeth are nearly straight. Not to mention general wear and tear from 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not difficult to believe someone with a degenerative disease would display a big change in the composition of their teeth.

       I have. So here's some information for you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          Although the life expectancy of a person with ALS averages about two to five years from the time of diagnosis, this disease is variable, and many people can live with the disease for five years and more. More than half of all people with ALS live more than three years after diagnosis.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Once ALS starts, it almost always progresses, eventually taking away the ability to walk, dress, write, speak, swallow, and breathe and shortening the life span. How fast and in what order this occurs is very different from person to person. While the average survival time is 3 years, about twenty percent of people with ALS live five years, 10 percent will survive ten years and five percent will live 20 years or more.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.alsa.org/about-als/facts-you-should-know.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/">
        The source is this wonderful official ALS website
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the first result when you look for ALS life expectancy is often this Scientific American article entitled:
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/">
        How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The TL;DR is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Plus he has a respiration, so he can breathe rather than suffocating like people used to if they had it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All sorted? I guess...

       How about no research my cousin's child has smard. She had no life expectancy whatsoever she's already living way past her years and still going strong. So people do outlive their expectancy all the time, she wasn't meant to live til past three. She's way past that and smard is way more advanced than als it's one of the rarest diseases on the planet. It's that rare there's hardly nothing about it on the internet or Wikipedia. She would of had more chance being hit by lightning once a week for the rest of her life.

       All interesting but doesn't actually advance your argument other than 'sometimes people live'. A position which I acknowledge above. The hawking story is an interesting one and the combination of physical appearance, teeth, tge life expectancy and the theatrical value of him literally being a puppetted mouth piece for 'the estsblishment' as resident "smart guy" all creates an argument which can be considered persuasive - though it's by no means settled, otherwise we wouldn't have this exchange.

       I mean this is true but sadly on the level of deception we are subjected to it probably hardly even registers. Hawking is now nothing more than a puppet, literally a human puppet where his replacement is probably an invalid voiced by unseen controllers to be the unquestionable authority of establishment "science."

       Trump has always been involved in the deep state though (bailed out by the Rothschilds several times and mentored by CIA operatives). It's not like anything's changed with him. I do hope he can pivot against them but not looking too good.

       Valid point about the brain. But that only counts if he's still the original. One of the many things I'd do if I had the time would be to look at what kinda work he did before the date its suggested he is changed and after. If it's the same/fair progression then that'd be a persuasive argument that he's the original. But if it changes in style/profundity then that's dofferent. Part of that would involve a brief analysis of review literature on his work. Has the latter stuff been confirmed or disproved at a similar rate to earlier stuff?
