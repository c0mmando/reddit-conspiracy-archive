       Here are the facts: Trump won the popular vote in 31 states to her 19 and DC. 62% to her 38%. Trump led in the total popular vote for all states except California.
Hillary won California 5,860,714 to Trump’s 3,151,821. 61.6% to 33.1% exclusive of the other candidates. Thus California suspiciously gave Hillary the popular vote for all when included . But deduct her California vote from her national vote leaving her with 54,978,783, and deduct Trump’s California vote from his national total, leaving him with 57,113.976, he wins in a landslide in the other 49 states, 51.3% to her 48.7%.  Trump was elected president of the rest of the country by a substantial margin. 
Trump’s Campaign Manager, Kellyanne Conway, saw this early on and devised her strategy of “6 pathways to the White House”. This meant ignoring California with its huge Democrat vote tally(From previous election) and going after the states that would give him the necessary electoral votes to win, FL, NC, MI, PA, OH, and WI.
Without continuing voter fraud in California could this mean the end of the Democrat Party? When the afternoon of January 20, 2017 arrived, the Republican Party had: 1) The Presidency. 2) A majority of the House of Representatives. 3) A majority of the Senate. 4) Almost two-thirds of all the governorships. 5) Total control of the statehouses in almost two-thirds of all the states. And soon after, Republicans were able to add: 6) A new majority to  the Supreme Court. The above has never happened before in American history.

       California results are  a statistical outlier to the other 49 states due to corruption in voter roles. They have not allowed an official investigation into this anomaly. Criminal democrat leaders are 
covering their criminality by hiding access to their fraudulent voter roles so they don't go to jail.

       They have been hiding thisfor a long time. It shou,d be looked at not because I say so but because it's an indicator of the fraud I believe is wide spread in     the shitty places run by Dems. If there isn't widespread fraud what are all the california dems afraid of?

       As a liberal, I'm not scared of anything. Especially considering every audit performed to date has found no evidence. You on the other hand just keep pulling random nonsense out of your ass and stating it as fact. But you keep telling yourself everyone who disagrees with you is cheating or something.

       No it isn't. D.C. and HI had higher % for Clinton. MA and MD were also above 60%.

       CA is a statistical outlier because of its

        size

       . It's voting pattern hasn't changed much. It did shift several points towards Democrat this election. Nothing terribly significant. You know who else did about the same? Texas.

       In fact, if Texas shifts the same amount next election than it did this one, it'll turn blue.

       This reminds me of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       The American murder/criminality rate is much lower than that of European countries if you don't count inner city gang violence. So if you don't take all the violence/criminality into account the statistic looks much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for having basically total control of all parts of government Trump and the Reps seem like they really have difficulty making their policies like the AHCA or whatever they are calling it now.

       Hey OP, California is a really big state! It's also quite liberal! Two well established facts that make your whole post kind of pointless and unresearched.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also contributes more money to our nation than any other state, so perhaps you shouldn't treat its voters as an afterthought.

       California results are  a statistical outlier to the other 49 states due to corruption in voter roles. They have not allowed an official investigation into this anomaly. Criminal democrat leaders are 
covering their criminality by hiding access to their fraudulent voter roles so they don't go to jail.
