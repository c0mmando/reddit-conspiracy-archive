       I think perpetrators of actual conspiracies (Pearl harbor, JFK, etc) created a stream of misinformation and nonsense (reptilians, fake moon landing, flat Earth) to conspiracy theorists, in order to make them look like fools to the mainstream populace. So now when mentioning actual cover-ups alongside nonsensical theories, those conspiracy theorists seem crazy and unhinged. And that reflects poorly on truth seekers who recognize the both sides.

       Just a theory though.

       Yup. It's called a psy-op

       Iirc UFO and alien conspiracy were created for this reason and most stems to one dude who may have been on government payroll. Even the title 'conspiracy theorist' is ad hominem.

       The UFO/alien false conspiracies were created to discredit actual UFO conspiracies though, not to just make CTs look crazy.

       I thought the reptilian one was a load of shit for a while but there could be some truth to it. From reptiles ruling the earth for so long, there could've been intelligent bipedular beings. There could've been interbreeding between different species using technology. Who knows... but I do agree with what the thread says, there is a couple of fake conspiracies pushed out to discredit all conspiracies.

       Reptiles ruled the Earth for how long? Is it really far fetched to believe there use to be intelligent bipedular reptiles on the planet (and still are?) Bloodlines that have been mixed in with human DNA and passed down from generation to generation.

       Yes, yes it is very far fetched. Turtles? Comon man do you really believe this or is it some edgy thing that you say to seem ingesting while silently chuckling inside.. It's fun to play what if but like I said flat earth from the 90's NOONE really thinks it's possible

       <p>
        How many species of dinosaurs have been discovered?
       </p>
       <p>
        These species are placed in about 300 valid dinosaur genera (Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, etc.), although about 540 have been named. Recent estimates suggest that about 700 to 900 more dinosaur genera may remain to be discovered.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         How old are the dinosaurs?
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          How long did it take for the dinosaurs to become extinct?
         </p>
         <p>
          The first dinosaurs evolved around 230 million years ago, and the non-bird dinosaurs went extinct during the end-Cretaceous event 65 million years ago. So it took 165 million years for the dinosaurs to become extinct. During that time, species were constantly dying out and being replaced by new species.
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>
           Mammals appeared on the earth long before the extinction of the dinosaurs; in fact, dinosaurs and mammals originated within 10 million years of each other, in the late Triassic about 200 million years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our species, Homo sapiens evolves 200 thousand years ago

       Is it really far fetched that an intelligent bipedular reptile? I don't think so. So much time, not much evidence. I think you forget that not every dinosaur fossil is a full body. It's only fractions of bones that they find during a dig. Then there is places like the Vatican and the British Empire whom both went into countries, stole and destroyed information regarding their religions. Who knows what 'evidence' has been covered up through time. I really don't find intelligent bipedular reptiles to be that far fetched.

       There was another recent post on this board about how the 9/11 crowd needs to focus on challenging the existing story instead of proposing a number of positive 'theories' about what actually happened.  I think the real problem has less to do with the conspiracy community at large (if you will) and is closer to what OP is talking about here... the media and popular culture will always elevate kooks and quacks before they give any press to the people who are ripping the official story apart, or just asking dangerous questions.  This is true of more than just 9/11 truth, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in my view it is confirmed fact that the UFO phenomenon became primarily about extraterrestrials and alien space craft in the popular culture because the military wanted to steer people away from the reality of black budget experimental aircraft projects and the like.  Now when people think 'UFO', they think:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        alien abductions
       </li>
       <li>
        grey aliens
       </li>
       <li>
        flying saucers
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and not:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        misappropriation of tax dollars
       </li>
       <li>
        corporate welfare
       </li>
       <li>
        terrifying weapons of war
       </li>
       <li>
        greater and greater surveillance capability of intelligence and military apparatus

       Sure.  I'm not saying that experimental aircraft totally explains the UFO phenomenon (I don't think it does), just pointing out that there are certain lines of questioning which are preferable and acceptable to powerful people, and they are going to be pointing public perception and investigative inquiry in that direction.

       Are you really going to contest the evidence and mathematical probability  for intelligent extraterrestrial life in 2017?  To say "there's no evidence" is a giant admission that you know literally nothing about this subject other than what you're spoon-fed through official outlets.

       Another good example is the cattle mutilation phenomenon and popular discourse on that.  This is another one where the popular conception is the idea of alien abduction and experimentation.  Meanwhile, all the concrete evidence points toward the CDC, FDA, and other government agencies performing secret tests to monitor the public health risk posed by rapidly spreading diseases amongst herds of cattle, most especially the prion diseases which are ill understood, difficult to contain, and pose extreme danger to the public at large.  Be warned that if you start to look into this, you will probably want to stop eating beef.  Any interested readers can check out the book "Stalking the Herd" by Chris O'brien.  This one should be on the list of confirmed conspiracy theories in my book.

       Yeah I mean when you consider it and just abandon the need to trust these orgs you see the terrible but clear logic of faking extraterrestrial nightmares to distract from all-too-human activity. People often say they'd pick invisibility when questioned about what superpower they'd want. Obfuscation = no accountability. The Paperclip Pack didn't just become swell guys when they got off the planes. No reason to assume their protégés are any less Machiavellian when it serves them.

       The actual conspiracy is that people have given into to belng labeled as "conspiracy theorists." Even on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, just try to disagree with a widely-circulated conspiracy on this sub, like Pizzagate. If you're skeptical, you'll be hit with "what are you doing here?" "go back to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       " "why are you defending pedos?" and all sorts of detracting "if you're not with us on everything you don't belong here."
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally giving into to be labeled as a hivemind at every turn, and then complaining when people treat you as such, like when
       <a href="/r/showerthoughts">
        /r/showerthoughts
       </a>
       made a joke about conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to start thinking for themselves and stop following the hivemind. Being a "conspiracy theorist" isn't a thing, it's not a gang or organization. It's just looking for conspiracies of any variety and discussing the possibilities of the how and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to believe in Bigfoot in order to believe the CIA had JFK assassinated. You don't need to believe in flat earth in order to believe in corporate conspiracies.

       I only use "conspiracy theorist" as a moniker for the group of people who aren't apt to accept the given explanation for an event. I think it has been adopted by the group and understood to not be defamatory. But I could be wrong and everyone else hates the term.

       The behavior you're discussing here has nothing to do with conspiracies or "conspiracy theorists" specifically. This type of behavior is prevalent wherever something is specialized. It happens to be extra noticeable on reddit or any forum because forums are, by nature, compartmentalized for targeted purposes/topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go into any place with any doubt about the prevailing narrative and you will see this "hivemind" behavior. It doesn't matter whether it's in a politics sub, trans sub, feminist sub, mens rights sub... whatever.  There's a specific purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of it is understandable, some of it is absurd. It just seems to make less sense to walk into a conspiracy sub and start spouting the official narrative because the nature of conspiracy is to question everything, so there's no specific direction except that: question everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, some theories get far out (lizard people, flat earth). I don't think these things discredit "conspiracy theorists" because "conspiracy theorists" aren't any defined thing except to question everything. It is up to every individual to come here and ultimately decide what holds water and what doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies by nature cannot have many facts, so it relies heavily on every individual to apply his own set of skills and critical thinking abilities. In this regard, we're all in different places.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not as simple as saying "oh, you don't believe women should have equal rights? GTFO" It's "what if...?" "Is this plausible?" It's bouncing things off the wall, like ping pong. Sometimes people are going to try to find evidence that fits a narrative and some people are going to try to find a narrative that fits the evidence. Both can be equally correct and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of conspiracy thought is that it's always attempting to pierce a barrier of obfuscation while recognizing that information is splintered and generally outright unknowable. It's building a pile of crumbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason conspiracy theorists are labeled as kooks is not because they're challenging a narrative, but they're challenging everyone's ego. Because if I didn't see this possibility, then I was tricked. Because I was tricked, I'm dumb. I'm not as smart as I thought I was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ego is the greatest adversary of the thinker and his ideas.

       This is not true. Conspiracies by nature mean you don't have access to all of the facts, or perhaps a misrepresentation of the facts, not "cannot have many facts."

       The problem with your "theory" is that is fails to question subjective opinion on what "misinformation and nonsense" theories would be. Anyone could accuse any theory of being outlandish with this idea. Especially as you go farther down the rabbit hole you're going to find things that will make you question everything you've ever known.
       <em>
        You have to discern for yourself.
       </em>
       And it's not important to come to a conclusion immediately. Many theories are open ended because they can't possibly be solved in a timely manner, or may be so obfuscated that they may never be solved, and that should be okay. The whole point is to consider a different perspective every time you read something, as its not just a matter of believing a theory or not, it's a practice that is good for your brain.

       I think that what you say is bs, bottomline is that there is to many conflicting points of interest to confuse people. We'll call it "fillers", these are conspiracies that derail the crucial ones. I once believed the world was a globe but i never believed we evolved from chimps. From what ive researched, all the scientist involved with nasa, cern, and any other organization are all apart of a bigger plot. A plot that is to bring about the greatest war we will ever witness. A war between Satan and his followers versus God. It's always been a fight to disrupt our society and to disrupt our beliefs to pit people against one another. If you haven't already noticed it, watch television one day and look at the dynamics. Not only that but a part of the plot is to take God out of every single thing he is involved in. That is why i think this is bs.

       But only the Xtian god right? Even though most of the world is not and has never been of the Xtian religion. So your god actually weaseled his way into a few places and it just keeps growing and growing, so your conspiracy is backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this? Christ was actually sent by Satan to confuse the chosen people of God. Satan knew that the best way to get to the children of Judea was to provide false actualization of prophecy. And here you are a sheep in the greatest conspiracy the world has ever known.

       Nobody has ever heard of this "Xtian god" before. You made up the second part or someone you follow told you wrong. I'm  100% sure God, the one that create everything in this world,  cast Satan and all the angels that followed him out of heaven. This can be found in Revelation 12 : 7-12. The fact are 7-9.

       Dude, I'm not looking into that. I would imagine it's the same reason why the word Christmas isn't used nearly as much as "X"mas. This country as well as many others have been conditioned just the way Satan wants them to be... To make it easier for people to be controlled. I believe that you ,  as i have, searched for answers as to why stuff is the way it is. There are things happening today that is clearly not normal. But every major station claims its normal. War is normal. In the name what? I don't know if you are being naive

       I'm sorry, but you're completely misinformed if you think Xmas is used more than Christmas. X (Greek Chi) was used to represent Christ in early writings of the church, iirc. Then hundreds and hundreds of years later, some ignorant, low intelligence person decided it was used to replace Christ and his church and spread that through his congregation. Ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       War is absolutely normal. I can't, off the top of my head, think of a period not identifiable by a war that was going on. And the fake war on Xtianity was created by the conservatives to keep you all occupied on something other than the redistribution if wealth that they've been doing since the 70s.

       If you notice, this last week there was a couple of accounts posting about flat earth and reptilians and a bunch of smaller conspiracies about Ivanka. They were posting about 20 post per hour and just completely burying any info.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have completely take over this sub and are killing it day to day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't let that stop you! They want us here. Tell your friends, all of them! About how we can all come together to stop all this shit! How our government has technology and money to record every phone call, text and FaceTime, but they can't provide daily meals for vets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlighten your friends. Tell them you are there for them, and express that life is about memories and how you make people feel. Not that 9-5 shit for the Rothschilds.

       I'm probably going to be downvoted for saying this, but I always had a sneaking suspicion that this is what was going on with all the Comet Ping Pong stuff. Influence the conspiracy community to fixate on a pizza parlor and 4chan codes, thereby tarnishing the image of the larger scale investigation into elite pedophilia.

       The FBI codes are correct and the emails are correct. Not sure about the pizza parlour though.

       The 4chan codes are actual FBI codes - unless you're talking about different ones I don't know about.

       Your theory is spot on! You just have it backwards. we are all being run by the satanic illuminati agenda and they distract you with bullshit conspiracies like JFK, water gate scandal, to keep you distracted from the power of the Lord and the flat earth we all are living on right now. NASA is a bunch of liars, they can't go to the moon now, and they couldn't go in 1965. You've all been lied to but you will all deny this information and keep living in your safe little reality. What a world we live in now a days

       That's what Alex Jones does. He is there to make conspiracy theorists look crazy just like him. Notice whenever one of these subjects come up, the mainstream media immediately uses him as an example of the "nuts" who believe in this stuff.

       Absolutely and it's well known within the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two most recent fake conspiracy theories (I believe) is the flat earth theory and Corey Goode with his blue avians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a pretty good indicator for a fake theory is when one comes in out of nowhere and hasn't been thought of before. Kind of like the blue avians in the ufology community.

you see bullshit parody subs too like finland conspiracy, dolphin conspiracy, post karma conspiracy.....these subs aren't even funny.... (Shill sense of humor sucks ass.)

       Of course they could just be normal people having a bit of fun but it's still hurting the conspiracy awareness effort with the whole mocking of the idea of conspiracies.

        How many species of dinosaurs have been discovered?
       </p>
       <p>
        These species are placed in about 300 valid dinosaur genera (Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, etc.), although about 540 have been named. Recent estimates suggest that about 700 to 900 more dinosaur genera may remain to be discovered.

         How old are the dinosaurs?
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          How long did it take for the dinosaurs to become extinct?
         </p>
         <p>
          The first dinosaurs evolved around 230 million years ago, and the non-bird dinosaurs went extinct during the end-Cretaceous event 65 million years ago. So it took 165 million years for the dinosaurs to become extinct. During that time, species were constantly dying out and being replaced by new species.

         <blockquote>
          <p>
           Mammals appeared on the earth long before the extinction of the dinosaurs; in fact, dinosaurs and mammals originated within 10 million years of each other, in the late Triassic about 200 million years ago.

       Is it really far fetched that an intelligent bipedular reptile? I don't think so. So much time, not much evidence. I think you forget that not every dinosaur fossil is a full body. It's only fractions of bones that they find during a dig. Then there is places like the Vatican and the British Empire whom both went into countries, stole and destroyed information regarding their religions. Who knows what 'evidence' has been covered up through time. I really don't find intelligent bipedular reptiles to be that far fetched.
