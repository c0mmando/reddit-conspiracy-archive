So now when mentioning actual cover-ups alongside nonsensical theories, those conspiracy theorists seem crazy and unhinged. And that reflects poorly on truth seekers who recognize the both sides.</p>

<p>Just a theory though.</p>

From reptiles ruling the earth for so long, there could&#39;ve been intelligent bipedular beings. There could&#39;ve been interbreeding between different species using technology. Who knows... but I do agree with what the thread says, there is a couple of fake conspiracies pushed out to discredit all conspiracies.</p>

<p>How many species of dinosaurs have been discovered?</p>

<p>These species are placed in about 300 valid dinosaur genera (Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, etc.), although about 540 have been named. Recent estimates suggest that about 700 to 900 more dinosaur genera may remain to be discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How old are the dinosaurs?</p>

<p>Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for the dinosaurs to become extinct?</p>

<p>The first dinosaurs evolved around 230 million years ago, and the non-bird dinosaurs went extinct during the end-Cretaceous event 65 million years ago. So it took 165 million years for the dinosaurs to become extinct. During that time, species were constantly dying out and being replaced by new species.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mammals appeared on the earth long before the extinction of the dinosaurs; in fact, dinosaurs and mammals originated within 10 million years of each other, in the late Triassic about 200 million years ago.</p>

<p>Our species, Homo sapiens evolves 200 thousand years ago</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it really far fetched that an intelligent bipedular reptile? I don&#39;t think so. So much time, not much evidence. I think you forget that not every dinosaur fossil is a full body. It&#39;s only fractions of bones that they find during a dig. Then there is places like the Vatican and the British Empire whom both went into countries, stole and destroyed information regarding their religions. Who knows what &#39;evidence&#39; has been covered up through time. I really don&#39;t find intelligent bipedular reptiles to be that far fetched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was another recent post on this board about how the 9/11 crowd needs to focus on challenging the existing story instead of proposing a number of positive &#39;theories&#39; about what actually happened.  I think the real problem has less to do with the conspiracy community at large (if you will) and is closer to what OP is talking about here... the media and popular culture will always elevate kooks and quacks before they give any press to the people who are ripping the official story apart, or just asking dangerous questions.  This is true of more than just 9/11 truth, too.</p>

<p>For example, in my view it is confirmed fact that the UFO phenomenon became primarily about extraterrestrials and alien space craft in the popular culture because the military wanted to steer people away from the reality of black budget experimental aircraft projects and the like.  Now when people think &#39;UFO&#39;, they think:</p>

<ul>
<li>alien abductions</li>
<li>grey aliens</li>
<li>flying saucers</li>
</ul>

<p>and not:</p>

<ul>
<li>misappropriation of tax dollars</li>
<li>corporate welfare</li>
<li>terrifying weapons of war</li>
<li>greater and greater surveillance capability of intelligence and military apparatus</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  I&#39;m not saying that experimental aircraft totally explains the UFO phenomenon (I don&#39;t think it does), just pointing out that there are certain lines of questioning which are preferable and acceptable to powerful people, and they are going to be pointing public perception and investigative inquiry in that direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good example is the cattle mutilation phenomenon and popular discourse on that.  This is another one where the popular conception is the idea of alien abduction and experimentation.  Meanwhile, all the concrete evidence points toward the CDC, FDA, and other government agencies performing secret tests to monitor the public health risk posed by rapidly spreading diseases amongst herds of cattle, most especially the prion diseases which are ill understood, difficult to contain, and pose extreme danger to the public at large.  Be warned that if you start to look into this, you will probably want to stop eating beef.  Any interested readers can check out the book &quot;Stalking the Herd&quot; by Chris O&#39;brien.  This one should be on the list of confirmed conspiracy theories in my book.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean when you consider it and just abandon the need to trust these orgs you see the terrible but clear logic of faking extraterrestrial nightmares to distract from all-too-human activity. People often say they&#39;d pick invisibility when questioned about what superpower they&#39;d want. Obfuscation = no accountability. The Paperclip Pack didn&#39;t just become swell guys when they got off the planes. No reason to assume their protégés are any less Machiavellian when it serves them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual conspiracy is that people have given into to belng labeled as &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; Even on this sub. </p>

<p>For example, just try to disagree with a widely-circulated conspiracy on this sub, like Pizzagate. If you&#39;re skeptical, you&#39;ll be hit with &quot;what are you doing here?&quot; &quot;go back to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>&quot; &quot;why are you defending pedos?&quot; and all sorts of detracting &quot;if you&#39;re not with us on everything you don&#39;t belong here.&quot; </p>

<p>Literally giving into to be labeled as a hivemind at every turn, and then complaining when people treat you as such, like when <a href="/r/showerthoughts">/r/showerthoughts</a> made a joke about conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>People need to start thinking for themselves and stop following the hivemind. Being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; isn&#39;t a thing, it&#39;s not a gang or organization. It&#39;s just looking for conspiracies of any variety and discussing the possibilities of the how and why. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to believe in Bigfoot in order to believe the CIA had JFK assassinated. You don&#39;t need to believe in flat earth in order to believe in corporate conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The behavior you&#39;re discussing here has nothing to do with conspiracies or &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; specifically. This type of behavior is prevalent wherever something is specialized. It happens to be extra noticeable on reddit or any forum because forums are, by nature, compartmentalized for targeted purposes/topics.</p>

<p>Go into any place with any doubt about the prevailing narrative and you will see this &quot;hivemind&quot; behavior. It doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s in a politics sub, trans sub, feminist sub, mens rights sub... whatever.  There&#39;s a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Some of it is understandable, some of it is absurd. It just seems to make less sense to walk into a conspiracy sub and start spouting the official narrative because the nature of conspiracy is to question everything, so there&#39;s no specific direction except that: question everything.</p>

<p>Sure, some theories get far out (lizard people, flat earth). I don&#39;t think these things discredit &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; because &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; aren&#39;t any defined thing except to question everything. It is up to every individual to come here and ultimately decide what holds water and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Conspiracies by nature cannot have many facts, so it relies heavily on every individual to apply his own set of skills and critical thinking abilities. In this regard, we&#39;re all in different places.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as simple as saying &quot;oh, you don&#39;t believe women should have equal rights? GTFO&quot; It&#39;s &quot;what if...?&quot; &quot;Is this plausible?&quot; It&#39;s bouncing things off the wall, like ping pong. Sometimes people are going to try to find evidence that fits a narrative and some people are going to try to find a narrative that fits the evidence. Both can be equally correct and wrong.</p>

<p>The burden of conspiracy thought is that it&#39;s always attempting to pierce a barrier of obfuscation while recognizing that information is splintered and generally outright unknowable. It&#39;s building a pile of crumbs.</p>

<p>The reason conspiracy theorists are labeled as kooks is not because they&#39;re challenging a narrative, but they&#39;re challenging everyone&#39;s ego. Because if I didn&#39;t see this possibility, then I was tricked. Because I was tricked, I&#39;m dumb. I&#39;m not as smart as I thought I was.</p>

<p>Ego is the greatest adversary of the thinker and his ideas.</p>

<p>This is not true. Conspiracies by nature mean you don&#39;t have access to all of the facts, or perhaps a misrepresentation of the facts, not &quot;cannot have many facts.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your &quot;theory&quot; is that is fails to question subjective opinion on what &quot;misinformation and nonsense&quot; theories would be. Anyone could accuse any theory of being outlandish with this idea. Especially as you go farther down the rabbit hole you&#39;re going to find things that will make you question everything you&#39;ve ever known. <em>You have to discern for yourself.</em> And it&#39;s not important to come to a conclusion immediately. Many theories are open ended because they can&#39;t possibly be solved in a timely manner, or may be so obfuscated that they may never be solved, and that should be okay. The whole point is to consider a different perspective every time you read something, as its not just a matter of believing a theory or not, it&#39;s a practice that is good for your brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that what you say is bs, bottomline is that there is to many conflicting points of interest to confuse people. We&#39;ll call it &quot;fillers&quot;, these are conspiracies that derail the crucial ones. I once believed the world was a globe but i never believed we evolved from chimps. From what ive researched, all the scientist involved with nasa, cern, and any other organization are all apart of a bigger plot. A plot that is to bring about the greatest war we will ever witness. A war between Satan and his followers versus God. It&#39;s always been a fight to disrupt our society and to disrupt our beliefs to pit people against one another. If you haven&#39;t already noticed it, watch television one day and look at the dynamics. Not only that but a part of the plot is to take God out of every single thing he is involved in. That is why i think this is bs.</p>

X (Greek Chi) was used to represent Christ in early writings of the church, iirc. Then hundreds and hundreds of years later, some ignorant, low intelligence person decided it was used to replace Christ and his church and spread that through his congregation. Ridiculous. </p>

<p>War is absolutely normal. I can&#39;t, off the top of my head, think of a period not identifiable by a war that was going on. And the fake war on Xtianity was created by the conservatives to keep you all occupied on something other than the redistribution if wealth that they&#39;ve been doing since the 70s.</p>

NASA is a bunch of liars, they can&#39;t go to the moon now, and they couldn&#39;t go in 1965.

<p>Who gets to decide that? I think we should be open to all theories even if they are ridiculous because we aren&#39;t any better if we discount other theories that we find too absurd.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we can end up as close-minded as the sheep we laugh at.</p>

<p>This is all called a psychological-operation, aka psy-op and has been a very great tool in their Arsenal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely and it&#39;s well known within the community. </p>

<p>The two most recent fake conspiracy theories (I believe) is the flat earth theory and Corey Goode with his blue avians.</p>

<p>I think a pretty good indicator for a fake theory is when one comes in out of nowhere and hasn&#39;t been thought of before. Kind of like the blue avians in the ufology community.</p>

<p>How many species of dinosaurs have been discovered?</p>

<p>These species are placed in about 300 valid dinosaur genera (Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, etc.), although about 540 have been named. Recent estimates suggest that about 700 to 900 more dinosaur genera may remain to be discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How old are the dinosaurs?</p>

<p>Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long did it take for the dinosaurs to become extinct?</p>

<p>The first dinosaurs evolved around 230 million years ago, and the non-bird dinosaurs went extinct during the end-Cretaceous event 65 million years ago. So it took 165 million years for the dinosaurs to become extinct. During that time, species were constantly dying out and being replaced by new species.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mammals appeared on the earth long before the extinction of the dinosaurs; in fact, dinosaurs and mammals originated within 10 million years of each other, in the late Triassic about 200 million years ago.</p>

<p>Our species, Homo sapiens evolves 200 thousand years ago</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it really far fetched that an intelligent bipedular reptile? I don&#39;t think so. So much time, not much evidence. I think you forget that not every dinosaur fossil is a full body. It&#39;s only fractions of bones that they find during a dig. Then there is places like the Vatican and the British Empire whom both went into countries, stole and destroyed information regarding their religions. Who knows what &#39;evidence&#39; has been covered up through time. I really don&#39;t find intelligent bipedular reptiles to be that far fetched.</p>
