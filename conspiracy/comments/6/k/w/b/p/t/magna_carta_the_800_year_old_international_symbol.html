        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Magna Carta, meaning the Great Charter, was created in the year 1215. The ruler, King John, was considered one of the worst leaders in history. He imposed heavy taxes on his Barons and if they refused to pay, he punished them severly or imprisoned them. The Barons demanded that King John obey the law, when he refused, they captured London and King John had no option but to negotiate. Magna Carta was created to ensure the Barons and free men had their rights secured, However the vast majority of people in 1215 were peasants and ruled over by their land owners. Although Magna Carta was created to bring peace between the Barons and King John, the Pope declared the charter invalid and a civil war broke out. When King John died in 1216, 9 year old King Henry III took to the throne. Magna Carta was then re-issued several times during the 13th century until it was finally made part of English Law. It is echoed in the U.S Declaration of independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948. Magna Carta&#39;s most important legacy was that everyone, including our leaders, must obey the law. Without it the world would be a very different place.                 </p>

<p>Here is an in depth video on Magna Carta narrated by Monty Pythons&#39;s Terry Jones: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xo4tUMdAMw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xo4tUMdAMw</a>            </p>

<p>And here is an 800 year summary of the Magna Carta, again narrated by Terry Jones: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ7vUkbtlQA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ7vUkbtlQA</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back to The Queen’s position. To make it absolutely clear: The Queen (or the reigning Monarch) is above the law. It has been like this for centuries and remains true and practicable today. However, the important thing is that Her Majesty doesn’t test this prerogative.</p>

<p>I appears the that whatever language from the Magna Carta that was put into English Law does not apply to the King or Queen of England.</p>
