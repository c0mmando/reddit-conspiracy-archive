        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The &quot;MSM Dirty Dozen&quot; have sold the public War after War after War--from Vietnam to Iraq to Syria; putting the health of our youth (where much of the US military recruits from) at risk as well as the financial security of our nation.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Failure to protect the nation before/during/after the attacks of 9/11.  The Dirty Dozen often had inbformation or video which directly contradicted the &quot;official story&quot;; yet failed to investigate further (or withheld the information/video from the public).  Ecamples:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyYms4J5s98">CBS</a>...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_1jcjSnOCI">NBC/msnbc</a>...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoTz-cXBEi8">ABC</a>...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWpWc_suPWo">Fox</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/06/20/14975/finding-truth-935-lies-about-war-iraq">935 Lies</a> for the Iraq War...also see Bill Moyers&#39; documentary <a href="http://billmoyers.com/content/buying-the-war/">Buying the War: How Big Media Filed Us</a></p></li>
<li><p>TRILLIONS of Dollars wasted on war since 9/11--yet <a href="http://imgur.com/a/AhY2w">NO AUDIT at the PentaCon</a> with most of the Dirty Dozen being silent on the issue.  </p></li>
<li><p>PTSD suffered by US soldiers who participate in illegal US wars against Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc.  (In addition to the other health issues and Deaths of our soldiers).</p></li>
<li><p>Tobacco: The MSM Dirty Dozen failed to protect the public for decades by exposing the risks of tobacco use.  Thousands (if not hundreds of thousands, or even millions) have died because of their complicity.</p></li>
<li><p>Prescription Drugs:  The Dirty Dozen have failed to protect the public again and again--by allowing the drug companies to censor their reports on the dangerous Opiods which have now killed thousands in many states of the USA.</p></li>
<li><p>Environment:  from NODAPL to the oil/gas industry&#39;s use of fracking (which threatends our water table/supply) in many other states.  Fracking also causes Earth Quakes to increase in frequency.  Many states have been affected--California, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania...</p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear Waste:  from recent release of small amount of radiation at the Hanford nuclear site in Washington state...to New Mexico&#39;s nuclear waste site being shut down for 3 years after a fire--the Dirty Dozen remains silent, which puts our environment, the health of the workers, and the public at risk.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>AT the very least write the editors/producers/politicians a few times a year.  Helps to NOT visit their web sites, buy their products or watch their broadcasts.</p>

<p>I would advise people to protest--but that merely assures being put on a government list and risks arrest (which puts your health and finances at risk).  Damn shame that Americans can no longer feel free to prtest without being threatened by the system which we the people have paid to create with our taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I don&#39;t want to live in a fuckin country like Russia or North Korea where all the news comes directly from the government. If you don&#39;t like the news on TV then turn it off. </p>

<p>&quot;Time for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill.”</p>

<p>Guess who said that? Fuckin Mike Pence said that. </p>

<p>Trump has already been undoing the rules that Obama put in place about fracking. You think he&#39;s going to protect you from fracking?</p>

<p>The problem is the public is stupid and we don&#39;t give a fuck about issues we should. Shutting down the media so we only here our information directly from the government is the complete opposite of what we should do. We need more news companies reporting on issues that matter and getting the word out. </p>
