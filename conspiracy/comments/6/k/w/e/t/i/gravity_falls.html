<p>The main villain is literally the eye of providence, a demon named Bill. He represents the elite cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert, but try using a virtual machine to limit how much information that can be gathered about your computer and subsequently used to track you (which is possible).  Ensure communication is encrypted end-to-end.  Don&#39;t give personal information to people you meet online.  Turn off cookies and scripting languages on websites.  Don&#39;t go offering to join anti-establishment groups you know little about in open chat areas.</p>

<p>These tips are fairly obvious.  Look up encryption and online privacy yourself for more information.  Also, assume everything you do, everything you click on or type, is kept and stored.  Also know that no matter what you do, online security and privacy is an uphill battle, and these measures are generally just making it harder for people to track you - but if you are of enough interest to people with enough resources, these measures will not be enough.  The ramifications of this, I leave for you to ponder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are looking to do something really clandestine - look into Tails: <a href="http://tails.boum.org">http://tails.boum.org</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a hardened Linux live-OS (bootable from a USB stick) that systematically encrypts everything you do, whether storage (LUKS) or transmission (Tor). The firewall (iptables) ensure you don&#39;t accidentally leak your IP. The distrib even erases the RAM when you shut down, by booting a new kernel - pretty neat.</p>

<p>Attach the USB key to your wrist with a string if you&#39;re ever doing stuff outside on a public Wifi and you&#39;re golden :)</p>

<p>Movies that focus on fighting but use anger/fear/revenge as motivation do not pose any danger. It is just a reinforcement of emotions that feed into tribal mentality. And divide and conquer tactics have been used to harness tribal mentality to serve unelected powers since forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  There was a weird series years ago called Battlestar Galactica.  It had some deep storylines.  In it, the humans were getting smacked down.  There is a point where the humans, against superior technical force of the Cylon robots, humans start suicide bombing themselves to fight back.  What was weird was there were moments where I thought in the same situation, I&#39;d do the same for my parents, brothers, friends.  And I asked myself, is this why the towelheads do it to us?  Why they setup IUDs to blow up humvees?  </p>

<p>It is weird that such a small minority of people see through the veil, question things.</p>

For sake of this discussion lets assume there is no conspiracy behind 9/11 and what they say happened happened, i know a lot of people who believe this is an unprovoked attack on the united states.  They cant seem to grasp the fact that weve been blowing up the middle east since the 50s and this is bound to have obvious negative consequences.  Hard to love my country when weve been the major purveyors of destruction the last century and a half.  </p>

<p>Pleasantly surprised. Gravity Falls is great. Someone else mentioned Rick and Morty, coincidentally, Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch and Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland are good friends and the often reference each other in their respective shows. </p>

<p>Animated TV nowadays is swimming with incredible artists and people with wild views on things. They&#39;re able to get away with so much more interesting, symbolic, esoteric subjects due to their medium. Plus, kids don&#39;t really process things the way adults do so most of the more challenging ideas soar miles over their heads. </p>

<p>Jesse Moynihan was a storyboard artist on Adventure Time and he has a couple appearances on the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, as well as the creator of Adventure Time, Pendleton Ward. Definitely worth a listen, even if you don&#39;t necessarily like the show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly they aren&#39;t a dime a dozen. For every well written kids show there&#39;s at least three other shit shows trying to drown them out. Right now Cartoon Network is doing kind of good. Granted, Regular Show is over and Adventure Time isn&#39;t long for this world either. They would be doing better if they stopping airing Teen Titans Go EVERY HOUR ON THE FUCKING HOUR and replaced it with Steven Universe (say what you will about the fanbase, but the show is a delight.) </p>

<p>Disney used to run some amazing shows, but now they stick of a formula of mind numbing stupidity and lessons that teach young girls that their looks should come first. And the only thing Nick has going for it is The Loud House. I love Spongebob, but it needs to die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is quality, definitely worth it.  And as it gets deeper, the unexpected twists are exciting.  I watched it because others said I should - quickly grew to love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t watch it until the series was over, but I&#39;m glad I eventually did. As someone who basically grew up on conspiracies, I didn&#39;t think it would be all that great but in the end I was impressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly they aren&#39;t a dime a dozen. For every well written kids show there&#39;s at least three other shit shows trying to drown them out. Right now Cartoon Network is doing kind of good. Granted, Regular Show is over and Adventure Time isn&#39;t long for this world either. They would be doing better if they stopping airing Teen Titans Go EVERY HOUR ON THE FUCKING HOUR and replaced it with Steven Universe (say what you will about the fanbase, but the show is a delight.) </p>

<p>Disney used to run some amazing shows, but now they stick of a formula of mind numbing stupidity and lessons that teach young girls that their looks should come first. And the only thing Nick has going for it is The Loud House. I love Spongebob, but it needs to die. </p>
