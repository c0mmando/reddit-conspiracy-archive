       Quite a bit of right wing porn and sure he blames the hippies, but he mentions the welfare of the elite multiple times. He basically advocates for ultra-capitalism.

       Someone smarter than me answer why Trump is able to have multiple bankruptcies on his record and able to keep his tower?

       In a real world someone would take the tower and pay all his debts with it leaving him with the rest. Why would Bannon support this man after this video?

       You've already shown your lack of understanding of basic economics, so this post does not surprise me. There are multiple forms of Bankruptcy, one being restructuring. Which is probably what Trump has done. It's actually not too uncommon, tbh.

       So you cannot explain what you are talking about, briefly in your own words, from a documentary you've watched twice? Hmm. Something ain't right here.. And now, you're taking the intellectually lazy route of: "Do your own research!!!!". Typical.

      <p>
       No, that's not how it works. Restructuring means, liquidating some assets or what not and
       <em>
        restructuring payments of debt
       </em>
       (ie. coming to an agreement with both parties - could mean agreeing to pay ~50% of the debt instead of 100% of debt owed). It's a win win for both parties, in that situation. Hence why people usually opt for that type of bankruptcy, if you have valuable assets.

      <p>
       Cool? That's kind of like his opinion. Not seeing how it matters, in regards to your question. Are you sure your just not understanding what Bannon is saying in context (ie. public bank bail outs)?

       Yes. Which is why the meme of "communism has never worked" is a thing.

       In reality the technology has never been developed enough for real communism. Stalin and Mao and others took advantage of ignorance of the futute.

       Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, filed for bankruptcy not just once, but twice. Lincoln's business adventures left him strapped with debt, along with loans from friends and family that he took seventeen years to pay off. Fortunately he persevered to leave a better legacy as a politician than a debtor. He was not the only President to meet with financial failure. The 18th President, Ulysses S. Grant, and the 25th President, William McKinley, both filed for bankruptcy as well.

       Read his Vatican Speech, it's really a masterpiece. His argument for a global right libertarian populist movement is essentially that right now we have a "capitalist" system where the poor get welfare, the rich get welfare, and the middle class get fucked. At the same time he is also trying to destroy global government whether it's killing the Paris deal, trying to destroy the globalist EU, trying to unseat Pope Francis, etc. I am a big fan of Bannon's philosophy. He's arguing for lassiez faire instead of crony capitalism.

        Someone smarter than me answer why Trump is able to have multiple bankruptcies on his record and able to keep his tower?
In a real world someone would take the tower and pay all his debts with it leaving him with the rest. Why would Bannon support this man after this video?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He has said about Trump that he is more a symbol and that he isn't even sure if Trump knows the importance of his role (to the populist movement). I believe he wants to engineer Trump to be a symbol of capitalism and nationalism in the same way conservatives created Reagan while doing most of the hard policy work for him.

       I understand what you're saying. But lassiez faire is neo-liberalism which has been falsely associated with democrats which is a key talking point in discrediting liberals by people who don't know definitions. I know that's not Bannon's fault but he sure as fuck doesn't correct it.

       This conflates classical liberalism, with neo-liberalism.   Classical liberalism holds that the state should interfere sometimes if there are market inefficiencies and they view the market as an allocation device.  Neo-liberalism is a constructivist project.  They hold that the state should have an active role in construction of markets. Furthermore, they don't view the market as a means of allocating resources, rather they view it as an information processor.   The Democrats are neo-liberal through and through.

       I wouldn't conflate lassiez faire and neoliberalism. Yes neoliberalism focuses on economic growth and globalization but it is still done in a heavily regulated manner. When Bannon's referring to his model of capitalism it's much more about internal deregulation, spending cuts, and tax cuts than it is about the external expansion neoliberalism focuses on. While neoliberalism may have made the economy more globalized it has also existed alongside a massive increase in regulations at the national and international level. Hence the term crony capitalism that he uses because only some people get a seat at the table writing the rules that govern and restrict businesses.

       It definitely is pushed by Republicans as free market but what Bannon and Ron Paul would argue is that more often than not what they push isn't actually free. Only some companies get the contracts for privatization, for example. And in many cases they get the rights to a monopoly when state functions are turned over to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or with deregulation, certain key regulations are removed but the overall number of regulations and regulatory power continues to increase. While supposedly we are more free market now than in the 40s-80s, just off numbers most states have over 100k state level regulations, our government spends more than ever even adjusted for inflation, and we have the highest corporate taxes we've had.

       Laissez Faire Capitalism means official private property ownership with government police enforcement for property owners. That is
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       it means.
      </p>
      <p>
       While both parties support capitalism, one party has long-standing plans to eliminate all regulation and let the magic of the market run itself. Specifically, the Republican Party wants to repeal the New Deal and the Great Society -- nearly 2000 government programs or regulations that created the best economic times in American history -- the period from 1946 through 1981. And the numbers show it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the pendulum swung toward the "government out of the way" folks, the economy has been slower and slower ... and slower!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a huge catch to the "ideology" of those who today call themselves "libertarians." They don't seem to mind war. For example, the number one foundation for libertarianism is the Bradley Foundation. But the Bradley Foundation also funded the PNAC organization that wished for a "new Pearl Harbor" and wanted multi-front wars. The second biggest foundation, The Koch Foundation, also claims to be libertarian -- but this one funds American Enterprise Institute which has taken over the activities of PNAC in promoting wars.

       Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, filed for bankruptcy not just once, but twice. Lincoln's business adventures left him strapped with debt, along with loans from friends and family that he took seventeen years to pay off. Fortunately he persevered to leave a better legacy as a politician than a debtor. He was not the only President to meet with financial failure. The 18th President, Ulysses S. Grant, and the 25th President, William McKinley, both filed for bankruptcy as well.

       I think the Trump entertainment group paid their debts by giving stock out to the debt holders.  So the debts were technically paid.

       Stock in a possible failing brand from a known deadbeat. If it weren't for being President... the man would still be on T.V doing nothing but saying you're fired.

       If you find articles about Trump from before his name was in the POTUS hat, the "known deadbeat" meme is really non-existent.

       <strong>
        The Wollman ice rink
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The rink was closed in 1980 for a proposed two years of renovations at $9.1 million. Six years after the problem-plagued work was still not completed by the city, Donald Trump persuaded Mayor Ed Koch to let him complete the work in four months at $3 million in order to have it open by the end of the year.[3][4] Koch initially objected but later agreed. The city had originally planned to employ the resource-saving – but largely untested  – chemical compound Freon to generate ice, but instead time-proven brine was used. The rink reopened to the public on November 13, 1986.[5][6]

       I mean other than business disagreements with contractors, which is very common, he isn't a deadbeat by any normal non-politically motivated standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I don't get about the Trump hate.  It's painfully obvious that the vast majority of the outrage is manufactured, a little bit of basic political outrage over differences in philosophies and a dash of "all white men bad".

       A lot of people are tired of the phony nonsense.

       Literally everyone wrote Apple off when they declared bankruptcy. They were swirling the drain with no exit in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blurb here oversells the importance of MS investment. Apple had billions in the bank at that time so MS cash didn't make a big difference. However, the PR boost from a vote a confidence from MS did.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly was the return of Jobs as CEO.
       <strong>
        That
       </strong>
       is what saved Apple and is a direct result of the bankruptcy.

       Important side note,
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Apple Inc isn't on that list is because Microsoft bailed them out to avoid Monopoly related legal problems.  It was an 11th hour bail out. So Apple basically filed for bankruptcy.

       This film is pure political propaganda loaded with fake news. The music is too loud. The speakers read like a who's-who of the Koch brothers machine. That's after 20 minutes. The oligarchs have way too much money to rewrite history with propaganda like this.

       This far in, I see the white entitled hippies, but I haven't seen any of the civil rights struggles. They drone on about morality and the family.

       If, by the end, this is a "get government out of the way" flick, there is one lesson to learn:

      <p>
       SOMEBODY'S gonna have the power to enforce "morality." That will be the oligarchs. So much for freedom.

       Yes. Which is why the meme of "communism has never worked" is a thing.

       In reality the technology has never been developed enough for real communism. Stalin and Mao and others took advantage of ignorance of the futute.
