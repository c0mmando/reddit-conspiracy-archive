       The House of Orange-Nassau are a high level authority over society and operate as a branch of the Vatican's Roman empire. The House of Orange-Nassau are former Holy Roman and French nobility that currently rule the Netherlands as a constitutional monarchy. King Willem-Alexander is the blood appointed head of state. They are believed to be extremely wealthy with a large amount of shares in Royal Dutch Shell. The term Shell is a symbol for Venus and Venice. In Sandro Botticelli's painting "The Birth of Venus" the orange haired Roman deity is depicted being born out of the ocean from a pearl's shell. Lucifer is associated with Venus. Venus is depicted in images as an orange planet. King Willem-Alexander is the head of the Cult of Venus today. The Spencer merchant family of London uses the seashell on their coat of arms and Prince William who is a Spencer through his mother is a top member of the Cult of Venus along with Duke Edward Spencer Churchill. The city of Venice is named after Venus and was a major merchant and banking center in Europe for centuries. As a merchant family not only do the Orange-Nassau's have shares in Royal Dutch Shell but also in Royal Philips Electronics, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Holland America Line cruise ships. The reason these companies use the term royal is because they are primarily owned by the royal family of the Netherlands. Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau was a former Vice President of Goldman Sachs International in London and was a financial officer for Urenco Group involved in uranium enrichment. The Cult of Venus is all about the love for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The House of Orange-Nassua established the Netherlands Trading Society which later established ABN AMRO Bank and ABN AMRO partly owns Saudi Hollandi Bank of Saudi Arabia. Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Parma who is a member of the Dutch royal family through his mother Princess Irene of the Netherlands worked for the ABN AMRO Bank. The name Orange comes from the Celtic principality of Orange in France. The Dutch Royal family are Protestants. The Loyal Orange Institute is an Irish (Celtic) Masonic order in Ireland and was created in 1798 to honor the Dutch born Protestant King William of Orange. King Willem-Alexander is the real head of the Loyal Orange Order today and he is an Illuminati master mason. The Loyal Orange Order uses LOL as an acronym for Loyal Orange Lodge. The commonly used acronym for "Laughing out loud" is believed to be an Illuminati creation with the real meaning of "Lucifer's our Lord." Beatrix of the Netherlands is a Dame of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Rome and her deceased husband Prince Claus Amsberg was a member of the Nazi Wehrmacht defense force. King Willem-Alexander's father was a Nazi. The Italian Prince Jamie of Bourbon-Parma is the nephew of Beatrix and he is Knight of Malta and also the Dutch ambassador to the Holy See. Prince Jamie is of the House of Bourbon-Parma which established the Jesuits and this bloodline still has a portion of authority over the Jesuit Order which has deeply infiltrated the United States Department of Defense and US intelligence agencies headquartered at the Pentagon. The Loyal Orange Order uses a five pointed star on its logo. The pentagon and pentagram are symbols for Venus.

       What is your opinion of the founding fathers, Lincoln, McKinley, Martin Luther, or other traditionally regarded anti-Vatican/Jesuit/mafia figures?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the most resistance to them currently coming from?

       To what extent is this mafia currently divided, and who are the key factions?

       Freemasons hold a lot more power than the Jesuits. Rome doesn't control the money supply, London and New York do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people you mentioned were fighting the Old World Order, some of them as members of secret societies dedicated to breaking humanity's chains from the usury-charging, knowledge-hiding system known as Mystery Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, Russia is the main resistance to Mystery Babylon, with China attempting to avoid running afoul of the US, but quietly working with Russia to support broad-based economic development in Asia with the New Silk Road development program.

       The United States is defined as a federal corporation under US code 3002 section 15. The Virginia Company was turned into the United States during the Revolutionary War by the Freemasonic Founding Fathers who were serving the Grand Lodge of England. The Virginia Company was issued by the British royal family from the City of London Corporation for North American settlements. In 1213 King John surrendered the Kingdom of England to the Holy See under the Golden Bull. In 1215 under direct papal authority King John issued the Magna Carta (Latin for Great Charter) and that established the one mile square block called the City of London Corporation as a sovereign entity from England and London. The Holy See uses Latin for official documents and the Vatican uses Latin as its official language. Novus Ordo Seclorum is Latin and translates to New Order of the Ages and is on the United States Great Seal and United States one dollar bill. Washington DC is located in both Virginia and Maryland. That is Virgin Mary Land. DC was originally called Rome in 1669 which is stated in the Catholic Encyclopedia. DC is Roman architecture and Capitol Hill is named after Capitoline Hill in Rome. The ancient Roman fasces symbol is all over federal buildings and federal seals. The federal government is based on the Roman Republic which was a fascist empire.

       The Founding Fathers were Freemasons and British Crown knights that hijacked the revolution the same way the alternative media has hijacked the opposition to the New World Order. They turned the Virginia Company into the United States. They wrote the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence with weak and ambiguous wording. They also neglected some of the most important rights like the right to self reliance and right to own property.

       The Freemasons also hijacked the movement of protesting Rome and Papal authority and turned it into a religion. They always hijack opposition movements and incorporate them into the system.

       Exactly, not only did Washington have virtually no part in any Masonic communions, but the majority of masons were
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the Jesuits at this time. The advisors of the Kings of France, Spain and Portugal were all masons who prompted those monarchs to expel the Jesuits in the 1760s.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the closest aid of Washington, known as his "adopted son" - General Lafayette, a known mason had this to say about the Jesuits:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe

       has no clue what he's talking about in many instances and it's sad to see people just eat up all of his claims. He's already blocked me because I rained on his "black nobility run the Jesuits" parade. It's like a child blocking their ears.

       The founders of America including the signers of the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, as well as the general population were mostly Bible-believing men and women; the revolution having been spurred by the tremendous preaching of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield, known as the first great awakening. There were only something like 6 deists who signed the Constitution; the rest, which is about 50 men, were all Bible-believing Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Congregationalists. Roger Sherman who wrote most of the Declaration of Independence and was the only founder to sign the Continental Association, Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation was deeply Calvinistic; Calvinism was central to the actions and beliefs of Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Oliver Ellsworth, Jonathan Trumbull, William Paterson, John Witherspoon etc. Washington was Baptized by his favorite preacher John Gano according to various sources. James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights at the behest of his baptist preacher John Leland.

       Hi VA!  I hope you are well!  As a brother in Christ I was disappointed to see you delete my post in your sub in the past.  Regardless, as someone with a deep affinity for the founding fathers, do you have any books you recommend or prefer to back up the claims you have made?  Thanks for the input and may Christ Jesus continue to be the focal point of your life.

       But a book I think you might be interested in is Chaplains and Clergy of the American Revolution by J.T. Headly. I'd recommend also listening to brother Arthur Bowser on 247worldradio.com he specializes in vindicating that the revolution was of God and that no Jesuits were involved. You can Google to find out most of the specific things I just mentioned. There is a certain site that lists the religions of every signatory of the Constitution and Declaration: adherents.com.

       It would be pretty accurate to say the US is a Christian nation. What a lot of Christians may miss is how hard the Founders worked to overthrow the system of Mystery Babylon, including successfully infiltrating it and making the Revolution appear to be part of the game, when it was absolutely real.

      <p>
       In the 1790s, he sort of said that.... it's not clear if by "English Lodges" he meant to exclude the military Lodges founded by revolutionary soldiers, of which there were many. But there were also French and Irish military Lodges that he may have attended during or after the war. Indeed, it is likely that his good friend and trusted General the Marquis de Lafayette either established his own Lodge during the war or frequented one within his command.

       Couple things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Locke was not a Freemason, and the comment you are referring to was about Freemasons, so just keep that in mind
       </li>
       <li>
        Locke didn't "impose" anything on anyone. Indeed, among his writings is included calling slavery a, "vile and miserable an estate of man," when speaking of the common practice of indentured servitude or "Transportation". He was not as outspoken regarding chattel slavery because it wasn't practiced in England at that time, but he did argue for the ability to press prisoners of war into service. Not really the same issue, and certainly not as broad as you were suggesting.

      <p>
       I don't think either document is "weak" and while the Declaration of Independence isn't really ambiguous at all, the Constitution (including the amended Bill of Rights) are ambiguous only in those places that consensus failed to be achieved, so blaming that ambiguity on any one group is rather questionable at best.

       What does that mean in concrete legal terms? You're complaining about ambiguity, but then you engage in extreme ambiguity when you want to support your own positions...

       Not landownership or the Bill of Rights protect the people from annual land or property taxes just as the government taxes cars, houses, and land annually. Being forced to pay a fee for something under the threat of the government seizing it is not ownership.

       It is documented fact that the Founding Fathers were mostly Freemasons or associates of Freemasons like Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was a member of the House of Burgesses which was a subsidiary of the Virginia Company issued by the British Crown. It was turned into the House of Delegates. Thomas Jefferson was the one who renamed the Virginia Company into the United States which is defined as a federal corporation under US code 3002 section 15. He capitalized the UNITED STATES which means it is conspicuous in regards to a "term" under law. A term is a contract. They now fully capitalize names on birth certificates. There is an implied incorporation when they do this by fully capitalization meaning an implied term or contract. This is deceitful and ambiguous as I stated above.

       This is all related to the House of Orange since Queen Beatrix is a member of the Order of the Garter which are the reformed Knights Templar of London that were stationed at the City of London Corporation where the Virginia Company was issued from.

       You're incorrect, here. The United States is not defined as a federal corporation. If you re-read the section you quoted and its surrounding context, you will see that it says,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As used in this chapter ... “United States” means ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In other words, when referring to the "United States" in the US Code, such rules apply to any of the above categories. So yes, there are Federal corporations, but the Federal Government itself or the United States as an entity, is not a corporation. You can read more in:

       The House of Burgesses takes its name from Bourgeoisie which means a borough and refers to a class system which separates one group of people from another. The Bourgeoisie were a non titled elitist group in France "opposed" to aristocracy. The term originated with chartered cities of merchants. The oldest record of this term goes back to the House of Borghese an Italian banking family who are intermarried with the French Imperial House of Bonaparte.

       Since there is not charter establishing the United States as a corporation yet it is a corporation implies it is the continuation of an existing corporate entity and the United States is a continuation of the territories owned by the Virginia Company. The contract implied through full capitalization of the name on Birth Certificates refers to the 14th Amendment which states that citizens are subject to the United States through the subsidized state corporations they reside in. Capitalization of the name does not incorporate a person itself but instead emphasizes a term.

       Sebastiaan Peter Cornelis Tromp, S.J. (16 March 1889 – 8 February 1975) was a Dutch Jesuit priest, theologian, and Latinist, who is best known for assisting Pope Pius XII in his theological encyclicals, and Pope John XXIII in the preparation for Vatican II. He was an assistant to Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani during the Council and professor of Catholic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University from 1929 until 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sebastian Tromp was born in March 1889, the first son of Cornelis Gerardus Tromp (German: Kornelius Gerhard Tromp), a teacher in the Netherlands, and Maria Catherina Lörper.[1] His mother was from an expatriate German family, expelled during the Kulturkampf.[2]

       I added some new pieces of information that changed the nature of the post. In some places it is more effective to stay away from spiritual concepts. Other times it makes it more effective and in this case it has done damage to the Cult of Venus. Rants do not include facts and infer loudness and angry tirades. I leave out sources so people can do their own research. I state the facts clearly so that they can be easily researched. If you question a specific statement I will come back with a source like I did below with the Freemasons and Declaration of Independence. You are the one who is wrong and inaccurate. Learn what a word like rant is before you use it so carelessly.

       Conspicuous", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is "conspicuous" or not is a decision for the court. Conspicuous terms include the following: (A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and (B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.

       Those Freemasons who were involved with the US Revolution were, for the most part, involved since the start. What evidence do you have of this hypothetical "highjacking"?

      <p>
       I don't think either document is "weak" and while the Declaration of Independence isn't really ambiguous at all, the Constitution (including the amended Bill of Rights) are ambiguous only in those places that consensus failed to be achieved, so blaming that ambiguity on any one group is rather questionable at best.

       What does that mean in concrete legal terms? You're complaining about ambiguity, but then you engage in extreme ambiguity when you want to support your own positions...

       I added some new pieces of information that changed the nature of the post. In some places it is more effective to stay away from spiritual concepts. Other times it makes it more effective and in this case it has done damage to the Cult of Venus. Rants do not include facts and infer loudness and angry tirades. I leave out sources so people can do their own research. I state the facts clearly so that they can be easily researched. If you question a specific statement I will come back with a source like I did below with the Freemasons and Declaration of Independence. You are the one who is wrong and inaccurate. Learn what a word like rant is before you use it so carelessly.
