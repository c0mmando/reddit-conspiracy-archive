       I posted this in another thread so sorry if this is redundant for some people but I have a long theory of the night he died. 
Seth was a regular at Lou's bar, they have a lot of UFC type events there. Probably even a facebook invite saying Seth would be there that night. Joe knows Seth is going there this night as he probably manages the social media of the bar. (he's in on it, I don't what it is but they have something on him or paid him. He was also in an campaign ad for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser who directed the Metropolitan Police Department to stop investigating the murder of Seth Rich, so somehow connected to her) He slips something in his drink, which is why everyone reported him being super intoxicated on only a small amount of booze. Maybe even something like sodium thiopental, (it slows the speed at which your body sends messages from your spinal chord to your brain) it would make someone think you are really drunk but it also acts as a truth serum.
In the meantime a couple miles away an unattended police vehicle full of weapons, with ammo is stolen between 1-2am. The fact that it was unattended for that long and that the guns were locked with Ammo is against policy. This is a set up. You might be asking now, why would a professional hit man need to steal police guns? Even the secret service needs to register their weapons. However you make it look like these guns were stolen they are now untraceable, any murder tied to those weapons are no longer tied to the police or anyone else because they were reported stolen. The cops are in on it, we know the high ups in the FBI had connections to Podesta, including the chief Lanier who left the force 5 weeks after the murder to a job in security (weird.) Anyway the guns are “stolen” and the hitman, (either also cops or SEIU) get a call that Seth is on route to wonderland ballroom....

Seth Rich thinks he is going to meet with an FBI informant to reveal what he knows, But the FBI is also in on it. They pick him up on route, maybe this is when he was actually talking to Kelsey but doesn't give away too much info and says he is almost home when he runs into the Informants he thinks he is supposed to meet so he does not sound scared on the phone. (I don't know if I even believe Kelsey about the phone call, something seems off about it) They push him in the van and take him to the hospital where they torture him for info which explains the bruising on his knees, face and knuckles. One of the weapons they stole in that lock box was a baton. He might also be drugged on something, he releases the information they need and they pretend like he is free to go, they give him a lift near his house and tell him to get out where they shoot him in the back. They want it to look messy, so they can pin it on a robbery and bonus Hillary can use it in her campaign to push her narrative against gun violence which she did. The hitman drive off knowing that he will either die from the bullets or someone

       you have to scroll down about 10-20% of the thread before you get to the above comment. (or search for "Qb4REtoY"), there are some more comments from that ID. And some other interesting (unverifiable) claims (e.g. "Fentanyl Citrate")

       You need to redefine "work". Try to take away the element of profit, and you'll be much closer.
