      </p>
      <p>
       This is a smoking gun, proving that certain powers-that-be have the ability to wipe out or scramble all of the world's communication systems while maintaining their own communication network, as well as the ability to modify the weather by focusing sunlight on targeted parts of the Earth, using "plumes of atmospheric particles" acting "as a lens or focusing device". What other evidence does one need?!
      </p>
      <p>
       "...
       <strong>
        a plume of altered plasma can be established at selected locations for communication modification or other purposes
       </strong>
       ."

      <p>
       "The plasma of the typical example might be employed to modify or disrupt microwave transmissions of satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If less than
       <em>
        total black-out of transmission
       </em>
       is desired (e.g., scrambling by phase shifting digital signals), the density of the plasma (Ne) need only be at least about 106 per cubic centimeter for a plasma orginating [sic] at an altitude of from about 250 to about 400 km and accordingly less energy (i.e.,
       <em>
        electromagnetic radiation
       </em>
       ), e.g., 108 joules need be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Likewise, if the density Ne is on the order of 108,
       <strong>
        a properly positioned plume
       </strong>
       will provide a reflecting surface for VHF [very high frequency] waves and
       <strong>
        can be used to enhance, interfere with, or otherwise modify communication transmissions

       .

       amounts of power in the earth's atmosphere at strategic locations and to
       <em>
        maintain
       </em>
       the power injection level, particularly if random pulsing is employed, in a manner far more precise and better controlled than heretofore accomplished by the prior art, particularly by the
       <em>
        detonation of nuclear devices
       </em>
       of various yeilds [sic] at various altitudes.
      </p>

       "Where the prior art approaches yielded merely transitory effects, the unique combination of fuel and desirable field lines at the point where the fuel occurs allows the establishment of, compared to prior art approaches,

        it is possible

        what is used to disrupt another's communications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this invention as a communications network at the same time.

       <em>
        far-reaching extent of the effects of this invention
       </em>
       could be employed to pick up communication signals of other for intelligence purposes. Thus, it can be seen that the disrupting effects achievable by this invention can be employed to benefit by the party who is practicing this invention since knowledge of the various electromagnetic waves being employed and how they will vary in frequency and magnitude can be used to an advantage for positive communication and
       <em>
        eavesdropping
       </em>
       purposes at the same time.
      </p>

       "However, this invention is not limited to locations where the fuel source naturally exists or where desirable field lines naturally intersect the earth's surface. For example, fuel, particularly hydrocarbon fuel, can be transported

       Definitely. Definitely describes HAARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is implied is what I understand to be called a "standing wave pattern".
      </p>
      <p>
       What results, in the "cannot be simply waited out" section, is that the frequency of the earth field begins to change towards the frequency of the signal produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're seeing a lot of "why are the Earth's schumann frequencies speeding up so fast in the past couple years?" posts. The answer to that question is this article, itself. They have created, in many places, devices to compliment the "main array" in Alaska we all know as HAARP, and in doing so are essentially creating a binaural beat in the atmosphere, entraining the normal ~7-9Hz schumann frequencies into a higher waveform.
      </p>
      <p>
       (All speculation from here on)
      </p>
      <p>
       If life evolved in one range of frequencies, and we suddenly and drastically change those frequencies, isn't it possible to assume that this might have negative effects on the native wildlife/flora/weather/the ground itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if ramping up this frequency is itself enabling a faster buildup of charge in the sky and ground, causing all the wacky weather and earthquake clusters at previously "dead/inactive" faults?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most cultures have histories of using sound/vibration to enact change, and said that the vibrations changing heralded great changes in the earth. What if, through this technology, we are artificially ramping up the time table to the next "big thing", that would have taken longer to build to at lower frequency, and/or have possibly even dissapated off previously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some stuff that keeps me awake. This thread just made some stuff click into place in my musings, and I felt like I should toss it out there for some enterprising individuals to pick through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm probably just a misinformed asshat for thinking that this proposal of semi-permanent modification of an existing ecosystem in a drastic manner in a short time frame will have some kind of compounded effect on plant and animal life living inside this field. It's probably nothing. Don't worry about it. Everything is fine here, and we've always been at war with Eastasia.

       No great comment &amp; I forgot to thank the original poster too! 😀 Yea I think ESCAT in Norway &amp; I think India, Russia &amp; China have them too. Also have a look around the periphery of Antarctica &amp; you will see thing that look like HAARP. Such an evil concept. I do believe this is to mess with the natural cycle of all life, aid communications, weather modification &amp; last but not least. A missile shield. Super heat the atmosphere in the path of any ICBM Attack.

       Your mention of an ICBM attack made me think of the 2006 CBS tv series "Jericho"! I've never actually watched it, but I read the episode summaries and, wow, now this is all really coming together.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the 5th episode in season 1, "intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are seen passing overhead."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jericho_episodes#Season_1:_2006.E2.80.932007">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jericho_episodes#Season_1:_2006.E2.80.932007
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 6th episode, "An ICBM launched in the previous episode detonates;
       <strong>
        its electromagnetic pulse renders most electronics in Jericho useless
       </strong>
       . The town's citizens slowly adapt to a life without electricity and outside goods."
      </p>
      <p>
       On May 30 of this year, Reuters published an article entitled, "
       <strong>
        U.S. starts first test of key defense against ICBM attack
       </strong>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>

        http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea-missiletest-launch-idUSKBN18Q2E0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The U.S. military has begun the first missile defense test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, firing off an interceptor from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, a Reuters witness at the base said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It could be several hours before the U.S. military discloses whether the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor struck its target. The test came as fears mount about
       <strong>
        North Korea's advancing program to develop an ICBM capability
       </strong>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       According to "Jerichopedia", in the show, "North Korea was a nation in Far Eastern Asia. It along with Iran was blamed by the leaders of the Allied States of America for the nuclear attacks on the U.S.A as a means of covering their own guilt. North Korea &amp; Iran were then hit by the A.S.A's nuclear missiles &amp; completely destroyed."

       I watched Jericho, it's a good series if you are into tv shows. But I more and more believe that these series are just preparing the watchers for something,  numbing our senses, pushing our threshold, and almost like training us for upcoming events. Check out last year's Designated Survivor, it's a good show, but fuckin' frightening at the same time...

      <p>
       I previously made a post entitled "Weather modification patents, HAARP, 'human-induced' global climate change, and population reduction", which focused more on the weather modification aspect, but I thought I would make another post talking about the communication disruption capabilities of the invention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized when reading the description of the invention that this must be HAARP, because HAARP is located in Gakona, Alaska and under "Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention", it says, "...in Alaska, the right type of fuel (natural gas) is naturally present in large amounts and at just the right magnetic latitudes for the most efficient practice of this invention, a truly unique combination of circumstances." Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing how readily available this information is, yet so many people think there is nothing shady at all about HAARP.

       I agree. Also thank you I didn't realise it could be used to disrupt communications to all others while preserving your own. Other countries have HAARP analogs &amp; I think/know those Governments know exactly the raft of things it can do. Kind of like Mutually Assured Destruction. I wonder what other high tech super weapons are hiding in plain sight we are not aware of!

       it lets you do cool shit like ionize a section of atmosphere and use it as an effective radio mirror so you can bounce signals over the horizon without going into the ionosphere where it's affected by sunspot activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       the weather modification and enemy comm disruption aspects  are a bonus.

       What benefit is that when fiber-optic submarine cable systems carry out most of the world's communications?

       "Though fiber optic cables and communications satellites were both developed in the 1960s, satellites have a two-fold problem: latency and bit loss. Sending and receiving signals to and from space takes time. Meanwhile, researchers have developed optical fibers that can transmit information at 99.7 percent the speed of light. For an idea of what the Internet would be like without undersea cables, visit Antarctica, the only continent without a physical connection to the net. The continent relies on satellites, and bandwidth is at a premium, which is no small problem when one considers the important, data-intensive climate research underway. Today, Antarctic research stations produce more data than they can transmit through space."

       fiber optics can't talk to submarines in the south pacific. or ships. or troops on the move. a low atmosphere reflector is quite useful for comm when the target isn't a stationary installation.

       Anyone can file a patent. It's just proof of concept awarded first.

       If you look at "Legal Events" at the very bottom of the page, it shows that the assignor of the patent, as of 2006, is BAE Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to their website (
       <a href="http://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company">
        http://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company
       </a>
       ), they are, "...a global defence, aerospace and security company employing around 83,100 people worldwide."
      </p>
      <p>
       The same page also says, "Our businesses cover everything from electronic warfare systems to intelligence gathering to armoured vehicles."

       Unless they're a company that doesn't want anyone else to become the competition - which is all of them.

       No great comment &amp; I forgot to thank the original poster too! 😀 Yea I think ESCAT in Norway &amp; I think India, Russia &amp; China have them too. Also have a look around the periphery of Antarctica &amp; you will see thing that look like HAARP. Such an evil concept. I do believe this is to mess with the natural cycle of all life, aid communications, weather modification &amp; last but not least. A missile shield. Super heat the atmosphere in the path of any ICBM Attack.
