       So, browsing this sub and reading various posts that pertain in any way to 9/11, I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of contention here about what occurred on that fateful day. What do you, r/conspiracy, think about 9/11? Why do you or do you not believe the typical story about 9/11 is true?

       When you do your research with an open mind you see the cover up before you eyes. The evidence points to it being orchestrated and compartmentalized at the highest levels all the way down to crisis actors. It's mind-boggling to think an event that shaped the 21st century is a lie.

       I don't think anyone who watches WTC7 come down can honestly say they don't have some misgivings. They then cling to any official explanation in order not to confront the appalling truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day itself, I watched the thing unfold but didn't see the towers collapse. I was in another room and my wife came in to tell me that "they are saying the towers are gonna collapse" and I said "no way. It's not possible..." And then they did fall down. I said the bombers must have put explosives in the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't think much about it until maybe 6 months later when I caught a BBC documentary made by the well-respected Horizon team. I watched this and they came out with the pancake theory of the collapse and I sort of accepted that. Hey it's the BBC! Practically the word of god here in the UK...
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until maybe 3 years later that I heard about WTC7 and that was a major wake-up call for me. The fact that even today some people don't know about tower 7 is a red flag in itself.

       I don't believe we landed on the Moon with the technology that was available in the 1960's. If we really went to the Moon, we had access to technology that was given to us by aliens and very advanced. Watch this video. Unbelievable.

       In 6 years of war we took massive technological leaps. To the point that in 1945 we were using basic computers to allow electric guns on the B-29 to compensate for airspeed, lead, gravity, temperature and humidity, and even control multiple guns from a single control. We had fine tuned nuclear technology, radar, and beginning the spade work for more complicated computers. 24 years later following a massive post war boom and development, we more than had the technology to get man on the moon, and we did so several times afterwards until 1972. I think you underestimate the technology we had available to us, and grossly overestimate the technology required .

       You seem to be contradicting yourself. Did we (with ET aid) or did we not go to the moon? I don't really want to watch that whole video right now - do you have a time stamp?

       Jesus. Are you for real? The Moon on the "bright side" is 250 degrees F. The astronauts ran around on the Moon in 250 degree F. temperature. They had this amazing battery powered air-conditioner on their back-packs. I want to know what they used.

       Okay, you're right about the temperature. Didn't know that. But here's some info:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are three ways heat can transfer and only two are possible on the Moon. The first is radiation, both directly from the Sun and from the Sun’s reflection on the surface. The astronauts’ spacesuits were designed to reflect almost 90% of the light that reaches it, so very little heat would have transferred to the astronauts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The second is by conduction from the direct contact their feet had with the surface. This is also an ineffective process as regolith on the lunar surface doesn’t conduct heat well and the astronauts’ boots were insulated, slowing down conduction even further. This shows that even though huge temperature variations occur on the Moon, lunar astronauts were never actually exposed to them.

       History tells us conspiracy theories are bollocks, from JFK, Moon landings, to 9/11, they rely on fabrications, half truths, anecdotal evidence and cherry picking, ignoring all evidence that contradicts them, to fool people into believing lies, buy their book/DVD's/donate money, and turn a profit from peoples ignorance. In regards to 9/11, every single conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked. All you have to do is google what ever the claim is and read the rebuttals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, apply common sense.. why would a government risk treason and death penalty so they can stage an attack, blame Arabs from every country except the one you want to invade, and risk exposure for the rest of your lives by any of the hundreds/thousands of people that would have had to be involved to pull it off? Common sense destroys all conspiracy theories.

       1993 attacked the World Trade Center killing 6. 
1995 Bojinka plot, although disrupted, would have taken down 10 airliners going between Asia and the US and could have killed over 4000 people. It was planned by the same guy who masterminded 9/11 - Khalid Sheik Mohammed.
1996 attacked Khobar Towers killing 19, including US Servicemen.
1998 attacked both US embassies in Tanzania, and Kenya killing more than 200.
2000 attacked the USS Cole killing 17 US servicemen.
2001 9/11 attacks, killing 300,
2002 Bali bombing, 200 killed.
2004 Madrid train station bombing, 192 killed.

       They do it because we've been ruining that part of the world for money.  They don't want us there.  Terrorism is the way they often fight back, but don't assume they are so dumb that they would invite the USA to invade the region by giving them an unparalleled reason to do so.

       UAF's sooper expensive simulation of WTC7 is supposed to lbe released in August. It'll be interesting to see how it compares to the official NIST one, which doesn't look all that accurate tbh.  They even declined to release the raw input/output files so people can verify their simulation, because of "muh public safety".  You even have former NIST employees talking about how half-assed and shady the official report (released like 6 years later) turned out to be.

       Nothing, just explosions. The planes were added in CGI over many different takes. The volume of material edited to show planes makes it seem very convincing, but just like the 'credible non-CIA eyewitness' who says 'oh yeah I saw it all, the building collapsed mostly due to structural failure because the fires were so intense', the handheld footage with edited planes was all filmed by CIA plants. All pilots asked agree that the flights supposedly performed by the airplanes are impossible. And the hijackers were absolutely terrible pilots. There were no planes.

       more often than not i would agree with you, but regarding 9/11, why would they risk treason and death penalty? lol?

       you can get them to write bush a parking ticket let alone trial him for this

       once you're in a position to control who gets treason charges, you do not fear them your self

       and i do too like the
       <em>
        incompetent over malice

       saying but in this case, circumstantial evidence is so huge it would be quite a coincidence if none of that was connected. and by quite, i mean astronomical.

       UAF's sooper expensive simulation of WTC7 is supposed to lbe released in August. It'll be interesting to see how it compares to the official NIST one, which doesn't look all that accurate tbh.  They even declined to release the raw input/output files so people can verify their simulation, because of "muh public safety".  You even have former NIST employees talking about how half-assed and shady the official report (released like 6 years later) turned out to be.

       Using common sense, can't believe 3 towers collapsed on 9/11 because 2 planes hit the upper positions of 2 towers. Using common sense, can you tell me how WTC7 fell?
