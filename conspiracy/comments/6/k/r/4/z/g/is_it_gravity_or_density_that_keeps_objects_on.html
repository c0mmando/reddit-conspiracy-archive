He says that because an egg floats in denser water (salt water) compared to normal water, gravity has no effect on it?

       As I understand it, mass is the function of gravity. You can increase the density of an object but so long as the mass stays the same it is not supposed to affect its gravitational pull.

       You are incorrect. If mass Is another form of measurement in density then why is density=mass/volume? Density is just a measure of how much mass is in a given volume.

      <p>
       Mathematically your statement is Mass = density/volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to help clear a little confusion. Density is a measurement of mass. Not the other way around. This is an important distinction because two objects can have the same exact mass, but a much different volume. Thus the need to measure a specific amount of mass to volume ratio to help in understand why a pound of feathers is so much larger than a pound of bricks.

       Thermodynamics cause gravity, something about the PLUS(+) and the MINUS(-) that makes batteries work in a circuit, also works on a bigger scale, with the Sun dictating the direction.
On a smaller scale, matter seems to obey the same pattern, they heat up, lose tension, rise, repeat.
The fluid energy mechanics seems to circulate in a pattern of a

       Gravity is the weakest of the four forces. Just because an egg floats when there is salt water compared to just water shows that gravity is the weakest force.

       Everywhere in nature the less dense item floats. Even in the sea the ocean is more dense on the bottom, less dense on top, then the air is less dense above it and continues to get less dense with altitude. There is not a single example you will find that shows a more dense item sinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       You even find this in the way a ship works. It has a huge mass, but it floats because it takes up such a large volume that it's density is less relative to the water. It is only when it takes on water, increasing its density, that the ship sinks.

       I don't see how buoyancy of eggs in water and salt water proves the earth is flat. 
All it proves is that salt water has more density thus holds up the egg better compared to just water.

       Things do not float because they are full of air. They float because their density is less than water. Yes it is air taking up the space in a ship, but it floats due to it being less dense. That is why submarines fill their ballists with water to sink. They are making the submarine more dense and then it sinks.

       I think that my initial post made it very clear that I was only asking the question does gravity or density cause objects to fall to earth. You came to the conclusion I was using it to prove flat earth. That wasn't my intention at all. Just trying to figure in my head they answer to why if an object such as the moon is attracted to earth by gravity it does not continue to move towards the earth instead of simply orbiting it. Why does our sun have the gravitational pull to bring our planet into this system but not draw it closer?

       Anybody who questions of the earth is flat needs to buy a sextant and learn to use it.  Sailors for the past few centuries have used this tool to travel across the world. The only way it would work right is with latitude and longitude and a spherical earth.

       Falling, on earth, is gravity.  You aren't falling down you are being dragged towards the earth by gravity.    Density doesn't cause motion at all because it is not a force.

       You are correct density is not a force, buoyancy is. Correct? And air is a a fluid correct? So is it crazy to say that objects in air would descend because their density is greater? Isn't this how a hot air balloon works? It is filled with a less dense material and then rises? If you could somehow fill a cadaver with helium would it not float?

       Bouyancy is not a force exactly.  Bouyancy is a result of a difference in pressure.  The pressure is caused by everything being pulled to the earth by gravity.  And it affects objects differently depending on their density.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more like you standing on the ground.  The ground only pushes you up because gravity pushes you down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So floating on water just means the water is pushing harder than the object.  Water is easier because it is more visible.  A boat pushes Down into the water until the amount of water it displaces equals the weight of the boat.  If you add cargo it sinks lower.  Remove cargo, less water needed to displace and the boat rises.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sinking and floating all happens be in the direction of earth.  Sink towards earth and float away from earth.  That is because all of the forces involved are gravity or opposing gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the moon there is less gravity so the forces are less.  And no atmosphere for buoyancy so no hot air balloons.

       Weird I was just thinking about this. Geocentrists and heliocentrists agree as to why things like clouds and helium balloons rise--they're lighter than air, less dense, so they float. So what makes objects fall down? Let's put a pin in that. We should also agree on what makes objects float/sink in water: buoyancy, essentially density again. Ice cubes are less dense than water so they float, rocks are more dense so they sink. Water and air have a lot in common, no? Why would objects falling not be attributed to density before Isaac Newton blew everybody's tits off by inventing the word "gravity"? 'Gravity' is all you gotta repeat over and over if you want to keep acting like
       <em>
        Rick and Morty
       </em>
       is accurate, but it won't change how water doesn't actually curve over long distances.

       Not while I was in school. I did it the old fashion way, taking college courses my junior year. I don't think the 30 I got on my ACT was a result of them bending the rules for me either. Attacking my education does not dispute anything that I have said. In college you would have learned that this type of fallacy in argument is called ad hominem. If you want to dispute me, dispute me. Try to use observable facts rather than theories that no one can prove in an observable way.

       Density is not changed by gravity. It is changed by differences in pressure. Anything you relate to gravity can also be explained by buoyancy within a closed system. Until someone from a conspiracy forum on Reddit visits space themself, I'd suggest using arguments you can verify yourself, instead of relying on the people who told you we went to the moon.

       What I am saying is that you personally cannot prove that gravity is at play in any fashion. You can repeat things that others have said, you can point to theories about outer space, which only a select few have supposedly ever visited, but you cannot prove gravity. Yet you can prove quite easily that bouyancy is at play both in the water and in the air on this earth.

      <p>
       Also I have a telescope and look up at the night sky a lot. 
I study the planets and their satellites orbits.

      <p>
       Plus the tides rising and falling is directly correlated to the gravitational pull from the moon....

       Can you explain why there are no tides in the Great Lakes? Instead these bodies of water have something called a seiche. A seiche is when a change in atmospheric pressure and wind causes movement. It is already said that the movement of the winds causes change of currents in the ocean. Why would these ocean tides not be a seiche on a larger scale because it is acting on a larger body of water? If the moons gravity was causing tides wouldn't you expect them to be pretty uniform in movement? How does the moon reach across the point of neutral gravity and pull on the oceans? Why does it not pull on the land mass? If it does pull on he land mass why do we not feel it like we observe tide? If the moon pulls the ocean towards it would there also be a measurable pull on the iss every time it is between the moon and the earth? I mean there would have to be right? How could the moon pull on the earth which is thousands of miles further away than the iss but not pull on the iss?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        True tidesâ€”changes in water level caused by the gravitational forces of the sun and moonâ€”do occur in a semi-diurnal (twice daily) pattern on the Great Lakes. Studies indicate that the Great Lakes spring tide, the largest tides caused by the combined forces of the sun and moon, is less than five centimeters in height. These minor variations are masked by the greater fluctuations in lake levels produced by wind and barometric pressure changes.

       The planetary bodies do pull on land mass. You don't feel it because of how minuscule the movement is, and you are on the earth so you wouldn't feel it move.

       Without gravity everything floats. It doesn't matter how dense something is. The density of water only plays a role because a more dense material has more mass for gravity to act upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The air filled balloon has less mass and feels less gravitational pull. Because the water is a fluid, it can flow around the balloon and build up under it, forcing the balloon upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put simply, in the real world more dense objects can be "floated" on less dense objects easily. Take an gold bar and a wooden table. Gravity holds the gold bar on the surface of the wooden table, but the less dense wooden table holds up the gold bar because the gold bar is not fluid and can't flow around the obstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is the force that make buoyancy possible.

       A more dense material does not have more mass. A more dense material only has more mass per volume. If the earth was less dense but contained the same mass, it would only affect gravity from a very close distance. Outside of that it would have the same gravitational force. If a ball weighs 1kg it will still weigh 1kg with an increase or decrease in volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent of one another, the gold bar and wooden table would both sink until they reached mass equilibrium somewhere, correct? Because they are both solids they can rest on one another, but they are still within a fluid, air, which they are more dense than. Therefore the gold bar isn't "floated" on the table, it is at rest because it has met with a solid.

       But in that given volume, a more dense fluid will be able to flow around the less dense object and force it upwards.

       Why doesn't the less dense wooden table "float" on top of the gold bar then?

       It is also a solid which is why water cannot fall through it moron. What is with trying to use solids to disprove what I am saying? Obviously solids do not float on each other nor do they let liquids pass through them whether they are less dense or more dense. These are just idiotic come backs. Every example that has been thrown at me has had just no logic behind it. Why can gold rest on wood, duh because they are both solids. Why can styrofoam hold water, duh because it is a solid. And you guys think I am stupid... bahahahaha

       You literally CANNOT prove gravity at your home, but you CAN prove buoyancy. This is a conspiracy forum? So crazy theories should be allowed. And IF (and that's a big if) there was a firmament keeping our atmosphere in, would air not act exactly as it does with less dense air stacked on top of more dense air until it reaches the firmament and can go no further? Assuming that air is a fluid would not all objects between the ground and the firmament act exactly like they do and sink in less dense air until they meet more dense ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can easily test that a change in density would cause a solid to keep sinking with a brick, some dirt and some water. Place the brick on the compact soil. It will not sink because the soil is dense enough to prevent this. Now take the water and mix it with the soil to create mud. The mud is less dense than the compact dry dirt and the brick will sink.
