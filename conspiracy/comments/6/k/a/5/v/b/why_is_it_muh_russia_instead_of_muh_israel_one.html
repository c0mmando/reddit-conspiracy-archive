<p>Not granular enough. Russia has competing factions, just like the US.</p>

<p>These oligarchs are mostly Western aligned oligarchs.

<p>The &quot;invasion&quot; of Crimea left maybe 5 people dead, with 90%+ of people in favor of secession to Russia.

<p>I didn&#39;t say for the United States. I said: &quot;a political cash cow&quot;.</p>

<p>Politicians in the US are not the US and rarely if ever have the interests of the US in mind.</p>

<p>Israel and the Israeli fetishism is the basis of the US Republican Party. This is why Israel is a &quot;a political cash cow&quot; and will remain so as long as religious superstition is the sole guide of the Republican Party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll only give this one response because I made my point.  </p>

<p>You may want to brush up on your ability to express yourself with clarity.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Israel is the US nuclear weapons platform in the Middle East, as well as a political cash cow,  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifying that Israel is the <strong>US</strong> nuke platform and then using the connection &quot;as well as&quot; implies you are still referring to Israel in terms of its relation to <strong>the U.S.</strong>.  </p>

<p>If you want some help rewriting that it would look like this: But Israel is the US nuclear weapons platform in the Middle East, as well as a <strong>republican</strong> political cash cow...  </p>

<p>&quot;A&quot; implies generally at all times - which my comment addressed.<br/>
&quot;Republican&quot; specifies what you say you intended, but failed to write out originally.  </p>

<p>My original comment stands, and I&#39;ll add this:<br/>
&quot;Political currency&quot; means the level of your reputation with THE PEOPLE. That phrase is NEVER used with the implication of gaining support from a corrupt group of hidden money-funnelers like wall street.  </p>

<p>Politicians don&#39;t bow to Israel to gain political currency - they do it to win favors from one of the most corrupt and subversive groups in America.  </p>

<p>And lastly - your assertion that Israel,worship is a right wing thing is a joke. Most Israeli supporting Jews are on the left.  The right AND left bow to Israel, which decimates your final thought that Israel is OUR military base in the Middle East. You don&#39;t bow to your own creation.  </p>

<p>Israel is a Rothschild creation. Not an American one.<br/>

<p>I think you misunderstood them. Media is saying &quot;Russia Russia Russia&quot; now to get us ready for conflict with Russia. They&#39;re not doing the same for Israel or any other country that exerts influence over our government because they&#39;re not &quot;priming public opinion&quot; toward a future conflict with those countries. </p>

<p>Zionism is almost completely secular in nature. It is a movement of cultural Jews that have a strong affinity for Jews that are also highly observant. Bit Zionism is almost completely atheistic in its conception.</p>

<p>If you are anti-zionist, you are against Jews having a state for themselves. Considering the persecution and death Jews have faced over the last 100 years, I can certainly see how the two terms are linked. Denying a homeland for the Jews would certainly lead to their continued persecution and death.</p>

<p>The book definition of anything is usually bullshit. Look at the facts on the ground. Uncle Noam has taught us that you need to analyze the institutional behavior to understand what the actual purpose of that institution is.</p>

<p>There are perhaps 2-3000 true liberals in Israel. Everyone else is a right wing reactionary with a fascistic mindset. Within that country, the actual fact that there are debates regarding the political rights of the Arab Israelis is prima facie evidence of this supremacism, a natural consequence of Zionist ideology.</p>

<p>Judaism depends too much on genetic markers to not be considered a supremacist in-group.</p>
