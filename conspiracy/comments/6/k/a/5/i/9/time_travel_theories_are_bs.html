<p>The only thing that exists are time loops, these are loops that are felt by people when they are on DMT as an example, time slowing down, people being able to make different decisions in the moment that change the outcome of situations, these are Quantum time loops that exist for some but not for others.</p>

<p>Apart from that, people like Titor and Basiago.. Just myths.</p>

<p>There&#39;d be serious Government intervention of certain people if they had the technology.. People of specific importance as an example, witnesses to crimes who may be brain damaged and so fourth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a great question. Maybe it isn&#39;t an actual thing in the sense that a brick is a thing. Or gravity is a thing. Maybe it is just a useful concept for describing a perception. Kinda like using the word red to describe a color. Red isn&#39;t actually anything, it just gives us a reference point for discussing a detail of observation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time is the same as creation. </p>

<p>You can play and toy with your won understanding of the mechanism. I&#39;ve started to do it recently. Time is more akin to a vast loop, rather than a straight line. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed time repeating itself at several year intervals. Similar things happen in my life that are only divided by years and not context or lesson. Time changes but only with the individual mind. The force behind it remains consistent, malleable and to a degree very personal. </p>

<p>Like a Trillion dollar/year defence spending bill that has nothing but public failures yet continues to produce millions of pages of classified info every year.</p>

<p>Perhaps a Religious Institution which has been involved in education and the majority of scientific discoveries over the last 500 years, also one of the largest land owners with its own banking empire. (RCC).</p>

<p>The only thing that is unlikely is the paradox. A time loop would happen in a paradox situation. Regular travel backwards would create new timelines. Which themselves may be paradoxical in the grand scheme of the universe. Suggesting any interaction with future civilizations denotes the existence of a present time loop.</p>

<p>Now look through history for signs of <em>people</em> or <em>who/whatever</em> coming into an earlier time and messing with the people or politics in it. Keep in mind these people would have god-like powers to the natives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would make sense if the future is probabilistic. QM experiments suggest this. If I were forced to make assign a likelihood I&#39;d probably go with this.</p>

<p>The loop and the paradox are the two weakest elements and hard to rectify. Unless there are multiple systems. For instance the beginning and end exist and cannot be changed (loop), but within that only the present exists, allowing for probabilistic progression from the beginning to the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t and I will explain why you don&#39;t need a 1967 Stingray Corvette.</p>

<p>Take a big cloth. Now make a pocket. The lip of the hole is very light and the bottom of the pocket is very heavy. We call this a gravity well and there are something called Gravitons that shower this pocket cloth pulling everything down. Now run your finger from the lip to the bottom of the pocket. Let&#39;s call this a ray of time, movement and distance. That&#39;s what time is. It is just linear movement as a result of gravity.</p>

<p>Now make another pocket. You now have two pockets chasing each other like two sharks in a whirlpool. </p>

<p>Call pocket 0, World-0-Time-0-2063
Call pocket 1, World-1-Time-1-1999</p>

<p>Now bring the 2 pockets together.
Imagine walking from pocket 0 to pocket 1.
This is time travel.</p>

<p>Now you probably do need a car because the currents of time are very strong and could tear you apart. If you jump off a bridge from a  great height, you are likely to die. But if you&#39;re in a car, at least you&#39;re a little protected from the impact of surfing the ergo-sphere of the two pockets.</p>

<p>There. I just explained time travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t understand the technology yet.  To travel in space is to travel in time.  Faster than light means that you travel faster than change.  It means if you traveled 40 light years away but traveled 73 light years per hour, you would be able to see the effects of the nuclear bomb on Earth as you would be at a point in space earlier than you were created.  Faster than light is faster than creation.  You could travel to that place but you would get back 146 years in the past.</p>

<p>THis is why faster than light travel is a bit complex because you are warping the space around the vehicle so that the vehicle itself is the only thing aging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But time is man-made, is it not? We came up with the concept of time, it wasn&#39;t a constant when the universe was apparently created. So, we could very well be going BACK in time, by the Universe&#39;s laws. Just because the date today is June 30th 2017, and tomorrow will be July 1st, 2017 that doesn&#39;t mean we are moving through time, heading for the &#39;future&#39;. WE created that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? Where is your proof that time travel doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Traveling forward in time is time travel and that absolutely exists.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we just proved that two black holes can orbit each other. So I guess we don&#39;t know about nature as much as we think we do.</p>
