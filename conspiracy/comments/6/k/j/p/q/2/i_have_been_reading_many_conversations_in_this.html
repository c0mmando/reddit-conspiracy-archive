        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...and I am noticing patterns. For one, it seems as if whenever a few users start discussing how we need to stick together and seek truth objectively, one or two users will appear and start bashing Trump or Hillary. This tends to start arguments, and conveniently changes the topic from maintaining our common goal to find truth to fights and calling people &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;lunatics&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, whenever pizzagate or pedogate are mentioned people go CRAZY denying its existence, as if THEY were personally being accused of pedophilia. It is amazing how strongly people deny the POSSIBILITY of any truth to the &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Just a couple things I have noticed. Make of it what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between the Elite class especially Hollywood types being able to systematically abuse children for decades and no one bats an eye.  The fact that sexual predators on average serve 60 months in prison after conviction and their recidivism rate is 75% within 15 years of release which is much higher than other types of criminals.  It really concerns me that there is a clear breakdown regarding how these crimes are handled by our justice system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, it&#39;&#39;s all beginning to fall apart and fortunately for the people of the world, the Aussies have done the unthinkable and <em>charged</em> a Cardinal with multiple charges of &quot;historic child abuse&quot; with numerous <em>living</em> witnesses happy to give evidence under oath and in court -- and going by the past and the way Australian courts deal with such criminals .... is harshly!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/world/australia/cardinal-george-pell-charged-sexual-abuse.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/world/australia/cardinal-george-pell-charged-sexual-abuse.html</a></p>

<p>This cunt Pell has <em>not just</em> been getting away with his fucked up ways, what&#39;s <em>worse</em> was as he was/is the highest &#39;representative of the Catholic church in Australia&#39; ,,, he was also the judge <em>and jury</em> for all of <del>his mates</del> the priests in Oz who <em>have been accused of</em> numerous counts of child abuse as well! No wonder they all kept their positions!</p>

<p>These charges laid by the AFP are <em>very serious</em> and I&#39;m pretty sure this cunt pell is going to end up where he belongs before next Easter</p>

<p>Or he&#39;ll have a fatal &#39;incident&#39; like a heart attack or car/plane crash on his way back to Oz to face the charges not unlike his old pal, Antony Kidman ... <del>poor cunt lol</del></p>

<p>This has opened a Pandora&#39;s box for the Catholic church that&#39;s not going to go away! </p>

<p>Sweeet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, recidivism rates are approximately 72% across the spectrum of crime. I would not say that&#39;s &quot;much higher than other types of crime&quot;. I would agree that the VAST majority of the time that once a criminal, always a criminal. And I also agree that there is a rampant pedophilia problem not just in the U.S. but in the entire world. That is why I joined an anti-human trafficking/pedophilia taskforce.  It&#39;s disgusting and these people need to be taken out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the evidence is quite compelling. If you&#39;re completely oblivious to the history of this type of stuff, then I can easily understand why people brush it off at first glance. But once you dig into it, you&#39;ll see just how disturbing it all is. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re skeptical, just read &quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot; by Nick Bryant and do a little research into the Dutroux Affair. You&#39;ll quickly realize the nefarious nature of what&#39;s occurring and how deeply the tentacles penetrate. It enmeshes law enforcement, the judicial system, the media, intelligence agencies, politicians, etc. This has been historically documented. Once you&#39;re armed with this knowledge, you&#39;ll see the evidence of pizzagate in a new light and realize just how many overlaps there are to historical cases.

You obviously haven&#39;t spent significant time researching the topic and are only parroting the shallow surface perspective of someone with a pre-conceived notion that&#39;s contrary to the topic at hand. The pizza, pasta stuff are codewords that the FBI knows are used by pedophiles, if you read those emails then it&#39;s immediately obvious that they are speaking in code as most make absolutely no sense without there being a code involved. </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that people should be imprisoned just from the emails, but there&#39;s no way you can just dismiss the whole thing if you&#39;ve done the research. There is a fucking mountain of corroborative evidence that should be more than enough to at least validate a serious investigation into the matter. All people want is a proper investigation, I can&#39;t comprehend why anyone would be against an investigation into child trafficking and sex slavery unless they are somehow profiting from it, or they are cowards who don&#39;t want their rose-tinted glasses broken. </p>

<p>Yay, I was hoping you were going to mention that one! That&#39;s actually about a guy at Christmas getting a gift of assorted pasta components instead of his usual gift of various cheeses. It&#39;s incredibly obvious to anyone who actually reads it through, which is what makes it delightful when people try to quote it to me, since it pretty much proves they haven&#39;t actually gone through the archives to read the emails for themselves, only read whatever various forum threads pasted portions of them.</p>

<p>The Pizza stuff is just a tentacle connecting to a larger phenomenon. And yes, there is evidence for it.  Have you not seen Allefantis&#39;s Instagram account? -that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>I spent a good while going down that rabbit hole and saw some really gnarly stuff that was tangentally connected to that IG account. Scary shit. Like the naked corpse of a woman placed on a banquet table with stuffing come out of her vagina while two kids sit in front of it looking kind of scared. The photo looked like it was taken in the 70s or 80s. </p>

<p>There actually is a lengthy list of evidence with sources over at voat but I will get banned if I try and share the link.</p>

<p>Just think about that for a moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I admit it could be an effigy made to look very realistic, the image was so horrific and the inclusion of children made it so disturbing that I really wasn&#39;t inclined to download it to my computer. There were others that I did save to my phone just in case they got scrubbed from the internet (a problem with this subject) and I honestly did not feel comfortable having it. Not because I was afraid it would be incriminating but it just didn&#39;t sit well with me. </p>

<p>And while this one image was particularly horrific it was one of many from multiple IG accounts. So many that it gave the distinct impression that PG was not the isolated instances of a few &quot;creepy guys&quot; but a Culture, which is exactly how James Allefantis has referred to himself and his people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with his work as well Michael Gira of the band Swans who performed in some of his installations back in the early 80s. In fact, I used to listen to Swans almost exclusively for almost 2-3 years straight. </p>

<p>In fact,  I also have been fond of the industrial culture of the late 70s and 80s, Boyd Rice/NON, throbbing Gristle, Survival Research Laboratories and noise music, whatever I could get my hands on. Brighter Death now: the slaughterhouse is a perennial favorite of the genre, though I don&#39;t listen to it much any more.</p>

<p>As a kid I loved Hr Geiger and would flip through his books, awestruck for hours. In fact, as a kid I was totally obsessed with horror films and Gore, Faces of death? lets do it.  -the more realistic the better.</p>

<p>Not just horror but Trash cinema of John Waters and Cinema Transgression of the early 80s NYC underground. So much great stuff! </p>

<p>I was also  fond of the Apocalypse Culture books and Adam Parfrey&#39;s pubilshing at Feral house as well as other underground books and zines like Answer Me! and all manner of satanic occult stuff. </p>

<p>I have always been a voracious consumer of art, media and information and nothing is ever taboo. In fact, the more taboo and transgressive the better. </p>

<p>At least when I was younger, I&#39;m a bit more refined now. Still, no information is off the table and  I will go wherever I can to get to the bottom of things no matter the consequences. </p>

<p>This stuff I have seen on these IG accounts was not &quot;art&quot;,  as far as I could tell and there was a quality to it that really turned my stomach. Much like the &quot;elsagate&quot; stuff. This is not the work of people expressing themselves. this is something else and it is deeply fucked up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my thought on pedogate</p>

<p>i think there still alot of ppl afraid of pedogate and facing that possibilty. its  bitter to swallow and once you do you feel obliged to do somthing about it ... and not everyones ready for that. </p>

<p>or they belive it all and want to save the kids but also advocate for the straight up murder and annihilation of pedophiles.  but then we just end up loosing ourselves in a bloodbath. most ppl and myself included prolly have no idea just how deep this whole thing goes. a part of me is terrified as more and more pedo revaltions come to light. but deep down i know its somthing we must all face together. if we stay silent it will be considered as us giving our consent by TPTB.</p>

<p>idk what the solution is or where this path will lead us but im/we here peacefully trying our best to face it</p>

Comments like &quot;xxxx deserve to hang&quot; are removed, irrespective of who xxxx is (be it &quot;paedos&quot;, &quot;liberals&quot;, or &quot;liars like rodental&quot;) because this sort of violent language is emotive and incites arguments.

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. I think there a lot of things we could do to improve the conversations on this sub... the goal here is to discuss conspiracies, not to promote candidates or political ideologies.</p>

<p>Here are some things we as users could do better:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No name calling... It&#39;s childish and adds nothing to a conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Always respect other people&#39;s opinions / &quot;see the other side&quot;. All of us have different perceptions of reality. These perceptions are based on our life experiences. If you are in disagreement with someone, one of the most important things you can do is understand why that person thinks what they think. If you don&#39;t know why they think what they think, ask them. This is actually a great way to convince them why they might be wrong or to realize you might be wrong yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave your emotions at the door. This sub is for logical, critical and rational thinking. </p></li>
<li><p>Be open to the possibility that people, groups, or entities that you support could be the subject of a conspiracy. Do not take it personal when there is a post or comment that paints something you support in a negative way.</p></li>
<li><p>Be open to being wrong. This is one of the most important traits that anyone can adopt. If you are not open to this, you will never learn anything. With almost every topic in the sub, no one actually knows the truth. You may have a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of something, but you don&#39;t actually know the truth. Conduct yourself in such a way that you are open to being wrong. </p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t have anything substantive to add to a conversation, stay the hell out of it. If you see a controversial post and disagree, but you don&#39;t have any solid facts or evidence to rebutt their claims, stay out of it. Going in to call people names or talk shit ruins this sub, accomplishes nothing, and divides us more. If you do this, you are part of the problem in society, you are doing nothing positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell people when they have a good point, even if it differs or contradicts your own narrative. You don&#39;t realize how effective this is to get people to see your own points and understand your own rationale.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s time we get this sub back to a place where we might actually be able accomplish things. Maybe we can collectively dig up information or put pieces together to break a big story. At the very least we can have adult conversations, find commonalities, understand different perspectives, agree, disagree, or agree to disagree.</p>

It is basically become more aware of dogma and using Korzybskian semantics in language e.g. Instead of &quot;Mozart is a much better composer than Beethoven&quot; you add &quot;Mozart is a much better composer than Beethoven, in my opinion&quot;. Remain skeptical of everything, from what the government says to what a conspiracy theorist tells you - &quot;“Belief is the death of intelligence. As soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops thinking about that aspect of existence.&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Joking aside though, it&#39;s sad people can&#39;t be realistic that no group is perfect. There is actually no best and worst platform. My opinion is that these groups are intentional... They further divide us and coerce individuals to adopt the entire platform of the group. You have to be one or the other... Pick a side. You are either 100% with us, if not, you&#39;re against us. My opinion that very rich, powerful and influential people/governments encourage this divide to better control the masses, and distract from what is really going on might be controversial... But whether it&#39;s intentional or not, that is exactly what it does.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that in conversation, if I say I think single payer healthcare is good, I&#39;m automatically labeled a commy, far left bleeding heart liberal. But then I say that I&#39;m also for secure borders and immediately labeled a right-wing, Insensitive, priveleged white male. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible these days to be respected as someone who sees good ideas on both sides. I hope we can get more people to the middle of the two parties because the people at the far right and left that have a voice. It&#39;s time to give voice to the moderates.</p>

<p>Oh totally. Divide and conquer doesn&#39;t just apply to the battlefield, it&#39;s just the easiest way of controlling populations. </p>

<p>This clip describes it perfectly: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV46U11ZYSg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV46U11ZYSg</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a voice that cares about moderates in a position of power since JFK. Bernie was a step in the right direction, but we all saw what happened with that. </p>

<p>The problem is Moderates are both moderate in policy and attitude. They can see clearly enough to understand that the normal person just wants to live a secure life in which they have enough time to do the things they want to do and can work a fulfilling/rewarding position to help forward the human race. They understand people don&#39;t want radical change, so they end up being stepped all over by Radicals who do. If Bernie would have come out and said to the public that Hillary and the DNC were screwing him out of the primaries then I feel like he could have become the candidate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.</p>

<p>Definitely tough to get representation for moderates. Moderate, reasonable voices don&#39;t get ratings, so they&#39;re never represented in media. I do think moderates are often the ones who decide elections. They are the ones who swing back and forth from slightly right to slightly left... But the choices they have are not moderate. We have to pick between left and right. We never actually have the choice to vote for a moderate or third party. A viable third party would be great, but it&#39;s hard to see that happening because the media is mostly in control of people who don&#39;t want that. My only hope is that alternative media might give rise to more diverse content and opinions. It would have to be influential enough to overcome traditional media though, which might take at least another 10 or more years.</p>

<p>I was all about Bernie... He recognized one of the biggest problems we face: Money in politics from corporate interests and the wealthy, which is basically legal corruption. I support him on that issue alone. His other ideas were okay... Some I fully agreed with, some I didn&#39;t agree with at all. But I would have been behind him 100%. If we could get money out of politics, we would have a government that actually represents the people, no matter what political affiliation you are, this would be a good thing. Right now both party&#39;s leaders are boholden to the Rich and powerful, not the middle and lower class, which are the lifeblood of this country.</p>

<p>I was extremely disappointed with Bernie&#39;s actions and narrative after the primaries, I partially don&#39;t blame him though. I think he may have been coerced, threatened, or felt guilty that he contributed to Trump becoming president. He could have kept his momentum if he stuck with his guns and stayed away from the other candidates. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that many people are upset about Trump becoming prez, what happened this election cycle, I feel like the general public really opened their eyes to a lot of aspects of government they knew nothing about. It divided the country somewhat, but has also motivated many citizens to become more involved and recognize that there are serious problems with the way this country is run.</p>

<p>Secondly, whenever pizzagate or pedogate are mentioned people go CRAZY denying its existence, as if THEY were personally being accused of pedophilia. It is amazing how strongly people deny the POSSIBILITY of any truth to the &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a rather broad statement and it is a lie, trolling even imho. I don&#39;t see anyone, nor have I seen anyone here or elsewhere deny that there are pedophiles and even groups of them that work together.</p>

<p>But the right wing trumpies have tacked on that anyone who like pizza is a child rapist. Pizzagate is fucking stupid. Period. And people know that which is why they are trying to slide into &#39;pedogate&#39; which is an overly broad term trying to imply something on a wide scale that is somehow tied together on a small scale (a &#39;gate&#39; tends to have a few key players). </p>

<p>So when I see those two terms being used I just shake my head. There are many investigations going around, and have been forever, of pedophiles. People aren&#39;t denying the possibility of anything and it is childish and wrong to lie and say they are. What they are doing is protesting the stupidity in the method employed by some which is usually for their own benefit (feeling they are special and have secret information, etc).</p>

<p>The shooter was a nut job, just because he has an imdb doesn&#39;t mean anything (and just about anyone can make one) I know several people who have one. </p>

<p>And then there is the whole &#39;shooting the hard drive!&#39; crap. Easier to wipe it with a virus you have stored on it and even if shot some data can be recovered (and all I have heard is that the &#39;tower&#39; was hit in gunfire, nothing about the HD).</p>
