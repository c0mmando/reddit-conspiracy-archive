        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be undercover journalism but there are so many good opportunities on the table. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We,can all go to any bank and make a fool out the bankers with questions like, &quot;Are you aware that the people found out how you bankers are robbing our communities blind?&quot; Imagine the reaction in the face of the bankers. They would probabaly flip out occasionally. We can take our best clips and put them on YouTube which would further red pill the masses. </p></li>
<li><p>We can go into police stations and ask them if they are aware that most of the politicians they work for are pedophiles. Again, grab the best clips and post it up on social media. </p></li>
<li><p>We can go to our local city halls and tell them we know they are only pretending to serve the people but in reality, they are a self serving mafia. Again, take the clips and post on social media. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is to make it fun by asking questions that contain massive truth bombs that TPTB really don&#39;t want us to discuss. And we will be asking these questions directly to TPTB shills. </p>

<p>If we all do this on our camera phones occasionally, we can catch some nice meltdowns along with other kooky clips (i.e. Being thrown out of the bank would make them look like they have something to hide). </p>

<p>We would essentially be harvesting good clips simply through the power of numbers law. People occasionally get a good clip and entertain and red pill the rest of us. This would also motivate the people if they notice a pattern of movements among the others. It would motivate many to repeat the behavior.</p>

<p>We need to do creative things and this is just one idea that would work for sure. It would feel like a nice kick in the as for TPTB. </p>

<p>Okeefe should inspire us all especially those into journalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are overcomplicating it. I&#39;m simply talking about going to a bank and asking them why they are loaning out 10x the amount of money they have and bankrupting our communities to line their own pockets. The people want to know so I am here asking you. </p>

<p>Very simple, straight forward and honest questions. The issue is that they know they are evil and corrupt so some of them will flip out live on camera. Those flip out moments will tell the audience an entire story which is that these people are in fact guilty of human enslavement using slimy techniques. </p>

Honestly even the bank manager isnt that far up. They have a start amount and they have an end amount, and the numbers have to add/sub/equal a specific number. You would have to go to a banks HQ to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point our energy would be better spent working to raise the number of conscious people in our own society. The system is too big to chip away at in this way, and it leaves a lot of room for false flags, psyops, misdirection and slandering of the truth sayers. That&#39;s easy for them to do.

<p>The idea I should to get embarrassing moments that clearly makes the culprit look like he got caught with his &quot;hand in the cookie jar.&quot; You cat so this to politicians because they are well trained with mental gymnastics to talk their way out of anything but you can do it on their minions. A bank manager is high enough to know how dirty the bankers are. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if most bank employees know but they are so desperate for a job, they just keep their mouth shut. Some of them would even be happy to see us because they want the bank to be caught but they don&#39;t want to lose their jobs so they stay silent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, by all means get out there and get involed, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s practical in most scenarios because chances are any bank manager at your local wells fargo is not some kind of evil person who is going to let any beans spill. More likely he&#39;s just a person trying to pay for his family&#39;s needs. Sure if there are real names of guilty people out there with real evidence of wrong doing this is not a bad idea, but generalizing like you are is a recipe for turning the blame on our own team and not hitting the target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much value to word &quot;practical&quot; because when the masses are presented with complicated ideas, they tend to ignore it. For this reason, we need practical ideas that any Joe can easily understand and do. </p>

<p>The idea here is just to jump start things where random people go on their own time and do their own thing when they feel inspired. This clears up all the hassles of meeting similataneously. It give some people the ability to act on their own without waiting for some central command. Also, organizing willing people takes a long time. It&#39;s better if a few people push on this and they inspire a couple more, and those inspire a couple more, etc..  Before you know it, we will have a wave of people. </p>

<p>Did you see when Bill Cosby almost had a meltdown in public when the people realized he raped many women. That is the effect we want to capture on camera. It&#39;s VERY telling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said be dishonest. If you are interviewing an employee and he stops for 10 minutes to take a shit, you should edit the 10 minutes where he takes a shit and jump right into the interview. Nobody wants to wait 10 minutes so just edit it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except you said to edit like O&#39;Keefe, so you did actually say to be doshonest. Removing context and rearranging to create a meaning that wasn&#39;t actually there is dishonest. That&#39;s what O&#39;Keefe does. So do you want honesty, or do you want O&#39;Keefe? Because those are mutually exclusive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t venture out much, do you? He&#39;s been convicted for this sort of thing before. It&#39;s pretty clear if you watch the completely uncut footage that the conversation that actually took place was not at all like that in the video. That&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t release the full footage unless he has to turn it over in court; his entire narrative falls apart if you get to actually see what happened.</p>
