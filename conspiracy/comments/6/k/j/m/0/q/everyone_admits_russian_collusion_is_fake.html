       I was planning on voting third party until the MSM started talking about what to do against Russian hacks.  I realized that the democrats would take us to war over telling the truth of their misdeeds.

       Hillary had to lose.  Trump isn't great, but there was no alternative.  If he doesn't start going after pedos I fear things will only get worse.

       Except of course the Russians moved into Crimea in February and the referendum occurred in March.  Ukrainians and Russian soldiers fought and killed each other in that time.  You gotta really want to see the world one way to not call that an invasion.  Do you consider the Iraq war an invasion?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a lot of shadiness around the vote, many pro-Kiev Ukranians stayed home in protest and even the UN declared the vote illegal.  When a vote anywhere gets 96% support I'm usually suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Mexico came into Southern California where there was a majority Mexican population.  After much fighting with Americans they gained control of the territory and then declared that it was Mexico.  The Mexican population then held a vote to decide if that chunk of California wanted to join Mexico.  Then it got a 96% vote.  Would that feel like an annexation to you?  Or a secession?

       You keep saying everyone.  And yet everyone does not in fact agree with you.  The FBI director who was fired for investigation Russia disagrees with you.

       The US government having criminal elements does not make Russia innocent.  Wanting to make sure Trump isn't compromised doesn't equate with wanting war.

       I've googled it a lot. Trump is guilty of using botnets and obviously of many things in his past (money laundering, sex trafficking, etc.). But this Russia hacking story doesn't even have circumstantial evidence, unless you consider the IP address of the hacker evidence, which would be silly.

       People keep conflating two completely different things together and it's infuriating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia obviously favored Trump, consequently the state run media will favor Trump. This is the "Russian influences elections", newsflash BBC influences elections too by the same logic, and so does every single politicized news station. This wouldn't even be newsworthy if anti-Trump media wasn't vitriolic.
      </p>

       Then there is the collusion. So far no proof of collusion, the only thing that is known is that the DNC was hacked, supposedly by some Romanian that was part of a russian-based hacking group. It goes cold here, no link with the russian government, it goes straight from Trump joking asking russians to hack "hillary's emails during the campaign" to "Trump colluding with Russians to undermine democracy"
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly it's absurd at this point because the whole thing appears to be the result of poor communication and confirmation bias.

       It was pretty perfect. Whilst everyone was running around arguing back and forth over muh Russia, the PG narrative slowly crumbled away from view
