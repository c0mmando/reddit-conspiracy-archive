<p>This whole thing sucks. If he stuck to past statements and campaign rhetoric, Trumpcare would look a whole lot like single-payer. Instead we have this current nonsense. It&#39;s definitely a side-effect of the GOP accepting all factions under their big tent in opposition to Obama, the infighting is keeping them from getting anything done. </p>

Passing AHCA requires the participation of the whole Party. Don&#39;t let Republicans blame the death and travesty on Trump!</p>

<h1>Effect of AHCA on Americans</h1>

<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017#Health_coverage_and_budget_analysis">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p>I reccomend reading the full article, but here&#39;s some highlights.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/AHCA_Effect_by_Income_Level_v1.png">Visualization of AHCA&#39;s effect on wealth distribution, as of 2022</a></li>
<li>Wealth transferred from below-$50k households to above-$50k households</li>
<li>Number of Americans with health insurance: decrease by 23 million by 2026</li>
<li>Social Security expenditures : $3 billion less by 2026, due to people dying sooner</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures : $77 million more by 2026, due to reduced access to birth control</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pros and Cons of AHCA</h1>

<p><sup><em>Copied from NeutralPolitics/comments/6iul3q//dj98qvv/ from March 2017. Not giving a clickable link here, to avoid bans on cross-subreddit links</em></sup></p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tax cuts on wealthy households. The bill eliminates the surtax on investment income for individuals making over $200k/year or couples making over $250k/year</li>
<li>Expanded avenues to avoid taxes. The bill allows HSA contributions to be higher than they were under Obamacare, raising them to $5000 max a year. (cross referencing sec 121 with the linked statute).</li>
<li>Eliminates individual mandate. The bill eliminates the individual mandate, which is a pro if you don&#39;t like the individual mandate.</li>
<li>Fixes the issue around below poverty line people and the subsidies. Subsidies are available for people below the poverty line, fixing the issue that arose after NFIB v. Sebilius made the Medicaid expansion not be all 50 states.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tax cuts on wealthy households. This could be considered a con if you, like most Americans think upper income people pay too little in taxes.</li>
<li>Massive cuts to Medicaid. The bill cuts Medicaid spending by more than the House plan, which the CBO scored as an $834 billion dollar cut. This cut includes the pre-Obamacare medicaid program, which covers among other things almost 2/3 of nursing home patients in the country. The bill also allows for a &quot;flexibility program&quot; (sec. 134) which would allow states to not necessarily cover pre-Obamacare medicaid beneficiaries. If you think the Medicaid program should be much less generous, then this could be considered a pro.</li>
<li>Cuts to Obamacare subsidies The bill (Sec. 102(b)(1)(B)(i) reduces the benchmark plan for subsidies to a plan covering 58% of someone&#39;s expenses, as opposed to the current 70%. Additionally, subsidies are only available to people making less than 350% of the poverty line, down from the current 400%. Edit: did some back of the envelope math based on current silver versus bronze premiums. My best guess is this would reduce subsidies by $50-100 per month.</li>
<li>Repeals cost sharing reduction program The bill repeals the cost sharing reduction program which provided extra benefits to people under 250% of the poverty line to reduce their deductibles and copayments. Combined with the much lower baseline for subsidies, low income people will probably be left with insurance that requires out of pocket costs they could not possibly afford.</li>
<li>Allows states to eliminate essential health benefits. This allows states to eliminate the requirement that health insurance cover, well, anything. There might be state level coverage requirements in lieu of these - or there might not.</li>
<li>Does not replace individual mandate with anything. The way this is structured could cause a death spiral because it allows people to wait until they&#39;re sick to buy coverage, with no restriction on pre-existing conditions and no penalty for waiting. That could cause a huge adverse selection problem where people sit out of the market, and only the sickest buy coverage, and insurers drop out. This has already been a problem in Obamacare because of the weak mandate. Eliminating it without a replacement, while also reducing subsidies (meaning fewer people would sign up because it&#39;s free or close to free to them) could destroy the entire individual health insurance market. Edit: An interesting article just published arguing that this will cause a death spiral.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pressuring Media to use &#39;Republicare&#39;</h1>

<p><sup><em>Copied from esist/comments/5zl7bk//dez81nu/ . Not giving a clickable link here, to avoid bans on cross-subreddit links</em></sup></p>

<p>[Republicans are] already trying to pin this on Trump. This is why it is important to call it Republicare. DON&#39;T let them pass blame, and DON&#39;T let them off the hook. [...] It&#39;s time to start contacting editors and imploring them to use the term Republicare. Example tweet, and a brief list of editors&#39;, correspondents&#39; and authors&#39; twitter handles:
Call it #Republicare NOT #Trumpcare! We need the party to accept blame and not evade blame by pinning it all on one man.</p>

<ul>
<li>MSNBC Correspondents: @maddow, @Lawrence, @chrislhayes. These people have some control over the language they use on their own programs, and could reach a wide audience.</li>
<li>Slate Chief Editor: @juliaturner</li>
<li>Slate Authors currently using &quot;Trumpcare&quot;: @jim_newell, @JHWeissmann, @jbouie</li>
<li>Mashable Chief Editor: @gittrich</li>
<li>Vox Chief Editor: @ezraklein</li>
<li>CNN Chief Editor: @MeredithA</li>
<li>CNN correspondents who might be receptive: @sallykohn, @andersoncooper</li>
<li>MotherJones Chief Editor: @ClaraJeffery</li>
<li>MotherJones authors currently using &quot;Trumpcare&quot;: @H_Lev, @patcaldwell</li>
<li>The Young Turks Chief Editor: @cenkuygur</li>
<li>New York Times Chief Editor: @deanbaquet</li>
<li>Washington Post Chief Editor: @PostBaron</li>
<li>The Nation Chief Editor: @KatrinaNation</li>
</ul>

<p>I know Twitter isn&#39;t the greatest platform in the world, but it&#39;s one of the most effective ways to communicate with these people. So tweet them. Force the Republican party to take ownership of their shitty ideological war against the working class.</p>
