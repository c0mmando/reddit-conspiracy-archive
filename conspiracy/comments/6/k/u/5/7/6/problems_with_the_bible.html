    <div class="md"><p>Accurate in spiritual truth like how we should act out of love, treating other people the way we would want to be treated, etc. There&#39;s also essoteric truth in the Bible. I believe there are multiple places in the Bible  that reference our pineal gland. There&#39;srophecy in the Bible that has come to pass. The book of revelation talks about a sign in the heavens that many people believe is happening September 23rd. I encourage you to check it out for yourself, don&#39;t take my word for it. </p>

<p>The Bible shouldn&#39;t always be taken literally, it&#39;s a book with layers of truth in it. It&#39;s been purposefully corrupted throughout the years. Christianity&#39;s focus is not the focus of what Jesus taught anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not necessarily philosophy, because it has a spiritual purpose but ok. Lol read revelation 12 and then go look at all the September 23rd prophecy threads. Come to your own conclusions. </p>

<p>Have you ever read the Bible? Studied it at all? Have you studied any ancient text? Most, if not all ancient texts have hidden truths in them. Call it philosophy of you want to, but there are too many similarities to completely discount these works. </p>

<p>Ever heard of the Annunaki? (pretty much the ancient aliens). Did you know there&#39;s a book that was taken out of the Canon that talks about them? The book of Enoch mentions Nephilim, these nephilim we&#39;re Giants who the &quot;Sons of God&quot; created by coming down from the sky and mating with humans. </p>

<p>The Bible wrote about paths in the sea before mainstream science realized what currents were. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some bible prophecies about Israel that have come true </p>

<p><a href="http://therefinersfire.org/recent_prophecy.htm">http://therefinersfire.org/recent_prophecy.htm</a></p>

<p>The flood is being proven right now by Graham Hancock. Despite the flood being mentioned in almost every single religion in the world, mainstream science didn&#39;t believe it happened. </p>

<p>I am not even close to being an expert on this stuff, so I encourage you to look into this on your own. For me there is enough proof to at least give the Bible a little credit. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the Divine inspired word of God, but that doesn&#39;t mean we should discount all of the text. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is actually a mixed bag of truth and fiction. You really have to use common sense to understand what verse is real and what verse is fake. </p>

<p>The stuff about God being a judgemental, jealous punisher is completely fake and has probably been the source of a lot of mankind&#39;s problem. Our cops, teachers, professors, doctors, and bosses think it is appropriate to punish others because they figure that since God is doing it, it must be OK. The closest thing to God&#39;s real personality was Jesus. Jesus tried to clear the air about the the invalid theories people have projected on God. </p>

<p>Also, most of Jesus&#39; life is missing from the Bible. The entirety of Jesus&#39; life is in another book called Urantia. </p>

<p>Even the book of Revelations is only 50% complete. Someone took out the other 50%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some more information that narrows down what you are looking for would be helpful? </p>

<p>The issue of what is attributed to &#39;Jesus&#39; in the new testament, vs. what the differences are between bible versions, are only peripherally related.   All bibles are based on manuscript collections, and scholars making judgment of which reading is preferred.  So to answer a narrow question concerning what &#39;Jesus&#39; said in the New Testament, and to begin to understand the difficulties in answering this question start Ehrman&#39;s book called Misquoting Jesus The Story of Who Changed The Bible and Why.</p>

<p>You can read it here.</p>

<p>There was a group of around 150 scholars called the Jesus Seminar that tried to get to the bottom of what were authentic words and which were not. They were critical scholars, not evangelical or conservative, but you can read up on their work a little bit and methodology. Start at their wiki page.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Seminar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Seminar</a></p>

<p>There are also writings that did not make it into the New Testament, for a variety of reasons.  These are referred to as apocryphal. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enoch is a great extra biblical text that gives context to early Christian and Jewish theology. Enoch And Joshur are two books not in the Bible but referenced making you assume that early Christians knew of these stories. While there is no way to verify the &quot;inspiration&quot; of these texts you can assume there is some good information in there. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t discredit any extra biblical texts I only take them at face value but am intrigued when they get either quoted or referenced in the Bible. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The fact the the &quot;Jesus Seminar&quot; scholars said the gospel of Thomas could be more authentic than that of John just completely undermines anything else they have to say. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? First of all it is not a question of a Gospel being more authentic, rather a question of attributed sayings.  Their argument was that the synoptics share a lot more material with Thomas than with John.  The question is about Jesus sayings, and Thomas is purely a collection of those.    If Thomas shares more with the synoptics, and more of the authentic sayings are in the synoptics, and the number of shared authentic sayings between Thomas and Synoptics is bigger, then it follows that Thomas has more authentic sayings.    </p>

<p>Why does providing this argument undermine everything they say? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they even give their opinions on Paul&#39;s letters? He&#39;s a extremely important part of the NT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were no standalone studies concerning Paul&#39;s epistles, that I know of, by the seminar. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most &quot;apocrypha&quot; can only be dated after the first and second century which would conclude that they are not authentic representations of Jesus&#39; life on this earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logically this does not follow.   Later documents can contain authentic material that is excluded in earlier documents.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly the more one studies the more obvious it is that if someone could disprove the NT or even the OT then it would&#39;ve happened already. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is meaningless.  These are collections of literature from a variety of genres. It is like saying if someone can disprove a library it would have been done.  The statement is meaningless. But, there are plenty of statements in the Bible that are false.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh for sure I could figure it what their argument was but that doesn&#39;t mean it should be &quot;inspired&quot; material. To me that&#39;s the most important thing. John was the final Gospel and unique for very important reasons. I really haven&#39;t seen any evidence that this originated anywhere near the time of the other Gospels. Of course if you want to be validated with other material you&#39;re going to borrow parts of what you want to authenticate with. </p>

<p>That being said it all comes down to how you interpret the evidence. </p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s authentic of the time does not make it &quot;inspired&quot; which is really what this comes down to. I believe what&#39;s in the Bible know is exactly what God wanted it to be and that each word has been placed there for a reason. You obviously disagree which is perfectly fine. </p>

<p>The analogy to disproving a library is blatantly false. The Bible is a collection of works with the purpose of telling the story of the creator of this world from beginning to end. From Genesis to Revelations the Bible was written by multiple people over multiple generations without anyone writing with the idea of creating one complete book. Yet they all succinctly tell their story as well as being apart of the larger story itself. </p>

<p>This is a religious objection.  It already presupposes that the material is &#39;inspired&#39;.    </p>

<p>This is not true at all.   Fist of all its false on the ground that there is no set canon, meaning the very contents of what is and is not in the &#39;Bible&#39; is variable. </p>

<p>The second point is that it does not present a unified story.  There are antagonistic perspectives preserved.  Take for an example the question of justice.  There is an obvious debate internally between the perspective that &#39;good things happen to good people, and bad people happen to bad people, and the view that this is not true.  The disagreement is obvious between the book of Proverbs taken the former perspective while Job and Ecclesiastes take the latter view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion presupposes nothing just because you disagree doesn&#39;t make it religious. </p>

<p>There is a set canon... and has been for over a thousand years just not by you.  The OT was decided upon before Jesus and although their are different sects it&#39;s easy nitpick the finer points of faith due to wide ranging beliefs. Everyone decides for themselves and obviously you and I disagree. </p>

<p>Your example just shows how few people actually study the text. I don&#39;t think &#39;good things happen to good people, and bad people happen to bad people&#39; and neither does the Bible. Whether you look at Job, Jesus, David, Solomon, Jonah, John, or Paul many people who followed God were persecuted. Paul went blind after God spoke with him and also told someone who was meeting Paul &quot;I will tell you all the things he must suffer for My names sake&quot;. Jesus Gods Son was sacrificed for both good and bad... doesn&#39;t seem like a fair deal to me but yet that is how it went.</p>

<p>Just because the Bible says two separate things does not mean they contradict it just means they&#39;re both true. Just because in proverbs it says a diligent man will be blessed doesn&#39;t make Jesus saying making it into heaven for a rich man is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle any less true. </p>

<p>My opinion presupposes nothing just because you disagree doesn&#39;t make it religious. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, what makes it religious is viewing the text as &#39;inspired&#39;, before showing that it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a set canon... and has been for over a thousand years just not by you. The OT was decided upon before Jesus and although their are different sects it&#39;s easy nitpick the finer points of faith due to wide ranging beliefs. Everyone decides for themselves and obviously you and I disagree. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no set canon.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon</a></p>

<p>On top of this, the project of trying to figure out what was in the canon is given up by scholarship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your example just shows how few people actually study the text. I don&#39;t think &#39;good things happen to good people, and bad people happen to bad people&#39; and neither does the Bible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely misses the point.  There are perspectives in the Bible that do hold that view.  The point is that both are preserved. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;aul went blind after God spoke with him and also told someone who was meeting Paul &quot;I will tell you all the things he must suffer for My names sake&quot;. Jesus Gods Son was sacrificed for both good and bad... doesn&#39;t seem like a fair deal to me but yet that is how it went.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religious claims. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because the Bible says two separate things does not mean they contradict it just means they&#39;re both true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, what makes the bible contradict itself is when it claims A and its negation are both true.  A resolution which is simple once you accept that there are multiple perspectives preserved  in an anthology of literature, and that they disagree with each other. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because in proverbs it says a diligent man will be blessed doesn&#39;t make Jesus saying making it into heaven for a rich man is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle any less true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, they both are false.  </p>

<p>Here is a statement of fact.  There is no set canon, there are many different canons.  Moreover, I don&#39;t know what you are objecting to? You just stated that these views that you hold are a matter of &#39;spirituality&#39; and &#39;faith&#39;.  Therefore they are religious views. </p>

<p>You can watch this lecture that highlights the differeces between  deuteronomistic conception of justice, and those found in the wisdom literature like Job here:</p>

<p>I am not interested in  repeating arguments that can be found on any internet forum concerning biblical contradictions.  There are plenty of those.  Nor am I really interested in debating theological interpretations of what the point of Job is.  Did you even read the cycles of dialogue in Job?  How about this, you skip the prologue, and the epilogue and concentrate on what Job&#39;s interlocutors are trying to convince him of, and what Job denies. </p>

<p>I can safely say, you did not read the text.  Here is what I think happened, you know the prologue, and you know the epilogue, but you have no idea what is in between.  Job&#39;s interlocutors want to convince him that he is punished because of evil deeds, and Job denies this through the cycles.

<p>I provided several arguments so far. The party that has not provide any, and instead resorts to inspiration, spirituality and faith is you.   But, I really am not interested in discussing contradictions.  Not because there aren&#39;t any, there are! But because it would concede a certain idea of what the Bible is... that it is a book, that it is unified etc... ideas which are not true. </p>

<p>This is a very interesting topic of discussion.  </p>

<p>You are absolutely right to smell BS with this claim, because it is false.  It is logically flawed to conclude that because the Bible is not the &#39;word&#39; of god then it does not contain anything true about god.   You just have to read, discuss and form your own judgments. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, KJV preference can be based on a few positions.  It could simply mean, one prefers the style and the idioms, over the others. It could mean one is committed to the view that the manuscript collection that the KJV is based on, textus-receptus,  is more accurate, or it can be purely a religious commitment.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The bible has been corrupted, but I can&#39;t really comment on salvation.  I can recommend two more books for you to pursue. One is concerning the KJV.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Textual-History-King-James-Bible/dp/0521771005/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1499021787&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=textual+criticism+of+king+james">https://www.amazon.com/Textual-History-King-James-Bible/dp/0521771005/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1499021787&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=textual+criticism+of+king+james</a></p>

<p>The second is </p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forged-Writing-God-Why-Bibles-Authors/dp/0062012622/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1499022518&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=forged+ehrman">https://www.amazon.com/Forged-Writing-God-Why-Bibles-Authors/dp/0062012622/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1499022518&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=forged+ehrman</a></p>

<p>Or you can bite the bullet and read the scholarly version of the one above:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use he NKJV but they&#39;re all different for various reasons. Dr Michael Heiser(sp) is a good academic to look up. He does a podcast called naked bible that&#39;s very good. He also discusses giants and demons. He&#39;s a great overall source to use.</p>

<p>Seriously every translation is different because of their intended uses. IMO if you want to read the Bible as quickly as possible ESV is probably your best bet. If you want as close to what first and second century Christians used as sources KJV or NKJV are your best bet. But I&#39;m no expert. </p>

<p>Just be prepared because I never had any foundation in Christ or God before He spoke to me to confirm His existence and there was a lot of hate thrown my way. Prayer, reading the Bible, and fellowshipping with family that is looking to live for Christ each day are the best ways to know God better. Jesus is amazing and following Him is the only way to truth and wisdom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh for sure I could figure it what their argument was but that doesn&#39;t mean it should be &quot;inspired&quot; material. To me that&#39;s the most important thing. John was the final Gospel and unique for very important reasons. I really haven&#39;t seen any evidence that this originated anywhere near the time of the other Gospels. Of course if you want to be validated with other material you&#39;re going to borrow parts of what you want to authenticate with. </p>

<p>That being said it all comes down to how you interpret the evidence. </p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s authentic of the time does not make it &quot;inspired&quot; which is really what this comes down to. I believe what&#39;s in the Bible know is exactly what God wanted it to be and that each word has been placed there for a reason. You obviously disagree which is perfectly fine. </p>

<p>The analogy to disproving a library is blatantly false. The Bible is a collection of works with the purpose of telling the story of the creator of this world from beginning to end. From Genesis to Revelations the Bible was written by multiple people over multiple generations without anyone writing with the idea of creating one complete book. Yet they all succinctly tell their story as well as being apart of the larger story itself. </p>
