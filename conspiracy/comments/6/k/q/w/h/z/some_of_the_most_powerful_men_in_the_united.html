       Woodrow Wilson said this is 1913--the same year he signed the Federal Reserve Act into law, enslaving us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That same year. Teddy Roosevelt wrote “Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more examples of US presidents making these types of statements. JFK's
       <em>
        The President and the Press
       </em>
       comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are they talking about? International bankers? Organized crime networks that have infiltrated government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly the old Bill Hicks bit about being elected president seems more like truth than humor:

         The Jewish Story Behind the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       By Roger Lowenstein November 29, 2015
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        FORWARD
       </em>
       does NOT dodge the Jewish issue at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far from being "embarrassed" by the Jewish Origins (and dominance) of the Federal Reserve, they display it as a Crown Jewel in Jewish achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, they even go so far as to imply that "The Fed" has had a POSITIVE effect on the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why so many Jews behave as if it is a "dirty secret" is a puzzler, to be sure.

       I think even mentioning the word turns people off.  It defeats your purpose to put millions of individual people under one descriptor.  There may be a tradition within Judaism that promotes extremely immoral behavior but to blame every single person just because they were born is ridiculous and makes everyone here seem like an idiot.

       That's the point of these types of statements. To shut down debate as it looks like anyone believing it is anti-Semitic.

       Okay. I do want to discuss this with you guys, but right now I have a throbbing headache. Here is what I posted 7 days ago,and I think I was "on the money".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I think Kushner went to see Bibi to ask for help in the Russia investigation. Kushner is just like Trump. They both live beyond their means by borrowing more money than they can pay back. Kushner borrowed billions of easy dollars from Russian banks, and he is hoping Bibi will pull a few strings and get him off the hook when the truth comes out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bibi may have agreed to "take care of it" for Kushner, and in turn the Trump administration will let Israel build all the settlements they want to. "The Art of the Deal".

       Wilson had an affair with another woman while he was married to his first wife. The Zionists used this to blackmail him. This is pretty much standard conspiracy info. They got him to sign the Federal Reserve Act; he appointed the first Jew on the Supreme Court, and he drug America into WW1 for the Jews. The Jews made a deal with Britain that if they would get America into the war, the Jews would get Palestine.

       There are many theories, and no one truly knows. I think what they are talking about is the Holy Roman Empire, and the forces behind it. A spider web of bankers, secret societies, assassins, organized crime, politicians, "holy" men, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory that I think holds the most water, after all these rabbit holes is the theory of the Tri-Sovereign States (City of London, District of Columbia, The Vatican).
      </p>
      <p>
       DC is the military wing of it, hence why our military dominates. City of London is the Banking, and the Vatican is the Religious. All are Roman Corporations, controlled by ancient bloodlines via the Black Nobility. Dating back to Egypt, Babylon, and Sumeria.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more to the theory, in the ancient age, but I rather not write a wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ponder this as we go into the 4th of July, if you are a US citizen. Did we actually win our freedom from the Crown? The treaty of Paris may say otherwise....

       Here is a post I made with lots of info (text/video):
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/695cz9/the_two_bloodlines_of_cain_and_abel_the/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/695cz9/the_two_bloodlines_of_cain_and_abel_the/
       </a>
       as kind of an introduction into the theory. Also, I highly suggest watching the documentary:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZYB_IOqeOE">
        Ring of Power.
       </a>
       . It's a long documentary, but I highly recommend.

       Whenever something like this starts with bad English, I immediately nope out. If it was done by any serious researcher or scholar of history they wouldn't use bad English. And even if it was foreign propaganda they would at least have someone properly schooled in English proof read it.

       Not everyone can afford to have a translator... But I guess go ahead and ignore whatever you want. The president of the nation that is holds the highest population of native english speakers tweets: "covfefe". So there is that....

       Watching an amateurish video of obviously dubious origin would only add to someone's ignorance.  You have to be selective about this sort of stuff and vet what you choose to get behind - otherwise you're just another gullible pawn.

       You're a hypocrite as everything you've thrown at me you've been guilty of yourself. Take me to task for rejecting something that can't pass a smell test when you haven't watched it yourself. And unless you're a juvenile troll that's nonsensical. And you've made as many reddit boxes and never made a valid point of why someone should watch the thing other than you think they should when you don't even know whether it has merit or not.  Adds up to nothing.

       this video is quite a train ride. the link above is where it describes the tri-sovereign states the guy above you referenced.

      <p>
       the video later goes back to ancient egypt and how the hebrew bloodlines have gone through history, how the banking cartel started, etc.

       It was a Zionist plan to reclaim Israel. They groomed Hitler for the position when he was "imprisoned" in a palace for a few years. WW2 was instigated and then it began. The Zionists then went to European leaders and basically said "we'll bring America into the war and win it for you if you go along with supporting the creation of the state of Israel"

       Almost none of the jews that died in the holocaust were racially hebrew. Important to differentiate the race from the religion.

       Do you really need a source? Modern day Hebrews have a lot of similarities with Arabs as far as their looks go, yet all these Polish Jews (to name one example) who went to America are all blonde, blue eyed types. Old Rothschild, Soros, etc, they do not look like what we assume the Biblical or Modern Day Hebrews look like.

Two-three hundred years ago, they moved steadily eastward, and settled in their current communities. As noted in the wikipedia article, Hebrew has not historically been their first preferred language (evidently this has caused friction with the Sephardi, or Spanish/Iberian Jewish community), as they speak

       He'll probably tell you to google it, to do your own research - but the truth is he needs it to be true, because otherwise, his narrative shatters.

       Richard's theory about who shot Kennedy is correct, but his information about the Nazis is fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact about American financing of the Nazi party: one of the banks in Manhattan that was shut down for Nazi financing under the Trading with the Enemies in Wartime Act was Union Banking Corporation. Its managing director at the time: Prescott Bush. George H. W.'s father and George W's grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prescott was not charged with any crime, of course.

       Holy shit that's insane, it really explains the Abrahamic religions and how they all tie in to Egyptian history. It's crazy to know this conspiracy because it actually makes a lot of sense. I highly recommend the documentary, it has me sucked in while way through, 4 hours well spent.

       You're welcome, and indeed it's a mind fuck. Once you go down this rabbit hole, you will see everything completely different, and it will change you. And, people wonder why I have the views and sentiment that I do... Well, this is why. What if everything you've ever been taught was a complete lie? Truth is truly stranger than fiction.

       You tell me if some ancient document other than our constitution dictates our future.  Once the united states of the United States of America see their unified power, there won't be a star in the sky that could overcome that brightness.  Until then, let those that think they have power continue to believe that the shadows give them cover and that their secrets give them safety. Carry on and invest in sun screen. :)

        "The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. … For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed." - JFK

       Lol. No he isn't. He's talking about something far, far above the USSR. He was talking about the emerging global state, and it's corrupt global economy, that was lucrative enough to get national leaders to sell out their peoples and their countries.

       Kennedy talked about a conspiracy to spread communism to the press. He told them he would never limit free speech but asked them to be careful about making state secrets available to enemies. Your response to this is, "The Press was in JFK's pocket."

       No, it's obvious he's not. You know how he's not talking about the USSR?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Because calling communism a monolithic conspiracy makes absolutely no sense.
       </li>
       <li>
        Because he said around the world, meaning every place on earth.
       </li>
       <li>
        Because saying the USSR (or any country for that matter) is using covert means to expand its influence is literally like saying water is wet. Unless you consider JFK an idiot when it comes to speeches I'd say there's more to what he's saying.
       </li>
       <li>
        Because no one in their right mind would ever refer to the Red Army as "guerrillas by night" rather than "armies by day"
       </li>
       <li>
        It should be obvious that he's
        <strong>
         not
        </strong>
        talking about a country or a political theory (Communism) by the wording he is using. He's talking about something that controls countries like the USSR.

And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire." ~ Winston Churchill, stated to the London Press, in 1922

This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds' central banks which were themselves private corporations.

       But he explicitly talks about "military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operation" those are operations that only a state can perform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he says that "it" conducts the cold war:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So yes, in this speech it's pretty clear that he's talking about the Soviets. He's harping about guerrillas and covert operations and secrecy because that's what the Cold War is all about. Remember that the domino theory is still valid at this time and the red menace is looming at every corner of the world. You don't know who's a commie and who isn't, it's basically a worldwide conspiracy, even your neighbour can be a Communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other quotes form a different picture but this speech doesn't.

       Actually is sounds fantastic. It's a salary cap. High earners should reinvest into the community, not hoard their wealth like barons. The only reason men strive to earn more and more and more is that its a way for those dorks to measure dicks.

       This. Literally, the Good Old days were created from this post war boom. I am not sure if it was planned, or it delayed the PTB's plans, but it has taken generations to whittle back down to where most people's buying power is now near depression era.

       First we should talk about about the fact that the people who control the money supply siphon unimaginable amounts of wealth back into their own hands while "producing" literally nothing. Especially these days when they can just press a few key strokes to create loans from nothing -lazy bums probably don't even write actual paper ledgers any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that fact is addressed we can talk about whether or not taxation is theft. The way it works now though, it literally is because a big chunk of your taxes goes to paying down the interest on govt debt that was loaned to them out of thin air - and socialists seem to think cutting off their own leg is worth it if it means some rich guy has to cut off a fingertip.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, none of that is an endorsement of the mainstream so-called "free market" Right wing: pro-bankster, pro-corporate welfare, pro-mil ind complex, etc.

       Why don't our politicians think this way?  :(  (I know, the PTB don't care about our traditions and ideals if it interferes with their control, and they own the politicians.)

       If you listen to the ENTIRE speech, he is clearly talking about COMMUNISM.  I know if taken out of context that quote is awesome and I thought he was talking about a "shadow government" after I heard it the first time (I think it was on "A Rich Man's Trick".  Great documentary btw, but the writer clearly had some pro-JFK bias).  I can see from the upvoting and downvoting that I wasn't alone in this thinking either.  All I can say is when something seems to good to be true, like this quote, at least get some context.

       Or that could be the presupposed context, one that he wanted people to believe in, in order for his words to be understood only by those that know what's going on (or at least suspect that's what's going on) . I doubt that he would actually state something like that and openly contextually relate it to the hidden powers that be in the background (he would be ridiculed and probably killed even faster - this way he at least had an excuse, he could say he was talking about communism) .
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, that's just a theory. I could be mistaken and he was talking about communism.

       They are the fallen angels that rebelled against God. Invisible spiritual beings that have been alive for at least thousands of years in a spiritual realm around us. They are an army with a commander who we think of as the Devil, who is a high-order angelic being that controls thousands if not millions of lower angels who are working together to create a world where one man can rule over everyone, the Antichrist, who will be possessed by the Devil.

       Unfortunately it's impossible to get to the bottom of all of this without bringing up the extraterrestrial connection. This has been a pervasive influence since the dawn of time. I also find it difficult to discuss without bringing up spirituality, as much of what truly controls us is hidden/esoteric knowledge from the mystery schools. Everything that has been referenced above is just infrastructure, not the root/source.

       The bloodlines are just planetary custodians. I believe we're on the same page though. Unfortunately most people need something more tangible to wrap around their minds. I just prefer to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes. It makes most sense to me that everything eventually leads a spiritual or non-physical domain. The material world is more or less an illusion or deception (depending on how you look at it), but that is perhaps a discussion for another time.

       I agree that it is weird to incorporate the spiritual realms to our discussions but we need to understand that reality is not seperate. All things are connected. You cannot talk about the material realm without considering the spiritual realm, so yes, they most definitely have connections/ambitions/goals that have to do with other dimensions.

       What I wanted to say in my previous message is that, even so, what matters the most, what should interest us the most is how they go about their business, how they enslave us, how they operate under complete immunity and anonymity. When we understand the how, we can come up with better alternatives that serve us instead of them.

       Why make a conspiracy out of that? Yes there are obvious problems with the political and economic system in the USA and pretty much everywhere else.
But instead of acknowledging that simple truth and looking for practical ways to change it and work to make things better you draw up this vast global conspiracy that is too deep rooted and powerful to ever do anything else but complain about it on the internet and patting each other on the back for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think truly you have found something that is truly wrong with the world the next step should be to look at how you can take steps to make things better. And that involves breaking things down and looking for a place to start. If you treat this huge injustice you see as some kind of ambiguous far away concept that is like wanting to become a singer and then instead of starting to practice just talking about how difficult it would be to manage your career as a world star using that as an excuse to not practice at all.

       Did this make it to r/all? Do you not understand that a group understanding of the scope of a problem is required ?  How else would one delegate responsibility in an efficiently suitable way to satisfy the requirements of said problem if the scope wasn't well defined via interaction?  Perhaps the non existent problem will graciously hand out flyers informing everyone of all the evil shit they have done and are continuing to do.  Then we won't have to talk.  Then maybe people would know what the fuck they are supposed to do.  Get this, that is unity.  Lean not on your own understanding.

       A group understanding of a problem would be a great start to tackling a lot of problems but that is certainly not what people in this sub are doing. You cannot seriously think that a sub like this is actually raising awareness for real tangible problems. All you are doing is perpetuating a world view that makes it easy to ignore those real tangible problems and instead create these bizarre caricatures of them.

       You are posting on a thread that says our leaders are scared of some unknown problem.   At least comment regarding the subject.  Everyone here knows that their part in a functioning society is smaller and less exciting than bringing down the bad guys, but I see no reason why we can't have conversations in our down-time where we discuss bigger supposed issues. Maybe someone who can make a bigger impact at the higher levels might stumble upon some information that makes their job easier.  You never know!

I don't think driving people away from their beliefs is their aim (if they even really believe these things themselves), but it sure is the result.

       I started disliking Hillary Clinton more and more as the US elections progressed, but most of that dislike has been undone by the continuous attacks from TD supporters.

       Exactly. I don't understand why people here whine about T_D people posting on this sub. Is it really surprising that people that distrust the media and believe in a 'deep state' wouldn't also subscribe to r/conspiracy?

       They didn't come up with the ideas, but they're sure trying to shove them into the mainstream. There are real conspiracies between corporations, banks, etc. but that points to underregulated capitalism being a problem, so it must be (((something else))) instead. We can't risk hurting the job creators, right?

       Why would one existing result in socialism? That doesn't make any sense because the way it is now, they have a ridiculous level of control and profit, but that would have to be shared with the middle and lower classes under socialism.

       while i do think most of the world/systems ills are due simply to greed, how can you so dismissive of the numerous other forces us simpletons struggle to explain? Bilderberg....bohemian grove....trilateral....skull and bones....there are obviously some satanic rituals out there the people high in power participate in.....there is clearly a pedophilia ring that has been covered up again and again again, boystown, the breaking one in australia now, the church...belgium...
      </p>

       How is simply "greed" the explanation. Personally I think greed uses what i have outlined above, and not vice versa.

       IMO it's mostly because those trappings automatically gaslight any conversation about the ruling elite. To a normal person it doesn't matter if you're 100% factually correct, you sound insane when you start talking about satanic rituals, pedophiles etc and they tune you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think those things are also great distractions. They're the classic moral panics, they evoke far more of an emotional response than a logical one, and they dominate discussion. Throw a pedophile in your organization, John Podesta for example, and then throw him under the bus when you face scrutiny for something less titillating than kid fucking.

       Satanic rituals could easily still be possible. You have to understand that a small group of people with psychopathic tendencies could easily still have some occult systems as a form of practice.  Even if you feel that the metaphysical aspect of these practices isn't real, the only thing that matters is that they believe it's real (even though my personal opinion is that the metaphysical aspect to these rituals holds a lot of truth to it and is closer to reality than people might think) .

       It think it is sad that so many people in this sub seem to be living in this thought prison because of their worldview. You are using these conspiracies as an excuse to not have to seriously confront yourself with real actually solvable problems. But solving real problems that exists in our world takes more effort than creating theories about how all of those problems are caused by things so far out of your control you might as well do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have this realisation that things in your life and by extension in society or the world in general are going wrong then the next step is to analyse it from the top down until you reach a level where you as an individual can start making a change. What most of the theories are doing is only creating more steps between you as an individual and the change you want to make in the world. They make it easier to justify not changing your own behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine there is an election that is decided by one vote but you didn't vote for your party but you didn't vote because you had this theory that the vote is rigged by the opposing party anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or imagine you are looking for a job and you don't get any interviews but instead of changing your resume or looking for ways to make your applications stand out you tell yourself that they are somehow discriminating against you based on this theory you have.

       Or how about open discussions on boards that people frequent in their own time is not an indicator of anything other than an open discussion. Speaking about the problems of this world starts at examining the entire problem.  Until you know the whole picture you should ask questions, seek clarity, and shut the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, projecting your emotional response to an opinion piece onto others is something you should do to your mother.  Yes, change starts locally, but a collective understanding of the problem is required! So please, spare us, and let a conversation take place.  And go get a real job.

       Exactly what I said. You are putting off action to an indefinite point so far in the future you might as well not be taking action at all. Go ahead. Ask more "questions" and seek clarity so you can justify sitting on your ass for a little longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realise that you will never get the full picture or absolute clarity. If those are the requirements for you to take action as an individual then you will never take action. You have to realise that you are making excuses here.

       You are not doing anything by sitting on Reddit (supposedly - and by your own admission,) but you're actively trying to stop public discussions.  Why?  Stop being a hypocrite and get out there and change the world, little buddy!

       When you look at the context of a lot of these quotes, like Kennedy's speech about 'secrecy,' what they're talking about is a frustration with another power. Powerful people don't feel in control so they complain about it.
       <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx">
        To Kennedy that outside force was communism.

      <p>
       Wilson's speeches were collected in 1913, but he was saying this in 1910 to 1912. If you read the quote
       <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA13&amp;amp;dq=%22Since+I+entered%22">
        in context
       </a>
       , he's talking about monopolies and other entrenched businesses preventing new competitors from entering markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, you should find out how the Federal Reserve actually works. Saying that it is "enslaving us all" is ridiculous propaganda.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That same year. Teddy Roosevelt wrote “Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is from the

        1912 Progressive Party platform.
       </a>
       . It's talking about "the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics," that is, big business buying influence.

      <blockquote>

        There are many more examples of US presidents making these types of statements. JFK's

        comes to mind.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       JFK was talking about the international communist menace. He was saying to the press,
       <em>
        we hate secrets but sometimes they're necessary. Don't forget who the real enemy is. They don't play by any rules and don't have to answer to anybody.
       </em>
       JFK asked the newspapers to censor themselves on national security questions since we were not in a declared war.

       You are posting on a thread that says our leaders are scared of some unknown problem.   At least comment regarding the subject.  Everyone here knows that their part in a functioning society is smaller and less exciting than bringing down the bad guys, but I see no reason why we can't have conversations in our down-time where we discuss bigger supposed issues. Maybe someone who can make a bigger impact at the higher levels might stumble upon some information that makes their job easier.  You never know!

       Does anyone feel like revelations are kept to a minimum based on the fact of presedence? Meaning, if someone really knew the finite details about
       <em>
        insert any major conspiracy of the 20th-21st century
       </em>
       that person would be ostracized beyond belief, until that person retracted their statements. So if this person speaks up, what makes TBTB not create a strategy to immediately discredit him/her. Blackmailing in essence to me is the key why plain as day "conspiracies" have actual traction to some but never gain mainstream traction over the fear of being either blackmailed or have your name slandered and drug through the mud. To me Wolfgang Habib is an excellent example.

       This is what's so hard for me to understand, and the only remaining place for me that feels inclined to critique people's worldview as being "conspiratorial."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only understand the world in terms of empiricism and incentive.  I can understand "pizzagate" type situations because the incentive is clear.  You want power, you set up a system of blackmail.  I can even understand things like George Soros because he's a Jew and evolution acting on a parasite tribe for long enough and you have a people able to act in their group interest at all times seemingly in concert without ever having spoken about it in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this Illuminati, Rothchild sicko shit with the satanism and the Moloch and the Eyes Wide Shut Parties.  It just does not compute.    Without adopting some metaphysical worldview based on demons and evil instead of nature and incentive it just makes no sense for me.

       Whenever something like this starts with bad English, I immediately nope out. If it was done by any serious researcher or scholar of history they wouldn't use bad English. And even if it was foreign propaganda they would at least have someone properly schooled in English proof read it.

       Okay. I do want to discuss this with you guys, but right now I have a throbbing headache. Here is what I posted 7 days ago,and I think I was "on the money".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I think Kushner went to see Bibi to ask for help in the Russia investigation. Kushner is just like Trump. They both live beyond their means by borrowing more money than they can pay back. Kushner borrowed billions of easy dollars from Russian banks, and he is hoping Bibi will pull a few strings and get him off the hook when the truth comes out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bibi may have agreed to "take care of it" for Kushner, and in turn the Trump administration will let Israel build all the settlements they want to. "The Art of the Deal".

       Yep, war is one of the most profitable economic sources in the world, and humans are dispensable to big governments.

       But he explicitly talks about "military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operation" those are operations that only a state can perform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he says that "it" conducts the cold war:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So yes, in this speech it's pretty clear that he's talking about the Soviets. He's harping about guerrillas and covert operations and secrecy because that's what the Cold War is all about. Remember that the domino theory is still valid at this time and the red menace is looming at every corner of the world. You don't know who's a commie and who isn't, it's basically a worldwide conspiracy, even your neighbour can be a Communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other quotes form a different picture but this speech doesn't.
