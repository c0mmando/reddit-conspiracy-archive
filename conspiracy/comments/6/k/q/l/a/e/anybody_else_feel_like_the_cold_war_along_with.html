        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about this. The way they portray it, or the way that is the standard that is accepted by the masses, is that Russia is our kind of &quot;bad guy&quot; or rival so to speak. </p>

<p>We were told after WW2, Russia (Soviet Union) and the US were the two remaining global superpowers that emerged, and were immediately sworn enemies. </p>

<p>The leaders of Russia, often criticize us and our leaders, giving a sense of &quot;hostility&quot; between the two. The leaders of the US do the same to Russia. </p>

<p>Both countries have nuclear weapons, as well as aggressive tendencies, and those threats are often used to keep The general populations of both countries fearful. &quot;The Red Scare&quot; for example, the communism hysteria that was most certainly a ruse the social engineers came up with to keep the Us population in fear, much like War on drugs and Terrorism...the &quot;bogeymen&quot; that threaten our safety and freedoms.</p>

<p>But we all know, it&#39;s the ECONOMIC systems that matter, and who is in control of those? Largely, I would guess the same people who run the federal reserve system, also have influence over Russia&#39;s currency. They reflect a similar propagandized country, controlled elections likely, few civil liberties, generally what the establishment wants. We all know almost every country has a rigged financial system, a &quot;New world order&quot; that stretches the globe is very much present and alive today. <strong>Why do we think Russia is exempt from this? Because we &quot;hate&quot; them? They&#39;re the &quot;bad guys&quot;?</strong></p>

<p>Is this all just bullshit? Everyone here thinks Putin is like a great guy, and listening to him speak, yes I Am charmed by some of what he has to say. However I can&#39;t bring myself to trust a politician who is so powerful and in control of so much wealth and so many people as he is. </p>

<p>Can we at least consider the Russia-US relations and the hysteria generated by it is bullshit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to believe this was the case. I&#39;m sure there were some legitimate ideological differences but I believe both sides used the threat of nuclear war to fatten up the private and military industries while giving each other a wink of acknowledgement that this perceived imminent all out war was very good for both sides. If we&#39;re really so worried about Russia then why would we sell them rights to up to 20% of our uranium reserves? I&#39;m not sure of much these days.</p>

It used to be, if you took it in the ass, you could be reviewed by the &quot;committee&quot;, and you would be considered for an important part in a movie which would make you famous. All of your Gentile actors who are famous have sucked Jewish penis. All of them. John Travolta wasn&#39;t lying. Let me ask you: Would you suck a Jew&#39;s dick  to get a shot at stardom?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you look into the works of Antony Sutton. He has written a number of meticulously researched books, based on primary source material, that destroy the dichotomy between capitalism and socialism including &#39;Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution&#39; and &#39;The Best Enemy Money Can Buy&#39;. </p>

<p>Part of his 1972 testimony before a Republican National Committee encapsulates the conclusions of his research, and his refusal to remain silent on the subject led to him parting ways with the Hoover Institute:</p>

<p>&quot;In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet technology. Almost all, perhaps 90–95 percent, came directly or indirectly from the United States and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries have built the Soviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive construction job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been carried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance&quot;</p>

<p>In the 40-50 years since his books were published, the contents have never been disputed or disproved. Given the fact that his revelations came at a time when US troops were dying at the hands of the Soviet armed Viet Cong, it&#39;s no wonder his work was ignored.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_C._Sutton">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_C._Sutton</a></p>

<p>The bibliography section of his Wikipedia page has links to online versions of a number of his books, and I highly recommend you check YouTube for videos of his interviews/lectures. They&#39;re few in number, but very much worth your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Considering how much Russia lost during WWII, I&#39;m a bit hesitant to include them in the following, but I think they slot into the ideas just as easily as the post-war US).</p>

<p>The Allies &quot;defeated&quot; the imperialist fascist countries during WWII-- then decided, almost across the board, to become borderline fascist themselves, adopting flavors of nationalist ferver, spreading the reach of security forces against their own people, adopting the medical/occult obsessions of their former adversaries, hiring scientists doing ethically dubious work, we all know these stories. Then they played proxy war games for forty plus years. The spoils of war economies/the M.I.C./the Space Race never really stopped, and it&#39;s hard to claim this wasn&#39;t by design. Stopping the spread of bloody communist revolutions also meant supporting mass killings by natives and practicing our own enforced imperialism (in addition to the clear corporate imperialism the US is famous for), all under the guise of &quot;saving the world from communism.&quot; In some cases, the US IC probably did save innocent lives and fought off bad actors-- in others, not so much, and then you have nightmares like Cambodia, which the US helped fuel. </p>

<p>The Soviets utilized the other side of the ideological coin to fuck with foreign nations and systems in the guise of &quot;saving the world from capitalism,&quot; in addition to managing their emergent empire of puppet states (some more totalitarian than others though all ultimately under the fiscal and social thumb of their master state, sound familiar?). They too did good at times but plenty of bad. </p>

<p>Because everyone knew since the early 50&#39;s that further nuclear warfare almost ensured global catastrophe, this was constantly dangled as a scare tactic by both &quot;sides.&quot; It really is the ultimate scare item, &quot;support your country 100000% or risk the end of the human race,&quot; even Orwell didn&#39;t dream of such a weapon of adherence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that at a certain point, both sides realized the Cold War was great for business, though by the late 60&#39;s respective populaces came to see through this facade in part, and tensions slowly eroded until the Bush Sr./Reagan axis launched a scheme directly on the cusp of Soviet soil, eventually sinking the USSR at the point in their development where they were poised (I believe) to morph into a China-esque system. It&#39;s funny that the Middle East then became the site of US warmongering for reasons both legit and clearly oil-based, as the US and Brits both seeded the area for endless conflict after messing with Iran and supporting the Saudis and Israel no matter what. </p>

<p>As for the current &quot;Cold War,&quot; it feels like a tit-for-tat game of regional influence and back-and-forth election fuckery, maintaining the espionage angles of the past while a bit less direct in applied force. The propaganda narratives are just a little too perfectly contradictory, which also feels like old times. </p>

<p>Putin is a savvy geopolitical expert-- Bush and Obama weren&#39;t, and Trump certainly isn&#39;t. He&#39;s played a game with minimal military spending comparatively and the achieved goal of upping Russia&#39;s perceived power and world standing. The idea is the even the playing field-- as an American aware of history, it seems absurd to truly critique any action Putin has taken when the US has done similar shady things throughout it&#39;s foreign policy history. Yet the idea of somehow like Trump winning (although I abhor him and his cronies in nearly every way) does show me that here, our democracy is actually real, as manipulated and sputtering as it always is, whereas as long as Putin is alive, I believe he will be Russia&#39;s leader. I would just like any Putin lover in the US to imagine being in the place of a Russian who knows their system is uniquely corrupt but cannot change anything about it. Many feel this way about the system in the US, for good reason of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Major powers don&#39;t fight each other anymore because of World War I and World War II.  The threat of war since, which is fought in 3rd world proxies, keeps the major powers alive and spending money on the threat that will not materialize.
