       I think part of the reason they don't get sucked back to earth is because they are in orbit... Traveling at a high rate of speed around the earth which essentially pushes them back out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding earth and sun, I have always wondered this. You could point again to orbit, but I have always wondered if there are other forces that we have yet to discover, like a force that works opposite of gravity.

       For some reason the idea of us rotating around the sun without closing in on it has always been strange to me. I have this silly idea in my head that maybe it's like a slow toilet flush and maybe billions of years ago a planet such as mercury was our distance from the sun, and some day mars will be in the sweet spot we now enjoy.

       Give me a little bit of time to find it. I just drank some killer beer and I need some time to find it. Right now, I am very concerned about Trump getting the Gentiles to die killing Iranians for Israel. You do know that Jews want Gentiles to die killing Persians, don't you? I'm a Jew who knows this shit.

        Why is it that astronauts would feel weightless when they are still feeling 90% of earths gravitational effect?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The earth is under an atmospheric pressure, and since humans are 90% water, and water is denser than air, we are bound to the earth by gravity and density. In space where there is a lack of atmosphere, humans will behave much like water.

        Why would they float around weightlessly on the space station but be able to hop up and down on the moon?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The moon has gravity?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The space between the moon and earth is not just some zero gravity zone if in fact it is earth's gravity that is holding the moon in orbit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The earth isn't holding the moon in orbit, in fact the moon is straying further and further away from the earth.

       Others have said it, but the key concept around an orbit is basically falling and missing. If I am a million miles from earth and throw a ball straight at earth, it will fall towards earth with the speed of my throw plus gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I throw it away from earth, it will travel away from earth with the speed of my throw minus gravity. If the pull of gravity is greater than the force of my throw, it will eventually stop and then fall to earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if I throw it perpendicular to the line between me and earth it will start traveling perpendicular then bend towards earth due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I throw with a light force, gravity will pull the ball down towards earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I throw with a super strong force, it would speed away from earth and only bend towards earth slightly before gravity became so week it had no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right in between those, there is a speed I can throw the ball where it can't quite speed away from earth, but is still being pulled towards earth by gravity. So it moves perpendicular a little way (my force), moves down a little way (gravity), moves perpendicularly, moves down, etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result is that the ball is always falling towards earth but never hitting it - an orbit.

       The problem is your questions are, honestly, stupid questions based on ignorance that could be answered by starting with wikipedia.

       Gravity is definitely not a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is determined by mass.  The more mass (the amount of matter contained within an object...not its size) an object has the more gravity it "generates".
      </p>
      <p>
       Density does not determine the amount of gravity.  Density determines the size of the object.  Mass determines gravity.

       But density does cause an object to sink rather than float in a fluid. Therefore an objects relative density does determine whether it would float, sink, or rise. Look at helium. If you throw a helium filled balloon into the air it will rise and rise until it meets equilibrium. There it will stay until enough helium is gone that the balloon becomes more dense and then falls back to earth. Is this gravity at work or bouyancy? I think the answer to this is obvious. So then, why is it hard to believe that a ball thrown up in the air falls back down to earth because of its higher density than the air? Try this over water and you will find that the ball falls back down until it is met with a fluid that is more dense, water, at which point it floats. Try the same with a rock and it will sink into the water until it is met with a solid. Try it with an egg over the ocean and it will sink until it is at equal density with the water.

       Escape velocity. The farther you are away from a planet or moon, the less energy you need to escape it's gravity. Gravity is all about the uneven distribution of mass in space/time. In areas where the mass is distributed low like the space between Earth and the Moon, there will be little to no gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Escape velocity. The moon is slowly with each rotation moving away from the Earth. Same with the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The space station does not have enough mass and speed to propell away. The moon's rotation around the earth is what likely causes the slow moving away from Earth. The space station simply is not rotating earth fast enough to be able to stay without using propulsion.

       There are more than one different forces acting on you at all times and their pull never correlates linearly to distance. You should already have some intuition to this by playing with magnets. They can pull really hard when up close but at only a few cm away they don't seem to be pulling at all even though they technically are.

       combine this with swinging a bucket full of water, when everything is swinging and orbiting it wants to fly away and does unless something pulls on it(or restricts in another manner).
