<p>Not only that, it&#39;s also a very commercially successful Hollywood movie and since Hollywood is basically the No. 1 outlet for propaganda, it makes me wonder why people are not at least a little skeptical about the term &quot;red pill&quot;..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that there is an active force to change people. Even if you don&#39;t believe in the various Christian perspectives they do have a large body of logic and observation tied into their beliefs which present a cogent argument. The greatest failure in that logic is kind of a caricature or bastardization of their principles. e.g. Everything not this is Satan. Westboro et al. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a defense mechanism. Being &quot;trans&quot; is lauded and presented as a valid lifestyle choice which I think it is not. I think it is a perversion and a result of severe psychological/sexual abuse. I don&#39;t want to call it &quot;mental illness&quot;, because the term is kinda weird and implies some kind of predisposition, which I don&#39;t think makes sense.</p>

<p>Of course everyone can live as they please but when an (in my opinion) unhealthy and destructive way of life is presented as &quot;right&quot; to people who feel weakened and insecure already and thus get pressured into more self-destructive behavior, it angers me and thus I at least want to present my view on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think, like you, that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with trans people.</p>

<p>Then a friend of mine, who I went to school with as a young man and stayed in touch with, came out in his early 40s. He explained that he had always felt this way, but was too scared of the reactions of others to share it.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I think that only problem here is that if people have absolutely no experience or frame of reference for something, or we can not imagine feeling that way ourselves, our default is to fear it or label it &quot;perverted&quot;. Just because we don&#39;t feel that way, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not ok for others to feel that way. </p>

<p>My friend was raised in a completely normal, healthy household. She is just a person doing the best she can with what she has. </p>

<p>Trans is not a defense mechanism. Labelling trans as a &quot;perversion&quot; is a defense mechanism. </p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world also classified being gay as a mental illness just a short while ago. It turns out that the world was wrong.</p>

<p>Gay people can now be more open of their sexuality. As far as I can tell, this harms no one, but it definitely helps a lot of people to live happier lives. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m passionate about transgender rights, so much as I used to think it was a form of mental illness; but now that I have the experience of my friend coming out, I see that I was wrong, and further that my wrong opinion was harmful and hurtful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can sort of understand how, as people become more aware of trans, and it becomes sort of a popular topic in the media how you might feel that way, but there was no discussion of trans in the media 30 or 40 years ago; also I don&#39;t think very many people choose their gender based on media. It&#39;s sort of like saying that people choose to be gay because of media, which seems like an obviously silly thing to say. LBGT++ have become more accepted, therefor they feel they can become more open. I don&#39;t see how this harms a single person, and it definitely helps some people to live happier lives.</p>

<p>That being said, there is a difference between unnatural, and perversion. Even if trans people were somehow a product of environmental pollution, that doesn&#39;t make it write to persecute them as mentally ill or perverted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who was kicked out of his home. He turned tricks for a living, since he fell into a drugs and wild gay lifestyle. He eventually discovered that he made more money as a male prostitute &quot;trans&quot; than as a man. He was open minded and needed the money so he took the hormones. He honestly was too young and vulnerable, from the child abuse and drug abuse and family rejection to be in a healthy mind frame. 
Last I saw him he was obese, almost homeless and drug addicted. A whole future wasted. Sexuality is not the full measure of a man or woman. It is one part. Your friend is unique, suicide rate is extremely high amongst transgender. Child abuse and drug abuse is also an issue, not to mention their interaction with society. Anyone can do what they want, but watching a life devolve from a series of choices that stem from rejection and poor self esteem. Is heartbreaking. Simply saying it&#39;s a choice is a lie. Many have longstanding trauma that is being ignored. Meanwhile pharma and docs grow rich mutilating genitals and prescribing hormones as if that heals trauma in any way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s doubtful.  There are enough studies (that of course never get mentioned in media) that show people who receive reassignment are not at all happy.  Many go on to attempt or commit suicide.  </p>

<p>Can you not see this?  Why else would the tiniest groups of people keep getting propped up to directly go against the grain of majority morality?  To condition us to accept more and more.  </p>

<p>Sorry but when it comes to genital mutilation to feed an ego based need, I can&#39;t have sympathy.  I have sympathy for the fact that society has isolated someone to the point of thinking they need the cure that the same society offers for a completely unnatural complex.  </p>

<p>If people couldn&#39;t do it and they couldn&#39;t sell it I don&#39;t think people would want it.  </p>

<p>Yes. Many of them say things like &quot;I just don&#39;t see this movement as authentic,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s a preference. Leave it that way.&quot;, and &quot;Why do we need to make addenda to laws?&quot;</p>

<p>A more developed understanding of human rights, including constitutional rights, assumes as a premise that no right means much if the right to self-identify isn&#39;t protected. And it certainly includes the understanding that the set of permissible rights can&#39;t be constrained by the majority&#39;s preferences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, no, that is such a reduction of things! Akin to saying &quot;there is only love and hate in all the world, that&#39;s all&quot;.. I am reasonably certain that you stick to easy truths because more honest perspectives are too painful, but they don&#39;t have to be! You just have to go forward and trust that you can figure things out, even if you&#39;re upset for a few days; angry even. It does transmute into an understanding greater than what you feel is being threatened.</p>

<p>For instance, I once sat with a friend of mine during his darkest days on heroin, and he sometimes says that my acceptance is part of what got him off of it; that he could see himself as a better person because I didn&#39;t see him as a bad person. That being said, it broke my heart to know what he was doing to himself, and a good part of that came from seeing his effect on those around him. You can both love those who take destructive paths, and see the path as separate from them, at the same time. It is imperative, even!</p>

The model (hypersigil if you will) behind these ideas is still a work in progress, so none of these posts is perfect.  Also useful is this <a href="http://montalk.net/matrix/122/timeline-dynamics">model of timelines</a>.  It seems very abstract and theoretical, but keep in mind that there are direct applications (and these technologies, if you will, are absolutely deployed by those in power).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I packed into as few words as possible, both for succinctness and to avoid bots.  </p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the dominant paradigm for understanding how the world works is a materialist/reductionist philosophy that places space-time at the center of reality, and uses time as its main organizing principle.  Not all cultures have done this, and various systems that are loosely organized as &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;magick&quot; are Western attempts to use different organizing principles.   I think you could split hairs, but most of these other organizing principles could be grouped together as &quot;associative&quot; or &quot;semiotic&quot; organization.  Like-attracts-like.  Most people will tune out right now, but I&#39;m not trying to win an argument or convince anybody.  Those who are familiar with the methods know they work.  This is especially true of elites.  Think those corporate logos are random?  Think again.</p>

<p>The terminology in my above comment is mostly from chaos-magick.  That is the magickal system that requires the least initial investment, and it is probably also the safest to deploy.  The basic idea is that you create a semiotic link between an outcome that you desire and a symbol (&quot;sigil&quot;) over which you have control.  There are various methods used for organizing the symbols and creating the link, but this is the key principle.  People who are really good at this can organize a hierarchy of symbols/sigils, in which case the structure is termed a &quot;hypersigil&quot;.  Rune-yoga is similar, you form your body into the shape of a symbol that links with a desired outcome.  There are many variations on methods and structures, but this is the basic idea.  So, now I think you can see why the Wachowski family trajectory is so curious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friends niece saw some of the massive trans promotion in society. She decided she may want to be a male. The therapists put her right on male hormones. Now she says she may have nade a mistake. Many people may have been born that way and they certainly have the right to be happy. That is a completely different scenario. The problem is these psychologists rush confused people into hormones and surgery. The therapists then pat each ohter on the back and give themselves awards</p>

<p>Seeing you&#39;re arguing from ignorance though and that&#39;s sad. Yes there are some that regret it and get off the hormones but there are others that truly benefit from it. It&#39;s not a fad or an attempt to stand out, people really feel trapped in the wrong gender. It&#39;s not something I understand but just because I don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t make it wrong</p>

<p>As for overpromotion, T_D and Conspiracy talks more about being trans than most of the other subs out there(obviously excluding those subs devoted to trans/trans issues)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve never been through what I&#39;ve been through but you can put a person through so much abuse that they will lie without even knowing they are lying.

<p>Good luck getting a traumatized person to be honest. They won&#39;t. Ever. Forget about it. They will cut you out of their life before they let you close enough to understand.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to me why anybody who is conscious and healthy would feel the need to immolate their body. </p>

<p>Do they have the right to do so? Sure. But do I think that they are doing this because it&#39;s what they truly want? No. So I offer my perspective as an alternative for the undecided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the word matrix is not so new, I think. It&#39;s a term from geometry / vector-related mathematics. It&#39;s really only new in the context of &quot;everything is an illusion&quot;.</p>

<p>Even then, the movie Matrix may be kind of a falsification of those beliefs. Because while it says &quot;this world isn&#39;t real&quot;, it still offers a world that is real - which I think is in contradiction to the texts you refer to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in Hollyweird and the Trans-Agenda, you should look into all the secret Trannies there! TPTB love to invert and twist everything, and to give us false idols to worship. Them, or at least their agents, are essentially a part of a religion that acts like emo kids pissed off at daddy (God). These celebrities are born into the religion, and their parents raise them to be the opposite gender, making them born-to-be personalities and influencers, and it&#39;s all a big laugh to <em>them</em> I&#39;m sure. Nose jobs, rib removal, breast implants, general plastic surgery, the most flattering clothes/make-up avaliable, and of course, photoshop. I see Maggie from The Walking Dead on the cover of a magazine, perfect hourglass figure, gorgeous, and yeah, everybody will admit it was &quot;digitally enhanced&quot; and move past it, it&#39;s typical. But then I see her again in an underwear ad, and from the neck down, it could have passed for a boy&#39;s underwear commercial---where&#39;d her hips go?? Women having shoulders noticably wider than the their hips isn&#39;t normal, nor are a million other things YouTubers dedicated to this could explain better than I. About half the cast of TWD are trannies; Maggie, Andrea, Lori, Rosita, Tara, and I&#39;ll concede on one or two of them maybe, but with all the major shows they can&#39;t <em>all</em> be coincidences. One I will not concede on from that show is Michonne, now I&#39;m sorry because I like <del>her</del> his character, I like(d) the show, but man oh man was Danai Gurira born with a dick. <em>The Walking Tranny Dead</em> might be a good starting video on YouTube. I don&#39;t care if I sound crazy, I could be saving you from pounding-off to a monster! Another I can&#39;t unsee is Gal Gadot, Wonder Woman, she&#39;s not a Gal or a Woman! They used green-screen prothestitcs on set (a TIL here) to hide her baby bump? No, they used those to hide that masculine skeleton under there! &quot;But they&#39;re married, they&#39;re lead characters&quot;, <em>how</em> could they do this, assuming they wanted to? It&#39;s kind of a lost cause trying to understand the world elite and their games, so I&#39;d be less concerened <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> and more concerned <em>that</em> they are. Next time you&#39;re in the supermarket, even if you think I&#39;m way off base, notice the magazine covers, the people that believe this more than I do say there are certain periodicals that <em>exclusively</em> have MtFs on the covers. To be able to see these quite-literal monsters would be quite a <em>They Live</em> sunglasses upgrade IRL, no? </p>
