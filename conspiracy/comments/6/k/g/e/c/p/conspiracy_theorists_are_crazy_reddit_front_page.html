        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6kbie3/next_time_a_conspiracy_theorist_tries_to_tell_you/?st=J4J7SJGI&amp;sh=6b407428">post</a> was trending late last night in r/showerthoughts. The user has since removed the body content.</p>

<p>Now, also on the front page we have <a href="http://www.news18.com/news/buzz/we-do-not-have-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars-nasa-1447965.html">this</a> (&quot;<em>We Do Not Have a Child Slave Colony on Mars: NASA</em>&quot;) in r/nottheonion.</p>

<p>The veracity of Steele&#39;s claim is not important to me, what is, is that both these posts serve the purpose to ridicule anyone who questions &quot;the official narrative&quot; of anything.</p>

<p>Reddit is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com">4th</a> most popular site in the US making an estimated $ <a href="https://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/29/report-reddit-falling-short-on-revenue-may-close-content-aggregation-site-upvoted/">20 million</a> dollars last year in revenue. Facebook is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US">3rd</a> most popular site in the US making about $ 26 <em>billion</em> dollars last year in revenue.</p>

<p>They need to clear the narrative for <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/behind-reddit-funding-round.html">investors</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit still has its albatrosses--namely that its darker corners attract bad actors--and that still makes it a tough sell to advertisers. The harassment and spam that the site is notorious for have been major targets of management, but they are still a massive problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expect more targeted attacks of this sub.</p>

<p>Edit: This is a repost, the original was deleted because of the Facebook earnings source link. You can google it.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t even have to answer this, but namely it&#39;s because you attacked the members of this sub in a broad and general sense and your attack requires qualification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been weeks since I&#39;ve seen a conspiracy discussed openly in this subreddit. For every post saying &quot;can we talk about this?&quot; there are 10 comments attempting to debunk the idea and laugh at anyone who believes it, that&#39;s true even in this thread. </p>

<p>Forgive me if I&#39;m misunderstanding, but the point of this subreddit is to talk about conspiracy, not to debunk everything, right? </p>

<p>Conspiracies by their nature have dubious amounts of evidence to back them up (otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be conspiratorial). For me, the leaps of logic and the bold, paranoid thinking is what makes them interesting and alluring. </p>

<p>So I ask: What&#39;s the point of this subreddit if the prevailing attitude is skepticism? Honestly, what&#39;s the point? Genuine question. Should we be renamed to conspiracy_skeptics, or should more effort be put towards an attitude of open discussion, rather than the dismissive atmosphere it currently has? </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is totally compromised, perhaps not by shills, but by people who think they&#39;re far more intelligent than they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a volatile clash of ideas isn&#39;t what the subreddit was made for. The sub is for the discussion of a set of ideas called &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, right there in the sidebar, the first thing you read is this: &quot;This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.&quot;</p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t called &#39;debate_a_conspiracy_theorist&#39;, but alas, that&#39;s mostly what the comments consist of. </p>

<p>I think the identity of this place is completely shattered, and it&#39;s too big to have a meaningful discussion on one topic without a million Reddit Smart Guys<sup>tm</sup> crawling out of the woodwork to parrot the same tired old talking points which the subreddit was likely created to avoid. People talking about conspiracies can hear all of that shit on the default subs if they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw this in that thread and thought it was well put. The context is similar to what you&#39;re saying, and there is something not apparently dangerous in this line of thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what OP is suggesting actually contributes to the dissolution of truth and that is incredibly dangerous in a democracy. It not only fucks with someone of questionable mental health, it makes the general population more vulnerable to actual manipulation. Disparaging conspiracy theories means disparaging the US Constitution, secularism, criminal investigation, the EPA; it makes you vulnerable to people that would buy politicians, take over a regulatory body, manipulate markets, convince your grandmother to donate her money to save Jesus from persecution, lie to the public on the news. These are all actually happening daily. Not being able to discuss these things over lunch with your peers is harmful to society and shouldn&#39;t be treated so cavalier as a game of dodgeball. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As Krishnamurti put it...</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.&quot;</p>

<p>So for those who have recognised that all-pervasive sickness, enough to try and diagnose and discuss it&#39;s various symptoms in order to try and avoid being victimized any more than they already have by it, they are of course going seem &quot;crazy&quot; to all those that consider themselves to be the &quot;well adjusted&quot; ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First indie media was attacked as &#39;fake news&#39; and the following censorship - now it looks like conspiracy theorists are next.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really surprise me considering most of our conspiracy theories over the years have turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Snowden and Wikileaks are 2 examples of people who&#39;ve been able to prove us correct on a number of topics and look how much governments hate them. </p>

<p>Mass surveillance, government and corporate corruption, big pharma corruption, chem trails, USA supporting ISIS are just some conspiracy theories proven correct. </p>

<p>Why do you need specifics?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t even have to answer this, but namely it&#39;s because you attacked the members of this sub in a broad and general sense and your attack requires qualification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We could start, if you like, on flat earth or there being no planes on 9/11, or it was all done by aliens, or that the queen of england is a reptilian</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you please provide a citation that I&#39;ve given any of these theories credence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are enough conspiracies rooted in facts to keep anyone busy for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then what&#39;s the point of bitching and moaning about content that probably accounts for about 2% of what comes out of the discussion held on this sub?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being skeptical of some claims doesn&#39;t mean you are &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When did anyone ever accuse you of being &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>reality based investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good idea, now cut the unqualified strawman attacks and get to work.</p>

<p>Infowars is just as suspect as any mainstream new org with one notable difference. They want you to research their claims, whereas the likes of CNN/FOX etc act as if they are the final arbiters of truth.</p>

My professor told me to be careful with what I say because I sound a little like a conspiracy theorist.

Ugh, so bad, and this guy teaches journalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normies love bringing up Sandy Hook. I never argued it was a conspiracy but some people did, and after learning of other conspiracy theories to be true, i dont even blame them for questioning it. We&#39;ll never know at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Bottomline, imo, you shouldnt generalize an entire group of people because of that but the attacks are going to come no matter what. People still relentlessly ridicule people who know that 9/11 was a false flag operation.</p>
