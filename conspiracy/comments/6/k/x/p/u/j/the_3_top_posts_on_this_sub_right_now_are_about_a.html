       Are you taking this personally or something?  No idea why people turn the comments section into a place to attack the poster/commenter, instead of the information.

       This isn't my post...  The OP posted the link for the video with all the details...  After that I used the

       Not really. Didn't really care to spend time 12 hours ago to do an exhaustive search of news articles. I didn't honestly think someone would be so petty to latch onto something 12 hours later and make claims they couldn't prove themselves so they'd rather latch onto anything minor to keep their own argument from failing.

       I'm merely agreeing with you that you had sources that proved me wrong to a degree while also pointing out that all the sources were from the same week.  I don't understand why is this a big deal.  I'm just saying it because it was true.

       If you are Secretary of State and some of you top Subordinates are covering up an Ambassador having sex with minors it either makes them look incompetent or like someone who at least aiding someone getting away with committing a rather disgusting felony.  Either way it doesn't look good on her as a leader.

       So The Secretary of State didn't know an Ambassador was paying for sex with minors?  That sounds like a pretty big deal to me, something that The Secretary of State should have been told.  If she wasn't then she is an incompetent leader who couldn't get her subordinates in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 Directions?  She was literally the highest authority in the State Department it would have either have to been her or someone who reported directly to her.

       I won't argue that but to address this you have to address the current narrative. Which was engineered with absolute brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary became public enemy number 1 with most people who look past the headlines. Trumps rise in highsight, very engineered though he had seemingly a ton of organic support. Due to the fact the media shoved Hillary down the throat of everyone while non-stop leaks came out, while she faked her crowds in rallies and passed out in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they are on the same team there appears to be some infighting (even if its created from above them, like parents egging their children on to fight) so people take sides or at least support what they see as the lesser of two evils.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would agree that the larger picture and longer narrative compared to the state of being and state of the world is more relevant than short term politics (or any politics as its poison) but with the money and NGO support for Trump opposition it puts people on the defensive so that anything Anti-Trump is Pro-Hillary. And anything Anti-Hillary appears better than the alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an analytical viewpoint on the overall state of the last year or so. As mentioned if its engineered from someone above both Hillary and Trump and they are mere pawns it was done with absolute brilliance. Even people who were calling this subsided when the docs dropped on H, but then nothing really happened did it.

       It's chilling but at the same time
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       liberating to understand that there is a method to the madness. To spend a life wondering
       <em>
        whats wrong with the world

       or believing in a projected moral or legal code when reality tells you some other Natural Law exists, is madness. To ignore it seems like ignorance.

       That being said each person needs to develop their own outlook and character. It can take a long time to purge the animal or slave instincts where you judge yourself and others by whatever current paradigm is in place.

       People think mutually assured destruction or power projection is king. In reality its deescalation and compromise. If two people continuously project power and escalate they kill each other off or damage themselves to where they lose whatever they've gained.

       Think about a blood feud. Those family lines tend to wipe themselves out. One thing is that this may only apply to two equal powers which could explain a lot of parasitic behaviours.

       One other thing. When the election production was put into full swing the major conspiracy sites as well as others all started getting wiped of normal topics. Everything was redirected into politics. 4chan (good for organic discussion) was brought into Trump camping and the politics which became a forefront of the battle between Trump &amp; Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       To even properly discuss the overarching narrative or talk about the larger picture online currently doesn't seem possible. There are various subgroups, discords and random places and networks where people convene but intuition tells me some are probably agenda driven as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of control and engineering is well beyond anything witnessed before. Not only are the sub-cultures broken down but mainstream avenues went zero tolerance. Reddit for instance is so polarized that they simply corral opposing right/left paradigm sides into various sub-reddits while erasing anything unsuited to the agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically like putting everyone into their own echo chambers so no coherent thoughts can form. Ironically the DNC emails talked about their failures by creating echo chambers. There's two now.

       It's literally being trained into us.  College campus are leftist brainwashing camps (I too was subject to this at 5 separate universities across the US).  The right slips further and further into the "doomsday bunker" mentality and their ideologies are inflamed further by the left-leaning media.  It's all coming to a head.

       Is there a bigger criminal politician in US history literally getting away with murder than Clinton? If there's an establishment agenda it's not to frame the Clintons. If you want to fight for the underdogs for real, don't stand in defense of any of these people.

       You could be right and I guess we'll never really know and I'm about to have a look at those posts myself.

       One other possibility that's on a metaphysical level is synchronicity, universal mind, telepathy etc. I see this type of thing happen all the time on the internet.

       Is that the story about the Belgian ambassador?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Belgian intelligence agents trailed the guy (as is normal for all ambassadors) and they found him doing completely benign shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state department was also investigated by the inspector general and cleared of any wrong doing too.

       I think that it's gotten to the point where practically every user who used try posting any conspiracy involving the right wing has given up because they all get downvoted (regardless of quality and relevance) or have been banned.
