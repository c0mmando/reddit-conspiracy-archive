    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t argue that but to address this you have to address the current narrative. Which was engineered with absolute brilliance.</p>

<p>Hillary became public enemy number 1 with most people who look past the headlines. Trumps rise in highsight, very engineered though he had seemingly a ton of organic support. Due to the fact the media shoved Hillary down the throat of everyone while non-stop leaks came out, while she faked her crowds in rallies and passed out in public.</p>

<p>Even if they are on the same team there appears to be some infighting (even if its created from above them, like parents egging their children on to fight) so people take sides or at least support what they see as the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>I would agree that the larger picture and longer narrative compared to the state of being and state of the world is more relevant than short term politics (or any politics as its poison) but with the money and NGO support for Trump opposition it puts people on the defensive so that anything Anti-Trump is Pro-Hillary. And anything Anti-Hillary appears better than the alternative.</p>

<p>This is an analytical viewpoint on the overall state of the last year or so. As mentioned if its engineered from someone above both Hillary and Trump and they are mere pawns it was done with absolute brilliance. Even people who were calling this subsided when the docs dropped on H, but then nothing really happened did it.</p>

To spend a life wondering <em>whats wrong with the world</em> or believing in a projected moral or legal code when reality tells you some other Natural Law exists, is madness. To ignore it seems like ignorance.</p>

<p>That being said each person needs to develop their own outlook and character. It can take a long time to purge the animal or slave instincts where you judge yourself and others by whatever current paradigm is in place. </p>

<p>I think there is a natural moral code, our species altruism is one of our better traits. Unfortunately the other phenotype is also in the gene pool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People think mutually assured destruction or power projection is king. In reality its deescalation and compromise. If two people continuously project power and escalate they kill each other off or damage themselves to where they lose whatever they&#39;ve gained. </p>

<p>Think about a blood feud. Those family lines tend to wipe themselves out. One thing is that this may only apply to two equal powers which could explain a lot of parasitic behaviours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One other thing. When the election production was put into full swing the major conspiracy sites as well as others all started getting wiped of normal topics. Everything was redirected into politics. 4chan (good for organic discussion) was brought into Trump camping and the politics which became a forefront of the battle between Trump &amp; Hillary.</p>

<p>To even properly discuss the overarching narrative or talk about the larger picture online currently doesn&#39;t seem possible. There are various subgroups, discords and random places and networks where people convene but intuition tells me some are probably agenda driven as well.</p>

<p>The level of control and engineering is well beyond anything witnessed before. Not only are the sub-cultures broken down but mainstream avenues went zero tolerance. Reddit for instance is so polarized that they simply corral opposing right/left paradigm sides into various sub-reddits while erasing anything unsuited to the agenda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically like putting everyone into their own echo chambers so no coherent thoughts can form. Ironically the DNC emails talked about their failures by creating echo chambers. There&#39;s two now. </p>
