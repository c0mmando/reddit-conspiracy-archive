We believe that human trafficking and sexual slavery is a despicable but ever prevalent crime in the world. I have been here in this sub for a long time (even made a new profile so I could begin interacting without repercussions) and I know there are people here that are very against the atrocities that we also stand against. I wanted to extend an olive branch to anyone willing to seriously combat this problem. Please, I implore you to visit the link below and understand the real problems affecting the world today.

    <div class="md"><p>I plan on making a post on them eventually. The Jewish Mafia redeveloped themselves into politics law and business. They assist the Italian Mafia in their white collar crimes and operate as their front men. The Italian Nobility run the Italian Mafia and some of the Jewish Mafia factions. The Austrian, Hungarian, and German Nobility run the rest of the Jewish Mafia. The Israeli Mafia which work with a lot of the organized crime in Russia and the Black Sea region are the only real Jewish Mafia that I know of that are involved with drug trafficking, human trafficking, murder, extortion, etc. They have little involvement in the United States. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are Asian gangs on the West Coast involved in sex slavery, prostitution and worse. The Imperial House of Japan has a portion of ownership and authority on the West Coast for their assistance in WWII which was a staged war carried out by world leaders for the purpose of genocide and global takeover. This is why Emperor Akihito is a Knight of the Order of the Garter which are the continuation of the Knights Templar of London that were stationed at the City of London where the Virginia Company was issued. The United States is a continuation of the Virginia Company. The royal families covertly run the organized crime syndicate. Akihito runs Yakuza. The Triads are known for being human traffickers. Both of these groups are operating at the ports on the West Coast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re an insurance company and you have costumers that pay you monthly that you got to cover.</p>

<p>One guy gets into accident so you give him money as per his insurance agreement.</p>

<p>You need to figure out how much money you actually need, and big part of it is what&#39;s the chance of ending up being forced to pay someone.</p>

<p>The more people who have a low chance of getting into an accident, the less you need to worry about covering the ones who end up in accidents.</p>

<p>So you can lower the cost of insurance, because you have a lot of low chance ones.</p>

<p>The problem with obamacare is that they expected more healthy people to get health insurance but unfortunately healthy people opted for paying the fine rather than getting insurance.</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t forget that the ones who did opt for insurance were the ones who badly required health insurance, so insurers ended up paying way too much money compared to how much they got.</p>

<p>This is why premium prices gone up lately.</p>

<p>The problem with obamacare is that they expected more healthy people to get health insurance but unfortunately healthy people opted for paying the fine rather than getting insurance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem was that my (and I&#39;m sure millions of others in my similar position) out of pocket, bi-weekly, and total deductibles all went up an obscene amount.</p>

<p>I was being asked to pay $150/bi-weekly for coverage, <em>then</em> pay I think a $5k deductible, <em>then</em> still pay 20% or more for everything. I was making just enough to afford the $60 bi-weekly that I already had, with a much lower deductible and no co-pay after my deductible. </p>

<p>And yes, that was for the marketplace, &quot;lowest possible disaster level&quot; plan, and no, even though I only made $25k, I still didn&#39;t qualify for state assistance with the premiums. I tried and appealed that three times, all denied, and trying to talk to someone at the stupid call center was as pointless as using a BB gun to stop a bull. </p>

<p>The ultimate problem here, and the problem that is going to keep being a problem even if you raise the fine, is that healthcare costs too damn much in the USA. Prices need to come down, and until that happens any healthcare plan that gets passed is just gonna be a massive grab by the insurance companies to make more profit while providing fewer/worse services. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented the full story just now, but I basically got out because I suddenly got disabled and he didn&#39;t feel like looking after me. So he just chucked me in a hospital and that was it. I had almost no money, no clothes beyond what I had on, for a while he refused to give back my textbooks and passport...thankfully my uni had a great support system so I managed to make it all work. Had to take a year off though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the only reason I&#39;m on reddit is to grow accustomed to interacting with people, and learn that they&#39;re not all like that man. I try to speak as much as possible about my abuse so I can face it and move on. </p>

<p>Basically I was sexually abused from a young age. My father...okay, a bit of history. My mother was a uni professor in Iran before the revolution. When the revolution came many of her students were killed, her husband and her colleagues too so she fled Iran to Canada. There she had troubles and a Lawyer kindly offered to help her. That was my father. Except he raped her and coerced her to marry him (she was very very beautiful). He was going to frame her son for things and get him deported so to give him a good life she agreed. When I was 2 years old, he started sexually abusing me, and sharing that with his friends, etc. At one point my mother tells me that I was given to a judge in exchange for favors or something. When I was 6 my mother &#39;kidnapped&#39; me and went back to Iran. At 16 I came to England because my father was dying of cancer and I didn&#39;t remember all he did to me. I remained in England all on my own because I&#39;m a lesbian atheist and Iran was too repressive for me. It was a big struggle to survive, I worked many jobs and had to work very hard. My only non-study/work activity was playing WoW. On WoW I met someone, he was my tank while I was healer. It was so much fun, and he was my closest friend. We connected inrl and were the same age, wanted to do the same degree and wanted to go same uni. He was quite well-off to the point his parents bought him a house near the uni. I was planning on working an extra year to have enough saved to go to uni without having to work much. But he told me I could have a room in his house rent-free if I did the cleaning and cooking. I agreed and first month it was great. But then he would make these comments, about my eating. I was quite small, a size 8 UK but he called me chubby, fat, he would pinch my cheeks and under my chin. It all happened so subtly, but eventually he controlled what I ate, like making me count 10 peas and eat only that. I developed bulimia, whenever he wasn&#39;t around I would gorge myself, then get scared and throw it all up again. Then he did things like remove the bathroom lock and then walk in when I&#39;m showering, watching me while he poops. Then while he masturbates. Then he made me clean the floors in my underwear, then naked. I had to do his essays, not just for this year but also his dissertation for the future. I wrote his dissertation and it got him a distinction two years later in his final year. One day he was mad I walked faster than him and took all my toe nails. I still can&#39;t walk right because whenever my toe nails recovered he would pull them out again, on camera so I started walking poorly so he would not do it again. He took away all my clothes and got me other things, I wasn&#39;t allowed clothes unless he put them on me. Raped me, filmed himself hurting me, brought friends to come demean me and hurt me. Around October I wasn&#39;t allowed to leave the house without him, he kept me in my attic room with a pot to use to pee in. I would sit naked in my room and study, that was all that kept me sane, my textbooks. After a year of the torture, rapes and filming me, using me as a drugs snorting surface, sharing me with his friends, my limbs got tingly. Suddenly I was paralyzed. I was terrified. He loved it at first, made lots of videos of raping and hurting me, once did make-up to make me look like a corpse to experiment with &#39;necrophilia&#39;. He&#39;d left me outside in the rain for a few hours so my body would be cold like a corpse. But then he got tired of it, because I was paralyzed he had to clean and feed me. So he took me to the hospital and just dumped me there. I had Guillan-barre syndrome (sp?) where my immune system had attacked my nerves. After a while I got better in hospital, regained some movement. When he came to my room, I told him to fuck off. Lost all my friends and everyone hated me because he said I had used him, cheated on him, was a gold digger, etc. I kept my head down, did my physio and studied. He tried to blackmail me, spread rumors that I slept with lecturers, put the torture videos online...I kept studying. Got out of the wheelchair. Got a dog. My mum came here from Iran, rented a cheap place. I graduated and then moved to live with her. I&#39;m living with my mum now, she often has to leave the country for business trips and things like that, but it&#39;s good. I finally feel somewhat safe. I still have ptsd, bulimia, anxiety, depression...the last time I tried to die was last week, drank some bleach but vomited it again. He got away with it, while I hallucinate about him all the time, he is millions of spiders laying eggs in my skin, he is in my reflection, he is everywhere. Threatening me, mocking me. I only recently stopped scrubbing myself raw with bleach, the skin on my body is ruined from years of doing that. Trying to care for myself more, brushing my teeth, hair, moisturizing, eating well, not purging. It&#39;s frustrating and hard. I forget to add, I am also autistic. So I was a autistic, impoverished girl from a different country and was preyed upon and fully exploited by a wealthy english man. I&#39;m fairly certain his father has two slaves in his house, doing &#39;housework&#39; for him too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t describe the hurt in my heart for you but I want you to know your life is worth living. This world can be a horrible place and the people living in the shadows do everything they can to take advantage of those around them. But DON&#39;T let them prevent you from leading the life you want to lead. You are so strong to have made it as far as you did. There are so many people out there that care about you and want you to succeed. You are a hero. Don&#39;t let anyone ever tell you differently.  Thank you so much for sharing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so strange. Back then, with all his friends around me...I felt dirty, like I did something wrong, that I was less than human. I still do, everything I do doesn&#39;t feel like me, massive depersonalization as I go through the motions of being alive. I don&#39;t feel strong or heroic...I&#39;m just there. And I&#39;m very sorry for making you feel bad, I wonder if I&#39;m being selfish sharing such an experience where it might hurt people. But also...thank you. Your kind words mean a lot to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you don&#39;t feel heroic, but there are people out there that will hear your story that think that you are. I add myself to that list. There is no need to ever feel bad about telling your own story. Don&#39;t forget, other people have stories to tell as well and they don&#39;t need to feel sorry about telling their experiences either. I personally believe that part of growing as humans, and as people, includes being open about our past experiences. A lot of those experiences can be bad. But what we learn from those can help us be much better people and change the world in the future. Be strong. Be an example of how a person can completely overcome their past. People like me will always fight for people like you. Don&#39;t forget that. We are out there and we both Stand Together.</p>
