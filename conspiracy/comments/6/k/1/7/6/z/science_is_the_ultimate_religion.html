       all religions are a form of control, this is obvious, but science (the modern bastardization of it anyway) is perhaps the most nefarious as it is the only one that tells you that you are a random accident and there is nothing beyond what THEY can show you. gtfo, nasa.
      </p>
      <p>
       they don't teach science in school. they teach you DOGMA, only what they want you to think about how this supposed world worlds. your einsteins and your hawkings and your neil d tysons and your bill nyes are all shills that you've raised to the level of gods by accepting their word as gospel.

       tesla was the last real scientist. the last real scientist they'll ever let you hear of anyway.

       So basically you're against everything mainstream, even if the mainstream is correct?

       Before you respond, go cast some doubt at your power outlet and see if the science of electricity is correct.

       I agree, OP. Scientific method is an excellent way to measure and describe the world around us, but so much of what we are taught to believe as Science can't actually be replicated by any layman, so it requires a great deal of faith and belief. Global warming is a good example of this, and proposed carbon taxes are really no more than tithes for salvation. There really are a lot of parallels between science and religion, in my opinion. Both are used to prey on our human instinct to understand the meaning of life and to avoid death.

       What if the research was published, recorded, reviewed, and retested by others. If you're suggestion some kind of conspiracy between scientists to say something is true when it's not I would argue the opposite. Scientists get praised when they prove an idea wrong, not always when they prove it right.

       Science can and has been wrong. This doesn't mean it's a conspiracy and that people are lying on purpose (always). Sometimes people just make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes they're paid to make it look like something is true when it's not. Usually though if they are lying and you can't reproduce the results you just have to wait until someone else does the same study without motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to have an example, because I'm legitimately not aware of one, in which scientists whom were paid to do a study lied and then an independent scientist without motives came to the same conclusion.

      <blockquote>

        Instead of changing incentives, perhaps one could remove incentives altogether. Or insist on replicability statements in grant applications and research papers. Or emphasise collaboration, not competition. Or insist on preregistration of protocols. Or reward better pre and post publication peer review. Or improve research training and mentorship. Or implement the recommendations from our Series on increasing research value, published last year. One of the most convincing proposals came from outside the biomedical community. Tony Weidberg is a Professor of Particle Physics at Oxford. Following several high-profile errors, the particle physics community now invests great effort into intensive checking and rechecking of data prior to publication.

       His admittedly unscientific statement wasn't in favor of doubting science but rather improving it - minimizing the effects of the human element (greed, pride, ego, etc.).

       Dr. Horton and every scientist referenced in that Wiki page would disagree with you. What we have is absolutely the scientific method. There is simply a lack of rigor and control for the human factor. The scientific method does not come with build in guarantees against this sort of thing. We need to implement them on top of the scientific method.

       My personal peeve is incentive for replication. Currently it is difficult to get funding to reproduce. When you do, it does nothing to further a career. We need to make it just as attractive to replicate as it is to do original research.

       Global warming / climate change is a very real thing. We all know that an ice age will eventually happen, and through previous history of the Earth we know that before most major ice ages the atmospheric conditions changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been adding into the atmospheric conditions for over 100 years now by burning chemicals out the ground, which releases even more chemicals into the atmosphere.

       The tax is there to put pressure on the energy companies (and users) to change over to a more natural fuel source. The tax is being used as a deterrent. I don't necessarily believe in using taxes this way but it does seem to work (just going on the hiked taxes on certain industries on the UK and the reduced public usage.)

       The 3 lines of intelligence are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Science - Reason
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Philosophy - Logic
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Religion - Faith
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       One a balanced understanding of all 3 will lead to productivity and success in life. We need science to have laser control over society. Philosophy will give us the wisdom so we know how to use that power. Religion will give us the spiritual ideals we need to motivate ourselves into action.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a little bit of scientific knowledge but the other 2 are lacking especially real religious knowledge.

       Religious or spiritual knowledge include ideas that cannot be measured directly but they can be experienced.  Certain things can't be measured. It has to be basically "experienced".
      </p>
      <p>
       For example. Does the golden rule work when applied in totality? Science can't answer this. The only way to find out is to run a personal experiment for a few months to see if it works.

       This is a brilliant comment. I've been thinking about the purpose of religion as of late, and I think it would be much better to use the money that we spend on churches to reinvest in communities. Could you imagine how much better everyone's lives could be if we invested their money into communities as opposed to building bigger churches and paying pastors salaries? We could just go there to help each other out in our times of need. Gather and talk instead of listening to a preacher and get to know people in our communities.

       Ya, actually we don't need priests (aka middlemen to God) at all nor do we need institutionalized religion which is essentially a cult. All we need is "person religion" where we are all non-denominational revisionists who continue in the search for more spiritual knowledge like we do with science through our own personal experiences. That's how it works. We get spiritual insight from personal experience and then share it with the world to add to our current spiritual knowledge but since we decided to focus on a few books as the "end all" of religion, we are spiritually stunted as a people.

       Even if we don't need priests, a common meeting spot to encourage a sense of community would be ideal imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think these meeting points are actually key for religious groups, it less the religion but more the community.

       All three are unified, and no single one should lord over the others.

       Google definition of Science. Its the process of observing  and studying the natutal world. Its not a belief system or ideology. Its merely the tool to discover or create. Faith can be found with science but religion can not.
For religion is brother to tradition which is man made. Faith is the hope of something not yet seen or heard. But science is the tool to draw that faith  out so it can be seen or heard.
So many people have mixed faith with only religion yet it is evident religion is not brother to faith,  because religion is structure of lifestyles of worship, that are brought down through time. The only faith that someone has is that those relgious practices makes them closer to their God who they see not or hear not.

       Science is not the issue but rather the illiteracy of science and the ignorance of how to correctly apply it within one's own life. Science is NOT about memorizing and repeating facts. It is a system of philosophy designed to teach you to question not only your self and your own observations but the observations of others.
