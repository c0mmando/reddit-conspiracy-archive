       Pretty much everything is co-opted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate change, genetics, neuroscience, robotics, AI, nano-technology. All these techs have the capability to save the world and thrust humanity deep into the space age. Anything new, within the last 30 or so years is almost certainly coopted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regrettably these things will only be released incrementally for the majority of the population. Having to buy all total crap on the way to getting the real deal, while it's already well in use at the black-budget industrial level.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll be lucky if were even alive in a few decades though. All by design to depopulate the planet. Whole planet is going to be desert or tundra, if we don't have a major turnaround somehow. This means endless proxy war needs to come to a grinding halt, as it is one of the largest polluters.

       It's no more valid to dismiss religion on the grounds of 4000 year old myths being inaccurate than it is to dismiss science on the grounds that 4000 year old science is inaccurate.

       No, science is not necessarily "directly observable", and something not being directly observable doesn't mean it doesn't exist or affect reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, we don't "witness" the earth revolving around the sun; we learned that it does from careful observation and deduction. A casual observer wouldn't be able to tell which is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of something as incredible as the universe, the fact it exists within such narrow constraints as to allow life, and the fact that it exists continuously are all well-explained by the existence of an omnipotent creative mind. I know atheists often defer to luck, or an infinite multiverse where every possibility is actually realized, but neither of those satisfies your observability criterion either.

       Sure. I can agree with that.

       Also, sure. However, the leap you have to take when something is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        not observable
       </li>
       <li>

      <p>
       Yeah, from fucking space. Like, I understand the entire methodology of how we learned that we orbit the sun, but to say that it isn't observable is asinine.
       <strong>
        We've literally been there, and done that

      <p>
       Fortunately, science isn't beholden to the viewpoints of the "casual observer".

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anything is well-explained by "well, maybe it was a magical being". This isn't observable proof. You're making the grandest of false equivalencies here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I know atheists often defer to luck, or an infinite multiverse where every possibility is actually realized, but neither of those satisfies your observability criterion either.

      <p>
       This is ridiculous. The premise that because one thing doesn't adequately explain something means that we should lend equal credence to something that almost absolutely does not adequately explain the same concept is silly. You can believe whatever you like, but pretending that religion holds an equal weight to the practice of science in explaining the processes of the universe is totally and utterly false.

       I never claimed that I did! I said that we've observed the Earth rotating around the Sun &amp; that we've observed nothing about God. Ergo, science is less faith-based than religion.

       This is an "all rectangles are squares" argument. This is bad logic. You're applying a preconceived bias to a complete stranger. Furthermore, this topic has nothing to do with religion. And frankly, if it did, you'd probably be mistaken in your claims anyways. The religious right are the people who primarily enlist to go to war, and what do you think we did in the immediate aftermath of 9/11? Who do you think is more likely to mindlessly believe a story? I'd lean towards the subset of people who literally base their entire lives around one.

       Your faulty premise makes this entire point moot. Here's a thought: maybe I'm open to all information about 9/11? Here's a better one: maybe I don't give a shit about 9/11? Seriously, what kind of mental gymnastics are you going to make me try and follow you through, here? Are you actually demanding I follow you down a rabbit hole about 9/11 before we can address your claims that "science is a religion" or that we somehow cannot observe the earth rotating around the sun? That's an unreasonable request.

       Which God? I'm agnostic to the concept, but I find it highly irrational that something so arbitrarily devoid of reason could ever be the most likely solution. You're free to believe in God, but that's still a false equivalence to science, no matter how many times you stomp your feet and pretend that your comparison is legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, your premise on the 9/11 argument is faulty,  and the appeal you're making is unreasonable. 9/11 occurred
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       it was discovered that the earth rotated around the sun. It
       <strong>
        is not
       </strong>
       a relevant point in defining whether or not science can be considered "a religion". Your argument is trash. Take a forensics course at your JC some time, kid.

       So, none. Here's the problem: you haven't done your homework and looked at the arguments in order to come to your own conclusions like a rational person; you're just asking me for points to argue against from your preconceived point of view. I'm not going to play that game.

       Your original objection was that the bible says that the sun goes around the earth. It's pretty shitty that you would go around saying stuff like that without even bothering to read what current theological thought is about. It's dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most theologians actually regard scientific discovery as revelation of God's creation, not something in opposition to theism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when a priest published the theory of the primordial atom, and atheists hated the idea of a beginning so much that they held on to eternal universe models for another thirty years? Well, I wasn't there, but it happened. Atheists are still trying to explain it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also only recently been widely accepted that the vast majority of possible incarnations of the universe under different values for physical constants would be totally inhospitable to complexity and life. This has huge implications for this debate, and is a big reason for so much hoopla over the multiverse theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, but can you see why I was pissed that "the bible says this" and "theologians don't believe what they're supposed to believe" were the best you could come up with?

       Science isn't. "Science" is a major part of the statist, authoritarian secular religion that has increasingly displaced transcendent religion.

       The most striking example is the huge proportion of vocal atheists who claim to love science, but then they vehemently defend the popular 9/11 myth.

       Education, unfortunately, is not a cure all.  It has the same political problems that censorship has.  What I mean by this is, often times people flirt with the idea of making it illegal or impossible for people to express wrong or vulgar ideas.  And when this idea is suggested, often a wiser person is quick to ask, "Well, who will do the censuring?", and of course the censorship advocates never have an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weirdly enough, when people say, "well we just need to educate people and give them the right answers", its less common for another to ask, "Well, who will do the educating?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was Chomsky who said something like, "education is indoctrination."

       Science has always served power, whether it be corporate, government, aristocratic, etc, all throughout known history.  Just like any other field of human endeavor, it's corrupted by power relations.  Hardly surprising since the ruling elites have always decided who becomes scientists, what is worthwhile to study, and what findings history records as meritorious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime anyone claims to be authoritative on a subject, you should be doubly skeptical of what they are saying.  This goes for everything, including the work of scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       To see what I mean, think about the supposed discoveries of science and what they actually tell us about the world.  From what some have called, "Newton's clockwork universe" to modern quantum theory, what can physicists (a supposedly hard science) and their complex models teach us about what the universe is, and how it works?  They were quite useful in the design and construction of things like nuclear bombs and industrial machinery, but ask a scientist a seemingly basic question like, 'what is time?' and they'll tell you, "time is what a clock reads".  Very illuminating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of science, for the most part, is to design useful tools that help the ruling elites govern a regimented, hierarchical society.  Their work should be studied critically from a political perspective, despite their claims of objectivity.

       Anything is well-explained by "well, maybe it was a magical being". This isn't observable proof. You're making the grandest of false equivalencies here.

        I know atheists often defer to luck, or an infinite multiverse where every possibility is actually realized, but neither of those satisfies your observability criterion either.

       This is ridiculous. The premise that because one thing doesn't adequately explain something means that we should lend equal credence to something that almost absolutely does not adequately explain the same concept is silly. You can believe whatever you like, but pretending that religion holds an equal weight to the practice of science in explaining the processes of the universe is totally and utterly false.

       Which God? I'm agnostic to the concept, but I find it highly irrational that something so arbitrarily devoid of reason could ever be the most likely solution. You're free to believe in God, but that's still a false equivalence to science, no matter how many times you stomp your feet and pretend that your comparison is legitimate.

       Again, your premise on the 9/11 argument is faulty,  and the appeal you're making is unreasonable. 9/11 occurred
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       it was discovered that the earth rotated around the sun. It
       <strong>
        is not
       </strong>
       a relevant point in defining whether or not science can be considered "a religion". Your argument is trash. Take a forensics course at your JC some time, kid.
