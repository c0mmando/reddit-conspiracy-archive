    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much everything is co-opted.</p>

<p>Climate change, genetics, neuroscience, robotics, AI, nano-technology. All these techs have the capability to save the world and thrust humanity deep into the space age. Anything new, within the last 30 or so years is almost certainly coopted.</p>

<p>Regrettably these things will only be released incrementally for the majority of the population. Having to buy all total crap on the way to getting the real deal, while it&#39;s already well in use at the black-budget industrial level.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be lucky if were even alive in a few decades though. All by design to depopulate the planet. Whole planet is going to be desert or tundra, if we don&#39;t have a major turnaround somehow. This means endless proxy war needs to come to a grinding halt, as it is one of the largest polluters.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No, science is not necessarily &quot;directly observable&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. I can agree with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and something not being directly observable doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist or affect reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, sure. However, the leap you have to take when something is:</p>

<ul>
<li>not observable </li>
<li>has no foundation in science to back it up </li>
</ul>

<p>is fundamentally irrational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And no, we don&#39;t &quot;witness&quot; the earth revolving around the sun;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL we&#39;ve collectively never been to space, nor witnessed the Earth revolving around the sun from the ISS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we learned that it does from careful observation and deduction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, from fucking space. Like, I understand the entire methodology of how we learned that we orbit the sun, but to say that it isn&#39;t observable is asinine. <strong>We&#39;ve literally been there, and done that</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A casual observer wouldn&#39;t be able to tell which is the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, science isn&#39;t beholden to the viewpoints of the &quot;casual observer&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of something as incredible as the universe, the fact it exists within such narrow constraints as to allow life, and the fact that it exists continuously are all well-explained by the existence of an omnipotent creative mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything is well-explained by &quot;well, maybe it was a magical being&quot;. This isn&#39;t observable proof. You&#39;re making the grandest of false equivalencies here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know atheists often defer to luck, or an infinite multiverse where every possibility is actually realized, but neither of those satisfies your observability criterion either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ridiculous. The premise that because one thing doesn&#39;t adequately explain something means that we should lend equal credence to something that almost absolutely does not adequately explain the same concept is silly. You can believe whatever you like, but pretending that religion holds an equal weight to the practice of science in explaining the processes of the universe is totally and utterly false.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to be! We live in specialized professions! It&#39;s part of living in a first world society!

<p>I&#39;m deliberately trying not to put any words in your mouth. I&#39;m parsing your argument as explicitly as I can. Also, I don&#39;t care how you feel. It is irrelevant to the discussion!</p>

<p>This is the kind of logical train of thought that leads to thinking the Earth is flat! At a certain point, you need to recognize that your personal validation is not more valuable than the validation of <strong>practically the entire globe</strong>. Science is not existentialism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is your observable direct proof of why the universe exists, how it continues to exist and why it&#39;s capable of supporting life? Oh right, you don&#39;t have any.</p>

<p>I never claimed that I did! I said that we&#39;ve observed the Earth rotating around the Sun &amp; that we&#39;ve observed nothing about God. Ergo, science is less faith-based than religion. The fact that I don&#39;t have a mathematical breakdown of the creation of the universe doesn&#39;t make science a religion. That&#39;s a straight up appeal to extremes fallacy! </p>

<p>This is an &quot;all rectangles are squares&quot; argument. This is bad logic. You&#39;re applying a preconceived bias to a complete stranger. Furthermore, this topic has nothing to do with religion. And frankly, if it did, you&#39;d probably be mistaken in your claims anyways. The religious right are the people who primarily enlist to go to war, and what do you think we did in the immediate aftermath of 9/11? Who do you think is more likely to mindlessly believe a story? I&#39;d lean towards the subset of people who literally base their entire lives around one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the official story demonstrates that you only apply strict scientific standards to things you disagree with</p>

<p>Your faulty premise makes this entire point moot. Here&#39;s a thought: maybe I&#39;m open to all information about 9/11? Here&#39;s a better one: maybe I don&#39;t give a shit about 9/11? Seriously, what kind of mental gymnastics are you going to make me try and follow you through, here? Are you actually demanding I follow you down a rabbit hole about 9/11 before we can address your claims that &quot;science is a religion&quot; or that we somehow cannot observe the earth rotating around the sun? That&#39;s an unreasonable request. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your original objection was that the bible says that the sun goes around the earth. It&#39;s pretty shitty that you would go around saying stuff like that without even bothering to read what current theological thought is about. It&#39;s dishonest.</p>

<p>Most theologians actually regard scientific discovery as revelation of God&#39;s creation, not something in opposition to theism.</p>

<p>Remember when a priest published the theory of the primordial atom, and atheists hated the idea of a beginning so much that they held on to eternal universe models for another thirty years? Well, I wasn&#39;t there, but it happened. Atheists are still trying to explain it away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also only recently been widely accepted that the vast majority of possible incarnations of the universe under different values for physical constants would be totally inhospitable to complexity and life. This has huge implications for this debate, and is a big reason for so much hoopla over the multiverse theory.</p>

<p>I could go on, but can you see why I was pissed that &quot;the bible says this&quot; and &quot;theologians don&#39;t believe what they&#39;re supposed to believe&quot; were the best you could come up with? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science has always served power, whether it be corporate, government, aristocratic, etc, all throughout known history.  Just like any other field of human endeavor, it&#39;s corrupted by power relations.  Hardly surprising since the ruling elites have always decided who becomes scientists, what is worthwhile to study, and what findings history records as meritorious.</p>

<p>Anytime anyone claims to be authoritative on a subject, you should be doubly skeptical of what they are saying.  This goes for everything, including the work of scientists.</p>

<p>To see what I mean, think about the supposed discoveries of science and what they actually tell us about the world.  From what some have called, &quot;Newton&#39;s clockwork universe&quot; to modern quantum theory, what can physicists (a supposedly hard science) and their complex models teach us about what the universe is, and how it works?  They were quite useful in the design and construction of things like nuclear bombs and industrial machinery, but ask a scientist a seemingly basic question like, &#39;what is time?&#39; and they&#39;ll tell you, &quot;time is what a clock reads&quot;.  Very illuminating.</p>

<p>The purpose of science, for the most part, is to design useful tools that help the ruling elites govern a regimented, hierarchical society.  Their work should be studied critically from a political perspective, despite their claims of objectivity.</p>

<p>Also, sure. However, the leap you have to take when something is:</p>

<ul>
<li>not observable </li>
<li>has no foundation in science to back it up </li>
</ul>

<p>is fundamentally irrational.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And no, we don&#39;t &quot;witness&quot; the earth revolving around the sun;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL we&#39;ve collectively never been to space, nor witnessed the Earth revolving around the sun from the ISS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we learned that it does from careful observation and deduction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, from fucking space. Like, I understand the entire methodology of how we learned that we orbit the sun, but to say that it isn&#39;t observable is asinine. <strong>We&#39;ve literally been there, and done that</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A casual observer wouldn&#39;t be able to tell which is the case.</p>

<p>Fortunately, science isn&#39;t beholden to the viewpoints of the &quot;casual observer&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of something as incredible as the universe, the fact it exists within such narrow constraints as to allow life, and the fact that it exists continuously are all well-explained by the existence of an omnipotent creative mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything is well-explained by &quot;well, maybe it was a magical being&quot;. This isn&#39;t observable proof. You&#39;re making the grandest of false equivalencies here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know atheists often defer to luck, or an infinite multiverse where every possibility is actually realized, but neither of those satisfies your observability criterion either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ridiculous. The premise that because one thing doesn&#39;t adequately explain something means that we should lend equal credence to something that almost absolutely does not adequately explain the same concept is silly. You can believe whatever you like, but pretending that religion holds an equal weight to the practice of science in explaining the processes of the universe is totally and utterly false.</p>
