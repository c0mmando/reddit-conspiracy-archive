       Also, once a year everyone you fucked over gets to jam dildos up your ass. I jest, but I think we should make power less desirable in this country. Not much money in it. Then the only people who would want it are people who are actually trying to help rather than the parasites we have now.

       Just strip the central federal government of most of its power. If there's no power to exercise, there's none to peddle and broker. The quantity of corruption is always proportional to the amount of power.

       Switzerland, the US' so-called Sister Republic (its 1848 constitution was copied from the American founding document) has no campaign / political finance laws whatsoever. A political party or candidate can raise as much as he wishes, from whatever source, and doesn't have to disclose anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there is very little corruption, because the country is small and the political prerogatives are extremely decentralized (26 sovereign republics - cantons - for 8 million inhabitants).

       Damn, I like your punishment for bribery. Too bad it'll never happen since the public has no say in making laws. There needs to be a check and balance on them. For example, I like the idea of having the masses vote on the laws that effect them. I'm sure the voter turn out for such votes, one's where we would have actual say in, would be "unprecidented." (and I mean unpresidented to the mainstream media and politicians, because it would be completely predictable to anyone else)

       Some things should be federal so the shittiest states can't be shitty about things. Examples: how many states opposed the civil rights movement, stem cell research, and net neutrality, or how many states would gladly create insane laws affecting gun rights. Part of being the United States is that certain things remain constants across states. It's a matter of organizational technique that makes this nation more efficient to run and keep together.

       the best benefit.

       insider trade, and you have a

       Ever wonder how even the brokest-of-broke congresscritters get so much fucking money so quickly? Most non-millionaires in the House make enough to become millionaires in the 2-year period that is their first term in office.

       Not to mention you can do the Trump thing and have your own for-profit businesses providing "services" to your campaign (which typically has deep pockets, and is "someone else's money", but which you cannot legally directly pay yourself a salary from).

       I didnt even know that i just assumed it was illegal and they did it anyway and got away with it. What your saying is even worse.

       The best part is, it was exposed a few years back (after 2000 for sure, can't remember exactly when).
      </p>
      <p>
       They then passed a law that made the same laws apply to congresspeople. It stayed in effect for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was then very quietly repealed in a "must-pass-to-continue-government-funding" bill. (actually it might have been a different bill, but it was definitely a "must pass" type bill).

       Yeah they are so fucking sneaky like that. If they dont think they can paint a law they want to put through for nefarious purposes in a positive light they will quietly sneak it through lumped in with other stuff and order the msm to ignore it. An example of exceptions to this are Obamacare and the PATRIOT act where they made a big deal of it because they were confident they could manipulate the public into supporting it.

       Yeah, except they don't have to disclose much, and I'd bet its not available publicly (or if it is, it is likely delayed by enough time that it would be far out of date by the time you read it).

       The most powerful people in DC are congressional chiefs of staff and the liaisons between regulatory committees and the relevant federal bureaucracy.  Those guys work 14 hours 365 days a year.

       Fucking ridiculous. They aren't in office to serve us, they're only there to enrich themselves. Fuck them all.

      <p>
       The only thing that marginally makes it better is that at least when they aren't "working", they aren't doing anything to take away our rights. Still fucking absurd how much they get paid for it though.

       Some things should be federal so the shittiest states can't be shitty about things. Examples: how many states opposed the civil rights movement, stem cell research, and net neutrality, or how many states would gladly create insane laws affecting gun rights. Part of being the United States is that certain things remain constants across states. It's a matter of organizational technique that makes this nation more efficient to run and keep together.
