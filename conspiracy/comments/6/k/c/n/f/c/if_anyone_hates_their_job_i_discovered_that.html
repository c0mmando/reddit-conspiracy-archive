    <div class="md"><p>Just strip the central federal government of most of its power. If there&#39;s no power to exercise, there&#39;s none to peddle and broker. The quantity of corruption is always proportional to the amount of power.</p>

<p>Switzerland, the US&#39; so-called Sister Republic (its 1848 constitution was copied from the American founding document) has no campaign / political finance laws whatsoever. A political party or candidate can raise as much as he wishes, from whatever source, and doesn&#39;t have to disclose anything about it. </p>

<p>Yet there is very little corruption, because the country is small and the political prerogatives are extremely decentralized (26 sovereign republics - cantons - for 8 million inhabitants).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is <em>NOT NEARLY</em> the best benefit.</p>

<p>The best benefit is the fact that you can <em>LEGALLY</em> insider trade, and you have a <em>SHITLOAD</em> of insider information based on future government actions.</p>

<p>Ever wonder how even the brokest-of-broke congresscritters get so much fucking money so quickly? Most non-millionaires in the House make enough to become millionaires in the 2-year period that is their first term in office.</p>

<p>Not to mention you can do the Trump thing and have your own for-profit businesses providing &quot;services&quot; to your campaign (which typically has deep pockets, and is &quot;someone else&#39;s money&quot;, but which you cannot legally directly pay yourself a salary from).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt even know that i just assumed it was illegal and they did it anyway and got away with it. What your saying is even worse. Since they make the laws hell will freeze over and unicorns will be salsa dancing on the moon before they take thier own vacation days away or decide insider trader laws also apply to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part is, it was exposed a few years back (after 2000 for sure, can&#39;t remember exactly when). </p>

<p>They then passed a law that made the same laws apply to congresspeople. It stayed in effect for a while.</p>

<p>It was then very quietly repealed in a &quot;must-pass-to-continue-government-funding&quot; bill. (actually it might have been a different bill, but it was definitely a &quot;must pass&quot; type bill).</p>

<p>Apparently the $180k per year that we pay these folks is not sufficient and they need to be able to <em>LITERALLY</em> steal from the rest of us to get ahead financially (insider trading at its core is theft by the trader from &quot;the rest of the market&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they are so fucking sneaky like that. If they dont think they can paint a law they want to put through for nefarious purposes in a positive light they will quietly sneak it through lumped in with other stuff and order the msm to ignore it. An example of exceptions to this are Obamacare and the PATRIOT act where they made a big deal of it because they were confident they could manipulate the public into supporting it. </p>

Examples: how many states opposed the civil rights movement, stem cell research, and net neutrality, or how many states would gladly create insane laws affecting gun rights.

It&#39;s a matter of organizational technique that makes this nation more efficient to run and keep together.</p>
