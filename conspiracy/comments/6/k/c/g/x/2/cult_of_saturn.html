        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Prince Carlo Odescalchi is one of the highest authorities in Rome and is the head of the Cult of Saturn. The Odescalchi family have princely titles from Northern Italy, Austria and Hungary and connections with the Vatican, Knights of Malta, and Jesuit Order. They also established an influential bank in Genoa. Prince Carlo Odescalchi has an authority over the CERN program in Geneva Switzerland which also controls various particle accelerators around the world. Particle accelerators are nuclear technology developed under the Manhattan Project. German scientists worked with American scientists on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear physics. The particle accelerators are increasing gravitational pressure in the lower atmosphere which is speeding up the rate of time and decay on matter. When they turn up the particle accelerators the air feels denser and it creates more stress on the body. Gravity refers to weight and is like electromagnetic pressure. The particle accelerators function similar to the idea of taking two magnets with opposite polarities and binding them together creating pressure in the middle and then using nuclear power to accelerate their magnetism. There is a binary magnetic device inside of the Black Cube of Mecca. The Black Cube is also a symbol for Saturn. The Odescalchi&#39;s Ilok Castle in Croatia has a clock tower. They are like &quot;time wizards&quot; using their particle accelerators to oppress society so they can control the present and then dictate the future. CERN is affecting gravity which has effects on time and this is known as &quot;gravitational time dilation&quot;. Saturn is connected with time and gravity.</p>

<p>The hexagram or the six pointed star is also a symbol for Saturn the sixth planet. The hexagram is on the flag of Israel and also on the United States one dollar bill. The hexagon is the most efficient geometric shape for processing thermal energy and this is why snowflakes take the shape of six pointed stars through the thermal extraction. Many serpents have hexagonal scales for absorbing the solar rays because they are cold blooded. Zionists are a branch of the Cult of Saturn and they represent oppression and consumption. Many of the Zionists banking clans serve the Austrian-Hungarian Nobility and they are also members of the Cult of Saturn. Witchcraft uses sigils for binding and the hexagram is used like heavy shackles weighing the victim down. It is like squeezing the energy out of a person the same way you squeeze the juice out of an orange. Zionists consider energy as currency and humans as cattle. The Zionist clans were the ancient Horites that invaded Canaan and surrounded the Tribe of Judah. They eventually started speaking Hebrew and these families now claim to be Jews. The Zionist Horites do not represent the majority of todays Jews. Zionists are supremacists just like the Nazis. Saturn is connected with time in mythology. Hora is the Latin word for hour similar to Horite. Saturn is called Cronos in Greek which is where the word chronology comes from. Chronology means the arrangement of time. Time is money.</p>

<p>In Roman Mythology they worshiped the deity known as Janus who is connected with duality, time, transitions, and doorways. Janos is a common name that is taken by the Esterhazy family of Austria and Hungary. There is finance firm called Janus Capital Group with assets estimated at 190 billion. Saturn is also connected with time in the Roman Myth and there was a Cult of Saturn located in Rome with a temple right near Capitoline Hill which stored Rome&#39;s gold and silver. The Papacy and Odelscalchi family use gold and silver keys on their coat of arms. Scalchi appears to be etymologically connected to the word scale which is used for measuring the weight of things like gold and silver. The scale is also used as a symbol for judgement. Ode is a musical poem. The Odescalchi family have a portion of authority in Hollywood and the entertainment industry and they use entertainment to distract from their oppression. Tom Cruise got married at the Odescalchi castle and he serves this family as a Knight of Malta. Katy Perry covertly serves the House of Odescalchi and she is a wiccan member of the Cult of Saturn. She uses the Eye of Horus symbol in one of her music videos. Horus like the Horites. Hex in Hexagram means curse and witches curse people. Other members of the Saturn cult include Queen Elizabeth II, King Harald V of Norway, Princess Mary of Denmark, George Walker Bush, Count Janos Esterhazy de Galantha, Samuel Walton, Benjamin Netanyahu, and George Soros. There is a large clock in Oslo, Norway. Big Ben is the nickname of the clock tower in London now renamed Elizabeth Tower to honor Queen Elizabeth II. Saturn represents duality, time, (prophecy) oppression (gravity and judgement), and consumption (beast).

    <div class="md"><p>control of time I think.  the ability to arrange circumstances - thus the need to build a cohort that&#39;s aware of the possible manipulations and to design systems of behaviour and data keeping to mitigate the exploitable surface.  it&#39;s a tough problem.  also complicating things is the archonic influence, which may also be saturnian - the ability to influence thoughts and behaviour.  learning strategies to be aware of possible mood and thought influences is part of this too.  if one thinks as timespace as being a mutable hypercube of sorts, then mutations to it will layer phi-ly from points in timespace just like mutations in physical space only apply in layers along the time axis.  not trying to sound all gobbledegooky - just trying to use sufficiently accurate language.   also, i&#39;m reasonably sure there are more than one group with this tech, one of which are the &quot;good guys.  Dr Who scenarios, in other words.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kronos has been inaccurately equated with what we know as Saturn. The accurate Greek name for Saturn is Kairos who has been mistranslated as the Titan Kreios. Ares from Greek has been equated with Mars when Aristaeos is the true equivalent. This gets complex and these errors have occurred because of the egos of high level fallen angels who are lesser than their minions. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos</a> </p>

<p>Kairos (καιρός) is an Ancient Greek word meaning the right, critical or opportune moment.[1] The ancient Greeks had two words for time: chronos (χρόνος) and kairos.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius</a></p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Crius /ˈkraɪəs/, Kreios or Krios (Ancient Greek: Κρεῖος,[1] Κριός) was one of the Titans in the list given in Hesiod&#39;s Theogony, a son of Uranus and Gaia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. u/AhuwahZeus, how are you getting this information? Many of us here (u/putin_loves_cats, u/911bodysnatchers322, u/birdman5000 and many others) have done extensive reading and research through the mis/dis-info laden internet for the real answers behind the Black Nobility. Where are you getting your source information from? Are you an independent researcher piecing things together yourself through reading encyclopedias and documenting the information and connecting the dots yourself, or do you have another method?</p>

<p>We are dedicated researchers here. And many of us would like to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, yet again. I&#39;ve been looking for sometime to find another coat of arms that uses the same papal keys, and now you&#39;ve provided it via Odescalchi. Are there other families that have the keys as well, and does that symbolize how much power/influence/wealth they actually have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prince Carlo Odescalchi is like Rome&#39;s gatekeeper or key holder. I explained how the Roman deity Janus represents time like Saturn and also doorways. Keys open doors. The papal keys are used on some papal coat of arms of Popes who come from these families. Keys are used on the Geneva flag and UBS bank logo of Switzerland. Geneva is where CERN is located. There are several higher level families in the Black Nobility however the Odescalchi family is propped up to defend them as the gatekeepers. They use CERN and the Zionist banking families like the Waltons and Wallenbergs to fuel a wall of defense in front of the gate. CERN and the particle accelerators are part of that wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>el is another name for saturn</p>

<p>the 4 thing could relate to the cross, which represents balance.  a cross makes 4 regions.  the symbol for Jupiter which looks like a 4 and a 2 intersecting, is the symbol for duality in balance (the cross), with the symbol for phi change (the fibonacci curve).  when things change in timespace they are always in balance and they change in layers.  Jupiter is the Zeus/Horus/Jesus/etc. archetype - Jove, or Love.  It &quot;decorates&quot; (in the phi sense) plain duality - which is what Saturn represents as an archetype.  That&#39;s why in all the various legends of conflict between these 2 (eg. Horus vs Set) the Jupiter archetype eventually wins.  This is another way of saying that duality on its own is a kind of hell if unchecked with love.  This dualistic reality isn&#39;t tolerable without love.  The Jupiter figure also re-members - which is to say that it brings things back together after they are sliced up by Saturn.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may not be entirely compatible but these Horus vs Set comparisons are represented across a few different religions and cultures.  Zeus vs Cronus (Saturn) for instance.  The various aspects of the archetype may have been fractioned off into various characters.  Hermes/Thoth - Hermes representing a dualsexual &quot;in balance&quot; design, very Christlike.  Prometheus representing the light giver to humanity (Lucifer?), and having eternal (until freed by Hercules) punishment given by Zeus.  The other thing I&#39;ve noticed is the similarly of the phonetics around these characters, specifically the suffix phonemes of &quot;oos&quot; and &quot;ia&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>and the numbering system of their symbols (ie. assigning a number to a symbol), which interestingly enough is a required step if you want to encode any language, like say for a computer program.  i&#39;ll demonstrate.  to create an arithmetic system you have to come up with the symbols first.  those symbols will represent the number of steps needed to count up to that symbol.  imagine a numeric system as being an ordered list of symbols on a gear, and adding to be the operation of moving the gear one step at a time until you reach the symbol, and any complete rotations of the gear add a gear next to it and increment it by one.  this is the operation of addition, the reverse the operation of subtraction.  this is how the abacus works basically.  this design also implicitly leads to the creation of a zeroth order of magnitude aka a decimal.  it also implicitly leads to the creation of a zeroth order of quantity aka the number 0 and negative numbers, respectively.  right?  so you have an entire arithmetic system simply on symbol manipulation that mirror this gear model.  long hand arithmetic being one example.  all of these things require the symbol before the act of counting can even exist.  symbols predate counting.  which means that written language has an inherent numerology to it - a meta language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Janos comes from Ioannes/Oannes/Johanan. The God Oannes of Babylon has no relation to Saturn to my knowledge, but he is defintely associated with the Constellation Capricorn as he was celebrated on January 6th, as does Janus, from whose name the word &quot;January&quot; was derived. In the Aeneid, Virgil mentions that Janus is among the wardens of the door, and some people speculate that the month&#39;s name is derived not from Janus, but rather from the Latin word ianua, which means &quot;door&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scholars identify Oannes with U-An, the first of seven pre-flood sages known as apkallu (abgal), who appear–each associated with a succession of kings (as in the Sumerian King Lists)–on a cuneiform text from Uruk, dating 165 BCE. These apkallu are known as the Seven Sages, and according to the Assyriologist Gwendolyn Leick, were “fish-like” beings and “manifestations” of the primordial watery abyss (Absu), “sent by Ea,” the god of wisdom who ruled over the primordial ocean (Mesopotamia: the invention of the city, p.25, Penguin 2001) <a href="https://mythologyjournal.wordpress.com/2010/07/04/oannes-and-ioannes-connection/">https://mythologyjournal.wordpress.com/2010/07/04/oannes-and-ioannes-connection/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oannes is also viewed as the Philistine god Dagon. This has led me to a curious notion: perhaps Oannes is the same entity who ruled China as its first emperor, Da Yu Gun (also know as Emperor Yu and the Yellow Emperor). In Chinese mythology, he was the god-being that, along with his father, ultimately saved the Ancient would-be kingdom from their great flood.  I and Y were frequently interchangeable sounds so Daigun could be one in the same with Dagon. There&#39;s also speculaton that IOannes, or John the Baptist, was in fact a manifestation of Oannes, and his connection to the water would fit nicely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but unlike the planet, the moon was given its name roughly 50 years ago. It&#39;s a recent connection. In ancient times, Janus was associated with Oannes, merman-goat hybrid god of Babylon and Capricorn, a water sign that is symbolized by a goat. Perhaps the two heads are a reflection of both his goat and fish aspects. Either way, I&#39;ve felt for some time that this god is significant in understanding the great deluge mythologized in just about every significant ancient culture, and I think the original root of the story came from what is now the Tibetan plateau of Western China.The chinese myth speaks of the land in that region rising while the rest of the known world became engulfed in ocean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genesis connects to Egyptian mythology as well as Sumerian mythology. Shinto closely relates to Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology, with the primary gods being Susanoo (Zeus) and his sister Amaterasu (Hera/Artemis). Hindu is probably the oldest non-Native American religion and it conis nects to just about all of them. Arjun is Orion for example, the archer. The Mayan religion and Hindu also share a root I think, but I&#39;m still in the process of surveying native american beliefs. The later Egyptian monotheism fits neatly with much of Zoroastrianism. It also has tie ins to Judaism I speculate. AhuRa Mazda being the rough equivalent of both Ahu Ra Moshe, the God Ra Moses, as well as Ramses.Buddhism ties in, of course with Hinduism, but also with Christianity through Jesus and Kshitigarbha, the final Buddha. Oannes of Babylonian myth as I mentioned earlier is everywhere, and there&#39;s reason to believe that he might have been transexual. His female form would be Diana, as a derivative of both the Scandinavian goddess Dagin as well as the Pheonician male god Dagon. From these two gods also arose the tales of the Dragon Kings of Ancient China as well as the Naga (snake gods) of India. It&#39;s massive work, but the pieces fit snuggly and aren&#39;t too hard to find if you explore the original languages with an open interpretation and understanding of possible phonetic morphologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bowie&#39;s practically my god, so it would definitely be fitting. </p>

<p>Look into Yu the Great founder of the Xia dynasty. I&#39;m fairly certain the accounts of him are the most detailed accounts of the Dagon/Oannes figure. Gun was his father&#39;s name and his name in Chinese was Dayu. The great flood, the spontaneous growth of the Tibetan plateau, a Great disaster in the Western Chinese Desert at a place that was once known as Sion, all these events led to the largest diaspora in human history. It&#39;s near the mysterious Baigong pipes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigong_pipes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigong_pipes</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am super interested in the idea that all religions come from one, it&#39;s pretty apparent with things like the deluge.</p>

<p>But a few questions:</p>

<p>Dagon appears to be a god of the Philistines. I can&#39;t find anything on him being from Scandinavia.</p>

<p>And about the Si-Te-Cah - how exactly are they connected to Saturn?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dagon is a philistine/semitic god</p>

<p>Dagin is a goddess, that I read about about 8 months ago when I first started looking into this stuff, that&#39;s a part of one of the lesser known European pantheons, but I can&#39;t find the source that tied her to it at the moment. I thought it was Scandinavian, but it might have been Lithuanian, Germanic, Icelandic, or some other eastern european culture.  There was a &quot;Diana&quot; figure in pretty much every ancient pantheon though, so I&#39;ll try to post more on this after work today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you asked though, because I did find out that Dagin is also a goddess in India, so she might have been introduced to the region through the Aryan invasion, and then became incorporated into Hinduism, or she could have spread to Europe from India many thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve got some si-te-cah research at home as well in one of my journals, so I&#39;ll try to post that too, but I&#39;m heading out of town this weekend so it might not be til Sunday. Basically, I think they are remnants of the tribe of Seth from the Bible or the cult of Setech from ancient egypt, and ultimately, I speculate that they could potentially have been the ancestors of the Aztec.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a similar thought about CERN, that it&#39;s being used to simulate a more dense gravity/aether for both research and an operational advantage. Due to time dilation, people within the field can get more stuff done than people outside, right? Doesn&#39;t that also mean they age faster?</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re familiar with the Great Year, the whole solar system is spiraling back towards the Milky Way center due to our Sun&#39;s binary star, Sirius. (Actually, Sirius A, Sirius B, and Sirius C, but let&#39;s keep it simple.) This means the planet and all of humanity will experience denser gravity/aether in the future. The Earth and Sun both will grow at a faster rate, so we&#39;ll have more earthquakes, volcanoes, severe weather, and hotter climate. And supposedly humans will evolve more quickly. Does all this ring a bell?</p>
