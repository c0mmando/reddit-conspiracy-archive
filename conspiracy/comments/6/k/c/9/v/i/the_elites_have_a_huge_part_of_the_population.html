       A lot of people are either too scared or ignorant to investigate about the hidden hands behind our governments, even the selfish people who bash on conspiracy theorists for not following the MSM narratives are too blind to think about the long term consequences of their actions (they will eventually get screwed too) they are really wasting their lives in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists are also the only ones who can truly take action against the elites, our hidden knowledge make us the only ones who can fight back. It's not for the weak of heart to handle the hidden truths and take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think I'm exaggerating? Think about it It's all true! We are the only hope for civilization!

       That's not necessarily true. Knowledge is power. There is a time and place for everything. What we should be doing right now, is gaining as much  knowledge as possible. One main thing that I notice people disregard or just do not look into is, history.. actual history that is.

      <p>
       Whenever I hear "knowledge is power" I think of this post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When I was young my father said to me:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Knowledge is Power....Francis Bacon"
      </p>
      <p>
       I understood it as "Knowledge is power, France is Bacon".
      </p>
      <p>
       For more than a decade I wondered over the meaning of the second part and what was the surreal linkage between the two? If I said the quote to someone, "Knowledge is power, France is Bacon" they nodded knowingly. Or someone might say, "Knowledge is power" and I'd finish the quote "France is Bacon" and they wouldn't look at me like I'd said something very odd but thoughtfully agree. I did ask a teacher what did "Knowledge is power, France is bacon" mean and got a full 10 minute explanation of the Knowledge is power bit but nothing on "France is bacon". When I prompted further explanation by saying "France is Bacon?" in a questioning tone I just got a "yes". at 12 I didn't have the confidence to press it further. I just accepted it as something I'd never understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until years later I saw it written down that the penny dropped.

       The premise that "Everyone is on their own" is a lot on mind these days. I believe it started when that Mayor of London said that we should get used to terrorist acts.

       And there are two types of Conspiracy Theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is just batshit crazy or trolling, and is doing no one a service.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other one is the common folk who sees that something is wrong with the world, asks "why is this happening?" , tries to find answers, and hopefully acts against the deterioration of society and the world as whole.

       Reddit does not have a good "friend/follow/network" function.

       We need to be able to link together as people behind our accounts so that we can build trust.

       People who spend their time looking for corruption and calling it out are doing good for all of us. It incredibly altruistic to delve into such serious and unpleasant matters. You don't do it for just yourself, but for the good of all, for the rights and wellbeing of all. There is a hell of a lot of work that goes into it and I greatly appreciate anyone willing to put forth the effort to do so.
