<p>Conspiracy theorists are also the only ones who can truly take action against the elites, our hidden knowledge make us the only ones who can fight back. It&#39;s not for the weak of heart to handle the hidden truths and take action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever I hear &quot;knowledge is power&quot; I think of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was young my father said to me:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Knowledge is Power....Francis Bacon&quot;</p>

<p>I understood it as &quot;Knowledge is power, France is Bacon&quot;.</p>

<p>For more than a decade I wondered over the meaning of the second part and what was the surreal linkage between the two? If I said the quote to someone, &quot;Knowledge is power, France is Bacon&quot; they nodded knowingly. Or someone might say, &quot;Knowledge is power&quot; and I&#39;d finish the quote &quot;France is Bacon&quot; and they wouldn&#39;t look at me like I&#39;d said something very odd but thoughtfully agree. I did ask a teacher what did &quot;Knowledge is power, France is bacon&quot; mean and got a full 10 minute explanation of the Knowledge is power bit but nothing on &quot;France is bacon&quot;. When I prompted further explanation by saying &quot;France is Bacon?&quot; in a questioning tone I just got a &quot;yes&quot;. at 12 I didn&#39;t have the confidence to press it further. I just accepted it as something I&#39;d never understand.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until years later I saw it written down that the penny dropped.</p>

<p>One is just batshit crazy or trolling, and is doing no one a service. </p>

<p>The other one is the common folk who sees that something is wrong with the world, asks &quot;why is this happening?&quot; , tries to find answers, and hopefully acts against the deterioration of society and the world as whole.</p>
