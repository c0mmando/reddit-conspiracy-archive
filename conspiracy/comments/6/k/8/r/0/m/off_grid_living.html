I read a story awhile back saying that a home owner was charged by not having water, gas, and electric at their home. They had solar panels, collecting rain water, and they had propane gas. Are there any laws starting that you must have utilities? Also do y&#39;all remember the tv show doomsday prep Peta? What happened to those folk? Show isn&#39;t on anymore and I think the people on that show exposed themselves to the government in ways they shouldn&#39;t have. </p>

<p>Oh is there any spots left where people could live off the grid without outside/modern world bothering them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laws and regulations vary from state to state and county to county , best bet would be check your local laws about off grid living, some states don&#39;t allow rain water some do , but if your county is in a drought then you will need to possibly get water tank and get water from a municipal source , some counties/states will pay you for producing your own electricity but you have to produce quit a bit for it to be profitable , you can buy a propane tank 250lb 500 lb etc connect it to your shante , many appliances can be converted to run off of propane or bought straight out as propane run and you can have propane delivered annually or as needed .I don&#39;t think you necessarily have to have power service on your property , those poles can cost up to $1000 and depending on how far out you are it could get pricey . If you chose to live off grid I don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t . People in my state do it all the time , fuck I&#39;ve even done it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read many stories over the years of people being charged for living off grid. In almost every case, the crux of the problem boils down to lack of septic system or sewer. The people who are charged never actually discuss this aspect. Instead, they cry foul about how they are being persecuted by the government. Living without sewer or septic is a legitimate public health and safety issue.</p>

<p>Now, it can be done. I have lived that way myself. Humanure /composting is a legitimate option for dealing with human waste. But, it is not a legal way of dealing with human waste in most locales. And, I think that&#39;s for good reason. It is not something that can be done casually. Your humanure  pile needs to compost hot in order to kill bacteria and pathogens. Your humanure pile needs to be properly contained in order to ensure that when it rains, there is no sewage runoff from your pile to contaminate the land and local surface water.  Can all of that be done? Sure it can! But, it&#39;s not something that a person can take lightly. </p>

<p>So, when I read stories of people who are not &quot;allowed&quot; to live off grid, my first question is, &quot; what are you doing with your human waste&quot;? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are problems with this.  I think it&#39;s fine in a relatively closed system, where you are unlikely to encounter the human waste produced outside your social network, but if your environment entails a high probability of contact with &quot;foreign&quot; human waste, then you end up with the circulation of some pretty nasty pathogens.</p>

<p>Except in maybe Alaska, it&#39;s reasonable to require people to have functioning septic systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds interesting, and I will definitely check it out.</p>

<p>But, I still contend that human waste has the ability to harbor and spread disease, if not properly handled and treated. On the off grid property I lived on, which did not have septic or sewer, the previous inhabitants literally just shit into a bucket, and when the bucket was full, just dumped it on the ground on various parts of the property. Gross, and irresponsible.</p>

<p>I could be snarky and say in reply to you that &quot;someone doesn&#39;t know their history, or how human waste contaminating local surface water sources was responsible in large part for the polio epidemic, and polio cases only began to decline with proper sanitation and sewage treatment&quot;. Sanitation has played a huge part in disease reduction in the US - some argue that it&#39;s had a bigger effect than vaccinations. And, I don&#39;t see why we should take a step backward in that department.</p>

<p>Human waste CAN be treated effectively in a humanure set up. There are even open source plans for composting toilet systems made from 55 gallon drums, and the plans can generally be approved in most locales in the US as an alternative composting system.</p>

<p>I just wonder, truly, how many of these &quot;off gridders&quot; are responsible with their human waste. Because, in my experience, being responsible is not the norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! This is whats wrong with the water system in western North Carolina (Walnut Mountain Range areas are notorious for it). Don&#39;t get me wrong, the coal industry is enemy #1 to the water but out houses are very much legal and common. Homeowners with indoor plumbing often have expensive plumbing issues because they are literally hanging on a cliff, average household income is just a little over 20k/yr...  they &quot;straight pipe&quot; it into tributaries of the French Broad River.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my friends had a leech pond and holding tank setup for their home and they got harassed for it because they were in PA where you must have a pump up system installed by a licensed company. i wanted to build in the same area and researched doing it myself. you can take a class to get your license, but, you must work for a septic installation company for 3 years before you can get a license. big win for septic installation companies. which is probably the whole point of the law (yes poor septic systems dumping human waste into creeks and overflowing onto farmland is a concern as well, but thats a concern that can be solved without forcing everyone to use one specific type of expensive septic system.). i can only imagine that several septic companies got together, picked the most labor intensive type of septic they could think of, and forced a law onto the books. not everything is a plot by the illuminati. sometimes people just do things simply out of plain old boring greed. </p>

People living happily growing their own healthy food, hunting, fishing, etc etc would not have to rely on welfare to buy shit products from corporations that bribe politicians. Also, it would take a lot of people out of the work force, therefore tax revenues would heavily drop. </p>

<p>But then again, maybe they might do something like that. Kind of like in a dystopian movie. Separate those living outside the walls of the metropolis from the people living within. People living on the outside would be considered the wildlings like in game of thrones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea but i dont think russians actually pay much tax.</p>

<p>its a flat rate - very low like 13%.</p>

<p>also a lot of it is off books so people pay even less.</p>

<p>besides im sure people would still register for gib me dats so could be kept track off.</p>

<p>btw i rly liked film Captain Fantastic. shame about the massively left leaning of it (youll understand when / if you watch it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because America and the West have a system that pretends to exist to protect freedom and liberty, while defining very strictly what freedom and liberty is while consciously doing its best to keep people from living alternatively to that defined freedom and liberty, but in an often very subtle way. The past 500 years or so or more of Western history has been about a continuing redefinition of reality. When a political figurehead tells you you&#39;re free, he means something entirely different from what you think he means by it. </p>

<p>When George Orwell wrote about Newspeak and all of that, he was only getting at something that had existed for a very long time and which he didn&#39;t understand the full scope of. It started at the very least ever since nominalism became the foundational epistemological view of the West, starting with the Late Medieval Scholastics and culminating in the modern world and its naïve empiricism-materialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In North Carolina, groundwater is a property right. I recently discovered MANY families that are off the grid in western NC. I was at my families cemetery on Lonesome Mountain (I live 3 hours away and don&#39;t know the place like my relatives there) and there is one road to the cemetery. I was standing there and I heard chickens on the other side of the mountain that I thought was just forest. I look down and I could see about 5 or 6 ancient abandoned barns within 2 or 3 miles and then I knew I was going to have to check them out (despite the fact of being a 100 pound female with a foot that was in a cast just 24 hours earlier). Once I got far enough down to really start questioning my life choices, I realize they are NOT in fact abandoned. I imagined Ned Beatty getting raped behind every tree and tried to channel my inner Jon Voight. I was very, very relieved to learn they were actually just families, only closer, more protective and better looking.  </p>
