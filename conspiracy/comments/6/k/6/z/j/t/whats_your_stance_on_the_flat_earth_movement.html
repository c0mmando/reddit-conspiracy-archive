<p>I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re on a spheroid in an infinite universe.</p>

<p>Perhaps our plane of existence/psyche is &quot;flat&quot;, but pretty sure earth is in spess as depicted by NASA</p>

<p>However, I love the lore of flat earth, and until I can be 100% certain I&#39;m on a ball, I will leave that 1% chance for flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay...</p>

<p>Richard E. Byrd lead 4 expeditions to Antarctica and beyond the South Pole. He stated in an interview long ago that, he found a land mass the size of North America that was filled with natural resources and he hypothesized that many expeditions would happen in years to come because of these rich resources. He also said that he found a large deposit of coal mountains enough to supply earth for years and years. (can&#39;t remember precisely what he said). </p>

<p>His last expedition it is assumed that he went beyond this coal wall and after his expedition, the treaty of Antarctica was installed. Meaning no one can explore or enter Antarctica without governmental permission and it is agreed upon by many countries. </p>

<p>Also interesting is that, following that expedition, Russia and America started sending nuclear bombs to space and, if you look at it with an open mind, some people think that they were testing how high the dome around earth goes. Some of the footage of the space explosions almost look like it is hitting something is space too. </p>

<p>Now like I said, I am not a true flat earther, I just think all of this information is very interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because I&#39;ve researched it a lot doesn&#39;t mean that I fully believe in it. I will say one thing that interests me that I find VERY hard to believe. </p>

<p>I have a degree in aviation. We are taught that planes use circumnavigation to cut usage of fuel/time and what not. And it makes sense, until you realize they don&#39;t do it in the Southern Hemisphere. But both the paths planes take in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere look to make sense on a flat earth map.</p>

<p>This topic of flat earth fascinates me not because I fully believe it, but I like that it makes me think out side of the box and I think it&#39;s very entertaining to explore the possibilities. Hence the reason I lurk this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would only work if the sun just happened to be 100% at your back, which in their case would only happen during a lunar eclipse (their flight path was directly between the earth and the moon) so you&#39;d also see the shadow of the moon.

<p>I have my own pet psyop agent on Discus whom I throughly enjoy teasing about it. He argues the Earth doesn&#39;t spin because if it did we could feel it, so I tell him I can feel it move. It&#39;s great fun. </p>

<p>He is also one of the very few who were promoting pizzagate, so I assumed he was doing them both in order to discredit the pizzagate investigation by association. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I think. It only rose to the heights it has in the past few months. The question I always ask is why? Why is there such a big noise about the earth being flat atm? I don&#39;t trust NASA in the slightest but the theory and calculations of the Earths size dates back before NASA so I don&#39;t understand how people say &#39;I don&#39;t trust NASA therefore the Earth is flat.&#39; I do believe it has been created to make conspiracy theorists look crazy and discredited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that the Earth is potato-shaped: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1896238/how-to-calculate-curvature-of-earth-per-surface-kilometer">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1896238/how-to-calculate-curvature-of-earth-per-surface-kilometer</a></p>

<p>But seriously, I&#39;ve never had a respond to the question of why the Sun doesn&#39;t seem to get smaller as it approaches the horizon. People who think the Earth is flat are reluctant to talk about the Sun&#39;s distance from the Earth, its size and its exact flight path. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you have to have everything figured out to question the standard teachings, but at least have something to say about the sun and moon, which are the most important astronomical bodies we see in the sky. </p>

<p>This flat Earth diversion came at a time when more and more people are wondering about elite child abuse rings, globalist warmongers and banksters, etc. And who does it all go back to in its recent incarnation? Looks like some LARPer named Eric Dubay. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPWNYfhtndg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPWNYfhtndg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s wildly unlikely that the earth is flat, however I don&#39;t have any way of proving it to myself either way. Sure, I&#39;ve been provided evidence that the earth is spherical my entire life, but if there was a conspiracy to hide its flatness, wouldn&#39;t that be the case?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to consider that images of the Earth from space could be faked, but think about it deeper and you&#39;ll realize much more could be faked. If you imagine that a class of elite people with technology far beyond what the rest of us know to exist are running the world, you can start to doubt your entire world view. And if you imagine them as non-human beings, what they&#39;d be capable of is endless. For that reason, I don&#39;t think it even makes sense to argue against a conspiracy with science when the very data used to create our science could be manipulated on a scale that we can barely comprehend.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that the entire sky isn&#39;t some sort of screen manufactured to display whatever its creators want. Even if I did personally take a trip to space some day, that could be simulated. I don&#39;t know that all of the alleged continents and oceans exist. Anyone who tells me they went to Antarctica could be lying or simply the victim of an elaborate hoax/simulation.</p>

<p>So while in my day-to-day life I definitely think of the earth as a sphere, I know that I could be wrong about that or any number of things.</p>
