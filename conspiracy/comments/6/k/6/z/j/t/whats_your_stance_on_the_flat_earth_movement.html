       Would love honest responses. As a guy that did question the moon landing (in my younger days) this seems really outlandish. If you believe it to be true, convince me.
Edit- throw some upvotes for fuck sake. That's the only way to get more people involved.

       I saw a video once where this guy goes to show a website that shows you where the sun is shining on the earth at a certain time and date. The guy set the time to when the blue marble original picture was take (the only one NASA claims is actually a singular photograph and not a combination of photographs) and it showed that everywhere from Western Australia to eastern South America was in the sunlight at the exact time that the picture was apparently taken. And yet, if you look at the photo, only Africa is shown to be in the sunlight. That alone shows me that that picture is fake, and that NASA is lying to us about something.

       I don't think the earth is flat, but I don't think it's a sphere. Even Neil Degrasse Tyson admits it's not a sphere but more "pear" shaped.

       I'm talking about a picture of the entire earth. Those picture will only show parts of the earth, never include the entire earth in on picture. You would think that NASA could just turn the Hubble around or something and take a picture of earth.

       Perhaps our plane of existence/psyche is "flat", but pretty sure earth is in spess as depicted by NASA

       Okay...
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard E. Byrd lead 4 expeditions to Antarctica and beyond the South Pole. He stated in an interview long ago that, he found a land mass the size of North America that was filled with natural resources and he hypothesized that many expeditions would happen in years to come because of these rich resources. He also said that he found a large deposit of coal mountains enough to supply earth for years and years. (can't remember precisely what he said).
      </p>
      <p>
       His last expedition it is assumed that he went beyond this coal wall and after his expedition, the treaty of Antarctica was installed. Meaning no one can explore or enter Antarctica without governmental permission and it is agreed upon by many countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting is that, following that expedition, Russia and America started sending nuclear bombs to space and, if you look at it with an open mind, some people think that they were testing how high the dome around earth goes. Some of the footage of the space explosions almost look like it is hitting something is space too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now like I said, I am not a true flat earther, I just think all of this information is very interesting.

       I mean you say you aren't, but you are making a lot of the points a flat earther would make. My problem with this whole movement is that no one but Eric dubay really admits to believing it. They all just throw little jabs at theories that have never been questioned before, much like you are doing now.

       Just because I've researched it a lot doesn't mean that I fully believe in it. I will say one thing that interests me that I find VERY hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a degree in aviation. We are taught that planes use circumnavigation to cut usage of fuel/time and what not. And it makes sense, until you realize they don't do it in the Southern Hemisphere. But both the paths planes take in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere look to make sense on a flat earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       This topic of flat earth fascinates me not because I fully believe it, but I like that it makes me think out side of the box and I think it's very entertaining to explore the possibilities. Hence the reason I lurk this sub.

       But giving credence to things like this destroys elemental trust, and this subject in particular seems to intentionally broaden the gap between people. Why are people getting upset about this? Especially a sub that is supposedly about governmental conspiracies, why does this matter? The government did not create the earth, why is it even a topic?

       This sub didn't used to be all about governmental conspiracies and it still isn't. That is a relatively recent thing compared to the subs 'glory days'. If you look threw the /new on this sub you will see plenty of post not about government. A lot of people seem to agree that this sub is compromised with shills and certain topics will make it to the front page and others won't due to vote manipulation.

       I appreciate the effort because I hate reading copied posts from t_d on here. Flat earth just seems to rile people up for some reason when I find it a truly interesting conspiracy with many many people spending hours of research on it. So there's a lot of information out there, it's up to the reader to decide what they believe to be true or not true.

       They were still much further than Hubble. Most satellites aren't very high up at all, just a few hundred miles. Geosynchronous satellites could do it, but then you'd get a photo of just one spot which would be sort of boring.

       Also, for those pics to be real, the astronauts had to have passed the Van Allen radiation belt, yet NASA admits they do not know how to safely pass it. If those images are real, how did the astronauts take them (or get to the Moon for that matter) without dying from radiation poisoning?

       That's my point. According to the web page they SHOULD be visible because it is in the sunlight. Common Swansea would be that if you were up in space taking a picture of earth with your back to the sun, you would be able to see all parts of the world that is getting hit by the sun.

       That would only work if the sun just happened to be 100% at your back, which in their case would only happen during a lunar eclipse (their flight path was directly between the earth and the moon) so you'd also see the shadow of the moon. It looks like a "full earth" but reflected light from the moon illuminates parts of the edges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those other areas are there, they are just on the edges of the curvature because of their position. You can even see a of Australia if you zoom in on the bottom left.

       Right. And it's not in shadow in this image, it's just not visible at all. Again, this picture isn't taken on a line from the sun, but on a line from the moon. The entire sunlit area of the earth
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       going to show. You're seeing a lot of the sunlit area plus some moonlit area.

       That's fair, it was an inaccurate oversimplification. There's no reason to suspect that they were directly in the Earth-Sun line. That same picture (with the entire visible globe lit by either sunlight or moonlight) could be taken from many different positions relative to the Earth-Sun line.

       That would have been a more accurate statement.

       but wouldn't sun shine everywhere at the same time on a flat earth?

       i mean of course it would, so why is at least some part in the dark then? why not sun everywhere?

       and secondly, how do you explain that further north or south, you have half a year of sunlight and half a year of dark. how dafuq does that work on flat earth?

       Flat earthers believe the sun is actually much closer than we are told and is the size of roughly the moon so the sun is more of a spot light and it moves in sort of a figure 8 ish kind of way over the earth
      </p>
      <p>
       That ties into the next question in that it's just the path of the sun moving across he plane.
      </p>

       The main believe in flat earth is that we are actually stationary and the stars and sun more around the planet.

       I hope you're right but I don't think there are many on the fence.  It's all rational people on one side who don't think about it because it's a foregone conclusion and loud busy psyop agents on the other side trying to make something out of nothing.

       That sounds a lot like how Trump got elected. One group of people knowing that the other group of people is stupid, and dismissing them and the questions they have. I'm really not trying to be a dick, but it's this "they are too stupid to matter" thought process that created an us vs. them mentality. People have questions, a lot of them have stupid questions. But who is the bigger asshole, the guy that asks a stupid question or the cunt that calls him a retard and never answered the question?

       I find it hard to believe there are any people who honestly have questions about the flat Earth bs. It is taught in third grade and anyone can easily look it up. Who would have questions? You'd have to be incredibly stupid or ignorant to not know the earth was a globe.

       I have my own pet psyop agent on Discus whom I throughly enjoy teasing about it. He argues the Earth doesn't spin because if it did we could feel it, so I tell him I can feel it move. It's great fun.

       He is also one of the very few who were promoting pizzagate, so I assumed he was doing them both in order to discredit the pizzagate investigation by association.

       This is what I think. It only rose to the heights it has in the past few months. The question I always ask is why? Why is there such a big noise about the earth being flat atm? I don't trust NASA in the slightest but the theory and calculations of the Earths size dates back before NASA so I don't understand how people say 'I don't trust NASA therefore the Earth is flat.' I do believe it has been created to make conspiracy theorists look crazy and discredited.

       I read somewhere that it was MI6. But they work with the CIA so it is probably some kind of joint effort. I think the purpose is to create confusion, 9/11 was supposed to be the end of the laws of physics, so flat Earth would take on that too and end astronomy. The PTB are attempting to recreate the dark ages by making people as ignorant as possible. That is my theory about it.

       It gets conflated with legitimate theories. Go ahead, assert that 9/11 was an inside job and see how long until somebody accuses you of being a flat-earther. It's no accident.

       There's a large group of people that want to keep this sub fixated on American politics with Russia interference like it matters. They honestly say that the fe is a psy op made to distract from what's really going on(which is given to us by the msm which is hilarious).

       I still say use the search engine. You'll find lots and lots of information.

       Why are you relying on others to give you those reasons? It's your life, your world. You create it and live in it. No outsider should tell you how your life is. If it's true for you and you make it work then it's true.

       That's fair on philosophy, but science and math is held to a higher (or at least more verifiable) standard. The burden of truth is on the side of denier at this point.

       I'm sure truth would have a few choice words on that. Math and science require two things. Money and faith. Sounds like religion. If you want to be "convinced" on fe you have to give up false idols and ideologies.

       It's difficult for all of us to even look into the Flat Earth because we were born having everyone saying we live on a planet orbiting around the sun. I was totally against looking at any FE research, but once I started to read and look at what NASA says is real; I have no confidence in anything I've learned as a child. I know one thing though, you don't have to believe the Earth is a sphere or is flat to see how NASA has faked most of what they have shown us.

       But seriously, I've never had a respond to the question of why the Sun doesn't seem to get smaller as it approaches the horizon. People who think the Earth is flat are reluctant to talk about the Sun's distance from the Earth, its size and its exact flight path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you have to have everything figured out to question the standard teachings, but at least have something to say about the sun and moon, which are the most important astronomical bodies we see in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       This flat Earth diversion came at a time when more and more people are wondering about elite child abuse rings, globalist warmongers and banksters, etc. And who does it all go back to in its recent incarnation? Looks like some LARPer named Eric Dubay.

       I think it's wildly unlikely that the earth is flat, however I don't have any way of proving it to myself either way. Sure, I've been provided evidence that the earth is spherical my entire life, but if there was a conspiracy to hide its flatness, wouldn't that be the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take much imagination to consider that images of the Earth from space could be faked, but think about it deeper and you'll realize much more could be faked. If you imagine that a class of elite people with technology far beyond what the rest of us know to exist are running the world, you can start to doubt your entire world view. And if you imagine them as non-human beings, what they'd be capable of is endless. For that reason, I don't think it even makes sense to argue against a conspiracy with science when the very data used to create our science could be manipulated on a scale that we can barely comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that the entire sky isn't some sort of screen manufactured to display whatever its creators want. Even if I did personally take a trip to space some day, that could be simulated. I don't know that all of the alleged continents and oceans exist. Anyone who tells me they went to Antarctica could be lying or simply the victim of an elaborate hoax/simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while in my day-to-day life I definitely think of the earth as a sphere, I know that I could be wrong about that or any number of things.

       You could also argue that we just need to keep searching with our own senses, and that we haven't seen all the pieces of the puzzle yet. If people were wrong about the earth being flat, why can't they be wrong about it being round? There is always more to learn, so I like to keep an open mind.
