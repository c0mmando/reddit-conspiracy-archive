        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The media wants people to believe it&#39;s all about Comet Ping Pong and some kind of child abuse ring being run out of their basement, but it&#39;s so much deeper than that. Alefantis is without a doubt suspect as hell but I still don&#39;t know how much of a role he or CPP play in all of this. What I do know is that people like Jeffrey Epstein are key players in the blackmailing and this was addressed way before Pedogate went mainstream. From a court filing in October of 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein&#39;s purposes in &quot;lending&quot; Jane Doe (along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite part of Pizzagate is that these people will insist again and again that John Podesta is talking in a secret pedophile code in his emails, and yet in all of the emails listed above, <strong>NOT A SINGLE ONE IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY JOHN PODESTA</strong></p>

<p>Only three of the Podesta emails you listed have any reference to pizza. So, despite scooping through years and years of emails, you found three emails about pizza, one of which is just a photo two journalist eating pizza, and none of which were written by John Podesta himself. And from that you expect me to believe that he is using code words to discuss child sex trafficking? Give me a break.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first is clearly a joke, comparing foods to performance enhancing drugs. But tell me, since you clearly believe it&#39;s code, how on earth do you &quot;play domination better on little girl than little boy&quot;? How does that make sense?</p>

<p>A pizza-related map is either a handkerchief like <a href="http://imgur.com/QkbP2Qx">this</a> or it&#39;s a joking dig at Podesta&#39;s fondness for pizza. But you really believe people would be trying to find the owner of a semen-encrusted hanky? </p>

<p>The last is just a comment on the craziness of international diplomacy.</p>

<p>Your problem is you can&#39;t understand idiomatic English.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Context matters. He was writing a friendly email, not trying for the best grammar. So he used a bit of an obscure meaning of &quot;on&quot; to mean &quot;while I am eating pasta&quot;. If you read the rest of the email the full phrase is obvious: He usually eats pasta while playing dominoes with this particular group, but this time he had cheese instead and jokingly wonders if eating cheese would help.</p>

<p>Seriously, the lengths people are going to read into these &quot;code words&quot; are ridiculous. What&#39;s more likely, a guy was sending a thank you email for a gift basket containing food, or a 60+ year old man was using a 4chan meme to arrange nefarious encounters with his underground ring of child kidnappers?</p>

<p>He was making a dad joke comparing pasta and cheese to performance enhancing drugs and whether he&#39;d play domnioes better after consuming them. It&#39;s like saying &quot;will I run the marathon faster on cocaine than on speed?&quot;, but substituting  dominoes for running and food for drugs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But your madeup 4chan code is even more problematic. It translates this as “do you think I’ll do better playing domination on little girl than on little boy?”, which really doesn&#39;t make sense. How do you &quot;play domination&quot;? Why would they they say play domination <em>on</em> little girl? How do you dominate someone better? You spend so much time trying to pick minute holes in a perfectly understandable sentence that you miss the massive holes in your supposed translation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First point - that&#39;s actually the most reasonable explanation for that particular email I&#39;ve ever heard from anyone who argues against pizzagate. So thank you for that new perspective. Completely valid and I&#39;ve taken it on board.

<p>Second point - I don&#39;t believe is valid. You&#39;re arguing grammar when the theory suggests it&#39;s a code. A code wouldn&#39;t need to have perfect grammar, so long as you get the message across. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways. You were arguing that the fact Sandler wrote &quot;on&quot; meant that he wasn&#39;t simple talking about eating food, but now you&#39;re saying that grammar doesn&#39;t matter in a code. It must be news to you, but a lot of people don&#39;t worry about grammar in personal emails or even in public posts. You&#39;re changing the argument to suit your position.</p>

<p>In any case, the whole joke depends on the use of &quot;on&quot; to make the drugs connection. People talk about being &quot;<em>on</em> drugs. If Sandler had written &quot;Do you think I&#39;ll do better playing dominos after eating cheese than after eating pasta?&quot;, the whole drugs allusion would have been lost.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still up for a reasoned discussion on what convinced you that pizzagate is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to go to sleep, but I can have a quick go at these. Fifty per cent of pizzagate is smear capaign and 50 per cent is just woeful reading comprehension skills by gullible people. In short, they can&#39;t recognise a joke even when it&#39;s right in front of their noses.</p>

<p>A real estate agent found a handkerchief that may or may not have had a design on it relating to pizza. It is what it is. You find that hard to believe but you accept without question that someone would pick up a semen covered handkerchief and then try to find the owner? Get real.</p>

<p>The chioldren email is just a woman talking about her grandchildren coming to a family get together and letting people know if they want to go for a swim they won&#39;t be the only ones.</p>

<p>The playing dominoes comment is just a dad joke comparing cheeses and pasta to performance enhancing drugs. Explain to me how you get orgies in a box?</p>

<p>&quot;Still in torture chamber&quot; is not literal.Plenty of people refer to their jobs as torture or hell.</p>

<p>The hot dog stand in Hawaii is more joking. People in high-stress jobs talking about an easy job in paradise.</p>

<p>Just because someone says they think Obama spent $65,000 on hot dogs doesn&#39;t mean he did.</p>

<p>Sacrificing a chicken is another joke, coupled with a dig at Boehmian Grove.</p>

<p>Tony Podesta wrote about staying in touch with Hastert <em>before</em> the abuse allegations came out. It&#39;s not hard to understand why a political lobbyist would stay in touch with someone who was a big political player. Joking about someone fleeing legal troubles doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re involved in them.</p>

<p>Walnut sauce and pizza references are simply references to food. You do realise the &quot;code words&quot; were just a 4chan poster&#39;s invention don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>What has someone hiring an adolescent boy dancer got to do with anything? As noted in the email, it was considered inappropriate.</p>

<p>Getting pizza for an hour is just idiomatic English: &quot;I have an hour for lunch, do you want to get pizza?&quot; And I&#39;d be wired if I had to sit by kids on a flight. Wired does not mean sexually excited.</p>

<p>Store-bought pasta has a shelf-life of 18 months to two years. I have pasta in my house that&#39;s older than three months.</p>

<p>The headcount for pizza is more joking. Notable you leave out the bit about &quot;Simply send a single response, filed, color-coded, double-sided and
appropriately labeled, signed in triplicate and set on fire.&quot; Clearly joking.</p>

<p>Spirit cooking was an art piece by Abramovic that later became a name they gave to having friends round for a meal. Spirits aren&#39;t real, you know.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you find suspicious in the last email. It&#39;s just a busy household.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason they talk about Japan in relation to Pizzagate. Edo era Japan had their own version of Ancient Greek boy loving rituals, and also transgenderism or &quot;third gender&quot; which we&#39;re now seeing get pushed on Western culture:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/arts/design/when-japan-had-a-third-gender.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/arts/design/when-japan-had-a-third-gender.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The art on display shows how many permutations were acceptable in Edo society: men or women in liaisons with the adolescent wakashu; female geisha dressing like wakashu and engaging in rough sex; male prostitutes cross-dressing as women; men impersonating women on the Kabuki stage, a tradition that lasts to this day; and even a male Kabuki actor impersonating a woman who pretends at one point to be a man.</p>

<p>The wakashu are a case in point. The term describes the time a male reaches puberty and his head is partly shaved, with a triangle-shaped cut above the forelocks that is a telltale way to identify wakashu. During this stage of life only, before full-fledged adulthood, it was socially permissible to have sex with either men or women.</p>

<p>Why do so many religious nutters seem drawn to pizzagate? Abramovic&#39;s performances may not be to everyone&#39;s tastes, but it is art. Just because you don&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t make her a criminal. Let me ask you what you would think of someone who claimed to consume the literal blood and flesh of a man as part of their religious rituals and who had paintings of a half-naked or entirely naked baby boy? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be quick to call them a paedophile. Except I was describing a Catholic – they consume the blood and flesh of Christ in the communion and they display paintings of the naked baby Jesus all the time. Context matters.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This one is so fucking easy to explain if you&#39;re willing to listen.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start:</p>

<p><strong>This email was sent on christmas eve this is very important to most of the context</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape
of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the
square shaped box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John sent a present in the mail, the present was different from what he normally sends</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John sent cheese, now i&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not old, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cheese-Assortments-Samplers/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=2256190011"><strong>but sending cheeses is pretty common</strong></a>, apparently he used to send pasta which while not as common, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pasta-Featuring-Marinara-Artichoke-Sun-dried/dp/B0006H94P4">is still a gift</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am awaiting the
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Herb Sandler here is very old, it&#39;s easy to believe he has children coming to visit soon <strong>for christmas</strong> and bringing thier children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

<p>I miss you both</p>

<p>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old guy ending, nothing odd</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old people play dominos, you see any teens crazy to play that? He rhetorically asking if he&#39;d do better playing that filled with cheese(<strong>the gift he was just given</strong>) or with the pasta he used to get as a gift when playing.</p>

<p>I want you to right now read over it and think if it was sent by your own grandfather to a friend who had just sent assorted cheese to him</p>

<p>Moloch was a sacrificial God up until Deuteronomic reform in the 6th century. </p>

<p>In the 17th century the actual real practice of sacrifice was ancient history and Moloch was being used in literature as a figurative trope for a costly sacrifice. </p>

<p>And the text I quoted is most definitely on the wiki, you&#39;re just suffering from selective reading again... Will doctors ever find a cure? I&#39;ll sacrifice a rabbits foot to Moloch just in case. </p>

<p>Probably because it&#39;s so blindingly obvious that most people don&#39;t think it needs explaining.

It will be well-known in the Beltway and that&#39;s why she made the comment.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one inventing conspiracies and codes to explain away obvious jokes. You don&#39;t have a single shred of actual evidence that anything untoward is going on here. Part of the problem is that a lot of pizzagaters seem to be quite young and don&#39;t get the context in which the emails were written. For example, when John Podesta tweeted a reference recently to the Saturday Night Massacre, some of them seriously thought he was talking about a murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is my misunderstanding of pizzagate?</p>

<p>As far as &quot;pedogate&quot; is concerned, that was just an attempt to rebrand the conspiracy once people realised that the repeated claims that high-level arrests would go down as soon as Trump was president were just more bullshit. By calling it &quot;pedogate&quot;, the proponents of the theory were able to claim any child abuse arrest as proof of &quot;pedogate&quot; (even though they weren&#39;t), and it also allowed people like Alex Jones and David Seaman to keep milking the subject while minimising the chance of being sued for defamation. Talking of child abuse as &quot;pedogate&quot; is like claiming that the 14,000 murders in the US each year are proof of a conspiracy called &quot;murdergate&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not an answer. That&#39;s a source less claim you&#39;ve pulled from nothing. You can&#39;t just state they are satanists without sources. The pedophilia has some merit with people like Jimmy Savile etc. But Satanism? What possible evidence do you have on satanism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done hundreds of hours of research to come to this conclusion. On the top of my head, several actors have come out to say pedophilia is a huge problem in Hollywood, in the music industry you can see a lot of symbolism in concerts. Marina has ties with JayZ, beyonce, lady gaga etc. You can see Jayz with an aleister crowley shirt, baphomet worshipping symbolism is everywhere in the music industry, katy perry pedophile symbolism in her music videos, same with rihanna. Look at Eminem&#39;s twitter for example, or miley cyrus ties people who post to instagram pizza-related sex, (including her own pizza obession) or kanye west&#39;s breakdown (forced hospilization) etc. etc. </p>

<p>Drake litterly saying they worship &quot;6 God&quot; behind closed doors etc. etc.</p>

<p>Look what came out today about that guy from the vatican. Or look into England royals and their ties with satanism and pedophilia. It&#39;s EVERYWHERE. That is no coincidence. My personal opinion it&#39;s the devil controlling powerful structures in society.</p>

<p>Because you have already put in &quot;hundreds of hours&quot; of research. If you&#39;ve invested that much time and effort, why should we also take all the time and effort when you could just point us to anything you&#39;ve personally researched and say, &quot;Here is my evidence.&quot; Telling us to research it ourselves is a waste of time, and it makes you look dishonest.</p>

<p>From the wiki on MKULTRA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1957, with funding from a CIA front organization, Donald Ewen Cameron of the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada began MKULTRA Subproject 68. His experiments were designed to first &quot;depattern&quot; individuals, erasing their minds and memories—reducing them to the mental level of an infant—and then to &quot;rebuild&quot; their personality in a manner of his choosing. To achieve this, Cameron placed patients under his &quot;care&quot; into drug-induced comas for up to 88 days, and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months, often administering up to 360 shocks per person. He would then perform what he called &quot;psychic driving&quot; experiments on the subjects, where he would repetitively play recorded statements, such as &quot;You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company&quot;, through speakers he had implanted into blacked-out football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects (for sensory deprivation purposes). The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages, played for 16–20 hours a day, for weeks at a time. In one case, Cameron forced a person to listen to a message non-stop for 101 days. Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse stables behind Allan Memorial into an elaborate isolation and sensory deprivation chamber where he kept patients locked in for weeks at a time. Cameron also induced insulin comas in his subjects by giving them large injections of insulin, twice a day, for up to two months at a time. <strong>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#MKULTRA">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#MKULTRA</a></p>

<p>Low level sex offenders and pedos are already dealt with fairly well. Most of them involve people known to the victim. But if it goes too high it will get shut down and nothing will happen. When you start talking about actual CIA and secret society human trafficking law enforcement has no power.</p>

Pro-Trump posters keep saying &quot;ignore the false dichotomy&quot;, yeah, that&#39;s absolutely true, don&#39;t generalize or assume and think for yourself, but one party&#39;s platform is pushing free education, free healthcare, higher minimum wage, and other policies that lift and protect the weakest members of society, and the other party is writing voter laws to stop minorities from voting, writing medical bills that will kill thousands of poor people and give money back to the wealthy elite, and doing nothing to help people who desperately need help, how does a sub like this that is supposed to be for a fairer and more transparent world get behind them?  Where&#39;s his infrastructure bills?  Where&#39;s his pro-LGBT legislation?  Where is anything good, promised or otherwise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read about a 2 year investigation into a group pushing a microsoft scam. That took a lot of people to work on, not your everyday beat cops.</p>

<p>Look at the seth rich murder, 64 other murders that year still unsolved, more the prior year and more this year. Forces don&#39;t have the manpower to keep up investigations. </p>

<p>Take cops off of drugs/traffic issues and move them around then, money in this case means to me resources. </p>

<p>We could further shift that to have a whole separate government entity that is involved in taking over all sorts of investigations when other avenues get exhausted and getting nowhere (like a state/city level cold case unit on the one hand and an investigative group for more current ones). </p>

<p>Any way you go you end up with either not having enough people to get the job done or having to put forth more capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, pizzagaters have claimed that kids have been abused at Comet Ping Pong. They claimed that a videoclip of the street outside CPP in which someone could be heard yelling was proof of a child being abused isnide, they claimed that the WorldCorp video showed achild being abused and was shot at CPP, and they claimed that secret tunnels ran from CPP&#39;s non-existent basement and that they used these tunnels to supply children to the Washington elite.</p>

<p>Yes, the Franklin &quot;coverup&quot; is bullshit too. You&#39;re probably too young to know but there was a wave of satanic moral panic that swept around the world in the 1980s and involved accusations of poweful men abusing children and sacrificng them, though in those days the accusations were centred around childcare facilities, not pizzerias. After exhaustive invesigation at the time, these claims all turned out to be false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no &quot;little kids waiting for him in a hot tub&quot;. There was a family gathering at which there was a swimming pool that was to be heated. A woman mentioned that her children would be going and gave their ages: it&#39;s not unusual for people going to these sorts of get-togethers to let others know how old the children will be so that other parents will know if their kids will have anyone to play with. And John Podesta didn&#39;t even go.</p>

<p>No one has shown that Laura Silsby has any ties to Hillary Clinton. It was claimed that Clinton had been kept informed about Silsby for years but this was soley based on one the transcription of one email that had a typo in the date (2001 instead of 2010). How do we know it was a typo? Because the original did not have it, the New Life Children&#39;s Refuge was mentioned in it and that was only set up in 2009, and it also mentioned the Haitian earthquake, which occurred in 2010. Clinton was secretary of state when the members of the NLCR were deatined, which was causing a diplomatic issue for both Haiti and the US and a delegation of US senators were pushing the State department to do something about it. That is why she was included in routine State Department emails about the subject. That does not constitute &quot;ties&quot;.</p>

<p>James Alefantis had no paedophile images on his instagram. None. He had a picture of child (his god-daughter I think) with her hands taped to a table, but she was happy and smiling and her parents were nearby.</p>

<p>Podesta&#39;s emails were not in code. Everyone of those emails is perfectly understandable to anyone with average written comprehension skills and knowledge of idiomatic English. However, when you substitute the claimed code the emails make no sense: how do you get orgies sent in a box? What does &quot;do better playing domination on little girls than little boy&quot; mean? Do you really think they bought girls for volunteer workers?</p>

<p>James Alefantis is <em>not</em> one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington. Yes, GQ put him at 49 in their 50 most powerful list one year, but it&#39;s a clickbait list and doesn&#39;t mean anything. Above him was another restaurateur, some party planners, and some bloggers. And do you really think that GQ put him in that list because they thought he was peddling children to politicians?</p>

<p>First, where is your proof that Alefantis is connected to the Rothschilds? All I&#39;ve seen is one picture comparing Alefantis to
Philippine de Rothschild and claiming that this proves something. All it proves is how gullible some people are. And so what is he is? What does that prove? Nothing.</p>

<p>The logo for Besta Pizza is not the boy lover logo. It&#39;s a stylised &quot;B&quot;. Moreover, the boy lover logo is just a traingle spiral, which is common geometric design. You can buy clipart of similar spirals and people have been drawing this design for thousands of years before a small group of paedophiles used it to indicate their individual sexual preference. Let me repeat that last bit – the boy lover logo was for individuals to indicate their sexual preference; it wasn&#39;t meant for businesses to display. Real life is not some James Bond movie or videogame where all the bad guys wear identifying symbols.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen any proof any of the separate child abuse cases are in any way related to a larger ring. Nor do I think every rich person is a pedophile. Most of the evidence I have seen like Sandusky, Gary Glitter, etc suggests they mostly operate alone. A ring doesn&#39;t make much sense because if one goes person down, everyone goes down. It increases the likelihood of getting caught If Epstein has a bunch of blackmail material why didn&#39;t he use it? </p>

<p>I also agree if you really want to convince people you need to drop the Satanic shit, that&#39;s nonsense. And it doesn&#39;t matter, the religious beliefs of a pedophile are not relevant, and the number of Christian/Jew/Moslem/Hindus doing it are going to massively outnumber any occultists doing it. That angle may work with your religious fundy middle American buddies, but most people laugh at Satanic panic nonsense. Also the whole triangle equals pedo symbol is silly too. I don&#39;t think sex offenders advertise. </p>

<p>I am totally opposed to child abusers, but false accusations, like with Podesta and pizzagate, are abhorrent. Doing it as a political smear job is disgusting, it&#39;s why I continue to fight pizzagaters. The OP here is still on about Alefantis. People have gotten death threats over total nonsense. It threatens free speech. It makes genuine conspiracies easier to dismiss. And at the end of the day the Conspiracy community got used by a group of Trump supporting 4 chan posters. That should bother you, that innocent people got harassed because they are democrats, that they still live in danger, over some code words that a troll site says are codes for children. The whole thing is so laughable it&#39;s insane, but people here are still on about it.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t ask you if you thought it was a crime. Since you quickly glossed over it without giving it the proper attention that it deserves in the context of the conversation I felt it would be prudent to revisit that point and point out your bullshit.</p>

<p>Please try to follow along in your own conversation. </p>

<p>So I will ask you more simply. <strong>Do you think that a penis ejaculating pizzas is typical advertising fare for a restaurant?</strong>  What about all the other weird images? Do you think they are typical? If so, could you point to any other restaurants that use similar sexually explicit images? </p>

<p>... and the Anthony Wiener thing is just hard cold proof that this shit is going on within those exact circles that people have accused, so I just like throwing it in there cause you guys can&#39;t defend against it :)</p>

<p>Skepticism about claims of a child sex ring isn&#39;t &quot;defending these people&quot;. That&#39;s a straw man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I grew up around the Franklin scandals times, I had many friends who were victims (actually groomed to be prostitutes and even sent to the Whitehouse) via boystown and all of them are now deceased. That&#39;s how it works. If your an unwanted/poor/street kid they will use you until dead. To this day Franklin has not been tried for his crimes. I was also a victim of childhood sexual abuse and I work with other victims via support networks. I have no faith in this corrupt system. I do believe in karma and these terrible men and women will reap all they sow. I don&#39;t advocate for reform anymore-- what we need is a revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t hear about pedogate until long after I heard about pizzagate and only ever as an an attempt to link pizzagate to the fact that pedophiles are well known to exist in order to legitimize pizzagate.</p>

<p>The media isn&#39;t who made me believe it&#39;s all about inventing code words to apply to someones email in order to translate them into meaning that there is a pedo ring being run out of the basement of Comet Ping Pong.  It was pizzagaters who made me believe that.`</p>

<p>You are trying to prove there is some legitimacy to a very specific set of accusations arrived by way of a very specific theory based and justified by very specific interpretations of very specific information by pointing to something much more general.  This is like me trying to prove you stole something in very specific circumstances as proven by applying specific code words to your correspondence then saying it&#39;s just the media who want everyone to believe that&#39;s what it&#39;s about and in fact it&#39;s more about the fact that crime is real and really exists, just check out these stats on burglaries if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

<p>Frankly this is pathetic.  If you want to talk about Epstein then talk about Epstein but don&#39;t try to pretend that pizzagate was ever anything other than propaganda posing as a conspiracy theory.  You&#39;re just exploiting very real suffering (of the Epstein victims) and this goes beyond exploiting the concept of such suffering - now your&#39;re exploiting actual real people rather then imaginary victims who don&#39;t actually exist.</p>
