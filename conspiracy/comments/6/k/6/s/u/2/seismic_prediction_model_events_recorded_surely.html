<p>TARDY CME SPARKS AURORAS OVER ALASKA: Arriving hours later than expected, a CME brushed past Earth&#39;s magnetic field on Nov. 9th at approximately 0600 UT.  At first the weak impact did little to spark geomagnetic activity. As Earth passed through the CME&#39;s magnetized wake, however, auroras did appear.  Marketa Murray sends this picture from a spot outside Fairbanks, Alaska:
WEEKEND AURORA WATCH: Minor geomagnetic storms and Arctic auroras are likely on Nov. 12th and 13th as Earth moves deeper into a stream of high-speed solar wind. Visibility of auroras will be muted somewhat by the glare of the waxing supermoon. Browse: Aurora Photo Gallery</p>

HERE COMES THE SOLAR WIND: If you live near the Arctic Circle, get ready for Northern Lights.  A solar wind stream is approaching Earth with wind speeds as high as 700 km/s.  First contact with the fast-moving gas on Dec. 7th and 8th could produce G1-class geomagnetic storms and auroras at high latitudes.
The source of this solar wind stream is a hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere, shown here in a Dec. 5th image from NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory:</p>

<p>CHANCE OF STORMS: NOAA forecasters say there is a 40% chance of minor geomagnetic storms on Aug. 16-17 when a high-speed (700 km/s) solar wind stream brushes against Earth&#39;s magnetic field. Glare from the nearly full Moon will, unfortunately, mitigate the visibility of auroras. Aurora alerts: text or voice
CO-ROTATING INTERACTION REGION: A co-rotating interaction region (CIR) is expected to hit Earth&#39;s magnetic field on Aug. 19th.  CIRs are transition zones between slow- and fast-moving solar wind streams. Shock waves and density gradients inside these regions often do a good job sparking auroras.  NOAA forecasters say there is a 40% chance of G1-class geomagnetic storms when the CIR arrives. Aurora alerts: text or voice</p>

INCREASING CHANCE OF FLARES: NOAA forecasters have boosted the odds of an M-class flare today to 25%. The probable source would be sunspot AR2488, which has developed an unstable &#39;beta-gamma&#39; magnetic field with pent-up energy for strong explosions. Any M-flares today could produce minor shortwave radio blackouts. Solar flare alerts: text or voice</p>

<p>SUBSIDING CHANCE OF STORMS: A co-rotating interaction region (CIR) expected to hit Earth&#39;s magnetic field on Aug. 19th did not arrive as expected. Probably, the sharp transition zone between slow- and fast-moving solar wind streams (i.e., the CIR) dissipated before it reached our planet. As a result, NOAA forecasters  have downgraded the chance of geomagnetic storms today to only 15%.</p>

<p>GEOMAGNETIC STORM: A G1-class geomagnetic storm is underway on Aug. 23rd as Earth passes through a stream of solar wind filled with negative polarity (-Bz) magnetic fields. The ongoing disturbance has sparked some of the first auroras of the season over Finland:</p>

SOLAR SECTOR BOUNDARY CROSSING: On Aug. 28th, Earth will cross a fold in the heliospheric current sheet. This &quot;solar sector boundary crossing&quot; could disturb our planet&#39;s magnetic field and spark auroras at high latitudes. NOAA forecasters estimate a 25% to 30% chance of G1-class geomagnetic storms. Aurora alerts: text or voice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>P.s. Feel free to help build the model in <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a>
Contact <a href="/u/julianthepagan">/u/julianthepagan</a></p>

<p>Need programmers and various coders. Pretty large yet simple project. Any level of experience welcome. </p>

<p>The bulk of the project can be deciphered in the <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a> sub.</p>

<p>Also Totally finished my website&#39;s 2.0. 
<a href="Http://www.crydir.com">Http://www.crydir.com</a> (which is a crypto-directory, and user forum). Still thinking bitcoin will hit 4800+ by xmas. 
Take care all :)
Please visit and show some love. Ty. </p>

<p>KK. Hope to see ya in the sub and ya. Contact <a href="/u/julianthepagan">/u/julianthepagan</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! First off just wanna say I really appreciate your work on seismic activity and try to follow as much of it as I can.</p>

<p>Anyway, hijacking your comment here to ask more about your prediction that bitcoin will soar. I tried checking through your comments a bit but didn&#39;t find anything about it.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate just a sentence or two on why you think it will hit 4800+ ? If I were to believe it would hit that, do I just basically buy as much coin as I can spare for right now and sell after it hopefully goes up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>21 million coins 7.8 billion population. In korea at the 2800 peak users were paying near 4000usd premiums. </p>

<p>Last time we saw that was when india pushed for legalization. (900premium) on a 700usd market. </p>

<p>Thats when I began advocating for a buy-in. Prices soared to 1200 within 30days. </p>

<p>There probably wont be much of a 3000 range. Its a ceiling. Once we break the wall 100 per day inflation will take place again. Causing a masse buy in / or &#39;goldrush&#39;. The inflation will likely reach over 5k. Yet the value I determined was 4800. Post crash. With a 10k (ceiling and 3600 floor).</p>

<p>My assumption is regardless of the price being post 3600. The crash will either come in dec or jan. (with a 4800 holding price). </p>

<p>Note I also determined the first etg split (215 to 130). And the ltc price at 46. (post bitstamp). So I am just good at assessing the numbers. Idk why. Just always been good at graphs. </p>

<p>Imo its a pretty safe bet. But I think any war or unseen factor could easily mitigate the vector of growth I am anticipating. Yet its the vector of growth all the same. So should life be calm. Its basically guaranteed. 
(however life can be chaos). So don&#39;t hurt yourself investing more then your saving and willing to lose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note this coincidence is why I feel we can adequately assess incoming seismic data 24 - 100+ hrs in advance. </p>

<p>Not all seismic events, yet the largest on earth-

    <div class="md"><p>Final note cause I am a bit pissy...</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite obvious each and every 7.0+ magnitude earthquake followed a bz componet breaching. My being a <em>psuedo</em> scientist or not makes of no factual argument to this relevancy. </p>

<p>So, By comparing a list of all events by approximate range, intensity, and vector I do propose that a factual algorithmic agency such as the &quot;Predpol&quot; (predictive policing agency), could use <strong>predictive modeling</strong> in comparison to the past 10 years seismic and solar data on earth to accurately assess a marginal percentage of the worlds most caustic seismic events. With or without some Profitable conquest in accuracy. </p>

<p>That being said, please upvote, join <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a>, or build it on your own and get me back. Cause I&#39;d like to say these events will undoubtedly be the largest BZ breaches on record for the 2016 year. With each event leading to the largest seismic events on earth. 
Like me or not, the data is not irrelevant- </p>
