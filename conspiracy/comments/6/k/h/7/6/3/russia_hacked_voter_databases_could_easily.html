<p>I used to work in malware analysis, and one big way people would cash out on stolen credit and debit cards is to get a bunch of people in the target county to go and use them. They keep a little money and most goes back to the organizing gang.
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/10/us-crime-debit-cards">Example.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A network of operatives then fanned out to rapidly withdraw money in multiple cities, authorities said. The cells would take a cut of the money, then launder it through expensive purchases or ship it wholesale to the global ringleaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How fucking easy would it be to take the stolen voting records and make believable fake IDs. They could target people in key counties who have a consistent record of not voting. Then have a strong turnout for their desired candidate.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s case rests on people habitually not voting, but in the last several elections, the voting turnout has not been based on precedent. Many people who never voted showed up for Obama and Trump (and Hillary). This would cause several examples of the same person&#39;s ID being used for multiple votes and in some cases voting for the same candidate. </p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of voter fraud investigations would lead to all those expensive agents and the supporting network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly why those of us who actually read the Podesta and DNC emails were so outraged at Clinton, because these allegedly Russian-hacked servers were storing a database and analytics software that connects voters to all of their purchasing information, identification numbers, interests, location, etc and then links that using computer algorithms based in mathematical probability connects that data to your race, age, political affiliation, and family. The company that did this for the DNC is called Catalist. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s more. The software then incorporates the data from its algorithm back into the database and then analyzes the voting registry for people that it can&#39;t connect on any level to a digital footprint. These they call deadwood accounts, and in all but a few cases, they are individuals who have passed away but for some reason were never removed from the registry. The deadwood entries nationally accounted for roughly 7 million registered voters, meaning the Democratic party had access to technology that would enable them to identify every person on the registry who was not in any way connected with a potential voter; and using this list of names along with early-voting mail-in ballots guaranteed that they could easily give the Clinton campaign a 7 million vote swing of fake voters. </p>

<p>Until the Clintons and the DNC leadership are executed for their crimes, democracy is dead.</p>

<p>Clinton lost the rust belt for multiple reasons. She sent people like Ted Danson to campaign for her instead of going there herself. She was also viewed as a corporate sell out which hit a nerve with older blue collar workers (which pretty much IS the rust belt). She relied on the &quot;it&#39;s her turn&quot; slogan which turned off male voters who normally would have voted for a Democrat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you admit that both parties do this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Shit happens... The whole state isn&#39;t Democrat obviously. I&#39;d say it would be more worrying if there weren&#39;t Republican hold out districts.</p>

<p>Any candidate that has supporters with this much fervor shouldn&#39;t be ignored.. That&#39;s what happened this last election. The DNC didn&#39;t think Clinton was going to lose so they didn&#39;t take him seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you trying to say that when Snowden dropped and the American people discovered their privacy was being unconstitutionally violated, and all the talking heads came out to say things like: </p>

<p>&quot;you can&#39;t have 100% security and 100% privacy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we need to track everyone and everything so we can protect you from cyberattacks!&quot;</p>

<p>Are you trying to tell us that not only was the privacy and freedom of the American people taken away (to protect them, they said), it was taken away for NO GOOD REASON WHATSOEVER because those who took it away without consulting or even informing the American people FAILED MISERABLY and allowed a country with a population less than half its size with a GDP per capita less than one sixth what America boasts, to totally rig the American election <em>through the internet</em> from a country on the other side of the planet, against the will of the American people who apparently can&#39;t be trusted to make up their own minds about anything?</p>

<p>Is that what you&#39;re trying to say?  </p>

<p>That now the American people have neither privacy NOR security?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beauty of living in Dumbfuckistan is that you get to see shit like this Russia hacked the elections narrative.  What&#39;s the point of it all, to get Trump out office? And then what? You&#39;d get President Pence.  Nowhere in current line of succession is Clinton.  Face it, there is more chance of a President Rick fucking Perry (14th in line) than that half-dead sociopath diaper queen being installed.  There would not be a new election.</p>

<p>The only candidate where we have clear evidence of collusion and rigging the electoral process is Clinton.  Evidence courtesy of those damned Russians hackers and their DNC email leaks. lol</p>

<p>No, not really. The point is to look at information available and try to figure out what&#39;s actually going on. Consider possibilities. Don&#39;t let politics block your vision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would still need to be registered voters.... how many people who consistantly don&#39;t vote would bother to uphold their voter registration? How would they be able to guess which non-voters registered to vote and wouldn&#39;t show. Why aren&#39;t we seeing lots of people being jailed for casting double ballots? This is a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voter registration is different for each state. Procedures for maintaining registration vary by state. </p>

<p>In order for them to be able to pull a stunt like checking registration against actual votes the voting officials in each district would need to be russian agents.... I just can&#39;t roll with that idea. </p>

<p>North Dakota has no registration so would be the easiest to manipulate without a trace and I would bet that undocumented citizens would easily outweigh any sleeper agents in a state that doesn&#39;t require registration to vote. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t we just ease off the Russian involvement thing since we&#39;re already pretty much in a proxy war with them on Isreals behalf?</p>

<p>Personally I think republicans are better at securing their voter areas, California even has a republican senator or house guy. Just pointing out that the data exists to precision target specific areas. Whether through propaganda or conspiracies like this to get just enough votes to secure the state. </p>

<p>All you have to do is target the rust belt and a few others. </p>

<p>I see people on the internet calling Trump a God Emperor and making pictures with him riding a horse deus vult style. Doesn&#39;t mean a thing really. </p>

<p>But about the Rust Belt... Trump lied to them and said he&#39;d bring back jobs. He said he&#39;d bring back factory jobs... which if they ever do, the corps are just going to build a giant 3-D printer and a conveyor belt with minimal human jobs. One thing Clinton didn&#39;t do was lie to them about it and had to say we&#39;ll figure something out.</p>

<p>Either way, it lost her the election. She needed Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>
