    <div class="md"><p>Yes <em>and</em> no, depending on your definition. It effectively acts as a stimulation, but it&#39;s probably not like we&#39;re Sims on a computer to Gods or even future humans. Even if it was then what would that matter? It&#39;s a stimulation of what? The universe? Well that&#39;s just a set of all sets containing itself. It&#39;s an infinite loop. What happens here <em>is</em> what happens outside the simulation as it&#39;s a stimulation of itself.<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s definitely infinite more layers to &quot;reality&quot; than we perceive from this 3d representation of universe that exists through time. The universe is <em>everything</em> - and that means everything beyond our understanding of this 3d universe, and beyond time. All things exist at once in &quot;the universe&quot;. Consciousness - which is at least 5d - has just taken root temporarily in these 4d shapes we call &quot;living creatures&quot; (as is the nature of consciousness to do so) and through a brain, which acts as a quantum supercomputer. The brain exists to translate what limited perspective of the universe it can to consciousness in what ways it&#39;s equipped to do so. Ego is the sense of self created by the accumulation of experiences and circumstances that the brain has taken in, whereas &quot;self&quot; is actually much more than that. It&#39;s everything. It&#39;s the universe. But from this perspective it just appears that it ends after these bodies expire. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t wrong at all, bro (or sis?). I go about spreading as much love and light as I can on a daily basis. I&#39;m just going to have a tough time letting the resentment I feel towards these kinds of people go when the time comes. If they&#39;d listen to even 25% of what we try to expose, then maybe what&#39;s coming could have been averted. </p>

<p>Decades of being fucked with and having your intelligence ridiculed by the very folks you&#39;re trying to help wake up has just worn thin, I guess. :-/</p>

<p>I envy that you&#39;ve come to a point of strength and shedding the ego that you will offer a helping hand with no hesitation. That is fucking awesome and good on you for it. Hopefully I can attain that same level of peace within myself before the time comes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey bud I completely understand, and it&#39;s not so much that I&#39;m egoless or full of peace, I just know that if I were to emulate those I look up to who are wiser than me, that they respect me the same and understand me where I am, forgive me for my delusions and calmly set an example how to be a better person. For me this has helped me open up to new ideas that I had previously closed myself off to because I was afraid, and how fear plays the biggest role in our own ability to accept new ideas. If we build our houses on an unstable foundation that means we have to knock everything down and start over which is not easy. </p>

<p>Damn. That really just hit a chord and gave me some perspective. </p>

<p>When you find out the truth your going to think, &quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda like that, but it&#39;s not. And the conspiracies are kinda right, and their not.&quot;</p>

<p>And then you will try to explain it and it won&#39;t work. There&#39;s too much deviation, perception and interpretation. So the best you can do is speak in narratives, metaphor and allegory. Then the very act of speaking that way changes the perception itself. And you begin to question how many others were doing that while you questioned their  aversion to <em>truth</em>.</p>

<p>It seems by reasonable deduction there is a reason Spiritual leaders speak strictly in metaphor and allegory. It&#39;s symbolic. It cannot be contested, manipulated or distorted the same way. It can, and it appears to be, but when you <em>get</em> the underlying meaning it really isn&#39;t. And once again we are back to perception. Perception is reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You disregarded my point entirely: that person experiencing an alternative reality cannot apply a mathematical or logic framework to their observation, therefore it is not objective. Also, calling math language is reductionist in the extreme. Math is the language of logic, but logic is universal and non-arbitrary by nature. Math does not communicate in the same way as spoken or written language, we&#39;ve attached arbitrary symbols to it, but those symbols are not math, they are just avatar of the underlying logic.</p>

<p>If that person experiencing the alternate reality also has a logical and mathematical framework to their reality and it produces results for them, i.e. they can apply their reality to situations and achieve the desired result, then by all means let them continue. A man who believe he can fly and has worked out how hard he has to flap his wings using his own brand of physics will still jump off the cliff and die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s agree on a few points here:</p>

<p>Objective Truth - Has been observed by the individual</p>

<p>Subjective Truth - Believed by the individual</p>

<p>These are the oldest philosophical descriptions and understandings of objectivity vs. subjectivity. One is belief the other is knowledge. To know something is to observe it. You can read in a textbook that the boiling point of water is 50c but until testing it and observing it you do not <em>know.</em></p>

<p>Know apply this underlying logic to things you are trying to describe as objective reality. Society by default operates almost entirely on subjectivity. Worse is the promotion of it. It is up to the individual to create and strive to objectivity which brings them closer to union with the universe. There will be at any point some subjectivity if they have any <em>beliefs</em> whatsoever. </p>

<p>If you read textbooks from the 1800s you will notice science involved all experimental procedures. Theory was very limited. That&#39;s because the world was incredibly more objective and the objective experience was promoted in Natural Philosophy (Natural Science). This fell off during the creation of &quot;Life Sciences&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is that your <em>objective</em> opinion? You have demonstrated here you have a subjective opinion of reality and those within it. If a person goes to school to study &quot;Post Modernism&quot; they are a person that studied post modernism. The only true &quot;Post Modernist&quot; was the person who invented it and lived it for themselves. The rest is Identity Politics and subjective labelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I have very few beliefs, and I acknowledge that beliefs are not objective reality and treat them as such, in that they are easily subject to change with the presentation of new evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that your objective opinion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you even trying to say here? By definition if you believe the tenets of an ideology you follow that ideology, its not even a semantic argument, its just a &#39;by definition&#39; argument. One of the central tenets of postmodernist philosophy is that there is no no objective reality and even if there is, we cannot know it, and that all knowledge is relative to the observer therefore any one person&#39;s truth is just as true as any other person&#39;s. it is also a philosophy that is self-fulfilling in that if you buy into it, any evidence to the contrary can be disregarded as simply an artifact of different perceptions.</p>

<p>Its a fools philosophy; a manifestation of the decline of civilization, and a rejection and flippant disregardal of the cumulative advancements we have made as a species.</p>

<p>You believe this because you are not a scientist. Advancements in the &#39;natural sciences&#39; have been exponential in the past 50 years. Our understanding of things like plate tectonics, geochemical processes, and geophysics are all at the peak of both rigorousness and knowledge, mostly due to the incorporation of the math and logic aspects of reality. Life Sciences are mostly guesses aided by statistics and guided by theory. Again, though, if you believe in some home remedy for a ruptured appendix, no matter how rigorous your belief structure surrounding your homeopathic method is, you will still die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To know anything you have to accept that we are not living in a simulation and that your brain and senses are capable of logic and observation, and that those logical conclusions and observations can be verified through results. You also have to believe in universal physical laws: I believe that an experiment conducted in the exact same way will yield the exact same results. The evidence of this can be observed and is mathematical and logical, and the results of this are too numerous to even begin to list. </p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to make a epistemological argument but you&#39;ve already concluded things about the very nature of the acquisition of that knowledge. I know the floor in my office will hold my weight &quot;But you can&#39;t know that! Maybe you will fall through the floor, maybe from somebody else perspective you ARE falling through the floor!&quot; irrelevant if you accept that the results you perceive are true for you personally. I did not just fall through the floor and die, therefore I accept a whole host of other truths. Again, if you believe in a different reality you can quantify and observe and produce results from it, then everyone else is wrong. Reality is a truth, and truth is not relative. Our interpretation of it may be flawed, but flawed interpretations cannot be fully quantified by logic and math, and yield incomplete or undesirable results.</p>

<p>You complain that <em>Post Modernists</em> live in some subjective falsehood yet the logic used to define your world is strikingly similar.

That we will sow the seeds of goodness or improvement by the empirical causative effect of our deeds.</p>

<p>Post Modernism (notice I don&#39;t use -ists) suggests that there is no objective reality because each person lives in a subjective sphere. That&#39;s only true if only one of us exists in the world. A million subjective experiences with actions creates an objective result.</p>

<p>The foundation of science is logic. At the top of the stack we have things like psychology, down through biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics, then finally math and at the foundation of math, logic. Philosophy likes to pretend its outside of that hierarchy but its mostly just not useful enough for other disciplines to consider. Its the mental masturbation of academia.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of this is speculative nonsense. You made the claim that observing is knowing, and that perception is reality. THOSE are postmodernist beliefs and demonstratively false. You can&#39;t make me kowtow by throwing overly wordy nonsense at me, and you can&#39;t mask your underlying philosophy. Your philosophy of relative truth is exactly what those in power need you to believe. If any reality is as good as any other, and no truth can be known because none exists, whatever &#39;truth&#39; you decide upon is just fine!

    <div class="md"><p>My point is there is no inherent logical system in math which forces it to describe reality properly. Our wires may be crossed here as the past comments were perceived incorrectly. </p>

<p>The logical framework in math are applied constructs.  And math is a language. Like vocabulary. (Which has grammar as an applied logical construct.)</p>

<p>Philosophical truths, like <em>we can only</em> <strong>know</strong> <em>what we</em> <strong>observe</strong> is a logical framework in our <strong>underlying reality</strong>. An inherent logical system that exists within our reality. A fundamental truth. Similar to internalizing causality (which is probably done subconsciously at a young age.) </p>

<p>Any deviation from these <em>truths</em> are subjective. Truths can be internalized. That&#39;s the objective reality. Math is used like language as descriptive means for describing or modelling our environment but at no time is it able to actually interpret it nor does it have any <em>truths</em> within. Only the human can perceive the environment and only the environment has objective truths. Math cannot be used to observe the environment only conceptualize it or help interpret the perception of it.</p>

<p>This is the basis of science. The scientific method. Philosophy. It originated as means to describe the underlying nature of reality [it represents the actual act of human understanding or receiving information]. The further you deviate from these truths the easier it is for any modelling system (math/language) to become flawed and broken or simply present a false picture of reality. </p>

<p>You can we have logical systems for language and math but they themselves have no inherent logic. </p>

<p>Philosophy is the human act of understanding the environment. Science is the questioning of that environment. Math and language are abstract communication devices allowing us to do this. They contain no special abilities as the human mind must first visualize the rules or logical systems applied. Math has one weakness (also strength in some aspect) that you can model something a dozen different ways and none are perfectly accurate representations. The only perfect representation is something that is internalized as a truth, but cannot be without observation. In other words, math is great and all but the moment you say something <em>is</em> because of math - it&#39;s wrong. There should be a disclaimer for every mathematical model saying &quot;this is the best we can express it. This does not necessarily represent reality.&quot; Which is admitted by intellectually honest people. However there is a terrible trend and distortion today where someone says, <em>&quot;(x) *is</em> because math.&quot;* In reality, *&quot;(x) is because (x) is, here&#39;s how we can model it with math.&quot;</p>

<p>Note that most everything we use today in <em>modern</em> times was invented between 1600-1800. Industrial processes go back even further 00s to 000s - like <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2013/acs-presspac-july-24-2013/ancient-technology-for-metal-coatings-2000-years-ago-cant-be-mat.html">metal plating</a></p>

<p>Our entire electrical grid and most everything we use today was invented over a span of a couple hundred years. Besides computing and a mild boom around the 1950s nothing new has come only <em>improvements</em> on old technology much of which was already hypothesized or visualized long before the &quot;modern&quot; era. There is a reason why engineers / inventors invent things and why mathematicians model them or try to <em>explain</em> with theoretical concepts years after the fact. At the root of the human experience is visualization and your visualization ability is directly correlated to what <em>truths</em> you internalize. Internalizing falsehoods skews your ability to perceive or rationalize your environment objectively.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand what math is, or even what a number is. Math is not anything like vocabulary. Math would be like if you stripped language of all vocabulary you communicated in only concepts. Math is a language of ideas with no of the associated interpretation and ambiguity that bogs down verbal communication. </p>

<p>HAHAHAHA</p>

<p>After a statement like that I don&#39;t think I can continue this discussion. Thats some pure phase scientific ignorance. We didn&#39;t even have a half way passable model of an atom until 1913. Modern chemistry is almost an entirely 20th century invention. All of mass spectrometry and nuclear chemistry is a modern phenomenon. </p>

<p>Because a model of an unprovable hypothesis is how the electrical grid works, how cars work, transportation, communications, etc. Wait. Never mind its actually irrelevant. Not even scientific. An unprovable hypothesis (cannot be observed) is not scientific.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plato has Socrates describe a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners&#39; reality. Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners. The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison; for they know no better life. The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day, and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was. They discovered the sun, which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man cannot see behind. Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave, the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the senses. Even if these interpretations (or, in Kantian terminology, intuitions) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality, we cannot somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition - we cannot free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains. If, however, we were to miraculously escape our bondage, we would find a world that we could not understand - the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it. In other words, we would encounter another &quot;realm&quot;, a place incomprehensible because, theoretically, it is the source of a higher reality than the one we have always known; it is the realm of pure Form, pure fact.</p>

<p>Ok, thats observably false. Watch a balloon take off and stand directly under it. It does not move towards the horizon. Thats a blatant lie. Next.</p>

<p>And again, thats not a valid explanation because we live in 3 dimensions. Things moving upward do not converge with the horizon. Things moving further away diminish in size relative to our field of view, why doesn&#39;t the sun get smaller as it move further away?</p>

<p>If anything the fact that a balloon can remain in the same location while the earth is spinning at a thousand miles per hour should tell you it&#39;s not spinning. If you threw something straight up it would land in a different location if the earth was spinning , at all.</p>

<p>That question a globe tard couldn&#39;t answer. A lot of your questions are formed because your spherical model makes no sense. If the earth was spinning then why doesn&#39;t the sun get smaller as it moves far away? </p>

<p>Anyway the answer has to do with how many areas of the atmosphere there are between the sun&#39;s location, and yours, on a Flat plane. Sometimes you see different magnifications, or diminished light because the weather.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because the balloon has the same velocity as the earth from which is rises, as does the atmosphere. A force would have to act on the balloon to give it velocity in another direction. That phenomenon is called conservation of momentum. Velocity relative to a fixed point of observation. If i am driving at 60mph and somebody throws a baseball right next to me at 60mph, it appears stationary. </p>

<p>You made the claim that objects &#39;converge&#39; with the horizon as they move further away. This is not true for objects moving away from you in any</p>

<p>If the earth was spinning then why doesn&#39;t the sun get smaller as it moves far away?</p>

<p>It does, but only very slightly because the sun is massive and very far away. Its about relative changes in size. So answer my question: if the phenomenon of convergence is what causes the sun to be visible on the horizon and at the azimuth from 2 places on a flat plane, why does the sun not appear noticeably smaller when it sets? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Different magnifications? Then why don&#39;t distant mountains also appear uniform size as you move away from them? By your own admission the sun should converge to a single point as it moves away from you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are creating a perception influenced by your beliefs. And that is what you call your reality. Every time you post.</p>

<p>You just even admitted the earth is stationary relative to yourself. Yet you don&#39;t sense &#39;terminal velocity&#39; because of it?? Why is it I can feel a car turn a corner at a relatively constant speed? You always sense centripetal force, yet somehow when you are in a constant centripetal force like a spinning earth that sense goes away. Actually we should either all be flung off the earth if we are spinning at a terminal velocity. Or if gravity did exist we would all be stuck to the earth and wouldn&#39;t be able to jump. It totally makes no sense.</p>

<p>See, I have heard all this before that we are all stuck in place relative to our location on the earth and within its magical gravitational lockdown and on and on. But it makes no fucking sense when those same principles found in nature don&#39;t apply to the earth itself.</p>

<p>Like if you spin a ball and pour water on it the water flings everywhere. Just like we should be doing, along with the ocean. Life on earth would not exist if the same physics found in nature applied to the ball earth model.</p>

<p>Even the senses , our best avenue for perception, even they can be influenced by false beliefs. I can show you a ball spinning with water being flung off of it, for you to perceive. But since you have been indoctrinated that the earth is a ball, and shown pics of the oceans magically curving around it, You Will Defy Your Own Sense Data in favor of the belief. That is how Believing is Seeing.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s simple, you see what you are told to see. You have no direct knowledge of what shape the earth is. You have belief. I have more facts that say it&#39;s flat rather than a sphere. I have belief because I also don&#39;t have direct experience of its overall picture. Though my beliefs are more in line with what can be Sensed. Not theoretically conjectured into existence with mathematics.</p>

<p>And further, once gravity is exposed as the sham it is, much of the language supporting incorrect assumptions like it will also be discarded. Because it will become &#39;postmodernist philosophy&#39; even math. Unless you want to go down with that whole ship I&#39;d learn to trust your common senses. They will give you an accurate assessment of reality, more than theory can.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&#39;terminal velocity&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I said absolute velocity. The two are completely different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it I can feel a car turn a corner at a relatively constant speed? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because turning a corner creates acceleration, and we can sense force. Velocity is both a magnitude and a direction. Acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity -&gt; if you have mass and you turn it, force is used. We can sense force.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You always sense centripetal force, yet somehow when you are in a constant centripetal force like a spinning earth that sense goes away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you have interia so at any given point one component of the force on your body is centripetal force. The net force is downward due to gravity being stronger than the centripedal force. Remember the formula for centripetal acceleration is v<sup>2/R,</sup> and that R is huge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually we should either all be flung off the earth if we are spinning at a terminal velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without gravity, yes. We&#39;re also not spinning at terminal velocity. terminal velocity refers to the velocity at which an object falls in a fluid when the gravitational force and the drag force are in equilibrium and the net force on the body is 0.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or if gravity did exist we would all be stuck to the earth and wouldn&#39;t be able to jump. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you can apply a net force in the opposite direction of gravity and create motion. Have you ever taken a physics class?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like if you spin a ball and pour water on it the water flings everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because the water has a high relative velocity compared to the ball. There is also a fluid shear interaction between the ball, air,  and the water. The appropriate analogy is to place a ball in a vacuum and spin it to a constant speed. React the surface the ball to create water. That water has always been traveling the same velocity as the ball, so it would require an outside force to remove the water. Not only that, the centripetal acceleration of the water on a much smaller radius (remember a centripetal = V<sup>2/r)</sup> may actually be greater than gravity. So your analogy is fundamentally flawed. The centripetal acceleration of the earth is 0.03 m/s2. So less than 1% of the force of gravity. If the earth were say 1000x&#39;s smaller and turning at the same speed at its outer edge, we would be flung off like a water droplet on a rapidly spinning ball.</p>

<p>Think of it like this: lets say you put a magnet on a big steel ball. The magnetic force here is going to simulate gravity: a constant force between the ball and the magnet You start spinning the ball very slowly at first. No movement! thats because the centripedal force is less than the magnetic force. Now you increase the speed until---pop! the magnet slips off. So now we know that there is a speed at which the magnet will slip off, and a sleep at which it wont. So we know that we can quantify that speed! But what we also find is that the radius of the ball matters. We develop an equation describing this, and lo and behold that equation works for other balls and magnets too! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can show you a ball spinning with water being flung off of it, for you to perceive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logic and math cut through the haze of observation and perception. You see only water being flung off a ball and immediately decide that that must mean water would be thrown off the earth. I see a force balance between centripetal force, surface tension, fluid shear, and drag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right off the bat you say,&#39; you can sense force&#39; and I&#39;m thinking Yea that&#39;s it. The only force I sense is myself in relationship to my environment. Not just some imaginary force of gravity pulling myself to the earth. But the force that interconnects my sense of being to every single thing in my reality. That is a real force. Like love is, or color is even a force.</p>

<p>The physics of consciousness is a little different than the physics of science class. It relates more to the invention of ideas to apply an explanation to what is being perceived. It&#39;s a mix of the inner senses and outer senses. The only math is figuring out in which time some guy said some thing that everyone for some reason believed. And they begin as theory.</p>

<p>Ball Earth is actually a Theory. A flat level surface is a sense perception. Maybe it&#39;s both. A hemispherical  dome over a Flat circular plane. That model has both flat and ball, the two perceptions in play are most likely in combination in actuality.</p>

<p>OK, heres where we can agree on something... maybe. Science is not meant to describe a supernatural phenomenon. If something is not made of matter or energy, it falls outside of science. Trying to describe flat earth theory while simultaneously denying the existence of gravity and talking about &#39;the force&#39; AND trying to use scientific examples makes absolutely no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes total sense because it&#39;s all interconnected. Love is connected to consciousness which is connected to creation which is connected to our area of consciousness and our physics of perception. In a less dense area of consciousness like the Astral Plane, the physics of perception are different and connected in an abstract way that would be hard to interpret in waking areas.  So mad to trying to explain a dream when you wake up. The return to density makes astral perceptions flee, in a sense, because the physics are configured in way not bound by our belief systems. You can fly or jump a mile, in a dream.</p>

<p>Now what this is , is a matter of the density of consciousness. And what this force of gravity is, is DENSITY. Density is a common sense perception. If something is heavier than the air it will fall to ground or to its buoyancy and reach an equilibrium with its plane of density.</p>

<p>That is a fundamental perception that dissolves a round spinning earth. A flat earth model is ruled by density and pressure. Pressurized air between the flat plane of earth, and the firmament that separates this dimension from the astral plane. Separated by layers of density.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve explained this so many times to flat earthers I am just sick of it. Density is not a force. Density is a property of matter. Density cannot cause anything to move. Differences in density cannot cause anything to move. You can&#39;t confuse or distract me with empty words. I am also not going to dismiss you as nuts because I know thats not true, you are simply fooled. I know I may not change your mind, but to others reading this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats not a plausible explanation. Density is not a force, its a measure of mass per unit volume. For an object to move, a force has to act on it. If there were no gravity and you placed a rock in water, it would not move as there is no force acting on it. The force that causes an object to sink is gravity. First lets talk about how fluids behave. As you get deeper in water, pressure increases as more and more water is on top of you pushing down. So lets say you are scubadiving and you are sitting right at 5ft depth. At your feet, the water pressure is higher than at your head. To calculate the force, you would multiply the surface area by the pressure. On the lower half of your body, you are being pushed on harder than the upper half, so the net force is actually UPWARD, that is why you feel lighter when you&#39;re in water than when you&#39;re on land: The density gradient in water is higher because its a more dense fluid. The reason you sink is that you are being pulled down towards earth harder than you are being pushed upward by pressure differences. So lets say that it is pressure differences holding us down (even though we know that the pressure gradient is actually pushing us up), in that case, more dense objects should fall faster than less dense objects. But we can demonstrate that thats not true: drop a block of lead and a block of wood: they fall at the same rate, meaning density does not effect the rate of descent. Additionally, if density gradients were causing us to &#39;sink&#39; to the earth, if you were to pull a vacuum in a glass container and put an object in it, that object would not sink as there is no density gradient to sink in. Or you could make the argument that it should sink FASTER, because you can&#39;t pull a true vacuum, so it would actually just be less dense air. Neither are the case: it falls at the same speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tl;dr The buoyant force pushes AGAINST gravity, which is why things become lighter in water. This is directly related to the density of an object: more dense objects sink faster because the buoyant force is less because they are displacing a small amount of water, but their mass is large so gravity pulls on them strongly. If density were a factor, a lead ball would fall slower than a tennis ball. This does not happen: negating drag, all objects fall at the same speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say density was a force. You don&#39;t seem to understand I&#39;m not a typical flat earther. I incorporate the conscious mind of the individual into a different model more in line with sense perception. </p>

<p>I already explained the more abstract principles of interconnectedness of consciousness and how those are more accurate as forces. Love and color and vibration, those are examples of force. Density is what it is regardless that you believe it&#39;s a Force. Gravity is belief. Knowing something is heavier than air and drop to ground is perception. Perception is reality.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s interesting. I have all day. So what, are you sick of trying to prove something to me? Like I&#39;m dumb or something and you just desperately need to convince all the flat earth tards they are wrong?  What&#39;s the point? Trying expanding on what you know. Gravity is not an absolute. None of your beliefs are. They are passing ideas in an endless sea of confusion. When it&#39;s simple. Perception is reality. And at the core of perception are beliefs. Some of them are wrong. Nonetheless they are still influencing. And what you are attempting to do while trying to prove us all wrong is just tightening your hold on them. The true individual freedom you seek is by letting them go. Watching them fly. Sensing their importance diminish.</p>

<p>You will get bored and see what I mean. You will eventually see that one piece of NASA fakery that might make you stop, and go Wtf, and begin questioning the whole damn thing. So I&#39;m just another version of you doing that and blazing a path for you to follow one day.</p>

<p>I would like for you to try and prove this all wrong. Continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By believing that perception is reality, you assert that any reality is just as good as any other, and any perception is just as good as any other. Absolute relativism. If that is the case, there is no reason to seek truth because there is no truth, only perception. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re dumb, but I do think you&#39;re pseudointellectual. Its not possible to prove somebody wrong who won&#39;t accept basic scientific truths, because proving anything to anybody requires that you work in at least the most basic framework. The fact is you might be mentally ill or schizophrenic, I have no idea, so why bother even engaging? Because I know I am right, and I can prove it through logic and rigorous empiricism, and I think truth is worth seeking, and anybody who genuinely wants to see truth should be shown it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, it&#39;s not quite absolute relativism when you know one of the core belief systems of perception is judgement itself. </p>

<p>You can stand by your scientific principles as truths but that is a reflection of your own absolute relativism. Perception is reality. Gravity is a belief and an absolute relativism for you. You fall into a trap thinking it&#39;s that way for all.</p>

<p>Truths again are these forces of consciousness. Tone, love, vibration. Those are truths. Reality is a truth, but your perception of it is a belief system. The scientific truth model is somewhat of a dead end and doesn&#39;t even factor consciousness into the equation. It&#39;s funny but if you think I&#39;m being a pseudo intellectual because I factor in the consciousness of man into the perception of reality you must not have a consciousness. I meet this with pseudoscience a lot, they don&#39;t understand their own perception and their own consciousness but they try to tell you in absolute terms how the world functions and how others should be perceiving the world they do because of all these scientific Theories they think are Truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the earth was both flat AND round. The same way that light is both a particle and a wave.

<p>Another theory could be the holographic universe. If it is a hologram, it is surely to be flat on the surface just like a photo on the wall until you move/walk past it (movement) which gives it a perceived depth.

<p>It&#39;s painfully obvious that people believe what they want to regardless of science or fact.  While anecdotal, I&#39;ve had discussions with many people who, when confronted with something that would cause cognitive dissonance, will call something &quot;fake news&quot; (or some other intellectually dishonest tactic) in an attempt to hand-wave anything that conflicts with their world view.  There are shit loads of them in this subreddit and it&#39;s the main reason that discourse in this subreddit is in such a laughable state.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>...I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;d ask that, to be honest.  Our species is all about holding irrational beliefs in the face of contrary and provable information.  I&#39;ve had discussions with several &quot;Flat-Earthers&quot; in person (anecdotal, however, it&#39;s an attitude/thought process that you see daily with many different subjects) and it&#39;s no different than people who deny several other scientifically accepted subjects.  It&#39;s a complete unwillingness to accept anything that goes against their world-view and a belief that their opinions matter as much as someone with vastly superior knowledge of a subject.  Critical thinking and intellectually honest discussions are the exception instead of the norm.</p>

<p>I must concede that there very well may be some people pushing absurd theories to make us look foolish, however, I&#39;ve seen the point that you&#39;re making used as a way to save face and deflect criticism.  It&#39;s almost as if people are allergic to introspection.  Pizzagate, in my opinion, was a great example of this.  Absurd claims made by regulars (Clinton contracting Kuru via cannibalizing murdered children is one of many examples) when even a cursory google search (of the duration of the prion disease) would show that this was... entirely without merit.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but I think it&#39;s likely that people just want to believe in something regardless of facts.  I also think that, as I said before, your point is all too frequently used to deflect criticism of very real beliefs held by people (that very likely isn&#39;t your intention, but I&#39;ve seen it used nonetheless).  Let&#39;s say that there are, in fact, a handful of prominent people pushing &quot;Flat-Earth&quot; as a way make conspiracy theorists look foolish;  they wouldn&#39;t be effective without the willingness of many conspiracy theorists to believe the idiocy.</p>

<p>I apologize for this rambling and probably incoherent post, but I&#39;m not a fan of people deflecting valid criticism with &quot;it&#39;s a psy-op!&quot; instead of taking a cue for some much needed introspection.  I&#39;ve seen many of your other posts (I didn&#39;t dig through your post history, just recognized the name) and they&#39;re great, but that one line of argument triggers me.  You could very well be right, but that along with many other methods of deflection are something I&#39;m seeing far too often.  Sorry again and have an awesome 4th!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about a &#39;separate groups&#39; thing for a long time and while the problems are glaring, the conspiracy community would <em>greatly</em> benefit from some active categorization. </p>

<p>I&#39;m imagining three levels of conspiracy. The lowest being confirmed conspiracies, generally of a historic nature, or perhaps something with a really obvious smoking gun of evidence. Things like MKUltra, Project Paperclip, the fact that the US fucking attacked itself in order to justify the use of &#39;boots on the ground&#39; in Vietnam, things that we know for sure happened, but at the time were conspiratorial in nature. Conspiracy 101, if you will. </p>

<p>A second level should be for theories with tons of circumstantial evidence, but no smoking gun. Stuff that&#39;s still under investigation, the complex stuff that the majority of experts don&#39;t even have a solid answer on. This would eventually serve as the real nitty-gritty good bits of conspiracy, imagine if this bit is the 9/11s, the Seth Richs, the Pizzagates. As well as the more complex and even more unprovable stuff like gnosticism or radically different worldviews. </p>

<p>Then we&#39;d get to the deep end. The outer layer. Your uncles conspiracy corner. The kinds of conspiracies that have next to no evidence to support them, or face massive evidence that appears to prove it false. Looking at you, Flat Earth. And I make fun but really it would be nice to have a place to look at the crazier theories and understand that they&#39;ve been categorized appropriately. I mean, I&#39;m a pretty crazy dude, I&#39;m not willing to throw out flat earth theory entirely, I&#39;m just not ready. I&#39;m like 95% sure we&#39;re on a ball though. But that last bit is nagging! So it would be nice to have a place to legitimately consider the crazier theories, for crazy people like me. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;d quickly find a pattern emerge, and within probably a year we&#39;d be able to distill out any psyop rather quickly with such a system. But of course the flaws are too obvious and too great. How does such a disorganized community come together to agree on something like that? So implementation is a nightmare but even if we assume people could get their shit together... The people we really need to worry about, the people spinning narratives and running psyops for better control over the zeitgeist - these people would take any system we devise for ourselves and hijack it. Anything we create as a tool for ourselves to use can be taken by them to manipulate us. They would probably thank us for it. </p>

<p>I guess the main conclusion I&#39;m coming to is that conspiracy ought to be a self driven path towards better understanding. Any group can easily be coopted by our enemies. How? they sacrifice one of their own to us, allowing their lamb to give us just a tiny little bit more evidence, something small but credibility ensuring and then BAM as soon as their guys&#39; in it&#39;s game over. </p>

Right now, I feel like most people would say that Saturn was far out in terms of travel because they <strong>know</strong> it&#39;s not possible to get there. I could be wrong but let&#39;s assume I&#39;m not. What if all of sudden the whole world knew we weren&#39;t alone in the universe and that alien life definitely existed and it existed on Saturn. That it was now possible to travel there even. Do you think people would still consider that far out in terms of distance? Or do you think that they would consider it a long ride but no longer think it&#39;s &#39;far out&#39; because it is within their understanding and capability to get there? My thought is that access to information is what determines whether or not something is &#39;far out&#39; or not. It also works with stupidity. Ever said something you cringe over later? Because it&#39;s so far away from what you&#39;d say now, knowing more?   </p>

<p>Some information junkies have to find and vet the information themselves. Others don&#39;t mind it being handed down and will believe it regardless of what it says. I like to think true conspiracy theorists are the former. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I&#39;ve been kicking around all day. My take is that a conspiracy theorist is someone who thinks people are more devious than they appear in public and that there are a lot more cover-ups than they can see. They want the unadulterated truth. Then there are those who believe interdimensional spiders once roamed the Earth, and/or the Earth is hollow and that&#39;s where we live, and that the global cabal gives a shit about Satan and Jesus. These are the &quot;too open-minded.&quot; </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s another group: the users. This group consists of anyone who uses a distrust of authority and the official history to garner credibility within a group, and then they start inserting politically useful &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; which act in the service of some political agenda--usually tons of money. </p>

<p>The name pizzagate should be scrapped and attention turned to sexual exploitation of minors in general - very few people are actually stating that those two are running a ring out of a pizza joint, yet critics jump on that being the entire argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are plenty of theories here that do have evidence of sorts but if every theory had great evidence it wouldn&#39;t be theory it would be fact. we like to push the limits here sometimes taking fringe ideas and digging in to see if it is a theory that can hold water. Often times you see crazy theories that although they may not have great evidence to start with, there are not many who can provide solid proof to debunk the idea. question everything remain vigilant!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is when they can bury legitimate parlay with an army of robots posting whatever their limited AI brains can cook up.  They&#39;ve effectively silenced the internet, and now we are forced to share this information face to face.</p>

<p>Honestly, it really is a good thing.  The fact that they have had to resort to these transparent measures is going to wake even more people up.  The real question, and what I seriously doubt the most, is that anyone will do anything about all of this.  It&#39;s like the good people of the world have decided there are too many bad people and have given up on holding them accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of my Political Science class and how the professor would make jokes like these. On the exams (which he made way too easy), there would be questions and answers kind of like </p>

<p>&quot;Why did the French peasants start a revolution in 1789?&quot;</p>

<p>A) To overthrow the monarchy in France
B) Because the French peasants were bored
C) Because the Illuminati made them
D) The letter C is the 3rd letter in the alphabet and triangles have 3 sides. They are totally onto us.</p>

<p>One student in my Political Science class asked if it&#39;s okay to blame President Bush for 9/11. The professor quickly changed the subject, but I decided I would go back to that guys question and mentioned how the day before 9/11 the Pentagon lost it&#39;s money or how Building 7 rarely gets reported, and the Professor admitted that he wanted to change the subject. He then makes a joke saying that I must watch videos on Youtube about how &quot;The Jews did 9/11&quot; and compared me to a Flat Earther. The next day he shows us a video by <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fNS4lecOaAc">John Oliver where he mocks Alex Jones</a>. Out of every good conspiracy theorists the teacher himself could of tried to mock, he had to choose Alex Jones, the most easiest to mock, and he had to have John Oliver do it for him.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get offended, but I felt sorry for how he ran that class with his mainstream facts and how students will swallow any information they&#39;re fed as truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty, I feel like he knew that some conspiracy theories are actually true. what&#39;s more fucked up is that we rarely ever talked about Political Science and all he wanted was to be a &quot;cool teacher,&quot; that the class could like. About 20% of the class was about the Deceleration of Independence, 20% was about left wing and right wing, 20% had to do with other stuff that has nothing to do with politics at all (Mainstream Science, Football), and 40% was on Trump and how he&#39;s the most evil man alive.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Trump is a good guy, but he was so focused on him that he&#39;d waste our time to watch CNN/Politico to think that Trump is the only bad president we had so far. He didn&#39;t want to be a boring teacher that tells his students the truth, so he decided to be a fun one that would waste our time with bullshit that rarely has any political thinking, distorting the Truth, and keeping up with the opinions of the masses (or students in this case).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That shower thought is either so dumb that I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s supposedly brilliant or such blatant vote manipulation (or both.) The angry comments here make it worse though, I mean come on people it&#39;s reddit, what do you expect and no I don&#39;t mean all people here are sheep, I mean no one believes this crap and you shouldn&#39;t get so emotional over obvious propogonda. Do yourself a favour and delete social media or put up with the crap that comes with it. Just don&#39;t pretend everyone else (that aren&#39;t bots or shills) buys it cuz that&#39;s what they want, to manipulate your view of the crowd and create divide between conspiracy theorists and others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s harder to brainwash masses than it is to wake them up. Never lose hope in your fellow brothers and sisters, we gonna need all the help we can get for what they have planned. Just need to step it up a notch (or twenty) and get really creative: to surprise the enemy, surprise yourself. </p>

<p>Truth seeking is fucking awesome and everyone has always known it. I commend you guys for seeking the light so vehemently where there&#39;s so much darkness and making others aware of it so they can see too. </p>

<p>(It&#39;s gotten so bad I can&#39;t even be sure this sub&#39;s reaction is legit...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. The idea that Rich was the DNC leaker is the only reason there was a conspiracy theory to begin with.

    <div class="md"><p>I saw this and laughed. I can&#39;t believe that people are that intellectually dishonest. A few comments I&#39;ve seen implicitly and (explicitly) group any and all &#39;conspiracy&#39; theorists into the same basket. The implication being everyone who suspects a conspiracy in one area also somehow believes every other conspiracy theory. There&#39;s no way a serious person can accept that as sound reasoning.</p>

All those people could come here and see all of their stereotypes and comments verified for them. Take a look around, look at how deep this community is entrenched in its own echo chamber.

    <div class="md"><p>What I find especially embarrassing about this particular pysop is that it requires participants to agree on what to me, is a completely idiotic premise.</p>

<p>Person A. suggests something that might be difficult to believe (but person A. believes this might be true) and wishes to have a discussion because it is possible that the safety of the community or something similar is at risk.</p>

<p>Enter Person B.</p>

<p>Person B. hears this information, his first responses are?</p>

<ol>
<li>Become angry</li>
<li>Begin argument despite never being exposed to any information to understand person A. beyond information initially conveyed.</li>
</ol>

<p>And now, according to reddit the best way is</p>

<ol>
<li>Passive-aggressive ridicule.</li>
</ol>

<p>It takes some severe mental gymnastics to avoid every possibility of learning a non-authority-approved message like this. It&#39;s basically a 3 step redundancy on how to remain ignorant.</p>

<p>The fact that anyone could have such a low amount of objective awareness for their own processes or actions is why my mind is totally blown. It&#39;s very difficult for me to even be provoked into anger without asking myself &quot;whoa why are you angry&quot;, nevermind create my own fucking composite autism just to protect myself from  learning one thing in a conversation with another human being.</p>

<p>And then you have reddit, where you have a massive amount of people to contribute ideas and vote for ideas, and there is this clear consensus that ridicule stage 3 is the best way.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m going to assume that the vast majority of the data in this post was due to bots or sophisticated computer programs being run by an intelligence agency. If anyone would like to argue with my conclusion - don&#39;t bother - I&#39;m just going to mock the fuck out of it while I shield my conscious mind from activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To know anything you have to accept that we are not living in a simulation and that your brain and senses are capable of logic and observation, and that those logical conclusions and observations can be verified through results. You also have to believe in universal physical laws: I believe that an experiment conducted in the exact same way will yield the exact same results. The evidence of this can be observed and is mathematical and logical, and the results of this are too numerous to even begin to list. </p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to make a epistemological argument but you&#39;ve already concluded things about the very nature of the acquisition of that knowledge. I know the floor in my office will hold my weight &quot;But you can&#39;t know that! Maybe you will fall through the floor, maybe from somebody else perspective you ARE falling through the floor!&quot; irrelevant if you accept that the results you perceive are true for you personally. I did not just fall through the floor and die, therefore I accept a whole host of other truths. Again, if you believe in a different reality you can quantify and observe and produce results from it, then everyone else is wrong. Reality is a truth, and truth is not relative. Our interpretation of it may be flawed, but flawed interpretations cannot be fully quantified by logic and math, and yield incomplete or undesirable results.</p>

<p>Are you also saying Aristotle and Socrates were incorrect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing I am saying is postmodernist. If you think that, you don&#39;t understand what I am saying or you don&#39;t understand postmodernism.</p>

<p>The foundation of science is logic. At the top of the stack we have things like psychology, down through biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics, then finally math and at the foundation of math, logic. Philosophy likes to pretend its outside of that hierarchy but its mostly just not useful enough for other disciplines to consider. Its the mental masturbation of academia.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of this is speculative nonsense. You made the claim that observing is knowing, and that perception is reality. THOSE are postmodernist beliefs and demonstratively false. You can&#39;t make me kowtow by throwing overly wordy nonsense at me, and you can&#39;t mask your underlying philosophy. Your philosophy of relative truth is exactly what those in power need you to believe. If any reality is as good as any other, and no truth can be known because none exists, whatever &#39;truth&#39; you decide upon is just fine! Don&#39;t worry about it, no truth is any better than any other!</p>

<p>It&#39;s painfully obvious that people believe what they want to regardless of science or fact.  While anecdotal, I&#39;ve had discussions with many people who, when confronted with something that would cause cognitive dissonance, will call something &quot;fake news&quot; (or some other intellectually dishonest tactic) in an attempt to hand-wave anything that conflicts with their world view.  There are shit loads of them in this subreddit and it&#39;s the main reason that discourse in this subreddit is in such a laughable state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think all of those people organically believe in something that can be disproven with simple flight paths, or literally just looking at the stars from a few different parts of the world? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;d ask that, to be honest.  Our species is all about holding irrational beliefs in the face of contrary and provable information.  I&#39;ve had discussions with several &quot;Flat-Earthers&quot; in person (anecdotal, however, it&#39;s an attitude/thought process that you see daily with many different subjects) and it&#39;s no different than people who deny several other scientifically accepted subjects.  It&#39;s a complete unwillingness to accept anything that goes against their world-view and a belief that their opinions matter as much as someone with vastly superior knowledge of a subject.  Critical thinking and intellectually honest discussions are the exception instead of the norm.</p>

<p>I must concede that there very well may be some people pushing absurd theories to make us look foolish, however, I&#39;ve seen the point that you&#39;re making used as a way to save face and deflect criticism.  It&#39;s almost as if people are allergic to introspection.  Pizzagate, in my opinion, was a great example of this.  Absurd claims made by regulars (Clinton contracting Kuru via cannibalizing murdered children is one of many examples) when even a cursory google search (of the duration of the prion disease) would show that this was... entirely without merit.  </p>

<p>I personally think some percentage of them are paid to make conspiracy theorists look stupid.</p>

<p>Maybe, but I think it&#39;s likely that people just want to believe in something regardless of facts.  I also think that, as I said before, your point is all too frequently used to deflect criticism of very real beliefs held by people (that very likely isn&#39;t your intention, but I&#39;ve seen it used nonetheless).  Let&#39;s say that there are, in fact, a handful of prominent people pushing &quot;Flat-Earth&quot; as a way make conspiracy theorists look foolish;  they wouldn&#39;t be effective without the willingness of many conspiracy theorists to believe the idiocy.</p>

<p>I apologize for this rambling and probably incoherent post, but I&#39;m not a fan of people deflecting valid criticism with &quot;it&#39;s a psy-op!&quot; instead of taking a cue for some much needed introspection.  I&#39;ve seen many of your other posts (I didn&#39;t dig through your post history, just recognized the name) and they&#39;re great, but that one line of argument triggers me.  You could very well be right, but that along with many other methods of deflection are something I&#39;m seeing far too often.  Sorry again and have an awesome 4th!</p>
