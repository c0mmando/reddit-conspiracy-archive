<p><strong>&#39;Flat Out Corrupt&#39;: Protests as Trump Headlines Trump Fundraiser at Trump Hotel</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Trump monetizes his office constantly. But tonight&#39;s a new low: he&#39;s collecting cash from being president, from his hotel, and from his party.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Any opinions? &quot;they all do it&quot;? Can we agree that he was a bad bet to fix anything? that he is a snake, already beholden to bankers, oligarchs, and warmongers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe.</p>

<p>Just to clear the record, Obama didn&#39;t &quot;fire all the good generals&quot; nor did he even fire a majority or a lot.  McCrystal was fired for reasons he brought on himself, Flynn was fired for reasons I don&#39;t know details of -- I&#39;m fairly certain it isn&#39;t what Flynn claims, but who knows.  Other than these two which Generals were fired?</p>

<p>But, aside from that, their positions are filled.  There are a large number of Captains and Colonels eligble and waiting for a promotion.  I don&#39;t think &quot;integrity&quot; is the purview of &quot;previous people&quot; holding those positions.</p>

<p>In fact, DoD and Integrity when it comes to corruption is not really something I would be willing to bet on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really made it set in how strange it is to begin fundraising for re-election this early is that the FEC haven&#39;t even released guidelines for the 2020 campaigns yet. I did a little research and <a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/news/press-releases/fec-complaint-trump-filed-false-campaign-report-violation-election-law">found this filed complaint from almost two months ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>alleging Donald Trump’s campaign committee violated federal election law by illegally accepting campaign contributions after Election Day and falsely reporting those contributions for “debt retirement,” even though no debt existed. These false reports could have the effect of illegally increasing the amount Trump could accept from contributors for his 2020 reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Trump began to fundraise just days after his Nov. 8 victory. Federal law provides that a candidate may only raise funds after Election Day to retire outstanding debts from the election, or for a future election. But the Trump campaign ended the 2016 election with no outstanding net debt—therefore, all contributions made after Election Day should have either been refunded to contributors or designated for the 2020 primary election.  </p>

<p>Yet instead, Trump reported the entirety of the funds raised to 2016 debt retirement—even though no such debt existed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this specific event, I&#39;m curious what the actual breakdown is between what will go to Trump&#39;s campaign and what will go to the RNC. Because he&#39;s splitting it between the two, it negates the rule of $X maximum amount per donor. </p>

<p>What do you think of when they use protection and the unwanted pregnancy STILL happens? do they still deserve your holy punishment mandated by your god? do they still deserve to have their futures wrecked so that christians feel better about themselves? will these christians support any help for the mother in caring for the unwanted baby after the fact, or do they say FUCK YOU I GOT MINE to any poor person down on their luck?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And again you bring up Islam when we&#39;re talking about Dominionism.</p>

<p>You know what they call that right?</p>

<p>Back on to the topic. Here is Ted Cruz&#39;s father&#39;s own words.</p>

<p>In his August 26th, 2012 guest sermon at Larry Huch&#39;s Irving, TX megachurch, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz&#39; father Rafael Cruz, in what was not the first of his guest appearances at the church, explained,</p>

<p>&quot;The pastor [Huch] referred to Proverbs 13:22, a little while ago, which says that the wealth of the wicked is stored for the righteous. And it is through the kings, anointed to take dominion, that that transfer of wealth is going to occur. God, even though he&#39;s sovereign, even though he&#39;s omnipotent, he doesn&#39;t let it rain out of the sky - he&#39;s going to use people to do it.&quot;
Introducing pastor Cruz, in the context that it would soon be Rosh Hashanah, which would ring in the Jewish New Year of 2012, Larry Huch had stated, invoking dominionist numerology,</p>

<p>&quot;The number 12 means &#39;divine government&#39;, that God begins to rule and reign. Not Wall Street, not Washington - God&#39;s people and his kingdom will begin to rule and reign&quot;
As Huch spoke, Rafael Cruz could be seen in the audience, standing next to Huch&#39;s wife Tiz, hand upraised to receive and magnify Huch&#39;s prophetic blessing. Huch continued,</p>

<p>&quot;I know that&#39;s why God got Rafael&#39;s son elected - Ted Cruz, the next Senator. But here&#39;s the exciting thing - and that&#39;s why I know it&#39;s timely for him to teach this, and bring this anointing. The rabbinical teaching is, especially amongst gentiles, who God opens their eyes, that in a few weeks begins that year 2012, and that this will begin what we call the &quot;End Time Transfer of Wealth.
And that when these gentiles begin to receive this blessing, they will never go back financially through the valley again. They will grown and grow and grow. It&#39;s said this way - that God is looking at the church, and everyone in it, and deciding, in the next 3 and 1/2 years, who will be his bankers. And the ones that say, &quot;Here am I, Lord, you can trust me&quot;, we will become so blessed that we will usher in the coming of the Messiah. This message if for you. Would you welcome our good friend Rafael Cruz ? What a tremendous man of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Pastor Cruz could not have made himself more clear:</p>

<p>&quot;There are some of you, as a matter of fact I will dare to say the majority of you, that your anointing is not an anointing as priest. It&#39;s an anointing as king. And God has given you an anointing to go to the battlefield. And what&#39;s the battlefield ? The battlefield is the marketplace. To go to the marketplace and occupy the land. To go to the marketplace and take dominion. If you remember the last time I was in this pulpit, I talked to you about Genesis chapter 1, verse 28, where God says unto Adam and Eve, &quot;Go forth, multiply, TAKE DOMINION over all creation.&quot; And if you recall, we talked about the fact that that dominion is not just in the church. That dominion is over every area - society, education, government, economics...
Describing the anointing of kings, pastor Cruz spoke of,</p>

<p>&quot;Kings who are anointed for a totally different reason than priests. Kings who are anointed to take dominion. Kings who are anointed to go to war, win the war, and bring the spoils of war to the priests. So the work of the kingdom of God could be accomplished. And I&#39;ll tell you - the king needed the blessing of the priest in order to be successful in battle... [in Deuteronomy] Before the king went to battle, the priest came and blessed the king and blessed the warriors. And the king needed the blessing of the priest in order to be successful in battle... Now, the priest also needed for the king to be successful in battle, because the priest needed the spoils of war in order to repair the temple, in order to carry out the ministry that God had entrusted him. So the king and the priest complimented each other, and they were both very, very interested in blessing one another.
Concluding the service, the two men, Huch and Cruz, met onstage and pastor Huch conveyed a &quot;word&quot;, a prophetic message from God relayed through one of his believers, from Rafael Cruz to his New Beginnings Church audience,</p>

<p>&quot;God laid this on Rafael&#39;s heart, for right now - listen to me - In the next 3 and 1/2 years, and we&#39;re not waiting 3 and 1/2 years, it&#39;s the End Time Transfer of Wealth... You know, during the elections - and it just hit me, Rafael was up there and he was saying, &quot;this is the anointed by God&quot; - when I got a phone call, would I come to a meeting to meet Rafael Cruz and Ted Cruz, Tiz and I had already received about ten phone calls asking if we would get behind a candidate - &#39;could we come and speak at your church ? Can we come ?&quot; I mean one after another.
And when we were asked by some friends to come to this house. They said we would not only meet Ted but we would meet Rafael. Before I ever met Ted, I met Rafael. And I knew that if the son was like the dad we could trust him to be our Senator. Amen ?</p>

<p>But here&#39;s what, here&#39;s when it came to me - Ted will be our next Senator, and I gave Rafael a word the other day... this is just the beginning. It&#39;s going to be much, much, much higher. But here&#39;s the deal - Ted Cruz is the real thing. But he hasn&#39;t become the real thing now that he&#39;s going to be Senator. He was the real thing when he was working as a clerk, he was the real thing when he was going through college, he didn&#39;t become faithful now that he&#39;s Senator. He&#39;s going to become Senator - and I believe some day either Supreme Court justice of Vice President - but he was faithful back when he was his [Rafael Cruz&#39;] boy and God took that faithfulness.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what is it about religious extremists which frighten you?</p>

<p>Are you not afraid of child indoctrinated young men in black pants, white shirt and ties walking through your neighborhood trying to convert people to their religion?</p>

<p>What about those nutters driving around town scaring my kid with their &quot;the world is going to end, and your going to burn in hell&quot; placards??</p>

<p>Or is it the fear of being murdered by a religious nutter who believes only their moral and philosophical views are valid?  </p>

<p>Of these fears, I also see a fear of lightning, shark attacks, being hit by a bus and of a heart attack.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t control any of them except the heart attack, but I do know I have more to fear about being hit by a bus than I do of any denomination of religion quack attacking me.  Except Christians - in America they commit 95% of crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not afraid of any of them. I just think they are a cancer on society&#39;s evolution. Now, I know you want me to prefer Muslims over Christians. And although, I think both groups are worthless, you raise a red flag to me because you are trying to create a perception that Islam is better or &quot;less bad&quot;. If I was not a Westerner then maybe I would agree. But, I also think your stats are fucked up. Most Christians are not practicing. If you tracked me down, they&#39;d say I&#39;m Catholic which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Fact is, if you succumb to the Islamic faith in any way, you are a slave. Can&#39;t say the same For Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, honestly I can see how much you let your confirmation bias get the better of you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in Monterey California, I was referring to Mormons in their white shirts.  As for the other two -- if you&#39;re a &quot;Westerner&quot;, you have several orders of magnitude likeliness of being physically harmed by a Christian of one sort or another.  Depending on which specific section of which specific City that likeliness might be more likely Jewish, or Muslim or Hindu or Sikh, or Buddhist or Wiccan if you picked right.</p>

<p>But, being that Westerner&#39;s are so unequivocally Christian of one sort or another -- you chances are much greater for a person of that belief.</p>

<p>I was not intentionally using &quot;devoutness&quot; as a measure of belonging --- I&#39;m not even really thinking about what a person self-identifies with (still overwhelmingly Christian) but rather with the &quot;cultural&quot; normative religion they are.  Sadly, since administrative paperwork has yet to uniformly include &quot;Abstain&quot; or &quot;Atheist&quot; ... being &quot;Westerner&quot; is nearly by definition Christian.</p>

<p>I hope I riled your religious feathers -- because frankly all religions are bunk by and large.</p>

<p>I also hope I riled your political philosophy because the greatest chance of harm coming to you is from your own neighborhood, state, country.  Not some remote foreigner.  I&#39;ll agree that there are bad people ... I spent ten years Active duty Army tracking them down (US) ... by I haven&#39;t let the minorities shape my views of the majority.  Any more than the black criminal I see in the newspaper doesn&#39;t blind me to the fact that the vast majority of black&#39;s in the country are not criminals.  The truth is that a large portion of the world&#39;s population -- both Westerner and not, are increasingly struggling to live.</p>

<p>Currently because of very real, and very difficult Economic issues, Environmental issues, Political Issues the current people&#39;s with the greatest sense of &quot;being targeted by the rest of the world&quot; are living in the Middle East countries -- whether it be Christian Coptic in Egypt or Salafists elsewhere ... they perceive the Western Nations as causing undo problems.  It doesn&#39;t take a well talent Demagogue to convince them that all the worlds problems stem from the United States ... Bin Laden convinced a few thousand, and other&#39;s have as well.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the fact that a loud mouth like Bin Laden can convince young men to become a bomb then you might want to contemplate what causes such a world view a person would be willing to do that.  Religion becomes the language used to convince, but it is not the source of the resentment and anger.</p>

<p>Consider how easily a Demagogue in the US became President by convincing 49% of the population that the Worlds problems will be solved bringing back Gold coins, grabbing women by the pussy, telling Mexico to build a wall around itself and pretending that Coal mining is a viable career.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but for the worlds &quot;Terrorist Problem&quot; I suggest the source of the problem lies within our own Western Worlds.</p>
