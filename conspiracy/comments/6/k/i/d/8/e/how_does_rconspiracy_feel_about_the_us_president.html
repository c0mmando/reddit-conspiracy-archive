       I would expect this from a Clinton, but... never mind, Trump has been a self-interested double-dealing crook all of his adult life, so of course he would have a pay-to-play party THREE years before an election.

       Truthfully, there isn't a good way around it. Megathreads will be called censorship, mods removing reposts would be called censorship. It's just something we have to sift through, I guess.

       He could focus on doing his job as president instead of holding ego stroking parties to ask for donations, that would make me feel better.

       So it's OK because Hillary had one dinner at $100k/plate that raised $1.5million? How about we just don't allow politicians to dine with elite for millions of dollars? It would be one small step in the right direction.

       What I responded to you with is directly related to what your original comment was. I said $35k was a shitton because your original comment was "people should be allowed to eat dinner" as if it's your everyday American family sitting down.

       And my comment was in response to the previous comment implying that the president shouldn't be spending his time on campaigns. I suggested that this likely wasn't a time sink for the president, but something he arrived at like any other dinner or function. You changed the subject to the cost of the dinner, I responded in kind and here we are.

       Trump is going to go to war with Iran for Israel. Anything he has said, or done, will pale in comparison to the devastation, the misery, suffering and loss of life that will result from his war with Iran. War with Iran will finish the U.S. economy for good. So, anything else he does is just circus drama to keep you Gentiles distracted.

       Is this the same sort of war effort which Bush had for Iran and North Korea?

       Pretty sure the majority of the Pentagon are sane enough to push back those notions -- which for some reason are always fronted by Cabinet members and politcians with deep connections to war-based profit corporations.

       Obama fired all of the good Generals who were outstanding patriots. He fired them. Now, all we are left with are Generals who are corrupt and easily bought off.

       maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clear the record, Obama didn't "fire all the good generals" nor did he even fire a majority or a lot.  McCrystal was fired for reasons he brought on himself, Flynn was fired for reasons I don't know details of -- I'm fairly certain it isn't what Flynn claims, but who knows.  Other than these two which Generals were fired?

       But, aside from that, their positions are filled.  There are a large number of Captains and Colonels eligble and waiting for a promotion.  I don't think "integrity" is the purview of "previous people" holding those positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, DoD and Integrity when it comes to corruption is not really something I would be willing to bet on.

       You might want to honor him a bit better by learning how to refer to his religion.  "
       <em>

       This is a joke fuckin joke right? He's the president right now. He's not a candidate. He's not running for anything for another 3 years. By this logic, every president could just use the office to make money and claim they are just a candidate.

       This might be hard for you to understand, but it is possible for many people to play more than one role at a time. I, for instance, can be a property manager, interior designer and also be a piano teacher. I can also keep those things separate. Sometimes the first two roles overlap slightly as far as clients because, but they are separate roles.

       This might be real tough for you. But the president isn't allowed to use the office to enrich himself. The reason you didn't answer the question is because Trump is the fuckin president. Your mental gymnastics ate awful man. You really gotta practice.

       And this may be tough for you, but part of his commitment to his supporters is to work to get elected. His donors paid for the dinner, not the tax payers. His hotel didn't make $35k per plate, his campaign did.

       The thing that really made it set in how strange it is to begin fundraising for re-election this early is that the FEC haven't even released guidelines for the 2020 campaigns yet. I did a little research and
       <a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/news/press-releases/fec-complaint-trump-filed-false-campaign-report-violation-election-law">
        found this filed complaint from almost two months ago
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        alleging Donald Trump’s campaign committee violated federal election law by illegally accepting campaign contributions after Election Day and falsely reporting those contributions for “debt retirement,” even though no debt existed. These false reports could have the effect of illegally increasing the amount Trump could accept from contributors for his 2020 reelection campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump began to fundraise just days after his Nov. 8 victory. Federal law provides that a candidate may only raise funds after Election Day to retire outstanding debts from the election, or for a future election. But the Trump campaign ended the 2016 election with no outstanding net debt—therefore, all contributions made after Election Day should have either been refunded to contributors or designated for the 2020 primary election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet instead, Trump reported the entirety of the funds raised to 2016 debt retirement—even though no such debt existed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For this specific event, I'm curious what the actual breakdown is between what will go to Trump's campaign and what will go to the RNC. Because he's splitting it between the two, it negates the rule of $X maximum amount per donor.

       I don't understand what you mean.  How does he want to screw gays or women?  I haven't heard about him wanting churches to buy off politicians either.  Is there any substance to your claims?

       Where the hell have you been all this time? don't they want businesses to be able to discriminate against gays? don't they want to subjugate women into pregnancies that would derail and destroy their lives? didn't they push an executive order to allow churches to make political donations? If we leave it up to these macabre regressive bastards, we would be back in the 1950s under American Sharia law.

       What do you think of when they use protection and the unwanted pregnancy STILL happens? do they still deserve your holy punishment mandated by your god? do they still deserve to have their futures wrecked so that christians feel better about themselves? will these christians support any help for the mother in caring for the unwanted baby after the fact, or do they say FUCK YOU I GOT MINE to any poor person down on their luck?

       And again you bring up Islam when we're talking about Dominionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what they call that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on to the topic. Here is Ted Cruz's father's own words.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his August 26th, 2012 guest sermon at Larry Huch's Irving, TX megachurch, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz' father Rafael Cruz, in what was not the first of his guest appearances at the church, explained,
      </p>
      <p>
       "The pastor [Huch] referred to Proverbs 13:22, a little while ago, which says that the wealth of the wicked is stored for the righteous. And it is through the kings, anointed to take dominion, that that transfer of wealth is going to occur. God, even though he's sovereign, even though he's omnipotent, he doesn't let it rain out of the sky - he's going to use people to do it."
Introducing pastor Cruz, in the context that it would soon be Rosh Hashanah, which would ring in the Jewish New Year of 2012, Larry Huch had stated, invoking dominionist numerology,
      </p>
      <p>
       "The number 12 means 'divine government', that God begins to rule and reign. Not Wall Street, not Washington - God's people and his kingdom will begin to rule and reign"
As Huch spoke, Rafael Cruz could be seen in the audience, standing next to Huch's wife Tiz, hand upraised to receive and magnify Huch's prophetic blessing. Huch continued,
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know that's why God got Rafael's son elected - Ted Cruz, the next Senator. But here's the exciting thing - and that's why I know it's timely for him to teach this, and bring this anointing. The rabbinical teaching is, especially amongst gentiles, who God opens their eyes, that in a few weeks begins that year 2012, and that this will begin what we call the "End Time Transfer of Wealth.
And that when these gentiles begin to receive this blessing, they will never go back financially through the valley again. They will grown and grow and grow. It's said this way - that God is looking at the church, and everyone in it, and deciding, in the next 3 and 1/2 years, who will be his bankers. And the ones that say, "Here am I, Lord, you can trust me", we will become so blessed that we will usher in the coming of the Messiah. This message if for you. Would you welcome our good friend Rafael Cruz ? What a tremendous man of God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Pastor Cruz could not have made himself more clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are some of you, as a matter of fact I will dare to say the majority of you, that your anointing is not an anointing as priest. It's an anointing as king. And God has given you an anointing to go to the battlefield. And what's the battlefield ? The battlefield is the marketplace. To go to the marketplace and occupy the land. To go to the marketplace and take dominion. If you remember the last time I was in this pulpit, I talked to you about Genesis chapter 1, verse 28, where God says unto Adam and Eve, "Go forth, multiply, TAKE DOMINION over all creation." And if you recall, we talked about the fact that that dominion is not just in the church. That dominion is over every area - society, education, government, economics...
Describing the anointing of kings, pastor Cruz spoke of,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Kings who are anointed for a totally different reason than priests. Kings who are anointed to take dominion. Kings who are anointed to go to war, win the war, and bring the spoils of war to the priests. So the work of the kingdom of God could be accomplished. And I'll tell you - the king needed the blessing of the priest in order to be successful in battle... [in Deuteronomy] Before the king went to battle, the priest came and blessed the king and blessed the warriors. And the king needed the blessing of the priest in order to be successful in battle... Now, the priest also needed for the king to be successful in battle, because the priest needed the spoils of war in order to repair the temple, in order to carry out the ministry that God had entrusted him. So the king and the priest complimented each other, and they were both very, very interested in blessing one another.
Concluding the service, the two men, Huch and Cruz, met onstage and pastor Huch conveyed a "word", a prophetic message from God relayed through one of his believers, from Rafael Cruz to his New Beginnings Church audience,
      </p>
      <p>
       "God laid this on Rafael's heart, for right now - listen to me - In the next 3 and 1/2 years, and we're not waiting 3 and 1/2 years, it's the End Time Transfer of Wealth... You know, during the elections - and it just hit me, Rafael was up there and he was saying, "this is the anointed by God" - when I got a phone call, would I come to a meeting to meet Rafael Cruz and Ted Cruz, Tiz and I had already received about ten phone calls asking if we would get behind a candidate - 'could we come and speak at your church ? Can we come ?" I mean one after another.
And when we were asked by some friends to come to this house. They said we would not only meet Ted but we would meet Rafael. Before I ever met Ted, I met Rafael. And I knew that if the son was like the dad we could trust him to be our Senator. Amen ?
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's what, here's when it came to me - Ted will be our next Senator, and I gave Rafael a word the other day... this is just the beginning. It's going to be much, much, much higher. But here's the deal - Ted Cruz is the real thing. But he hasn't become the real thing now that he's going to be Senator. He was the real thing when he was working as a clerk, he was the real thing when he was going through college, he didn't become faithful now that he's Senator. He's going to become Senator - and I believe some day either Supreme Court justice of Vice President - but he was faithful back when he was his [Rafael Cruz'] boy and God took that faithfulness."

       And I am telling you...your paranoia of Dominionism means absolutely nothing to me. Yeah, they're corrupt, they want money through illegal and immoral means. Who doesn't? This sect, this church, this delusion, this corruption, this (insert name) is not affecting my life directly in any way.

       Islamic terrorism, suicide bombings, etc. whether its false flagged or not...it does affect me.

       The participants involved maybe receiving financial backing from Western governments, but at the end of the day; it is their ideology that allows them to recruit people to continue the cause.

       what is it about religious extremists which frighten you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you not afraid of child indoctrinated young men in black pants, white shirt and ties walking through your neighborhood trying to convert people to their religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about those nutters driving around town scaring my kid with their "the world is going to end, and your going to burn in hell" placards??
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it the fear of being murdered by a religious nutter who believes only their moral and philosophical views are valid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of these fears, I also see a fear of lightning, shark attacks, being hit by a bus and of a heart attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't control any of them except the heart attack, but I do know I have more to fear about being hit by a bus than I do of any denomination of religion quack attacking me.  Except Christians - in America they commit 95% of crimes.

       I am not afraid of any of them. I just think they are a cancer on society's evolution. Now, I know you want me to prefer Muslims over Christians. And although, I think both groups are worthless, you raise a red flag to me because you are trying to create a perception that Islam is better or "less bad". If I was not a Westerner then maybe I would agree. But, I also think your stats are fucked up. Most Christians are not practicing. If you tracked me down, they'd say I'm Catholic which couldn't be further from the truth. Fact is, if you succumb to the Islamic faith in any way, you are a slave. Can't say the same For Christianity.

       well, honestly I can see how much you let your confirmation bias get the better of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in Monterey California, I was referring to Mormons in their white shirts.  As for the other two -- if you're a "Westerner", you have several orders of magnitude likeliness of being physically harmed by a Christian of one sort or another.  Depending on which specific section of which specific City that likeliness might be more likely Jewish, or Muslim or Hindu or Sikh, or Buddhist or Wiccan if you picked right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, being that Westerner's are so unequivocally Christian of one sort or another -- you chances are much greater for a person of that belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was not intentionally using "devoutness" as a measure of belonging --- I'm not even really thinking about what a person self-identifies with (still overwhelmingly Christian) but rather with the "cultural" normative religion they are.  Sadly, since administrative paperwork has yet to uniformly include "Abstain" or "Atheist" ... being "Westerner" is nearly by definition Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I riled your religious feathers -- because frankly all religions are bunk by and large.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hope I riled your political philosophy because the greatest chance of harm coming to you is from your own neighborhood, state, country.  Not some remote foreigner.  I'll agree that there are bad people ... I spent ten years Active duty Army tracking them down (US) ... by I haven't let the minorities shape my views of the majority.  Any more than the black criminal I see in the newspaper doesn't blind me to the fact that the vast majority of black's in the country are not criminals.  The truth is that a large portion of the world's population -- both Westerner and not, are increasingly struggling to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently because of very real, and very difficult Economic issues, Environmental issues, Political Issues the current people's with the greatest sense of "being targeted by the rest of the world" are living in the Middle East countries -- whether it be Christian Coptic in Egypt or Salafists elsewhere ... they perceive the Western Nations as causing undo problems.  It doesn't take a well talent Demagogue to convince them that all the worlds problems stem from the United States ... Bin Laden convinced a few thousand, and other's have as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like the fact that a loud mouth like Bin Laden can convince young men to become a bomb then you might want to contemplate what causes such a world view a person would be willing to do that.  Religion becomes the language used to convince, but it is not the source of the resentment and anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider how easily a Demagogue in the US became President by convincing 49% of the population that the Worlds problems will be solved bringing back Gold coins, grabbing women by the pussy, telling Mexico to build a wall around itself and pretending that Coal mining is a viable career.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but for the worlds "Terrorist Problem" I suggest the source of the problem lies within our own Western Worlds.

       He could focus on doing his job as president instead of holding ego stroking parties to ask for donations, that would make me feel better.

       Actually, strike that. I've seen his policy. I want him to spend
       <em>
        all

       of his time ego stroking and begging for money.

       <em>
