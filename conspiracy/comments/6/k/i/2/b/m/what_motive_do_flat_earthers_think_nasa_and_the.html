       Well if you want to read some weird NASA related stuff, read up on Jack Parsons. He was a rocket engineer and one of the founders of NASA's JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and an occultist and a high ranking member of the Ordo Templi Orientis. He was personal friends with Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard, who was also an occultist before founding the Church of Scientology. And it only gets stranger from there. The more you research it, the weirder it gets.

       How is anything created? Laws of physics.
If it was a flat geocentric earth then there would be different laws of physics, which doesn't (as far as we know) need an intelligent designer.

       How does it not? Geocetricity literally means we are the center of everything. We are the sons and daughters of God who made this earth for us. The fact that the grandfather of rocketry for NASA himself (Wernher von Braun, former nazi) quoted a bible verse on his tombstone that mentions the firmament, psalms 19:1,  (dome above earth,  space is water) should tell you they knew something they won't tell us about. Trust in the word of God.

       So you can't prove it but you will dismiss science where they can prove most of what they say. Which god have you had experiences with there are literally thousands of them? In the old testament god killed over 2 million people to satans 10, how is god better?

       I will repost a conversation for you here I had with my flat Earth friend on Discus about it, removing his last name in order to comply with reddit rules, and let you see if you can figure it out. Good luck. When I ask him really hard scientific questions he usually answers with gibberish like this or he tells me no one knows. It is a big mystery.

       Ben, the earth is a globe. It is the simplest shape in the universe which is repeated over and over again on many different scales. Like single cells, bubbles, oil droplets and fish eggs: planets, suns and moons are spherical. Get over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars look like they are spinning over us because we are on the surface of a spinning globe and they are a long way away. Some of the stars are other suns in our galaxy, others are entire galaxies of their own and some of the stars are other planets in our solar system. It is very three dimensional even though it looks flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint, if you want to learn how to feel the earth move, first you have to go outside at night when it is clear and sit very still or lie down with your head more or less pointing north. Look at the stars and watch them very carefully.Focus on them until you can see that they are moving in relationship to stuff like the trees and mountains. This is why looking south helps. After you are aware of them moving, then you can try to see them as stationary and feel the earth move.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do it right, you can feel it, but it is not easy. It requires focus and the right mind set. It might take many years of practice. You have to hold still.

       Hint, Lauren. Only brainwashed slaves believe they live on a globe. That includes 100% of the voters. Only brainwashed people vote time and again and lose over and over. A sign of insanity to some, but to me it just shows the power of brainwashing from childhood.
Tell me how Polaris has remained the North Star for all of human history if the Earth has moved an inch? Tell me how it remains the North Star during all four seasons since under your model the North Pole points in 4 different directions each season. Does the North Star jump around on a pogo stick?
Try answering the question rather than just stating your religious beliefs. The problem lies in scientism, the religion of the modern slaves, who know zero science themselves but believe Jewish men they never met, like the fraud Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you answer that one? I suggested a course in Astronomy, it didn't go over too well. But I enjoy Ben, teasing him about his flat-Eartherism is kinda fun.

       I'd maybe try answering his questions instead of thinking you are correct?  Actually look at the questions he asks instead of thinking to yourself "Oh he's such a kook".
       <br/>
       He's completely correct in his comment about scientism anyway.  People simply reiterate things they've heard, without any investigation themselves.

       I don't think he is a kook. I think he is a agent for MI6. Also it is not my job to answer his questions. Nobody is paying me to do it and I can make fun of him if I want to.

       Why do you think you have the ability to read my mind [which you don't]? Do you think you are God?

       I never claimed that ability.  From your comment it comes across like you really don't respect this person at all.  I simply used the word kook to imply that as shorthand.

       Maybe so but you are telling him that he is incorrect in his belief. So don't be surprised when he responds with questions that might refute your claims.

       It's just your job to make sure he knows how moronic you think he is for what he thinks, huh.  You're not trying to make him believe otherwise, people that want others to do that at least answer questions they might have about it.  That's how discourse works.
