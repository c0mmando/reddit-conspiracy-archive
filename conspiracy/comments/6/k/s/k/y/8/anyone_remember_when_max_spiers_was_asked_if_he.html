<p>Edit: I found <a href="https://youtu.be/S5TSm2mWlbo">the video</a>. By the way, the interview he is giving here took place in Poland where he had gone to give a conference. He was murdered on this trip.</p>

<p>There is at least another video of him talking about him being taken to Mars. I&#39;ll post it when I find it so check back later today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also the video of the conference he gave in Poland is a must watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mars has life. But most don&#39;t know every dimension In our universe shares the same space. Only thing that&#39;s separates us is a veil. What that means is the inhabitants of mars are in their own dimension in our universe. Their dimension has a different configuration of our shared space. So while there is life there, and while they look at earth where we are they don&#39;t perceive us . To them the earth is barren and seemingly lifeless and empty just like we perceive mars.</p>

<p>This is how inter dimensional beings exist. In a another dimension of our universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to nitpick but I think by &quot;dimensions&quot; you meant more &quot;plane of existence&quot;. </p>

<p>There are supposedly around 11 dimensions, we are (at least empirically provabely) privy to 4 and 4 only. Height (y), length (x), width (z), and time. Now, that being said, who&#39;s to say there&#39;s not another... plane... with beings that are only privy to, dimensions 5, 9, 10, and maybe time? 11 dimensions, that&#39;s a lot of... configurability if you will. Especially if a reality such as ours is manifested in only 4.</p>

<p>But no, dimensions are not other worlds as pop culture would have you know, and I think it&#39;s an important difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Counting dimensions with numbers won&#39;t work. There are countless dimensions. You can&#39;t count something that would not have a frame of reference in which to count something.</p>

<p>A dimension could be a plane, it could be not a plane. It could have no time, or time moves in a different direction. A dimension could not have water, or air, but something else entirely. But inherently a dimension is any area that can hold any type of reality. </p>

<p>Some of them our closer in our type of experience and those will be the ones we could experience first, if we were to somehow move our consciousness to the inter dimensional framework where we could experience these other dimensions directly. We do go to other dimensions in dreams , in a light body, we travel through consciousness. They idea then would be to more fully merge the dream state with the waking state. A profound alteration in our perception. Though I think that&#39;s what need to be done.</p>

<p>But from what I understand dimensions of existence don&#39;t mean the dimensions of our reality. They mean other worlds, other realities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have plenty of wit in one thumb to school you. Not even trying. </p>

<p>First, Let me know when you can actually do math. Then I might believe you know anything about the false theory of quantum mechanics. If you actually knew what they were talking about you wouldn&#39;t have such a problem with what I&#39;m saying. Little do you know I&#39;ve already unpacked quantum ideas and played with them like a rubrics cube and solved it. Only the solution to go anywhere in space involves the conscious mind of the person going there. Quantum does not include consciousness in its model, it&#39;s utter bullshit. All your science you think are Truths and that solve all these things &#39;out there&#39; , they all have no connection to a person&#39;s perception and to even how reality is consciously experienced. </p>

<p>Your math , which you can&#39;t do, doesn&#39;t map our experience any better than art work does. Quantum actually is what Mind could be, and not some mechanistic toy to conjecture symbols into, if all these hacks actually knew what the mind Is. I guarantee you don&#39;t know. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yet you&#39;ve unpacked all of quantum theory like a rubix cube. </p>

<p>You know the most FUNDAMENTAL, and not to mention most early proven, aspect of quantum mechanics lies on an observer collapsing the wave function right? Schrodingers cat is the classic example of this. You&#39;ve now, without a doubt, proven the extent of your ignorance. If had even googled the words Quantum Mechanics you&#39;d have learned about this fundamental aspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then what the fuck do you think multiple dimensions are accessed with.  You took me down this fucking path to show me some shrodinger and explain a wave?</p>

<p>Listen , you have no clue , you objected to me saying there are countless dimensions. And this is what you want to object with?</p>

<p>Where is the consciousness. Where is the mind? You have a cat in a box. The wave function can&#39;t be traced . You can&#39;t even follow an electron because it&#39;s in countless places at once. Just like our consciousness. It&#39;s the nature of consciousness itself. It&#39;s countless. The fucking atoms, even smaller than that the very substance of atoms blinks in and out faster than plancks constant, (Planck speed is slow , it&#39;s wrong, the wave /particle blinks faster. When it collapses and blinks out it goes anywhere it wants. They can&#39;t even predict that. All they know is it collapses and goes &#39;somewhere&#39; . Now do you really think it has &#39;limited places it can go? Don&#39;t be an idiot. There are countless dimensions all made of consciousness and all these little particles that make up the mechanics of your form are in a constant flux of being here and not here. When they are not here they are in another reality. Just in the time I wrote this my own mind has blinked in and out of this reality. It&#39;s the nature of consciousness.</p>

<p>Also what&#39;s confusing about you is if you know strings. You think those are finite? Why do you box this up and object to the idea there are countless dimesnions?? We are not in a closed system. In a box, like the cat.</p>

<p>Also man, when you are losing an argument don&#39;t act like a bitch, it looks bad. &quot;Key board warrior fraud&#39; ..you do nothing but straw man when you lose. If this is all you got just retract your bitch fest about how many finite  dimensions there must be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. No, I taught you it&#39;s conscious Ness, not particles. Science has a hold on you like it did me. I know most of its believable, but keep an open mind. The systems are not closed , there is countless. Countless blinks is the only thing you need to know. I wrote that sentence and every particle around me blinked more times than even a computer could count. The blinking out is where the fun for us will be to discover where some of the units of consciousness do go, and maybe we can hitch a ride. Math is somewhat arbitrary to map that particular field of understanding that they call quantum. Since its countless.</p>

<p>So instead of math it has to be frame worked differently. Sure math can help with conceptualizing it, but I think to really pierce that veil takes an understanding of consciousness. And the mind. </p>

<p>Because essentially we are inherently linked to conscious Ness and we are doing the same thing as any unit is doing because we are comprised of the same thing as everything else.  This interconnection can be consciously experienced in altered states, for example. But even sitting for a second and watching the space around you and marvel at your place within it. As it&#39;s a reflection of you and the force pattern of the consciousness you are.</p>

<p>And besides I was never dismissing you, thanks for challenging me, it&#39;s fun to argue sometimes.</p>
