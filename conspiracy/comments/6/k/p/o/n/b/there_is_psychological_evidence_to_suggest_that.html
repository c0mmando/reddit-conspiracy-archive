        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Allow me to elaborate, i have studied psychology more specifically Behaviour, When psychologists decide if someone may have a mental illness, they will look at their behaviour and lifestyle of &#39;being able to function adequately&#39; etc. Many of these suggestions as to what ideal mental health is, suggest that those that are trans may have an mental illness, for instance one factor they take into account is the reality that which one lives in, some could say that &#39;oh but they really feel like the opposite gender&#39; but someone with schizophrenia will feel like a clock is talking to them, by denying your biological body you are in turn not grounded in reality, secondly &#39;ability to function adequately&#39; requires those to be able to deal with the everyday demands of everyday life and be able to deal with stress. Many trans go through intense stress due the belief that they are another gender. They will also struggle with doing &#39;traditional gender activities&#39;. Im explaining this horribly but if you want you can look up the widely used books that psychologists use all over the world to diagnose someone with a mental illness or not DSM-5. by no means am i trying to offend its just a scientific conclusion i have come to, the mental illness section within this book suggests that many of transgender individuals do not have the ideal mental health. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender roles (or gender stereotypes) are socially constructed because society tends to dictate what the majority sees as masculine or feminine. Your gender identity is how you identify yourself based on your relation to the ideas of masculinity and femininity, which is internally derived. Society can influence how you outwardly choose express yourself, but it can&#39;t change what&#39;s at your core. That would just be the person conforming to gender roles to fit a stereotype because they don&#39;t feel comfortable identifying as who they really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great discussion.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you&#39;re saying, minus the crux of your argument which is:</p>

<p>&quot;Society can influence how you outwardly choose express yourself, but it can&#39;t change what&#39;s at your core. &quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty baseless assumption, don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when people used to (and in rare cases still do) claim that being gay was a choice? It&#39;s now (mostly) accepted that being gay is something with which you are born. Society can&#39;t get you to stop being gay, (although many conversion camps have tried), and some people will &quot;hide in the closet&quot; if they live in a part of society that deems being gay a negative. Being gay is simply a part of their identity, and that&#39;s something neither they or society can change.</p>

<p>I believe gender is the same way. A brain of a certain type is put into body of a certain type, and that brain, as it gathers information from the world as you grow up, matches up a certain way of identifying with the identity that already exists inside of it. This is less concrete, as deviating from the standard gender norms only just started to become okay in society, and as a result, the concept of gender identity only just started to permeate into the field of science. I may completely be wrong, and I&#39;m open to information that changes my way of thinking, but until that point, I will continue to believe that the two scenarios are comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed response. </p>

<p>I do fear that you are creating a bit of a false dynamic: that you are either born gay or choose to be gay.  Those aren&#39;t the only two options as many things we do are UNconsciously influenced by our environment and experiences, in ways we really don&#39;t always understand.</p>

<p>I majored in Sociology, and walked away with a strong sense that everything is influenced to some degree by our environment, and you can make the case for even things like sexual attraction.</p>

<p>But the idea of the us having a &quot;core&quot; self that we are born with intrigues me, I just currently find the Sociological arguments against they too compelling.</p>

<p>There are limitations to our scientific understanding of this matter, highlighted by this very discussion.</p>

<p>Multiple sides of this argument  can legitimately claim that they have the science on there side.  It&#39;s kind of a clusterfuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes male and female refer to sex but gender refers to how we treat those two. There are biological differences between a boy to a girl, its also pretty personality based, hence why i disagree with more than two genders, one gender is someone who can only have sex with someone once they love them or something similar to that, to me thats just someone&#39;s personality.

<p>No, no it isn&#39;t.  We don&#39;t approach someone feeling like they need to hide away because of the scar on their face the same way when they have such a scar as when they don&#39;t.

No one is denying how anyone feels or suggesting trans people need to get their rights taken away, the premise of this post is simply that those feelings may originate from somewhere psychological.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe so. In fact, I think the where this discussion is hitting major roadblocks in everyone&#39;s definition of gender. </p>

<p>Gender is like an identity umbrella for a lot of people and that&#39;s inaccurate. It stems from an old French word that just means &quot;to bring forth&quot;. Or possibly from another French word gendre, or genre, which has quite the same definition as most would expect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>c. 1300, &quot;kind, sort, class, a class or kind of persons or things sharing certain traits,&quot; from Old French gendre, genre &quot;kind, species; character; gender&quot; (12c., Modern French genre), from stem of Latin genus (genitive generis) &quot;race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species,&quot; also &quot;(male or female) sex,&quot; from PIE root *gene- &quot;give birth, beget,&quot; with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal groups. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until the 20th century that gender began to replace the term sex as sex had become a very erotic term.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until the 21st century that definitions were thrown out the window and simple understanding of biology was lost in the general public. It should still mean &quot;sex&quot; in the scientific term. Male, Female, Hermaphrodyte, Ambigious, and Hidden. All based off of physical observations, not how someone &quot;feels&quot;. </p>

<p>Which then brings me to what everyone is really using for the definition of gender, gender identity. Gender Identity would accurately describe the entire phenomena that is being discussed in this thread. </p>

<p>Gender identity is one&#39;s personal experience of one&#39;s own gender. This is generally described as one&#39;s private sense of being a man or a woman, consisting primarily of the acceptance of membership into a category of people: male or female. All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a social identity in relation to other members of society.     ~Wikipedia</p>

<p>:  a person&#39;s internal sense of being male, female, some combination of male and female, or neither male nor female  ~~Webster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and last but not least</p>

<p><a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gender+identity">Medical Definitions of Gender Identity</a></p>

<p>Soooo, hopefully this will help out with lack of understanding in different directions. These are important to discuss because it helps to distinguish this:</p>

<p>Transvestite is a Gender Identity term, not a Gender.
Transgender is a Gender Identity term, not a Gender
Non-binary is a Gender Identity term, not a Gender.</p>

<p>None of these terms describe what is being argued about however. Which is; are Transgender and Non-binary gender mental illnesses?</p>

<p>I would argue no, because it is a description of self identification or physical change attributes. Non-binary should be removed as Transgender is actually an umbrella term for anyone who identifies as anything other than their biological gender.  The argument would actually be what causes someone to self identify transgender?</p>

<p>This is where the discussion should begin to spread out into a web of studies on individual basis, but that&#39;s a lot of work and almost all of the ones I have read where not actual test studies. They were testimony and affirmation. So instead, I&#39;ve posted my train of thought on this subject leading to my conclusion of:</p>

<p>Gender Identity out of the norm is not a mental illness. Rather there is a miscommunication on perception of Gender Role. I personally would attribute high post-op suicide to flawed logic because of Gender Role perception and confusion with Gender and Gender Identity.</p>

<p>Are there cases of mental illness related to Gender Identity and Gender Role perception issues? Yes, but I believe it is a correlation not causation.</p>

The same way I have a mental illness that I like to titty-fuck girls. It serves no biological purpose. That doesn&#39;t make it &#39;wrong&#39; because we determine what wrong is, as a society.

    <div class="md"><p>Based on your other comments I think you missed the point of this post. No one is denying how anyone feels or suggesting trans people need to get their rights taken away, the premise of this post is simply that those feelings may originate from somewhere psychological. Many respected psychologists suggest that it is something along the lines of extreme body dysmorphia, but they still find the best cure is letting the person live as the gender they identify as. I just find it strange that people consider it transphobic or homophobic to question where these feelings originate from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>with homosexuality, i look at it very objectively, a reminder the the DSM-5 is based on western culture for what we deem as a society as &#39;ideal mental health&#39;, some psychologists actually believe that mental illness isnt a thing but they are just different. However getting back to the question, there is one truth in the universe and that is procreation, it happens with all animals, all cells so if someone cannot procreate because of loss of genitalia or something like erectile dysfunction etc it is seen as a &#39;biological disorder&#39; because biologically something is wrong with their body, so if someone is biologically sound but they cannot procreate naturally it is because of a cognitive disorder as mentally they wont want to have sex with the gender needed to procreate, therefore i also homosexuality as a mental disorder, however that doesnt mean they have to be cured or less then human because they are not. I dont think someone can objectively say that 1.6% percentage of the population is &#39;normal&#39; or that it isnt a disorder- i wish there was a better word to use than &#39;normal&#39;.</p>

In a family with two gay sisters and I have fetishes (and don&#39;t want to procreate) so always been curious if I didn&#39;t have what I have, could there have been a chance I could&#39;ve been gay? You don&#39;t need to attempt to answer my hypothetical question but I&#39;m starting to have a theory that fetishes, homosexuality, trans etc could all be tied to mental health in the family genes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea what you are talking about. They&#39;ve done brain scans and autopsies of trans brains and they are almost identical to the gender they are not the sex on the outside. Most likely it&#39;s caused by hormones in the womb. In some it is genetic because they have extra chromosomes​. Like xxy. You don&#39;t think there is a difference between sex and gender because you have the same type of sex and gender identity. I however did not grow up with that luxury. It is nothing like feeling like your a snail or other stupid arguments people like you try to make up. That doesn&#39;t even make sense. You do know there are male and female brains and there are hermaphrodites in nature so it&#39;s only natural that they&#39;re would be intersexed conditions where it&#39;s the brain that&#39;s opposite from it&#39;s body sex. And the suicide rates are high before treatment. I&#39;m not sure about older transitioners but there isn&#39;t a high suicide rate among young transitioners. They also took trans people out of the mental illness books do quit trying to put us back in it with your ignorant statements. I don&#39;t understand why you would even have this in the conspiracy section nobody made me trans i felt this way my whole like. I also am not dillusional i know perfectly how my body looked no hallucinations or anything like your picturing. I just know my brain and body didn&#39;t sync up right. It&#39;s like i was using the wrong kind of gas and oil and when i got on hormones everything just clicked and worked better cuz i got the premium gas and oil now. So no it&#39;s not a mental illness stop wasting your time worrying about trans people we don&#39;t harm you by getting treatment. </p>

Many trans cannot function adequately according to the DSM-5. Irrational behaviour such as cutting off genitals, maladaptive and suffer personal distress and self hatred.

    <div class="md"><p>Also I just looked at the dsrm Again trans people do not automatically have gender dysphoria. The gender dysphoria diagnosis is only used if it causes the individual great distress. You can be trans and be phycologically healthy or screwed up and trans just like anyone. It happens more often with trans people then it should because we haven&#39;t been accepted and are forced to play a role we don&#39;t feel is compatible with our true selves. Also using abnormal behavior if your gender as a diagnosis of mental illness is wrong. If that&#39;s the case then tom boys who like to do guy stuff and Boys that like more feminine activities must be mentally ill as well in your mind. Who defines what are normal behavior anyway certainly not you. I also don&#39;t know why your putting homosexuality as a mental illness it was taken out long ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know against me I&#39;m not sure what kind of group that is I&#39;m American by the way you mentioned uk so I guess they are from there. I guess what you are saying is she was mtf and the wife stayed. Well no that means she is gay she always was a lesbian just perceived as male before. Sexual orientation is definitely confusing for trans people and tho we might say it changed after transitioning it&#39;s more like it&#39;s revealed because most of us repress our true selves. That did a study recently on women where it was discovered all women are at least a little bi or fully gay. They all got turned on by women but the lesbians did not get turned on by men.There is no such thing as a 100 prevent hetero woman according to the study. So it stands to reason the wife either knew she was bi or discovered it and they stayed together. I&#39;m not sure what your point is.</p>

<p>Also trans people are not automatically gay.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was agreeing with you. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Against Me is a Punk band from the Gainesville area of Florida. Their singer very publicly transitioned from male to female. There was even a TV miniseries about her, and they had an album called &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues.&quot;  She and her wife are still together even after transitioning. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>My point is that contrary to what many people are saying in this thread, male, female, gay, straight are not cut and dry things, and many people are somewhere in between, both and neither.</p>

It&#39;s my normal i dont feel insane. No one is saying they aren&#39;t real people.

My comment about real people was that most people think of drag queens and transvestites or a weird porn fetish like thing. By real I mean people are seeing regular people like me that transition and live normal lives and see that were not what they saw in the media in the past. It was never once said against mentally ill people so if you bring it up again then you&#39;d just be trolling me at that point if you aren&#39;t already.

<p>I am hoping people consider this information when discussing this issue.  I think it does not solve this issue completely, but it offers some insight into what is going on and why each generation of heterosexual parents produce homosexual children.  </p>

<p>Has anyone here had a shot of testosterone?  I have, and it really changes your mental outlook.  Certain things no longer seem like a problem.  For example, I did not have time to go hike a certain remote trail I like because I was so busy with work.  You know something?  Fuck it.  I&#39;ll just go at night with a headlamp.  Why the fuck not?  Never mind it is December and cold as shit.  It is not a problem that I have no time during the day.  I&#39;ll just fucking go at night.  I don&#39;t see a problem.  Do YOU see a problem?  I want to get something done, SO IT WILL FUCKING GET DONE.  Period.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My daughter is transgender. While I do not think she is defective in any way, she undoubtedly deals with a mental condition that is outside the norm that she finds difficult at times. But despite that, I consider her very well adjusted. But no one ever told her there was anything wrong with her when she was 3yrs old ripping the bows off her panties and wanting to shave her head. I mean, my wife was confused by it for many years, but ultimately let her be what she was. When all your psychology is at war with your physiology, it just isn&#39;t a fun place to be. I feel for you guys. </p>

<p>I have another trans acquaintance who is what I would consider extremely mentally ill on top of the gender dysphoria, and that poor person will probably never be able to get around both of the conditions to lead anything like a normal life. Whereas my daughter gives no fucks about what she is, and just is what she is without the least bit of shame, it has never occurred to her/him that I know of that there might be something wrong with the way they are. </p>

<p>I guess what I am getting at is although trans <em>can</em> be a mental illness which causes great harm to the person that is afflicted, it doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be a crippling mental condition. And while I don&#39;t think we should force our entire society to adjust to this minuscule portion of the population&#39;s mental issue, it would be nice if we could live and let live in regards to trans people so they can live their lives as normally as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from my experience, gender dysphoria is different in the way it affects each person afflicted by it. i know that i personally dont care much about the physical condition of my body, so i dont really see a need for surgeries and genital removal as long as i can look like a girl and other people see me as a girl. my boyfriend is transgender as well, and can get a little hung-up about his breasts at times. i wouldnt be surprised if he got top surgery in the future. id say that he&#39;s definitely affected by dysphoria worse than me, but its not at a point where it prevents him from performing as a normal person in society. even when that does happen, transitioning usually fixes the issue, which is why even though i dont see the need for it i support others if they decide to do so. honestly, its just one of those &quot;live and let live&quot; situations. wanting to be seen as a different gender doesnt hurt anyone, and switching up a pronoun and referring to someone as a different name isnt very hard, and most people are very forgiving and understanding if you slip up. i dont really get whats up with all the trans hate on this sub lately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trans hate stems from our general suspicion of anything that is seeking to manipulate us at some fundamental level. And confusing us about sexuality is definitely a part of the agenda of some evil parts of our society imho. And while this sub can be mostly libertarian about a lot of things, I think it is very conservative when it comes to family values and the human condition, and it does feel like this is under assault imho. But I think they get mixed up when it comes to identifying the victim here. I feel like regular folk are as much of a victim of this situation as the trans community. This difference of a relatively tiny subset of the population is being used as a wedge to create division in society.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it is a mental illness, but not like the traditional mental illnesses we see such as depression and anxiety. Depression, for example, is a mental illness that you can get throughout your lifetime. Nobody is born depressed, and nobody chooses to be. But it can be cured because it is chemical and when different parts of the brain are altered, a human can go back to their natural state - without depression. But for transgenderism, it&#39;s not something that hits you out of nowhere, nor is it something you develop. It is something you are born with whether you realise it or not. It is also not something that you can cure. The only actual cure for transgenderism is for the transgender individual to undergo physical transition to create the biological impression of the gender and sex they identify with. This is the only way they can live with a happy mindset. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still much more about transgenderism and gender dysphoria that we don&#39;t know about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with transgenderism is that it is not some kind of illusion. It&#39;s not like a boy believes he&#39;s a boy but then has this thing where he thinks he&#39;s a girl. The way transgender individuals describe it is that they&#39;ve never felt like their biological sex. It&#39;s not an illusion that can be fixed and they can go back to identifying with their biological sex, it&#39;s much more ingrained in them than that. Does that make sense? I think what would help us understand this more is talking to doctors who confirm whether you are really transgender or not before giving you hormone treatments and the like. </p>

<p>The DSM-5 is defining gender dysphoria as a term to be referenced elsewhere. You should note that they renamed it from &quot;Gender Identity Disorder&quot; to &quot;Gender Dysphoria&quot; in recongition that being trans itself isn&#39;t a disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, some people feel they are simply born in the wrong body, without any other mental illness.  Or maybe feel they would be happier as  the other gender, without any feelings that they are really 
 male or really female.  We don&#39;t know enough to say why this happens, definitively, but we don&#39;t need to:  it&#39;s a &quot;correctable&quot; condition even if it is some form of delusion, so why not embrace it?</p>

<p>What is less talked about is a different category of people -- those struggling with issues characterized by a lack of persistent sense of self (personality disorders etc.).   I image some people who struggle with their gender identity suffer from one or more of these, and in these cases actually undergoing hormone therapy and surgery might be dangerous because of the instability -- what happens if they stop feeling like whichever gender they&#39;ve transitioned to?</p>

I guess what you are saying is she was mtf and the wife stayed. Well no that means she is gay she always was a lesbian just perceived as male before. Sexual orientation is definitely confusing for trans people and tho we might say it changed after transitioning it&#39;s more like it&#39;s revealed because most of us repress our true selves. That did a study recently on women where it was discovered all women are at least a little bi or fully gay. They all got turned on by women but the lesbians did not get turned on by men.There is no such thing as a 100 prevent hetero woman according to the study. So it stands to reason the wife either knew she was bi or discovered it and they stayed together. I&#39;m not sure what your point is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trans hate stems from our general suspicion of anything that is seeking to manipulate us at some fundamental level. And confusing us about sexuality is definitely a part of the agenda of some evil parts of our society imho. And while this sub can be mostly libertarian about a lot of things, I think it is very conservative when it comes to family values and the human condition, and it does feel like this is under assault imho. But I think they get mixed up when it comes to identifying the victim here. I feel like regular folk are as much of a victim of this situation as the trans community. This difference of a relatively tiny subset of the population is being used as a wedge to create division in society.  </p>
