       Basically alot of pedo related shit has been traced back to a pizza place called comet's. They have bands playing there who use child pornography based images in their music - some vids you can find on YT, They have paintings of child abuse, they use codes (Like pizza and other symbols) That are in the F.B.I's record of pedophile symbolism used by pedophiles....
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some basic stuff, you can find an archived post somewhere if you search for pizzagate. Had alot of information on it.

       Pizza is one of the registered pedophile words. I mean the clue is in the title...Pizzagate...Pizza has huge significance when trying to follow the pedophile trail.

       It's also probably the most common take-out food in the United States, but no, you're probably right. People who post their love of pizza on the internet are probably pedophiles

       Why because I can support my argument. I don't claim to have proof that pizzagate is a undebatable theory, but I know enough to explain why pizza has significance in the theory.

       Your argument is hilarious at best. My friend owns a pizza place. My whole family of 4 have shirt from the pizza place with a slice of pizza on the front. Are we some sort of pedo family because of it? Of course not. Do you legitimately have some sort of mental condition? That's a serious question.

       I lurk in here a bit for semi-comic relief and partially as some people have interesting theories about events. If something had evidence in here I'll happily read along the thought process and see if it could be true. Half the ones in here on the other hand are "I hate Hillary and she kills people reeeee"

       I never said this was valid, I never even made it clear where I stand on the conspiracy in general until you started messaging me. All I did was explain why pizza was linked to pizza gate. This forum is supposed to be about free thinking and information. He asked for information so I gave it to him.

       I don't think the image has any relation to P gate whatsoever... That said, the possible implication was the first thing that came to mind when I saw that post, which is kinda funny how a single apparently harmless looking image instantly sends my head looking for a connection or hidden message.
      </p>
      <p>
       It kinda sucks that the symbol of something as awesome as pizza has been tainted. I probably won't  see the "codeword-foods" the way I used to... And honestly, it sorta pisses me off that they didn't pick something shitty for their code words, like fast food or internet service providers.
      </p>

       I'm not actually upset about this or anything, but it's crazy how your brain gets trained to associate certain meanings with certain images/memes.

       This is the problem with conspiracy theories in general. Once you start to work backwards from your conclusion, you start to see the connections everywhere. Every single piece of "evidence" for Pizzagate is based on the idea that you already believe it's true.

       The effect that I was bringing up isn't really specific to conspiracy theories, it's a problem with the human mind. Conspiracy theories happen to have a lot of these sorts of "image &gt; hidden meaning" connections, but it happens all the time and it's all around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, 90% of what we consider to be the mainstream/zeitgeist is just memes; you see a United or Comcast logo nowadays and most people instantly add their own meaning... The only real difference here is that the P gate story was super charged up politically, whereas most people agree on some of the other memes out in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the whole "confirmation bias" phenomena, yeah, that happens a ton with conspiracy theories, but that also happens all the fuckin time with non-conspiracy related stuff too. Religion, politics, diets, etc. are all great breeding grounds for that sort of mindset.

       Some people, who spend a lot of time 'researching' pedophilia will see molesters everywhere (as well as hillary and the illuminati).

       Everytime I go grocery shopping now I get some frozen pizza. Cook it up, sit down in front of my computer and start eating a slice, bring up reddit and yell out "Look at me, I am raping and eating babies, this pizza all the proof any human needs".

      <p>
       I crack myself up when I do that.

       Judging by his post history, I think that's exactly what he's doing. He's a far lefter who posts in
       <a href="/r/politics">

       . Looks to me like he's trying to see who takes the bait so he can point and say, "see you people will believe anything that fits your narrative. This picture isn't related in any to pizzagate, nor does it have any sexual undertones. It's just a picture.

       This type of person does not exist. Far left people are banned from r/politics for not being cheerleaders for the Democratic Party, and anyone in r/politics that DOES support the Democrats is not "far left" at all.

       It's just a semantics argument, but the far left imo does cheerleader for the Democratic Party. "If you didn't vote for Hillary, you're a sexist xenophobic Drumphkin worried about muh emails." That type. People who hold on to old liberal ideas that don't cheerlead are progressives, of which the left has very few. Progressives aren't marries to the party and want to watch it burn.

       Then how do you describe the millions of people

       who would have voted for Bernie Sanders in the general election last year, but refused to vote for Clinton?

       It really, really is. Voting against progressive ideals is just that, doesn't matter what color it comes in. Democrats need to learn to get on board or get out of the way. Progressives aren't putting up with that shit.

       I have no opinion either way.

      <p>
       Look at the term 'gay' for example... these days, no one would
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       use that term to refer to someone when they're happy even though that's how it originated. or the abbreviation "AR" which actually means
       <em>
        AR
       </em>
       malite Rifle, but it's been used by so many people in so many different forms of media to mean "Assault Rifle" that people don't even know what Armalite is.

      <p>
       I'm only saying that definitions and usage of words change over time based on the context and frequency of use by a majority of people. We can't control it.

       Because Reality Winner leaked that we had SIGINT that the Russian gov't was attempting to hack voting machines.  And the next day, as if to corroborate and verify, the feds came after her for leaking.  The election was a fraud and a sham, and if they told people the truth all at once, there would be riots in the streets.  They're slowly trickling out the truth to us to prevent anarchy.  Voting booths were compromised, just like they were in 2004 (though that time it came from within, not from without).  Trump, Pence, &amp; Ryan are all implicated, and Orrin Hatch has been receiving the president's daily briefing for two months already, while Trump and his lackies have had their highest level security status partially suspended.

       You seem to have misconstrued the nature of Winner's leak. It didn't reveal that we "had SIGINT" that the Russian government was attempting to hack voting machines, but rather that they tried the same shit they're always trying, and
       <em>
        none of it had any effect.
       </em>
       She revealed how flimsy the "Russian hacking" story was, and the narrative fell apart shortly afterward.

       That not what the Russia story is about though. We know they got into voter rolls and we know they successfully hacked the DNC. We know they used other method to try to influence voters. The narrative is the fact that another country made a concerted and intentional attempt to harm our democracy and that hasn't changed.

       You're just dead wrong.
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/">
        Reality Winner's actual Leak to the Intercept is linked here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote the intercept article, the original source of the leaked document, which has been verified independently by the Intercept as well as implicitly by the prosecution of Reality Winner:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "The report indicates that Russian hacking may have penetrated further into U.S. voting systems than was previously understood. It states unequivocally in its summary statement that it was Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, that conducted the cyber attacks described in the document"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the NSA document says
       <strong>
        "based upon subsequent targeting, it is likely that at least one account was compromised."
       </strong>
       The document does not address the reach or effects of the hacking, only the methods (spearphising), and the fact that the company (likely Diebold if I had to guess) was likely penetrated by the Russian GRU.  This is a smoking gun of Russian hackers successfully penetrating our voting infrastructure.  If you don't see it as such, perhaps you just haven't read the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not "flimsy" evidence, sir.

       Well, there are some extremely unlikely point spreads in some Ohio counties, so much that even high enthusiasm can't explain it.  Winning by that much in that state, when the governor doesn't really like him all that much, definitely suspicious.  But the registrations were targeted, so a lot of voters were scrubbed from the registration rolls and showed up and were unable to cast their ballots. Moreover, the GOP didn't necessarily need the Russians to hack the systems in the first place, since
       <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890">
        they have set up a multistate system to wipe voters from registration rolls that disproportionately scrubbed minorities from being able to cast their ballots on election day.

       You could have just said "they had no effect" like every analysis of the situation to emerge thus far. Until someone comes up with proof that votes were tampered with, and so far there is none, this narrative will continue to be a fiction.

       False. We have no idea of the effects yet. Still waiting on 20/21 states to confirm the nature of the hacks on their election systems.

       Also the talking point, "This has always happened so it doesn't matter" is one of the most alarming things I've ever seen. Lots of my friends on the right are taking that stance, which tells me they really do not care about our country at all, just their party.

       Because, weirdly, the measures only ever target democrat voters and minorities.  It's almost like it's voter suppression, pretending to be something else.  So weird.

       Because there's evidence showing they did. And that theyve done it to many other nations, think of the block countries, and Ukraine, its rather obvious. Its what the Cold war has become. They couldnt win with M.A.D., so now its espionage and undermining our governments authority.

       "Government" doesn't imply any particular place on the left-right spectrum. "Nationalized Healthcare" is inherently a far-left policy. Therefore, the Democrats are far-left if they support Obamacare, agreed?

       I think single-provider healthcare doesn't necessarily have to be nationalized, but the economies of scale outweigh the benefit of competition in certain aspects.  Is that left or right?

       Just because they shared aspects doesn't mean ACA  is "communism". A lot of countries (social-liberal, socialist, etc) have nationalized healthcare and they definitely aren't communist. You make it seem like the only types of healthcare plans there are are communist or neoliberal. Also, if ACA were to be communist, it would be free (and probably shite).
      </p>

       Calling it socialist would be a little more accurate since it redistributes wealth in a way.

       By the way, the ACA is not nationalized healthcare.  It came out of GOP think tanks in the '90s and is primarily a private-sector solution, mandating insurance via a tax penalty.

       You mean you need to dive deeper into confirmation bias right? Stop looking for pizzas and children in the same picture and do some real investigating, this shit is ridiculous. Googling pizza is not research, getting hard evidence from someone's computer is but keep deluding yourself.
