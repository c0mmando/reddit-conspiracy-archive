    <div class="md"><p>There never has been nor ever will be laissez faire capitalism. And considering the ideology of free trade is the cri de couer of corporatists and globalists, the truth is that exploitation is the centerpiece and hallmark of capitalism, whatever its flavor. </p>

<p>Capitalism is an ideology that justifies and venerates greed over all other human values, which has not been a positive for culture or for all life on the planet for that matter. </p>

<p>It&#39;s capitalism killing the planet and consigning future generations to a world greatly diminished from what we have (which in turn is greatly diminished from previous generations -- things like the monarch butterfly migration or roaming buffalo or unsullied wilderness, for example), not Marxism.</p>

<p>One day, the guillotines will return for the bankers, the CEOs, the vulture capitalists and all their sycophantic courtiers. I wait with bated breath for the pavement of Wall St to be bathed in the blood of the so-called elites while the children of the poor play football with the decapitated heads of the likes of Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since neither of you sound like you&#39;re journalists, I&#39;ll inform you that &quot;assignments&quot; are handed down from Executive Editors, Managing Editors, and Chief Editors. Very rarely is a journalist allowed to write about anything they want when representing a national or worldwide brand whose sole concern is ad sales and affcom, uniques, and page views. </p>

<p>Even after a piece has been written, it is scrutinized by multiple Editors, not so much for clarity and research, but for brand loyalty, and to determine if the piece will sell (print), or if it will garner enough clicks (digital/social). </p>

<p>While I agree with you, that truth should prevail in news, you must remember that these are not crusaders in the conspiracy ridden world you reside, but companies that answer to shareholders and consumers. They will always and forever worship their bottom line over all else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree it&#39;s not ideal, but we offer no revenue stream to news organization that isn&#39;t directly tied to ratings. They could be entirely ethical in how they report stories, but if they lose ratings, they lose money, and if they lose enough money, they stop reporting altogether.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a simple solution. Subscribe to a news organization! I don&#39;t like to waste paper, so I just subscribe to my local paper&#39;s online version.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not particularly impressed with their reporting, but I&#39;m sure as fuck that local reporting would be worse if my local paper didn&#39;t exist!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you should give money to CNN, but if you&#39;re not paying for news, you&#39;re ensuring that this crap will continue to get worse as they fight to keep us watching instead of digging into important (and often boring) stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what really worries me. There was bipartisan talk about a no fly zone in Syria before the election and everyone knew that implied blowing up Russian planes. So they are already setting the table but the public wasn&#39;t on board. Then were blasted with Russia interfering in the election and chemical attacks in Syria means we have to get more serious there. All of this seems like an attempt to actually go to war with Russia, like they are trying to make us agree it has to be done. </p>

<p>It&#39;s terrifying and the question I always wonder from this witchhunt is what&#39;s the end game?  If we get rid of every single person who had the slightest connection to Russia out of any position of power what do we do with Russia to actually prevent this from happening again?  Isn&#39;t the logical conclusion war?  Sanctions don&#39;t do shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People easily confuse the business needs of a media outlet and propaganda. Will fully to fit their own needs. Which is in turn propaganda.</p>

<p>If you were a free weekly that covered light hearted events in town and a journalist working for you wanted to cover corruption discovered in Taiwan, the editor would nix that piece. That&#39;s not propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your job as a citizen to consider multiple sources and make the best decisions. Not that of a single media outlet. And I&#39;m not defending CNN - it&#39;s just not healthy to think this is something it&#39;s not. If it&#39;s suppose

    <div class="md"><p>But my point is CNN is pushing an agenda, at the very least for ratings, probably to get back at Trump.  At the same time, however, there are legit investigations and questions to report on.  Why did Trump&#39;s people lie, or rather &quot;forget&quot; all of their secret meetings with the Russian ambassador or whomever?  His former campaign manager has had to register as a foreign agent...  There are legitimate concerns.  </p>

<p>Russia is not the anti-corrupt anti-NWO champion so many Alex Jones viewers thinks it is.  RT can report on some interesting dirt on the US, and Putin is very cunning at poking holes in America&#39;s stances.  They are, though, insanely corrupt and oppressive themselves.  All of this shady shit with Russia with the Trump campaign certainly is troubling.</p>

<p>I agree, though, that I wish CNN had been pushing a pro-Paris Climate Accord agenda and covering how that&#39;s going to fuck the planet instead of only Russia.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people in this sub, though, reporting on Fox New&#39;s and the oil industries conspiracy to fuck alternative energy?</p>

<p>In response to your comment, I&#39;d say this:</p>

<p>Even with the investigation going on. Even with the lies. Even with the corruption within the Trump administration. The fact that a news CEO is telling his reporters what they <em>must</em> cover, instead of stories that they deem newsworthy, is authoritarian propaganda pushing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, CNN doesn&#39;t <em>do</em> any actual investigative reporting, really, except for when they did a great story on Trump University.  So, their reporters are told what to report for ratings.  It&#39;s not journalism, really, it&#39;s cable &quot;news&quot;.  MSNBC can have some interesting stories every now and again but if I had a nickel for every time it was leaked that Fox News had corporate wide talking points for partisan political campaigning...  They tell their viewers how to think and feel with lies, as opposed to reporting on facts.  That&#39;s a whole other level.  CNN is just desperate for ratings and likely hates Trump.</p>

<p>But yes, if your point is journalism is dead, I&#39;d direct you to The Intercept with Glenn Greenwald and suggest that&#39;s its last bastion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>eh, I don&#39;t necessarily agree. If their goal is simply to impassively report all the facts, they&#39;re not producing propaganda, at least not willfully. Now, if some facts are being hidden from them or covered with lies, artfully and skillfully enough that they honestly do not even suspect it, they might be <em>unknowingly</em> spreading propaganda - but not, strictly speaking, <em>producing</em> it; whoever wove the deception was the producer of it. </p>

<p>What the media - left or right - all do today is excessively editorialize, while passing it off as fact. It&#39;s never <em>just</em> the facts, much less <em>all</em> of the facts; it&#39;s their opinion and interpretation of subset of the facts they think is both important and &quot;news-worthy&quot; (read: ratings-boosting, click-baity, etc.) When the opposition is given a voice, that voice isn&#39;t chosen for being respected, well-informed, or any other constructive criteria, but for creating lively, dramatic debate partners that won&#39;t make their core people look bad. The distinction between that and propaganda can be so tissue-thin as to be largely irrelevant - technically there, but if it quacks...</p>

<p>In response to your comment, I&#39;d say this:</p>

<p>Even with the investigation going on. Even with the lies. Even with the corruption within the Trump administration. The fact that a news CEO is telling his reporters what they <em>must</em> cover, instead of stories that they deem newsworthy, is authoritarian propaganda pushing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree the media has been the biggest booster. I still consider that this is the best Season of America ever. Trump would be the perfect actor, him and the media both know the workings of episodic escalation perfectly.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>I trust my sense of humanity far more than what is fed to us on the  net and cable. I see true heart in Trump, I am not defending the faux pas and deceptions, I do think that they are far more innocent than what they have made out to be.</p>

<p>In the Bonifield video, he states that if we covered Obama like this, people would be off-put. Is that because being President is probably, and literally the most difficult job in the world? Obama was a community organizer and a first term senator and we felt him prepared, hopefully not because of any media induced white-guilt of course.</p>

<p>Trump is 30yrs older and I think he will be fine through first term, will have to judge later if he turns Reagan-mode. That&#39;s plain life experience and he&#39;s been public scrutiny for decades. It&#39;s a type of experience, I FEEL, that Obama simply never had and is indeed valuable as a leader.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that the electoral votes were hacked by the Russians at all. Unless they installed agents in the college. In that case, taxation is theft to a degree because obviously our intelligence has failed.</p>

<p>I am willing to excuse his persona for the direction he brings at the fork in the road for Trump vs. Hillary.</p>

<p>And since really nothing terrible has happened outside of the alleged Russian scandal, except rising 401ks and stocks and liberals learning the 2nd amendment, I can suspend my dislike for some of his traits.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a bit biased and crazy, but I feel this expression captures the emotion of most Trump voters. We want progress now, we want to build with all of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought of this. What better way to rally Trump&#39;s opposition during the election than to paint him as the underdog and attack him 24/7. Throw in a little two-party &quot;my team is better than your team&quot;ism and you&#39;ve got a silent majority of republicans that are DEFINITELY going out to vote. </p>

<p>My next thought, however, was why not just proceed with business as usual and set up two candidates and get one elected without this whole &quot;trump the outsider&quot; drama. </p>

<p>I suppose the counterargument would be that people were starting to wake up a little bit, which was the perfect time to use the outsider narrative, reinforced by the media attack. By getting their outsider elected, peoples growing distrust in the govt is quelled a little bit. </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t believe Trump was set up to win by TPTB, he just saw the game and played it well (used the outsider card and media attacks to his advantage). Thats why we have this whole Russia pushback. I still have a tiny bit of hope that Trump actually is an outsider, and heads will start to roll with this Loretta Lynch probe and so on.. But unfortunately it doesn&#39;t seem that way.</p>

<p>i also heard that at the LATimes, an (editor?) once said to a journalist that he already had the &quot;quote&quot; that he needed to be said, but that he needed to find someone to say it. </p>

<p>again, scripted &quot;news&quot; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s kill the environment so the oil and gas companies can make some more money. Also the richest 1% are not doing so hot right now they need more money also. Let&#39;s trick people into thinking that our interests are theirs. Now that was the plan, and the plan worked. Of course a health care bill that eliminates coverage is good for people. Of course we don&#39;t want regulations preventing lead from contaminating the water. Of course global warming is a lie.

    <div class="md"><p>Judging from this comment, I can tell you do not have a strong background in economics. </p>

<p>You can believe me or not, but I&#39;m about as anti-big corporations as I am anti-big government (should be evident from my history). Oil and gas are dying, good fuck em. We should cut all the government subsidies and divert them to renewables. But you know what&#39;s really profitable for the government? More regulations. Taking more money from corporations and giving it to the government won&#39;t solve climate change in the slightest. You know what saves money on healthcare? Not letting the government run it. What they need to do is remove the CRAZY amount of regulations that have already been in place for years, allow for real competition and let the free market do its job. </p>

<p>Regulations only work when they are done with solely good intentions, by honest and good people... does that sound like our government?</p>

<p>What we currently have is not a democracy, nor a free market. Don&#39;t let the state of our current system confuse you on the viability and efficiency of basic economics. </p>

<p>The answer should never be more government. But the answer should never be pro-big business either.</p>

<p>To varying degrees CNN is like FOX News and MSNBC: selling journalism for a profit, and often diverting to infotainment or agenda-pushing to get ratings or whatever the hell else they want. Healthy skepticism is important but that doesn&#39;t mean if they lie once they lie all the time; also going to remind everyone the two PV tapes just expose two people expressing an opinion. Everyone has an agenda and there is bias in everything but compared to other sources there is still a low percentage of content CNN has created that is manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That lawsuit is another MSM talking point. Have you ever actually read the court case for why he was sued?</p>

<p>I agree with the Michael Moore being a better comparison point. </p>

<p>Also, the PV video exposed the head of CNN expressing a biased and disingenuous opinion, not just the guys in the video (granted it may be hearsay, but still interesting given the source of the information).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. Media outlets are corporate entities: they exist because of money--without it they would not be able to finance themselves (to a degree). They don&#39;t run because of donations, and if you have a problem with that you are able to donate to news organisations or independent journalists. The issue then lies in &#39;what is profitable&#39;, which is a systemic issue. So, it&#39;s a bad cycle--news is made to attract viewers, and then viewers are largely only exposed to a certain view which they, in turn, often want to see more of. So then it comes down to change of the individual. But that&#39;s the same for anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that any &quot;news&quot; organization, or even any one person <em>in</em> a &quot;news&quot; organization, is fair and impartial is completely absurd.</p>

<p>Just making the decision on which stories to cover/not cover displays a prejudice.  So, in a way, every story comes with a built-in agenda.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s another layer to the prejudice; nobody presents a story completely impartially.  It&#39;s clearly presented with one side in mind, however much lip service it gives to the other.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only one reason why CNN runs a Trump/Russia &quot;story&quot;, and it isn&#39;t to clear Trump; it&#39;s to slowly crucify him, facts be damned.  CNN has clearly &quot;let&quot; (i.e. been ordered to) the &quot;story&quot; get ahead of the facts.</p>

<p>Source? I have not seen Van Jones &quot;driving the narrative&quot; at all. I&#39;ll ignore the first line about covering stories against their will because it isn&#39;t any less stupid than when you said it in your last post.</p>

<p>It&#39;s journalism if they are reporting facts and legitimate theories. It isn&#39;t any more complex than that. Whether they were directed to report on the topic or not it is still journalism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it reminds me so much of the Daily Bugle pushing the unlawful vigilante spiderman narrative despite other reports of spiderman being a hero. in no way though does it deny Spiderman&#39;s existence, just the fabricates the motivation. </p>

<p>Despite trying to tarnish Spiderman&#39;s name, the paper couldn&#39;t out right lie. you cant say spiderman robbed a bank unless you had evidence he was robbing the bank. you can say &quot;spiderman seen at bank robbery&quot; when spiderman was there busting bad guys.</p>

<p>News organizations like NBC, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc are literal propaganda corporations according to the very definition of the words.

    <div class="md"><p>OP I&#39;ve read your comments and you seem like a reasonable person who&#39;s been drinking a little too much &quot;CNN IS THE PROBLEM WITH AMERICA&quot; juice.  It seems to me that you have to look a bit higher and a bit more critically at what is happening here.  This isn&#39;t a consipracy, this is America.  </p>

<p>The situation we are in today is due to a whole host of factors.  You can blame whomever you want, it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Here&#39;s Rand Paul talking about the healthcare charade they&#39;re doing up in DC these days, but pay attention to the &quot;invisible hand&quot; comment:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53UEkpONzXs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53UEkpONzXs</a></p>

<p>Rand puts it perfectly.  There are those who believe that the Adam Smith doctrine will just <em>magically</em> fix all markets at all times, no matter what.  Supply, demand, you get the picture. </p>

<p>Then swing around a bit and read about ol&#39; Bernie Sanders ideas about the role of government in terms of regulating corporations:</p>

<p><a href="http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-corporate-regulation/">http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-corporate-regulation/</a></p>

<p>So far so good right.  You need some government to regulate these evil corporations!!  Well, here&#39;s the thing that you probably already know.  The corporations won a long time ago.  Every industry vertical in the United States has seen mergers, acquisitions, conglomerates and flat-out monopolies dominate its landscape in the last 50-60 years, which is where we are today.  So let&#39;s take media:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/data/the-6-companies-that-own-almost-all-media/">https://www.webpagefx.com/data/the-6-companies-that-own-almost-all-media/</a></p>

<p>Here they are in all their glory:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=1074385">National Amusements</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=38249">Disney</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=655621">Time Warner</a> - The evil CNN owners!!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=655621">Comcast</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=1077748309376325">News corp</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=33095">Sony corp</a></p>

<p>So your issue in your post title is that &quot;being told what you must report by the [CEO] is literally propaganda.&quot;</p>

<p>So...yeah.  It is.  And we as a country just watched as our newspapers and media outlets got swallowed up by these mega-corporations whose interest is hardly <strong>news.</strong>  That&#39;s adorable!!  Their interest is profit-only.  Full stop.  </p>

<p>See this is why the &quot;invisible hand will fix everything&quot; argument is nonsense.  Conversely, it&#39;s why the &quot;regulate the corporations&quot; is nonsense too in today&#39;s world.  In retail, in healthcare, in media, the list goes on and on...if there is not a government for the people, by the people, that will at least protect its citizens from being limited in CHOICE with its purchasing power (lol) then you just have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy">kleptocracy</a>, which is exactly where we are.  </p>

<p>So don&#39;t be mad at Rand Paul or Bernie Sanders or any one of the people on CNN or Fox News or whatever.  It&#39;s all just part of the whole system we&#39;ve watched be created before our eyes.  </p>

<p>THIS IS OUR MEDIA</p>

<p>If you think this Veritas video proves anything at all, you&#39;re really living in the dream world of what Americans <em>think</em> America is.  It proves exactly what we see right before our eyes.  There are six guys:</p>

<p>*Sumner Redstone
*Bob Iger
*Jeff Bewkes
*Brian Roberts
*Rupert Murdoch
*Kaz Hirai</p>

<p>These six fellows have a combined <strong>reported</strong> net worth of around 30 billion dollars.  They&#39;re your &quot;person at the top.&quot;  </p>

<p>So your problem isn&#39;t with CNN.  Or Fox.  Or Rand.  Or Bernie.  Your problem is that we went from Happy Days to Brand New World in the span of 60 years and America didn&#39;t care because they were workin&#39; hard and prayin&#39; to Jesus and earnin&#39; an honest livin&#39;.  And now we&#39;re here.  We have a literal moron as our President, a group of party-line obstructionists as our Senators, a Congress that spends its time debating whether Santa Claus is being discriminated against or not, and a populous that is too fat and lazy to vote, much less run for office.  </p>

<p>This is where we are.  The Veritas video proves nothing other than what is hidden before you in plain sight.  If you thought our media branches were reporting the facts in the interest of true journalism, I&#39;m sorry to tell you that you were incorrect in that thought process.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment. I do have one point, though ... :P</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The deregulation era began in the early 1980&#39;s when Ronald Reagan took office and the Senate went Republican after 22 years of Democratic control. In the House, Democrat Tip O&#39;Neill caved into the Reagan agenda, despite having very public doubts. </p>

<p>The corporations and oligarchs do not feel like they have won at all despite all the deregulation and tax cuts ever since. But they have made monumental progress under Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush -- not so much under Barack Obama though.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has shown to be perfectly in line with continuing the oligarch agenda, breaking all of his &quot;populist&quot; promises, and keeping the ones that we were supposed to take &quot;seriously but not literally.&quot;</p>

<p>Believe it or not, based upon the plans of the most virulent strain of oligarchy, there is a long way to go until they get their corporate utopia. They will not stop until they have reversed the massive changes introduced by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, and the many other changes at various times by people like Teddy Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and even Richard Nixon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That looks like a good article. I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I&#39;m willing to comment prematurely anyway LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1970s, the United States‚Äô position as the unchallenged colossus of the capitalist world was suddenly threatened from multiple directions: rising international competition, spiking energy prices, declining productivity and profitability, and soaring inflation and unemployment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oil shocks of the 1970&#39;s were the <em>only</em> actual economic sabotage or catastrophe of the United States economy after World War II. Despite these shocks, average real growth in the 1970&#39;s was 3.7 percent -- lower than the 5 percent rate of the 1960&#39;s, but certainly no slouch.</p>

<p>If you look at inflation rates in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, you will see that inflation went up and down at various times. We could have eased out of inflation but instead ...</p>

<p>The panic over the recently described inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment produced a horrific over-reaction in the early Reagan years, and led to the worst recession since WW2. It was only then, as the economy came back from the money squeeze that standards of living mostly stopped rising and the productivity trend separated permanently from the wage rates trend. By the end of the 1980&#39;s, growth had averaged 3.4 percent -- lower than the 70&#39;s -- but also growth was less equal across earnings percentiles.</p>

<p>The 90&#39;s saw a little recovery -- up to an average of 3.7 percent -- but mostly weighted in the anomaly of the computer boom in the latter years. After 2000, things fell through the floor. There have been ZERO gains for wage earners on average ever since -- although official numbers are under two percent. That two percent went entirely to the wealthiest people or to government spending.</p>

<p>/BTBishops might also be interested in this.  <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/">In this Chomsky video entitled &quot;Neoliberalism is Destroying our Democracy</a>, there is a clip in there of President Jimmy Carter saying the following (at 3:18 - scroll down for the video):</p>

<p><em>We deregulated the airlines, we deregulated the trucking industry, we deregulated financial institutions, we de-controlled oil and natural gas prices, and we negotiated lower trade barriers throughout the world to get rid of needless and burdensome federal regulations which benefit nobody and harm all of us</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://billmoyers.com/content/the-powell-memo-a-call-to-arms-for-corporations/">The Powell Memo</a>may be one of the early documents signaling the rise of corporations.  </p>

<p><em>By 1971, future Supreme Court justice Lewis Powell felt compelled to assert, in a memo that was to help galvanize business circles, that the ‚ÄúAmerican economic system is under broad attack.‚Äù This attack, Powell maintained, required mobilization for political combat: ‚ÄúBusiness must learn the lesson . . . that political power is necessary; that such power must be assiduously cultivated; and that when necessary, it must be used aggressively and with determination‚Äîwithout embarrassment and without the reluctance which has been so characteristic of American business.‚Äù Moreover, Powell stressed, the critical ingredient for success would be organization: ‚ÄúStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Those six media conglomerates are substantially owned by some Deep Corporate entities in London who essentially control all of big industry and banking. If you check Yahoo Finance, you will see the same names coming up over and over. About 25 groups control nearly everything!

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your premise but respectfully disagree with your wording.  I don&#39;t think there is anything &quot;deep corporate&quot; happening here.  It&#39;s all in plain sight.  Take one of them, News Corp, as an example.  It&#39;s all public information:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8841452/Top-ten-News-Corp-voting-shareholders.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8841452/Top-ten-News-Corp-voting-shareholders.html</a></p>

<p>A Saudi Prince, Bank of New York, JP Morgan, Goldman...pretty much standard operating procedure.  Then scroll down to section 9 here:</p>

<p><a href="http://investors.newscorp.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-15-353355&amp;amp;CIK=1564708">http://investors.newscorp.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-15-353355&amp;amp;CIK=1564708</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s right on their own website.  This isn&#39;t &quot;deep corporate.&quot;  It&#39;s right in front of us.  For the company to maintain its debt-to-equity standing, they leverage their debt across several lenders (banks).  If you think ol&#39; Rupert isn&#39;t golfing with one of their CEOs right now, you&#39;re missing the big picture.  They&#39;re not hiding...at all.  </p>

I&#39;ve been saying it for years, who needs wacky conspiracy theories when the way the world is run is right in front of our faces? There is conspiracy, but not aliens in your tapwater conspiracy, just regular old business conspiracy. If you want to know who runs shit just check rich lists, CEO lists, lists of financial institutions. It&#39;s all just money. If you have money, if you often put the interests of personal gain and wealth accumulation before fellow people, then it is you as well. It&#39;s not a shadowy cabal of pupeteers, its the system.

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo.  This goes back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fief">fiefdoms</a> and probably well before that too.  This isn&#39;t anything new, it&#39;s just the 2017 version.  Take it down to its base level.  Humans evolved and found safety in numbers.  In those numbers, roles emerged.  In those roles, leaders emerged.  In those leaders, despots emerged.  War emerged.  Fiefdoms emerged.  Kingdoms emerged.  Nations emerged.  We&#39;re just at that point.  Now we call it &quot;quantative easing.&quot;  The kings threw loaves of bread from their balconies.  It&#39;s the same stuff, just new and improved for 2017.  </p>

<p>The only real difference is that today&#39;s &quot;leaders&quot; have the environmental fate of the fucking planet we live on at their feet.  Other than that, we&#39;re just peasants waiting for that loaf of bread off the balcony to be &quot;blessed by the Gods&quot; enough to land in our hands.  Sad, but true.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed with everything right up until the end. America didn&#39;t make a conscious choice not to care. Making an honest living for most of us entails working away the best years of our lives just to keep our heads above water, and barely.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t care because they&#39;ve been literally blinded by a steady, unceasing river of lies streaming out of every news agency and government office in the country. They are taught to trust in the good of Democracy and our &quot;American way&quot; and believe the good word of our illustrious leaders. They were lulled into trust by a specially insidious breed of vampires who&#39;ve been sucking out the lifeblood out of America and the world for generations.</p>

<p>We only just now have the internet that allows us to gain a greater insight, but that new frontier is quickly evaporating as it becomes increasingly polluted with the same cancerous filth owned by the same parasites that control everything else we see and hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way and do in fact agree with you...until the end.  The &quot;these people&quot; part.  I&#39;m just not sure what that means exactly.  Who are &quot;these people?&quot;  Bankers?  CEOs?  Politicians?  The heads of the major religions?  The 1%ers?  Okay.  I guess.  I just don&#39;t know what &quot;destroyed&quot; means in this context.  Like killed?  Or just removed from their positions of power via revolution?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to leap a bit here and infer from your comment that you mean eventually the people will rise up.  Would not then new leaders emerge laced with their own agendas to fulfill?  Would not eventually new class warfare exist?  I don&#39;t mean to sound defeatist, but when generalities like &quot;these people&quot; get thrown around I just want to be sure what you mean.  </p>

<p>Is it possible that a true leader could rise up and unite America and in turn, the world, around a common idea?  Yes.  That&#39;s the hope.  The exploration of our solar system and beyond perhaps is that hope, I&#39;m not sure what it is.  But for now, this is our world, and &quot;these people&quot; control the whole show.  We&#39;re just along for the ride.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going in the right direction, but you stop at the billionaire class.  There is also a hidden hand that controls the billionaires-the trillionaire class, which can easily bankrupt someone in the billionaire class.  </p>

<p>$35B to a trillionaire is like $35K to a millionaire.  It is not much... </p>

<p>&quot;Our little moron of a President&quot; is a Nationalist, and the people you mention in the media are all New World Order Globalists.  Being a Nationalist directly conflicts with the NWOG agenda.  It is why they wanted Hillary, but she imploded.  </p>

<p>The CIA, the media, Congress, and everything else is being used to control Trump.  They last thing they want is for Trump to interfere with or expose their agenda.  </p>

<p>The best thing Trump can do is to tell the American people how it all works so that we can do our thing and change it.  </p>

<p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.  </p>

<p>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who falls for this nonsense needs more study in their psyop manual. This is a textbook example of misdirection, obfuscation, and &quot;nothing to see here&quot; trolling.  </p>

<p>The obvious red flag is acting like Rand Paul is part of the system we ... apparently according to you we <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be mad at.  Let me explain more clearly: Rand Paul is on one side with a few other good men - and Benie Sanders, Clinton &amp; Bush Crime families, Zionists et al are on the other.  </p>

<p>That Rand Paul link is such a shillspin example of CNN twisting, wrenching, and distorting reality to push the overlord agenda: Less Freedom - More War.  Rand Paul makes the case for private voluntary groups using their FREEDOM OF CHOICE in the healthcare market to negotiate a better deal. The invisible hand: competition drives prices down and services up to their limits. The CNN whore tried to spin that as an argument for TOTAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL.  </p>

<p>Fuck You. Fuck your &quot;nothing to see here, we all knew they were corrupt&quot; excuse which does nothing but urge people to stay ASHLEEP.  </p>

<p>And then you tried your snake-like way of NAMING NAMES. Compare that to this guy&#39;s version or maybe the Ken O&#39;Keefe version... then people should come back to you to see who you really are.  </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t fool me. Here&#39;s someone else&#39;s version of naming names:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But BIG, INFLUENTIAL BUSINESSES like PayPal (Schulman), Facebook (Zuckerberg), and Google (Brin/Page) - are owned by Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same with media: CBS (Sumner Redstone/b. Murray Rothstein), NBC (Brian Roberts), ABC (Robert Iger), CNN (Vivi Nevo) - are owned by Jews.</p>

<p>Wherever you look, whether its Wall Street (Goldman Sachs), Brewing Companies (Ken Grossman), Real Estate (Stephen L Green) (Automotive (Norman Braman), Hedge Funds (Paul Singer), Casinos (Sheldon Adelson), Tech Giants (Larry Ellison) - JEWS own it.</p>

<p>Speaking of Goldman Sachs, colleges are beholden to its Jewish agenda vis-a-vis its Grants Program, including Gary Cohn‚Äôs funding the ‚ÄúCohn Jewish Student Center‚Äù at Kent State.</p>

<p>Jewish patronage of academia is a well-known ‚Äòphilanthropic‚Äô (READ: control) endeavor.</p>

<p>Besides owning DC, Jewish Wall Street underwrites the stocks of defense contractors, which means more wars for the Jews.  </p>

<p>That was Brother Nathanael, FYI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Journalism going back as far as journalism began has always had an editor to get past, usually these editors make sure the copy is correct, sometimes they are making sure the story meets their standards, sometimes they kill a story for one reason or another, and sometimes those stories are killed due to pressure from the ownership, that is just life as a journalist. </p>

<p>A lot of &quot;news&quot; on the internet could use quality editors to make sure the story is correct, up to journalistic standards, and ready for public consumption. Just like a lot of media in the media world could use less editor oversight and less direction from the top. There is a balance that must be maintained between complete garbage and spin, somewhere right in the middle is where journalism needs to be from all outlets.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, it&#39;s not screeching you need worry about, but raucous laughter and mockery of the analogy.
How many CNN reporters have been jailed, or killed for &quot;not following orders&quot;?
I mean really, comparing a violent dictatorship to CNN is a headscratcher. 
Any CNN reporter may quit at any time with absolutely zero chance of being killed or jailed.  At best, they become an industry martyr, at worst, they sit on the unemployment line for a couple months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really tough situation to solve.</p>

<p>How do you regulate the media without having a state-sponsored media? I surely wouldn&#39;t want the Trump administration &quot;regulating&quot; the media.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that too many people put too much stock in the news and never bother to think for themselves.</p>

<p>CNN is corrupt as fuck, and so are the 5 other major news corporations in America. But the tricky part is that I believe that the agenda most of the major news companies are pushing will have a positive outcome. They&#39;re probably making up a bunch of bullshit about Trump but that doesn&#39;t discredit the fact that he&#39;s clearly unqualified for and uninterested in the job he has.</p>

<p>So how do you bring down the media conglomerates without the Trump Administration pushing their own agenda down our throats?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m left wing and cut the cord a couple of years ago, but I gave up on CNN more than a decade ago - after they killed Howard Dean&#39;s Presidential bid. I don&#39;t find the notion that management directs coverage to be at all surprising. No doubt, CNN sucks.</p>

<p>However......</p>

<p>Fox News has been doing the same for the entirity of its existence. Never once have I seen conservatives decry that.</p>

<p>I will go back to my tea now.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Kermit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But my point is CNN is pushing an agenda, at the very least for ratings, probably to get back at Trump.  At the same time, however, there are legit investigations and questions to report on.  Why did Trump&#39;s people lie, or rather &quot;forget&quot; all of their secret meetings with the Russian ambassador or whomever?  His former campaign manager has had to register as a foreign agent...  There are legitimate concerns.  </p>

<p>Russia is not the anti-corrupt anti-NWO champion so many Alex Jones viewers thinks it is.  RT can report on some interesting dirt on the US, and Putin is very cunning at poking holes in America&#39;s stances.  They are, though, insanely corrupt and oppressive themselves.  All of this shady shit with Russia with the Trump campaign certainly is troubling.</p>

<p>I agree, though, that I wish CNN had been pushing a pro-Paris Climate Accord agenda and covering how that&#39;s going to fuck the planet instead of only Russia.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people in this sub, though, reporting on Fox New&#39;s and the oil industries conspiracy to fuck alternative energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you that the coverage material isn&#39;t what it ought be.</p>

<p>In response to your comment, I&#39;d say this:</p>

<p>Even with the investigation going on. Even with the lies. Even with the corruption within the Trump administration. The fact that a news CEO is telling his reporters what they <em>must</em> cover, instead of stories that they deem newsworthy, is authoritarian propaganda pushing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they are actual publishing an opinion they don&#39;t agree with, sure, but that isn&#39;t what happened and I think you need to rewatch the video. They were directed to report on the russia story, simple as that. They weren&#39;t directed how to report or what opinions to give (that we know of, of course). The journalism that results from the directive to focus on the topic does not disqualify the actual journalism from being legitimate</p>
