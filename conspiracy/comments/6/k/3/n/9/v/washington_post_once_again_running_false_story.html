       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Those strikes came after Assadâ€™s military dropped sarin nerve agent on the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing scores of civilians and leaving hospitals overflowing with hundreds more casualties".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bullshit. The "Joint Investigative Mechanism" of the UN is still reviewing evidence from the Khan Sheikhoun incident. It is their mandate to assign blame or responsibility,
      </p>
      <p>
       They have not released any of their findings yet.

       What is "firm" evidence? Seems there's plenty of evidence pointing to Assad. What, that's not "firm" enough for you? Perhaps "firm" evidence is a direct admission by Assad himself? Perhaps posted directly through reddit with a verification pic of him holding a snoo?

       Supposedly the OPCW took samples from victims who were brought to Turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly the UK also "smuggled" samples out of Syria to reach their conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important to note that this is the intelligence that Trump received, both from French and UK intelligence sources.

       Watch for the word "hexamine". It will be getting a lot of use soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they will neglect to say is that hexamine has numerous industrial uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also of interest. Hexamine up until the UN report of the 2014 attack in Ghouta wasn't really known as an ingredient in chemical weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this date, blame has not been assigned for the Ghouta attack.

        Together with 1,3,5-trioxane, hexamethylenetetramine is a component of hexamine fuel tablets used by campers, hobbyists, the military and relief organizations for heating camping food or military rations. It burns smokelessly, has a high energy density of 30.0 megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg), does not liquify while burning, and leaves no ashes.

       The French intelligence report already ran with it. That's the report everyone is using. Not OPCWs.
      </p>
      <p>
       French analysis of the chemical compounds from the site also pointed to the presence of sarin, hexamine and diisopropyl methylphosphonate, a compound formed when sarin is synthesised. The chemicals found there essentially match the biological fingerprint of the Assad governmentâ€™s sarin manufacturing process, as the same chemicals were found in samples collected from a 2013 attack in the town of Saraqeb in Idlib, which was also linked to the regime.

       When Trump does something the CIA wants, they'll support him. He got suckered on the Syria thing, though really he just bombed an airbase and nobody dies and it was up and running again in two days. If it even really happened, that is.

       Funny how Sarin always finds its way when its connected to money from Soros/Rothschilds/Rockefeller network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sarin in Soviet Russia. Sarin in Nazi Germany (enough to kill 50,000,000 - but they used Delousing agents instead for mass killing)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sarin connected to ISIS and Al-Q operations in Libya and region. (This was uncovered before the Syria narrative took off).
      </p>
      <p>
       Something about that chemical. Also it's impossible to have been Sarin by the stated LD50 and hazardous of the agent. There were people without hazmat suits on tending to the "victims".

       Im not arguing the facts of the sarin gas attack, im arguing the validity of your argument. You are saying that because the investigation into the attack is not finalized, then wapo cant assume that assad committed the attack. And that they are fake news.

       Im not saying they are honest, they are the biggest power in the world, when they say something it becomes news. Why is that hard for you to understand?

       But you believe it, right? And that's what counts, right? But you can't back it up with any sources. So really..you're the one wasting people's time.

       Watch for the word "hexamine". It will be getting a lot of use soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they will neglect to say is that hexamine has numerous industrial uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also of interest. Hexamine up until the UN report of the 2014 attack in Ghouta wasn't really known as an ingredient in chemical weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this date, blame has not been assigned for the Ghouta attack.
