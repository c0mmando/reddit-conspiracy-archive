    <div class="md"><p>key word was &quot;honest&quot;</p>

<p>abc frames it as &quot;right winger conspiracy theory&quot;. So does newsweek. Aaaand so does BI. All of them seem to think it&#39;s a breitbart thing.</p>

<p>Which I can prove them wrong just by citing this 2014 story from liberal commentator Bill Moyers <a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/">http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not my point. News outlets used to not even mention the phrase &quot;Deep State&quot;. No platform. Sure they still call it a conspiracy theory, but it&#39;s done in a partisan sense like everything else (even deadly shootings). </p>

<p>The notion that there sits enthroned a government behind the curtain used to be a myth. The term is gaining validly and that can&#39;t be denied. </p>

<p>The point of this post is to say that like so many other things, the conspiracy community seems to be right once again through the lens of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s inherently secret, but I can engage in highly educated speculation. Patrick Kennedy is one. John McCain (senile as he may be), the H.W Bush at one point, members of high-level intelligence, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld at one point, high-ranking member(s) of AIPAC (who wield a disproportionate amount of power in our country), high-ranking members of the CFR, high-level banking officials, high-level industrialists, etc. </p>

<p>The purpose of a shadow government is their roster is not public. As JFK would said, &quot;No failure is printed. No mistake is headlined. No expenditure is questioned. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the same? Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.</p>

<p>Though it’s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice, much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book, “National Security and Double Government,” he catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability, transparency, or checks and balances of any kind. He uses the term “double government”: There’s the one we elect, and then there’s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked. Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Glennon cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added 30,000 more troops.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t.  Glennon provides the history of the national security state and locates it genesis with Truman.  He is attempting to answer the question of why are the policies of Obama and those of Bush not different. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no deep state before Bush?</p>

<p>The argument is that it grew significantly and crystallized into a new form under Bush.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Deep State&quot; is a legitimate political science term, but it has entered common parlance now thanks to conspiracy theorists and alt-right media.</p>

<p>Similar thing is happening to &quot;virtue signalling&quot;: legitimate evo-bio term but being popularized by neo-nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think... Calling something a different name isn&#39;t the same as it never existing.</p>

<p>There have always been long term people in government  and it&#39;s not necessarily bad... We don&#39;t want to change the WHOLE government every 4 years, it&#39;d be chaos</p>

<p>But we probably don&#39;t need Hoover as FBI director for 40 years either.</p>

<p>Knowledge or &quot;deep state&quot; isn&#39;t new at all, and it all depends how is being talked about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before Trump got elected, there was no need for the term &#39;deep state&#39;; it was just &#39;the government&#39;. Obama was a part of it, Bushes were a part of it, Clintons, Reagan etc. I have never head the term deep state before this year because it and the &#39;shallow state&#39; were always seen as the same thing.</p>

<p>Not though, everyone believes the Clinton&#39;s friend, Trump is an outsider. He gets elected and still adopts the government policies for the most part, so does that mean he isn&#39;t an outsider? Well, his supporters still want to believe be is, but he is the face of the government though. So the term &#39;deep state&#39; becomes popular, and it&#39;s this entity that is controlling Trump, so now people can say he is still an outsider while ignoring the fact he isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>key word was &quot;honest&quot;</p>

<p>abc frames it as &quot;right winger conspiracy theory&quot;. So does newsweek. Aaaand so does BI. All of them seem to think it&#39;s a breitbart thing.</p>

<p>Which I can prove them wrong just by citing this 2014 story from liberal commentator Bill Moyers <a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/">http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because it&#39;s suddenly dumb to state the Deep State is made up of individuals within the government. 😂</p>

<p>Do you even know the definition of bureaucracy?</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m &quot;playing dumb&quot;.....😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stood up to Wallstreet? ... nah, Goldman Sachs runs his cabinet.</p>

<p>Stopped meddling in the Middle East? ... nah, is just like every other puppet licking the feet of Israel and Saudi Arabia</p>

<p>Will fight for the common man? ... nah, he&#39;s too busy tweeting or golfing at his pay-to-play Mar-a-Lago retreat, and handing out tax cuts to billionaires</p>

<p>The jury is NOT still out on Trump being a decent human being. We all knew he was a depraved pervert before, we knew he had been on the verge of personal bankruptcy multiple times (many many multimillion business bankruptcies), so now we can confirm that he was a fucking INCOMPETENT business man who rode daddy&#39;s empire to where he is at today. </p>

<p>Is he an honest man? nah... biggest lying piece of shit to grace the White House. At least the rest sound smart when they lie. </p>
