<li><p>America isn&#39;t independent. It is a colony of Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>The Zionist lobby has infiltrated every institution of America and continue to squeeze America of all value for Greater Israel. (No pun to the innocent Jews of Israel, but the truth is the truth). It is currently using the might of the American military to assist terrorists like ISIS while the broke American taxpayer fronts the bill. </p></li>
<li><p>The media has been taken over by Zion who pushes all kinds of filth to demoralize the population. They are currently trying to normalize pedophilia. </p></li>
<li><p>Unknown entities keep dropping chemicals into the atmosphere to screw up everyone physical and mental health. Meanwhile, oceans of drugs are imported by the government to help further deteriorate the people. </p></li>
<li><p>The national debt is now 20 trillion and climbing quickly. The world debt is 217 trillion. </p></li>
<li><p>Half of the country is at least at near poverty levels thanks to the rulers artificially holding down the economy. This is shameful considering America is the richest country in the world. Meanwhile, 8 people have more money than half of the world&#39;s population combined. </p></li>
<li><p>Our own technology, resources, and information are being withheld from us so that we stay stunted in a world full of problems without answers.</p></li>
<li><p>The health care system uses old fashion, brutal techniques to treat patients while simultaneously destroying them for profit purposes. Meanwhile, the rulers murder legitimate homeopathic doctors who find extremely cheap and natural cures for the people. </p></li>
<li><p>The education department is a complete sham designed to keep people dumbed down while they feed totally fake information in history class. </p></li>
<li><p>The President&#39;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is the leader of the Illuminati. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short, they&#39;re higher beings our world leaders appease by creating suffering in our world. These creatures feed off off negativity and bad emotions. The theory is that our body is just a vessel/engine to feed these things, our souls are trapped in these bodies over and over again instead of ascending to higher consciousness.</p>

<p>The theory is much more in depth than that, but that&#39;s the gist of Archons. It kind of explains a lot of religious things and connects dots to why TPTB do what they do. Also brings in the whole theory of reptilian, Satanism, etc. Explains sub conscious stuff, why psychedelics do what they do, it&#39;s pretty interesting and eye opening if you keep an open mind on it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not fully sold on it, but it does bring an interesting perspective on things.</p>
