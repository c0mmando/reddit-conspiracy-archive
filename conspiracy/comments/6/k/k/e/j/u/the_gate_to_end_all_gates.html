       Search: Stratfor clinton foundation furniture pizza cheese walnuts wedding books dog pillows (possibly beer?) (and probably a lot more code, just look for repeating patterns that seem out of place)
      </p>
      <p>
       cards = access to CP/children/women/etc. -&gt; blackmail
furniture = arms
wedding = assassination?
dog = ?
books = ?
The other code words you know.

       This is what FBIAnon was talking about. We know HRC struck deals with foreign governments for favors. According to FBIAnon, these favors included intel, guns, and people. He said to look out for cards. They're credit cards, with which you can donate to the foundation in return for the "favors". It happened, and probably still happens on a massive scale. We can't let them get away with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Look for more in the Wikileaks files, it's all there, believe me. Think tip of the iceberg. Think big picture. This is what FBIAnon was talking about, this has the potential to bring down many powerful people in many countries, as well as some governments as a whole, I imagine. Go watch black mirror, especially season 3, episode 3. Look for the card lists stratfort made, make backups, just in case. You'll find many email addresses, but remember - they're just people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: I have to go to work now, after a sleepless night. Hope to be back soon. Be good. Believe. Peace.

       The post I wanted to reply to just got deleted, so I'm writing you. We have to be quick getting this out there. It corroborates everything FBIAnon said, and I always knew deep in my heart he was speaking the truth. They are gonna try and bury this. I don't give two shits about karma on reddit, copypaste the whole thing and post it as your own. They're shilling/botting hard on this, but if enough people post it, they are fucked.

       This was my first attempt, after getting banned from 4chan for using a Proxy/VPN, which I don't have. This is real. You have to believe me. I tried calling the FBI major case unit, but thenumber is not available, at least not for me.

       Well fuck me, but unless I see the headline "U.S. government sells child sex slaves and illegal arms with help of intelligence agencies and military" I don't think this story is quite dead yet. Remember FBIAnon. He wanted us to find it and spread it, because they couldn't due to immense political and internal pressure. If enough people called their congressman, the news, their mom and their mail man about this, then they can act. They need all eyes on this an dpublic pressure to reach critical mass. Wouldn't this be perfect for independence day? We know the FBI has enough intel to bring the whole circus down. I think it's time we helped them.

       Please, do. If I was in the U.S., I would go to the nearest F.B.I. building, bring a bunch of people with me, and show them the files. I think they (or at least many of them) are good guys in this scenario.

       I've noticed weird internet/PC slowdowns during the last few weeks. Sometimes my upload speed is virtually non-existent. My brand new phone now has an interference noise most of the time that it didn't have before. Often messages sent via FB/Whatsapp take upwards of ten minutes to reach my friends, although I can see we're both online and internet is working normally. I'm not saying it's a fact, but it's quite probable assuming these people are actually doing their jobs.

       I'm not being casual, I'm pretty sure I'm being monitored, but I'm not in the U.S., so they can't suicide me that easily. As soon as I knew what I was looking at, I tried to get it out to as many people as I could, but panic never helps. I tried calling the FBI, but it wouldn't put me through, not even after calling directory assistance. I'm not kidding. This is as real as it gets.

       Sorry, my bad. I'm still a bit on edge... FbIAnon said to dig in the files, that all the evidence was there. The Stratfor-Clinton-you donate-we deliver children/guns-link is new, afaik. These aren't the only files, btw, there are
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       . Don't take my word for it, though, go look for yourself.

       Fine, go digging in the files yourself then. I'm saying it ends there. I'm saying this is the key to finding the files that actually matter and how to read them. FBIAnon always said, all we needed was in the files, but that it would be coded. Now we know the code and where exactly to look. If you want sth. new, go look at Austin's Pizza's link to stratfor. Look at Ahold. This is the real rabbit hole and it goes
       <em>
        deep
       </em>
       . I know it's not aliens, only people. Real people, real children. Hell, I'm not even American, but we should all be mad about this, because this network is so vast even I couldn't believe it at first.

       Have you read everything that FBIAnon said? Studied it carefully? If not, do so, then look at the files again and start digging for more. Imagine a network so massive it boggles the mind. Like that scene in the Wire, when the FBI agent can't find the drugs in the shipping container until he realizes it's all drugs. Think in terms of a network that would put Gustavo Fring's one to shame. We know the symbols they like to use. We know they have they're people in all the places that matter. How do move product in these kinds of quantities? You make it seem legit. Search the stratfor leaks with the filters I've mentioned. You'll see it. The question is, will you be able to believe it?

       Apparently you have to first believe in a giant, worldwide, all-controlling pedophilia cult. Then, when you see there's no evidence of such a cult, you'll understand it's only because the cult is so powerful.

       And the one FBI agent brave enough to tell anyone about it only tells one internet forum about it because
       <em>
        only they

       can save humanity from the evil pedophile cult.  They're literal superheroes.

       I think you need to be a little more objective about it. The Podesta emails were weird as fuck and give me the creeps. But that second email is pretty normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first email might be something or might not. We would need to see the website to evaluate. Do you know what website they were testing? That would be better info than the second email.

       If you try convincing people with the stuff you posted here, they won't believe you. Even if you are totally convinced, you need to think of it from the average persons perspective if you want to convince others.

       It's also the word for things like chairs and desks and beds that you often have to transport when moving, and maybe pizza and fried chicken is code for something, but offering pizza and beer is pretty much the standard payment plan when helping a friend move.

       I've noticed weird internet/PC slowdowns during the last few weeks. Sometimes my upload speed is virtually non-existent. My brand new phone now has an interference noise most of the time that it didn't have before. Often messages sent via FB/Whatsapp take upwards of ten minutes to reach my friends, although I can see we're both online and internet is working normally. I'm not saying it's a fact, but it's quite probable assuming these people are actually doing their jobs.
