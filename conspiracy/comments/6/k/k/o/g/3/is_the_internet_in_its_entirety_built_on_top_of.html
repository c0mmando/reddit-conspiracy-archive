       Who gave us the internet and who populated it with information that many of the conspiracies discussed here within originated from?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we get technology as part of a slow release program, I have deduced that the internet was given to us in order to expand the rate of control and growth of the banker concentrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, the struggle this far has been on the back of a system by them for them and we are hijacking it to release truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we playing a game that there is already an ending for in terms of digital truth?

       We could lose everything written and never even realize as a critical mass.

       with roads, everyone can see who's on them and generally, what they're carrying.  that's not a chain.  that's a design reality.  that's what would happen even if you decided you wanted to make internet 2.0.  what you're really complaining about is the willful compliance in using tech that sits
       <em>
        on top
       </em>
       of the road, and that's designed to co-opt behaviour.  totes different subject than the subject of the road itself.

       You claim it is saving us but it was given TO us.  The internet itself is a catch 22.  They developed it to speed up profit gain but risk connectivity of the worker class.  Now they use it to bide time by spreading misinformation and breeding useful idiots that don't think critically about the very thing that is being used to train them.

       the internet is literally a road for information to flow on.  look up on how it's designed.  but even if you don't do that, know this - all signals vibrate.  those vibrations can be picked up by external listeners, as they are
       <em>
        broadcasts
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       roads are good.  where you have shitty roads (slow or narrow) you have poverty.  roads are arteries of information, ultimately.  absent the bandwidth, information isn't exchanged and common benefits aren't realized.  there's a direct correlation between road quality and wealth (excluding those areas where the elite congregate in part because the roads are shite).  it makes sense.  the less you exchange the less you learn.

       Did the technology emerge organically or was it rolled out by some authority?

       I remember the modem "chat boards" in the 80's. phone in the rubber cups dial in and you were typing with other people.  lots of stuff on there then.  it was all hackers then. IP addresses were a big thing.  that was a game changing technology.  it was very decentralized but you has the phone company as your defacto partner.

       Hi still see the potential for an over arcing figure of control and manipulation.

       Then it was the aarpanet. or whatever else.  i remember a couple vaugely. i was off tech from 87-93. thats when cern came up with the basic internet protocols. 2 computers with a network cable is a mini internet.  each a server.  still very early. lots of hacking build your own stuff. that was the years apple ibm and microsoft started suing each other.  i didnt experience the internet until 96.

       YES! It was exciting to see them developing it.  The universities and colleges had the internet right away. they were the major testers. It wasn't until the browser cam along that it really kicked off. HTML made the internet a visual medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its still hella good for scientific communication and collaboration.  its the backbone to many important societal functions now.

       That euphoria is the magic of technology winning over an entire generation.

       My point was that could have been what they were selling it as while the real purposes remained nefarious.

       I know it's kind of a strawman example but look at how the law is set up to make us think it protects us but it really creates new polls for the wealthy criminals and sets up a form of taxation on the lower classes that get caught up.

       The pure coincidence of cern creating the internet gives me a bad feeling that I'm onto at least something with my line of thinking despite the seeming innocence and naturalness of the internet.
      </p>

       It's a tool to the elite and like freedom of speech they cannot stop us from saying anything, but they can now collect it and use it.

       I'd love the internet to be idealistic but almost every other topic where money is to be made is subverted.  I think it's time we question the validity of what we're banking on so much.

       in 96 it was a network without content.  everything you read was suspect.  companies were still kicking you out of their offices for pitching them web design and development in 95-99 and telling you the internet was a fad.

       anyone can post anything and seem like an authority on anything.  that is simply not true. in this phase of tech dev.  its safe to say... the internet is comprimised. largely by greed and mismanagement. everyone wants money for nothing. flip side is the functional uses and benefits outweigh the asshattery of the Military Industrial Complex.  Office for Information Awareness.... lol. still cant figure out what to do with all that data. why dont you get some more harddrives. that always kinda works. where do you think big marketing gets their "real" demographic data from? Government selling back to businesses with fronted companies providing 'media awareness'.  wheeeee. its all a big cluster hump.
