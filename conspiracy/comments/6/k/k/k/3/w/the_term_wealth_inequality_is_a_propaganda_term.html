<p>So what is the incentive to create new innovations? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that instead of working for money, we will all be focused on improving planetary wealth so that we can all enjoy it together. Our lives would be more or less similar in that I can easily get a cup of free coffee from Startbucks as you can but this impossible unless we work. Right now, 30% of Americans don&#39;t work because its not worth it at a shitty $8 per hour. In the new system, the sole purpose of work is to make life pleasant for us all. Instead of $8 per hour, we are working for the purpose of free consumption. All that is asked out of us is 5 hours of work/5 days a week at a job of our choosing. Some people ask who will pick up the trash or do tough jobs. The answer is either robot workers, people who volunteer for these honorable jobs, or people we find using employee finding companies. The new innovations would be made by people who are looking to improve planetary wealth and possible make a name for themselves. We all want to live lavishly and we can make this happen if we are free to maneuver. Right now, nobody can do shit because it costs so much to get a project going. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>To improve their own quality of life and the rest of our lives too. Also, some people want to make a name for themselves. If someone invents a self-driving car, his name would become famous. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the punishment for people who create their own currency and begin to use that as will inevitably happen? How will you enforce that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our entire court system has to be upgraded. Random civilian juries need to be formed and unformed at anytime. These juries would decide if something is worth going to court over, would decide guilt, and they would decide the &quot;punishment&quot; if the culprit was found guilty. Punishment would entirely be replaced with rehabilitation which is a combination of education and love. We can have inpatient and outpatient rehab centers that can be inspected by anyone at anytime. Juries decide how much rehab is needed. A person who goes around burning building down may be deemed insane need inpatient educational programs to show them how burning down buildings leads to more pain and suffering. Beliefs cause behavior. Invalid beliefs lead to disturbing behavior. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We would use a caretaker program. If you are using something, its yours. If you are done with it, you have to give it away. If a douchebag ends up hoaring a 50 year supply of resources in some underground bunker, the civilian population would be responsible for telling him what the rules are. If he continues to hoard, civilians would recommend a court case. A jury would decide if the case is worth it. Jury would decide the verdict and the kind of rehabilitation that is needed. </p>

<p>So how do we know how many people should be working at Starbucks and how many should be working at the fire station? In the free market, price determines how many baristas and fire fighters can be employed at a given time.</p>

<p>Central planning actually requires more work and therefore costs more.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Robot workers’ and ‘employee finding companies’ would not even exist without the incentive of the free market. For example, what do you do when nobody volunteers to work for an ‘employee finding company’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, nobody can do shit because it costs so much to get a project going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, because of government regulation. For instance, it is illegal to open a homemade lemonade stand almost anywhere in the United States. The amount of regulations makes it prohibitively expensive for a young child to simply covert lemon, sugar and water into a product which is then sold to the public. </p>

<p>Regarding minimum wage: Take a young man with no work experience who is 17 years old. A Gas station owner wishes to hire him to fill gas at his station but the station makes little money and the man can afford only $5/hour + tips. The boy wants to take the job and build some experience. Maybe one day be promoted to cashier or whatever. Then you step in and say ’No, $8 dollars and hour is not enough.’ You pass a law so that no one can work for less that $8/hour. Now the owner and the boy are shit out of luck.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do you do if random civilians don’t volunteer and don’t participate?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A few way. Right off the bat, people will be encouraged to follow their passion. Once all the people pick jobs, we will post all &quot;job openings&quot; online. For example, my pipe forging business needs a few more people so I will post an ad online (maybe on craigslist). People will be changing jobs all the time when they get bored so someone on craigslist will see my ad and give me a call. If I can&#39;t find anyone, I can enlist the help of employee finding companies who can use commercials to help me find more employees. We will all figure it out. The whole purpose is to man all the stations so that society can keep running smoothly. If we fail, then all of our quality of life goes down. Those painful experiences will be very enlightening to the people. Eventually, we will make sure to keep all stations full.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is impossible when we have spokesman education the population on how the new system works. We need regular commercials that teach the population how things work and why it is in our best interest to cooperate. Once the people see how the &quot;cause and effect&quot; system works, they will happily participate outside of a few bad apples. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you do if random civilians don’t volunteer and don’t participate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only handicapped or old people or students are allowed to not work. If the douchebags refuse to participate, they go to court and see a jury. If the man is found guilty of not doing his 5 hours a day (which is nothing compared to 8 hours a day at jobs we hate), then he has to go to outpatient rehabilitation centers. If that fails, the guy goes to inpatient rehab. Also, when people make purchases, they use their drivers license. Simply swipe it and get whatever you want. The point of swiping is so that the cashier can see that you are participating in some job. If you don&#39;t work, the cashier will not be allowed to give you anything and therefore, you cannot consume so life becomes harder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How will you enforce this reeducation camp on people who resist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, people are allowed to consume by swiping a drivers license so others can see that they are participating with work. If a jury finds someone guilty, they can shut down their ability to consume until he finds a job. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who will decide what the invalid beliefs are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The jury using common sense. A man can be taken to court but the jury has to decide if the court will proceed or if the case is dropped. The jury, using common sense, will see that most everyone is working but some guy wants to consume without working. Random juries form and deform. We don&#39;t want any specific person holding all the power. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you point to a single country that has implemented anything like this???</p>

<p>None. We would be the first ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are a few examples of what&#39;s what&#39;s been stolen from me in the UK. What comes to mind first are all the industries and public services which used to be nationally owned, which I once had a democratic say in the management of (however poorly that principle was realised in practice). They&#39;re now owned by plutocrats who pay themselves multi-million salaries. On a larger scale, you don&#39;t have to go far back in history to realise that common land was once far more extensive than it is today, until it was enclosed by elites. Jumping forward in time, billions of pounds of tax money in 2008 and 2009 were taken from public investment and used to cover the mistakes of bankers. And finally, in a more traditional Marxist sense, my surplus labour is taken from me every day to ensure that the bosses who run the company I work for can continue to increase wage disparities over those beneath them.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of what&#39;s what&#39;s been stolen from me in the UK. What comes to mind first are all the industries and public services which used to be nationally owned, which I once had a democratic say in the management of (however poorly that principle was realised in practice). They&#39;re now owned by plutocrats who pay themselves multi-million salaries. On a larger scale, you don&#39;t have to go far back in history to realise that common land was once far more extensive than it is today, until it was enclosed by elites. Jumping forward in time, billions of pounds of tax money in 2008 and 2009 were taken from public investment and used to cover the mistakes of bankers. And finally, in a more traditional Marxist sense, my surplus labour is taken from me every day to ensure that the bosses who run the company I work for can continue to increase wage disparities over those beneath them.</p>

<p>Inequalities aren&#39;t the byproduct, they are intrinsic to capitalism itself. Without needing what we don&#39;t have, there would be no need for exchange. The problem is that many of these needs are manufactured by capitalists themselves, or the politicians that work in their service. Moreover, the forces of production are now developed to such an extent that we could eliminate such needs - witness the tonnes of food produces that goes to waste every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love the quip.  But monopolism =/= capitalism.</p>

<p>For example, we had a massive debate in the U.S. over whether or not to allow corporations to exist in the first place.  The clinching argument was the Panama Canal: corporations enabled large works for the public good that would never have been feasible for individual investors to accomplish.  So corporations were given licenses - &#39;charters&#39; - to exist if and only if they served the public good... and certainly never transgressed against it.  The government agreed to yank these charters when and where corporations were not serving, or indeed violating - the public good.</p>

<p>Today we have our news provided by five or so corporations, personnel shifting back and forth between corporate and federal positions, banks performing fraudulent and &#39;nonjudicial foreclosures&#39; nationwide and multi-billion dollar kickbacks in the form of lobbying and we&#39;re told, &#39;We don&#39;t revoke corporate charters anymore.&#39; Doubtless they don&#39;t, but they agreed to.  And the People haven&#39;t been holding the state to their agreement.</p>

<p>So please don&#39;t make the mistake of conflating the corporate syndicates we have today with capitalism.  Capitalism if it&#39;s to mean anything must be restrained by law, which means government, which means the People must uphold their own laws.  Not to do so isn&#39;t a problem with capitalism or any other -ism.  It&#39;s just that corporate marauding is but one form of lawlessness and usurpation the People have been actively and passively enabling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preaching to the choir in my case, but preach away - people need to know this shit. </p>

<p>I would say that the inherent nature of capitalism - exploitation of workers by discounting the value of their labor and reselling at market value to create profit for the ownership class - inevitably leads to an unavoidable end game: one entity. Not government, not corporate, but everything. Money in politics is expected. Corruption is expected. Breaking of social contracts is expected. Every opportunity to increase the delta between the minimum value for which people will work and the maximum it can be resold will be taken. Shareholder value. Economy of scale. Lower costs. Even slavery and environmental destruction become an economic question instead of a moral one. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a system created by and for the benefit of an elite class of sociopaths, and the sheer disregard for humanity is evident throughout. </p>

That&#39;s why <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Paris-The_Secret_History_of_Jesuits_1975.pdf">they&#39;ve been the ones pulling the corporations together</a>.  Business with a purpose, the state and corporations all in &#39;unity&#39; together.</p>

<p>Corporations can work, but they have to be stringently watched like a hawk by the People.  Which is no problem, you simply bring on a new form of media and plenty of recreational substances until their scenario is so distracted from living in a carnival that they can&#39;t pay attention.  Result: This.  It looks like the distraction techniques, along with this influence building and consolidation mechanism on their part, worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money has no inherent value. Take out a dollar bill and look at it and realize it has no real value that isn&#39;t imaginary. It&#39;s a slip of inked paper. Money has the value we give it.</p>

<p>In capitalism the capitalist must exploit the worker in order to make a profit. Which means the capitalist must pay the worker less than the value the worker generates. This exploitation quickly leads to inequality, especially when the capitalist uses the profit from the exploitation and bribes politicians to inact laws which favor them over said workers. It becomes a modern day owner-slave mentality.</p>

<p>Republicans can&#39;t grasp this. It always devolves into &quot;Murica!&quot; and &quot;Commie!&quot; and every other stupid thing they parrot from their parents. It always goes into irrationality.</p>

<p>Socialism is, for example, says that there are 18.5 million empty homes in America and close to a million homeless on a average week in America so let&#39;s house these people. We as humanity have the resources for no one to ever suffer and struggle and go without. Republicans respond with &quot;But they haven&#39;t sold vast swaths of their short lives to earn these slips of paper with imaginary value! We don&#39;t give handouts!&quot;</p>
