       Yup. They died because they ate up all the food thanks to bodies about the size of 40,000 pounds. They also had a small brain (less than 1 pound) so they were too stupid to find a solution.

       There is weird information surrounding dinosaurs and when looked at makes me very skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to that the merchandising of dinosaurs to children specifically and it just feels force fed and fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all aside from loving them growing up and never questioning the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all of science, the bullshitometer is pretty high when it comes to dinosaurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can laugh all they want.  It's just a sign that they haven't calmly looked into reasons to contradict their own beliefs.  If they had, they'd understand the argument and help the person to reason because they understand the journey.

       Mocking is dismissal and a symptom of ignorance.  Who cares? The one with the knowledge is busy thinking about better things anyways.

       Dinosaurs were discovered way before anyone created dinosaur merchandise aimed at kids.

       Aiming it at kids uses NOSTALGIA to create cognitive dissonance at skepticism of the narrative.

       And to add; with such a debate surrounding carbon dating, I don't consider it infallible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disregarding any information that you or anyone has pro-dinosaur.  That is the problem with debating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am fully aware of that information and then competing information that makes me realize that dinosaurs are a red flag indicator in a history that contains lots of them.

      <p>
       I am simply softening the hard stance against thinking about looking at more facts that people have researched based on threads that build into more.

       i don't understand why you think there is much profit from the education sector. certainly people make a living but no one is raking in the cash. they're not oil companies or churches who are raking in the cash using subversive information.

       that doesn't make any sense. what are you trying to say?

      <p>
       the sciences are a traditional part of academics and have a history of being knowledge for the sake of knowledge. if you disagree with that premise then what knowledge is sacred then? are all academics part of a conspiracy to control people? are all scientists in on it? i was kind of joking with you because that's the only reaction i can have to someone claiming the sciences are false because people make a living through them.

       i know enough biology to understand evolution and why it's canon. i don't subscribe to the idea that the earth is shrinking or is flat, nor that hundreds of thousands of scientists are in on a conspiracy of some sort. scientists are neither organized or powerful or motivated to conspire.

       I don't think that's obvious at all. It certainly wasn't obvious for Darwin who was already independently wealthy, or Einstein who never profited from his ideas to the extent others did. Jay Gould and the other modern biologists make a living but they're not worshiped and they're not rich. Name me the ten most influential biologists of the last 100 years. Exactly. I've heard those arguments before, from Christian fundamentalists actually, and it's a preposterous hypothesis. The science is built on the shoulders of others and is carried and improved upon by the nameless, un-monied masses; not by the rich and famous, or powerful and unscrupulous. it's not religion because it's not dogma. The entire point of science is to test hypotheses, old and new. If something becomes canon, it's because theories have passed rigorous tests, but you know this already. I don't even know why I'd bother with someone's ideas that somehow all peer reviews, etc, are part of a mass, global conspiracy.

       The problem is that for every information "they cite," there are thousands more independent, non-funded publications going the other direction, and if it's a pure numbers game, then the canon are the most peer confirmed.

       But scientists are made up of students, mostly. They're the vanguards of the process. And they exist without money and with a strong sense of ethics. They
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       in doing what is right and what is truth, scientific fact. They have no other motive than academic rigor. That's why it's very difficult to believe that establishment science is deliberately wrong; one would have to fool millions of people, and millions of people are not easily fooled, or "in on it."

       Yes, about the only ones who don't are hardcore religious people.

       They have their own angle on it which is a conspiracy theory in and of itself (why ignore evidence? To control people?).

       Cool? So, why not? Why should I believe Academia? They are known to be liars.. The Sphinx is most likely 15-30,000 years old based on geological evidence. Why would I believe the same people agreeing that dinosaurs are x,y, or z, while saying the Sphinx is ~4,500 years old?

       Why not? Both sciences date people to x time, based on "evidence". It's one in the same. Evolution is a myth. Now, explain to me how an advanced civilization ~10-30,000 years ago built the Sphinx, and how that fits in? Hint, it does not... Hence why they say the Sphinx is ~4,500 years old. Fits their controlled theory of evolution...

       It's what I believe not trying to state this as fact.  There are articles and findings all the time about

       </a>
       Just saying at some point maybe they are gonna be like oh yeah maybe humans were around for dinosaurs.  Maybe not like T-Rex roaming around eating everything dinosaurs but I think it stands to reason that if Crocodiles, Alligators, some lizards, and insects could have survived the the Jurassic period maybe other dinosaurs lived longer than scientists believe and maybe humans are older than they know right now.

       They would have to fake all those fossils, and then they'd have to pay off all the scientists who's work revolves around it..and dinosaur finding isn't exactly a government agency like NASA, so it would be much harder to coverup and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's hardest for me is, so you had evolution plus a multitude of years and got the Jurassic periods (not entirely sure what you'd call it) and then you had a great extinction, and then it all restarted? Why didn't we see the rise of dinosaurs again? Why did evolution take a different turn of events..granted I don't know much on evolution and generally just spit ball ideas before speaking so please be gentle.

       Create  a construct, teach people to work in that construct, and profit... Lower level scientists are none the wiser. Think of it like a video game, do the AI in the video game know about hacking the physics? No.. All they know is all they know... Dinosaurs never recreated because the Earth was smaller back then, less gravity (same with giants). We are expanding now, hence smaller organisms. I postulate that the earth grows and contracts, which cause various near ELE events.. Great Deluge would be a great example...

       Even further than that you'd need an International Agency to pull off something like that. Dinosaur fossils are found all over the world, it'd be practically impossible to create this a few hundred years ago and keep it going until today all across the world.

       Evolution is random. It's not just nature trying to get from point A to point B. It's possible that whatever made them go extinct just made it impossible for them to ever come back.

       Our ancestors had a chance to evolve while the Dino's ruled...tiny rodent like creatures, the first mammals. When they died off, then mammals fills the void left behind by the previous dominant group of animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the air had more carbon in it, so the animals were able to grow to be much larger. Insects and plants included.

       Expanding earth could explain it, same with giants. according to the current theories, no.. they could not of existed, unless the earth was smaller back then. If it was, which I think it was, then yes, they existed, imo.

       Even among my most hardcore religious friends, dinosaurs are a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       My one friend's parents believe that the world is only 10000 years old tops, that humans once lived to be 300 years old before the flood and that dinosaurs and humans lived together until they started getting to bloodthirsty, at which point God smote them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can personally believe a few dinos managed to survive whatever cataclysm killed their kind and would eventually spawn stories of dragons in Asia and medieval Europe. I'm not even going to say that there aren't a few rare stragglers hiding some place man has yet to conquer, but until we find some definitive proof of it, I refuse to believe Adam was playing the role of Fred Flintstone.

       Do what 19th century geologists did. Find a river cut - a place where a river has deeply eroded the earth. At the surface you will find bones of creatures that live on the planet today. Move deeper down the cut (back in time). The bones you find will be of creatures that do not live on our planet today. As you go deeper, the evolution of different species is revealed.  Usually, but not always, a species becomes more complex as it evolves.  Then, something happens in it's environment and poof, all gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not difficult to do yourself, some occult science or a rich man's trick.  The obvious answer is evolution and the extinction of millions of species.

       Sometimes I have to wonder if the "fossils are fake" crowd just never goes outside.  Like, when I was a kid my grandmother's property had a little stream and the rock it was flowing on was brittle and littered with fossils.

       Of course. The no-dinosaurs brigade are just desperately trying to reconcile their mythical religious beliefs with hard science..... which says they are delusional. I have been to London's Natural History Museum. It's awesome, and to suggest that it's fake is the depth of ignorance.

       And to add; with such a debate surrounding carbon dating, I don't consider it infallible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disregarding any information that you or anyone has pro-dinosaur.  That is the problem with debating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am fully aware of that information and then competing information that makes me realize that dinosaurs are a red flag indicator in a history that contains lots of them.

       I am simply softening the hard stance against thinking about looking at more facts that people have researched based on threads that build into more.
