       I'm a relatively new user to reddit.  I signed up because I was impressed by the depth of thought and sincerity many users commit to their posts on this board (r/conspiracy).  I'm very interested in conspiracies and conspiracy theorists so I couldn't help but participate after awhile.  I think this board is one of the best communities in regards to free thinking I have seen on the internet.  Despite all of this, I have to keep asking myself: why is the board so susceptible to political marketing campaigns, political propaganda, and the like?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think often about social media and its impact on our society.  I feel strongly that nearly all of them undermine our lives and our understanding of one another.  I have never submitted any personal information or participated in the social networks being developed by the people at facebook, twitter, myspace, etc.  I compromised and joined reddit for the reasons I mentioned before.  But reddit is far from acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many users talk about shilling and bots, and other subversive campaigns which disengenuously alter the perceptions of readers of this board, often without proof.   And in fact, accusing others of being a 'shill' has essentially become a mundane form of an ad hominem.  There is no doubt that 'shills' exist, and that 'shilling' occurs, but no one even expects the accusation of being a shill to amount to anything, because it has been overused to the point of meaninglessness and rarely does anyone bother to back it up.  Compare this to the accusation that one has 'doxxed' another.  Being a 'doxxer' is so serious that the moderators of this board took the extraordinary action to block links to a mainstream news organization because they felt like that organization had 'doxxed' a reddit user.  And 'doxxing' people IS reprehensible -- its an act designed to intimidate people and suppress ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does a milque-toast post on this board about net-neutrality, with no original content,  have over 13k up-votes, while the next highest has around 200 (noted at around 10:30pm EST 7/13/2017), right under a pinned post about the banishment of CNN links due to doxxing?  Well, no doubt it has something to do with the expensive mass advertising campaign waged simultaneously today by many tech companies.  Some people may be content with that explanation.  For the others, read on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why this phenomenon exists, is because reddit is a social media platform designed to suppress radical thought, to confuse, and to alienate.  I am no longer talking about the immense power wielded by the telecommunications cartel in the US, or the emerging tech giants in silicon valley.  This has nothing to do with the specifics of net neutrality.  I'm just talking about the medium you and I are both using to communicate, right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the design of reddit... It's very easy to design an information system which ranks information quantitatively.  However, computers are very bad at interpretting information qualitatively.  The 'novel' idea behind reddit is that posts have a number associated with them, which the information system regards as nearly synonymous with the quality of the post.  Hence the highest-voted posts are exposed to more and more people, and since the idea in the post has already proven palatable to many users (that's why it has a high rating), it continues to garner a higher and higher rating.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's enticing to be able to design a system which is able to promote popular ideas, and expose itself to more and more users.  This is the design principle behind reddit, and the reasoning behind its survivability as a social media platform.  The 'up-vote' mechanism, the primary mechanism which decides user/idea exposure, is a mechanism totally agnostic of critical and qualatitive thought.  Instead, the way ideas are spread though information systems like this is controlled centrally, while at once presenting the user with the illusion of participation and democratic control -- the vote.  The american government works similiarly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the up-voting mechanism conceals the actions of bots and other inhumane campaigns to promote certain ideas.  There is a reason why scientific journals have never adopted this practice of "popular promotion" and instead have preferred the critical insight of experts in the subject matter to decide what is published in their journals.  The reason is obvious -- an opaque popular vote isn't how you identify what is true about reality.  Yet for some reason, you and I are expected to believe that the number of likes or up votes something has is an adequate representation of that idea's value in our lives.  We are expected to put aside our expectations about valuable inquiry and discussion.  And though we should rightfully be concerned with the possible tyranny of supposed 'experts' in deciding what is published on our board, please imagine the possibilities.  What if there was a community of individuals, dedicated to true understanding, to fighting tyrrany, to freedom, and respect, where you couldn't suppress an idea through shear money and numbers alone?  It isn't just wishful thinking.

       If you are reading this post, it's because you had the good sense to read by the date of the posting (and the patience to tolerate my writing).  Either that, or you have gone so far into the depths of the site, that you are like me on a sleepness night.  I took the time to write all of this for you.  I think this is important, and true.  Maybe you think I'm stupid and wrong.  The point is, I'm trying to tell you what I think, and you're reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading.   Even if you disagree, you and I comprise the type of free-thinking community I was dreaming about before.  Despite the design of this website, and all the other social media which dominate our lives and relationships, we can liberate our minds from these technological systems.  To do that we must engage one another fully, critically, and sincerely - not through up votes or retweets, but in our hearts and minds.
