       Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
       <em>
        Please note that this post will be a part of a series that I am going to post here over the next week or so. These posts are a collection of notes that I have been taking on criminal activity within the Trump Organisation and those in the upper echelons of the Trump campaign. I started taking these during the election, without any idea that Trump was going to be president. Now that I am finally starting to see a true interest of Trump related conspiracies, I feel my notes should now be public.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been well known now that Donald Trump for decades has issues pulling his self-managed real estate projects and casino ventures out of debt and into a profitable business. Because of this, he has seen several bankruptcies in companies that he owns and operates. Because of these bankruptcies, it has been extremely difficult for Trump to get loans for development projects, where virtually no Western banks have given him loans recently, except for a German based bank, Deutsche Bank, which has it's own problems internally with money laundering with Russia. This intro will tie into a separate post that I will make about more recent money laundering activities, including Russian money laundering and Azeri money laundering tied to the Iranian Revolutionary guard. I feel that I should make them into a seperate post because those incidents are more likely to wind up in Mueller's probe.

      <h1>
       Italian Mafia Money Laundering in Atlantic City and in New York City
      </h1>
      <p>
       As you already know, Trump's casinos in Atlantic City were haemorrhaging money in the 90's. Now whether this was by design may be part of the overall conspiracy, as in many money laundering cases, real estate projects that are under water are usual targets for money laundering. Whether Trump purposefully coordinated these projects in aim to launder money is a plausible theory.
      </p>
      <h3>
       New York City
      </h3>
      <p>
       As Trump started construction on these Atlantic City casinos in the late 80's he had already had several deep connections to the Italian mafia. Prior to even buying properties in the area, he had developed a close relationship with a prominent lawyer named Roy Cohn, whom he saw as a key mentor in his early life,
       <a href="http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160901184027-donald-trump-roy-cohn-file-super-169.jpg">
        both seen here
       </a>
       . Roy Cohn was famous for his ruthless work for Senator Joe McCarthy during the infamous McCarthy trials. Cohn first met Trump during the Trump Organization's legal battle with the Justice Department over a housing discrimination case in their New York properties. After they met, Cohn represented that case, using attack-dog tactics, accusing the Jewish prosecutor of using Gestapo and storm trooper like tactics, and coutersuing the department for $100 million,

       </a>
       . The countersuit was thrown out, and the original case was settled, but with no admission of guilt,
       <a href="https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15342">
        source
       </a>
       .  Aside from his work for the Senator and Trump, Cohn went on to work as council for “Fat Tony” Salerno (head of Genovese crime family) and Paul Castellano (head of Gambino crime family),
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910">
        source
       </a>
       . Trump's close relationship with Cohn and having him as council for the Trump Organization led him to connect with both crime families.

      </p>
      <p>
       During the construction of the Trump Tower and Trump Plaza in New York City, Trump hired a firm called S&amp;A Concrete that was jointly owned by several members of the Genovese crime family,
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/politics/trump-archive/docs/dge-report-apr-7-1987-trump-plaza-renewal.pdf">
        source: see p.58
       </a>
       and was named in a federal indictment. While building Trump Tower, Trump famously hired hundreds of undocumented Polish workers that did not follow proper construction regulations and were paid between $4 and $5 an hour. They worked alongside Local 95 union workers,
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/nyregion/after-15-years-in-court-workers-lawsuit-against-trump-faces-yet-another-delay.html?pagewanted=all">
        source
       </a>
       . During the process, there were no union disputes or strikes, even during a city wide construction labour strike. The lack of labour disputes from Local 95, especially since the union worked alongside undocumented and underpaid workers, follows the labor racketeering in the RICO cause filed in 1984 against the top brass of the Local 95 in a separate dispute,

        source
       </a>
       . Although Local 95 never had labor disputes, the undocumented polish workers did file wage disputed years later.

      <h3>
       Atlantic City
      </h3>
      <p>
       Trump's mob activities in Atlantic City start with the acquirement of land to develop casinos on. For the land which was to become the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump paid $1 million for a lot that was originally purchased for $200,000 years before,
       <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GSXHR8ZL1HQ2dldWk4MVA5UG8/view">
        source
       </a>
       . Trump bought the land from Salvadore Testa and Frank Narducci Jr, who were hit men for the Atlantic City mob boss Nicky Scarfo. Other properties in Atlantic City were also purchased from Scarfo affiliates. Several properties were initially leased, then purchased from Daniel Sullivan(labor fixer) and Ken Shapiro(Scarfo investment banker),

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not only Italian mob connections that Trump made while in Jersey. The Taj Mahal's VP for foreign marketing (Danny Leung) was a member of the 14k Triad gang. While employed at Taj Mahal and Trump Castle, Leung would give out free hotel rooms to triad members, most likely enticing them to gamble/launder their money through the casino. The Taj Mahal and Trump Castle employed several Asian organised crime members (Raymond Miu, Peter Chan), all tied to entertainment and promotions at the two casinos,

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than Triad members and Scarfo family members, Trump used one particular Gambino family connection to launder money while in the city. Trump had a tight relationship with Jon Gotti's horse groomer, Robert Libutti. Libutti's mob ties were well known to the New Jersey Gaming Comission at the time and he was banned from gambling within the state. To get around the ban, Trump would give physical gifts to Robert Libutti. Over a period of time, Trump gifted several high end cars and watches to Libutti, as well as bringing him ringside to WWE events. As a result of Libutti's gambling activities, the Plaza was fined $450,000, as well as an additional $200,000 for catering to sexist and racist demands of Libutti,

       Decades after Trump's casinos went bankrupt and were ultimately shut down or the mortgages were bailed out by current presidential adviser

        Carl Icahn
       </a>
       , Trump's Taj Mahal casino was fined $10 million for all of the money laundering activities that occurred over it's lifetime,
       <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/news_release/20150306.pdf">
        source
       </a>
       . If you notice in the release, the agency that gave out this fine is FinCEN, which is the agency that just handed over 2000 documents to the Senate intel committee on financial crimes or suspicions that Trump/Trump associates may have committed. It would be really surprising if these activities were not included in those documents.

      <h3>
       Enough With The Money Laundering, Now For Some Entertainment
      </h3>
      <p>
       Trump's entry into New Jersey gambling required going through some red tape and some background checks, which Trump did not want to happen (possibly due to his extensive mob ties). His application to the New Jersey Gaming Commission only took 6 months to get approved, while the majority of other approvals took at least a year. During his application review process, Trump used his leverage in NY government in order to speed up his approval. A reviewer named John Degnan approved his application on the basis that he was weary that Trump would get approved to build a casino in NY state. As a result of the approval, Trump became a fierce advocate against gambling outside of the state of New Jersey,
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910">

       </a>
       . In a 1993 congressional testimony video seen

        here
       </a>
       Trump can be seen railing on casinos on native reservations in Connecticut, accusing the natives of organised crime and lying about their heritage in order to get licences. The racist son of a bitch even goes a step further in asking the committee to organise an effort to test the blood of the natives on these reserves, coining one of my favourite Trump catch phrases, 'They don't look like Indians to me'.
      </p>
      <h3>
       TLDR
      </h3>
      <p>
       Trump has a vast web of connections to the Italian mafia in New York City and in Atlantic City which mostly started with his friendship with Roy Cohn. These connections helped him get access to property, construction companies, and revenue which ultimately resulted in several documented cases of money laundering during the same period. These activities let to one of the single largest fines for money laundering for an establishment like a casino at $10 million in 2015.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
       In writing this, I hope this gives everyone insight into why investigators should follow the money. Sure collusion is more interesting and can get more controversy, but it can have legal grey areas and can be easier to mount a defence against in the media. In terms of money laundering, it is super easy to prove in court, as well as damn near impossible to defend if you are Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I don't doubt that there will be attempts to defend against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       More of these posts are to come, and not all of these posts will entirely name Trump. There are individuals on the campaign that may actually be in more criminal activity than Trump himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing.
       <strong>
        FOLLOW THE MONEY.
