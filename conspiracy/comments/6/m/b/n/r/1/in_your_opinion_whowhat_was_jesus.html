    <div class="md"><p>Some of the really ancient religions believe there were 2 paths you could take in life usually represented by 2 brothers. One was straight edge, clean, proper while the other was carefree and indulged in personal pleasures. Neither were wrong just 2 choices in life. The church took the one they didn&#39;t like and made it the devil imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story of these 2 brothers reads as a metaphor for the <a href="http://dragonintuitive.com/mastery-of-words/">study of the natural world.</a></p>

<p>One brother, ego-driven to become a better hunter, envious and hateful, ending life to become unlike a God.</p>

<p>One brother, whole-istically driven to better understand life, loving and peaceful, seeding life to spread God&#39;s work.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path#Terminology">The paths</a> are opposite and dualistic, but one cannot exist without the other. 
When one becomes bigger than life, the other will take the opposite role of the culler.</p>

<p>One method is taboo because it clearly implies killing at the detriment of others and bettering yourself over others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a physical incarnation of a person who was &quot;inspired&quot; (in spiraled?) by a fractally dualist hivemind so as to learn infinite lessons that could be shared.  he represented the superiority of the design of care over the design of division.  he&#39;s the same archetype (or mainly this archetype) as jupiter/zeus.  the symbol for jupiter is the symbol for tin, a 2 and 4 intersecting. <a href="http://www.symbols.com/gi.php?type=1&amp;amp;id=720&amp;amp;i=1">http://www.symbols.com/gi.php?type=1&amp;amp;id=720&amp;amp;i=1</a> . the 4, the cross represents intersection in balance.  this universe is always in balance, so how does it change?  it changes phi-ly.  it decorates in layers, always in balance.  The 2 part represents the phi change part, spinning off from the balance.  </p>

<p>anyway this character figures out that strict dualist hierarchy (set, satan, saturn) is improved upon by a wholistic (holystic) phi-losophy.  thus hierarchy/the pyramid/ being a singularity and phi being infinitely growing diversity (so-phi-a, so-phi-ah).  and as long as we change &quot;with care&quot; we&#39;re good.  care = love.  love = iove = jove = jupiter.  </p>

<p>that&#39;s my impression anyway</p>

<p>he&#39;s called &quot;the perfect man&quot; because he cares about how he develops.  it&#39;s as if in this form if you take care in how you grow yourself, he represents a kind of limit of that.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear I know someone who is the spitting image of the Crone, too.  I think the archetypes are all around us if we look, and why aspects of character are fairly innate in personhood, but explainable through experience.  It seems so easy to TALK about...but the idea of implementing a design like that seems so far-fetched.  Yet that&#39;s all words are...designs themselves.  And that&#39;s why things are unbelievable to me.  Not really, but just expanse wise</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Crone = female version of Chronus, time lord, Saturn</p>

<p>words are phi designs.  they are constructed phi-ly.  they are arranged in sentences phi-ly.  sentences are arranged in paragraphs phi-ly. and on and on.  it&#39;s a narrative/decorating/phi type of design.</p>

<p>of course the recurrence of these archetypes will manifest in the infinite.  this is the same as numbers and operations producing smells of their use.  infinitely occurring smells.  the word = jesus.  why?  because he&#39;s phi-ne.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh geez...l need to get off at the next stop.  </p>

<p>My favorite is Cain and Abel.  Ya know, Cain supposedly just found disfavor with the Lord because, unlike Abel, he did not proffer the finest he had.  If you check out this depiction of them:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F7c%2F39%2F0e%2F7c390e1b004aa2e80f980d51d8111dc4.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F57350595226039422%2F&amp;amp;docid=TRzGGxA50mJIXM&amp;amp;tbnid=7U_7ygqiJR04OM%3A&amp;amp;vet=10ahUKEwir2ZHc6_3UAhULeD4KHbRdB14QMwgnKAAwAA..i&amp;amp;w=587&amp;amp;h=608&amp;amp;itg=1&amp;amp;bih=701&amp;amp;biw=1536&amp;amp;q=cain%20and%20abel%20speculum&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwir2ZHc6_3UAhULeD4KHbRdB14QMwgnKAAwAA&amp;amp;iact=mrc&amp;amp;uact=8">Beat yo down fool</a></p>

<p>it seems like Cain offered nothing more than a bundle of sticks, which would maybe be the origin of all those &quot;nasty&quot; jokes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was in the world,
and the world was created through Him,
yet the world did not recognize Him.
He came to His own,
and His own people did not receive Him.
But to all who did receive Him,
He gave them the right to be children of God,
to those who believe in His name,
who were born,
not of blood,
or of the will of the flesh,
or of the will of man,
but of God.
The Word became flesh
and took up residence among us.
We observed His glory,
the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father,
full of grace and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was actually a Nazarene. Meaning he was not a Jew, but was part of a separate tribe. He was actually part of the Abraham lineage. A tribe of prophet kings. Jews like to mix up the word Nazarene with someone that comes from Nazareth, but in fact, that&#39;s false. You can say he was Egyptian. Abraham was sent down to earth by AmonRa to deal with the corrupt Nephilim (fallen angels) which started to corrupt the world.  </p>

<p>Look up who Ra is. 
Look up the emerald tablets of Thoth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This Nazarene insight is incorrect.  </p>

<p>The teacher had given me an assignment based on this Scripture:  &quot;And He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets, ‘He shall be called the Nazarene,’ might be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“It&#39;s from the Book of Matthew,” he said.  Your assignment did you search the Scriptures and find the prophecy where it is said that the Messiah would be a Nazarene.”</p>

<p>Several weeks passed before he brought it up again.  But then the day came.  “Have you found the prophecy of the Nazarene,” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.  “There&#39;s no prophecy calling Messiah a Nazarene.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice,” he said “that it doesn&#39;t say ‘what  was spoken by the <em>prophet’</em> but what ‘was spoken by the <em>prophets’?</em>  So the answer lies not with one prophet or prophecy but in the collective voice of the prophets.  And what did the prophets say of Messiah?  They speak of Messiah the Branch.  Why the branch?  For one, He would appear on earth in littleness, in weakness, growing up as a shoot or a sprout.  He will be born among us on the genealogy, the tree of humanity.  His presence on earth would then grow, becoming greater and greater and bear it’s fruit to the world.  In Hebrew, one of the words for branch it netzer.  It&#39;s the word used by Isaiah and his prophecy of Messiah as the branch that would come forth from the line of David.  If you add an ending, the word becomes <em>netzeret.</em>   <em>Netzeret</em> is the Hebrew name for the place you know as Nazareth.”</p>

<p>“So <em>Nazarene</em> speaks of Messiah the Branch.  And <em>Nazareth</em> would mean…?”</p>

<p><em>“Nazareth</em> would mean the place of the branch…the place of the branching forth.”  </p>

<p>“The perfect name,” I said, “for the place where Messiah would grow up…as a branch…and from where He would branch out.”</p>

<p>“It was considered a nothing place, the most obscure an unlikely of places.”</p>

<p>“Then why did God choose it?”</p>

<p>“For that very reason.  God loves to choose the unlikely and because it&#39;s not about Nazareth-it&#39;s about that which comes through Nazareth.  In the same way, it&#39;s not about who we are.  Nor does it matter how likely or unlikely, how imperfect or sinful our life has been…only that we receive.  For whoever receives Him, through that life, the life of God will come.  And from that life, He will branch out to the world.  For we are each called to be his Nazareth.”</p>

<p><em>The Mission:</em> Let Messiah’s life come through your life.  Let His love come through your love and your life become His branching-His Nazareth. </p>

<p>Zachariah 3:8; Isaiah 11:1-2; Matthew 2:23; John 15 1-5</p>

<p>I dunno if God literally impregnated Mary but I feel like Jesus the Christ had some kinda direct line to God that could equate to a son-like relationship. Somehow. </p>

<p>He was not white like pictorial depictions seem to favor. And he seemed like a genuinely awesome dude- feeding people with fishes and loaves and making wine. He&#39;s cool in my book! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a person of faith. I believe that we are all born pure and as god. If we are still and quiet we can feel it, our innate sense of right from wrong. It&#39;s our job to reclaim that god that is us. That is what I think Jesus was, (and plenty of other spiritual leaders as well.) When he said &quot;your body is your temple&quot; he meant it literally, not what the church spun like &quot;take care of your body&quot; but that the church is separating you from god, god is you and you are his church. So, I&#39;m sort of a Christian, but I won&#39;t step foot in a church. Churches are creepy dens of evil, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if all those similarities to other religions and astrology are because it&#39;s true? </p>

<p>If the mankind is less than 10,000 years old and the story was there from the beginning, written in the stars, then <em>not</em> having all these similar ideas come out of the other religions would be highly unusual.  </p>

<p>Take astrology. If you name the first few brightest stars of each constellation in order, it tells the story of the Gospel. Most names are lost now, but there&#39;s enough evidence throughout the Semitic languages to make the connections. Link upon request. </p>

<p>And if there are all these myths developing about the coming virgin birth and great king of kings... then that&#39;s something you&#39;d want in <em>your</em> mythology if you wanted to rule the world.</p>

<p>It all makes sense if you can hold it all up to the right light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was a radical Jewish preacher who preached ideals more in line with eastern ideology than the Jewish people of that time were used to. It&#39;s because of him that the Old Testament identifies God as a vengeful asshole and supports &quot;eye-for-an-eye&quot; philosophy, while the New Testament version of supposedly the same entity is all about forgiveness and pacifism rather than destructive vengefulness. It was the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth that codified the idea of &quot;the Golden Rule&quot; into Christianity that still stands today, and that was a good thing. &quot;The Goldren Rule&quot; has existed in many cultures all around the world going back to the days before Christianity, and unlike certain moral declarations in ancient Jewish scripture, it is a good, rational basis for morality. </p>

<p>However, something like a couple hundred years after his death, long after the people who actually lived at the same time as Jesus were all dead, some folks established a church of worship to him. In the hundreds of years since then, that church has been used to manipulate and control people. That&#39;s not cool. </p>

<p>Basically, the guy taught people to stop being jerks to each other, got assassinated for that, and then went on to become a tool of oppression long after he and all of the people who knew him were dead. I&#39;m an atheist personally, but even if there is a singular great creator god and even if Jesus is literally the human son of that deity, everything I&#39;ve said in this comment is still true. He taught some good morality while he was alive, and then long after his murder, his image has been used to oppress for centuries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was not a Jew, he was a Judahite of the tribe of Judah. In that time you had the pure racial Isralites, and then you had the satanic mongrelised edomite/caininites who had taken over the majority of the power structure with their usury.  The much poor  isralites were unable to make the sacrificial requirements because of the usury scam at the temple. When he came onto the scene the Isralites were being oppressed by the Edomites, and because the edomites mixed in with the caininites you had two tribes that looked similar; but were completely opposite to one another-as is still the case today. Hence the verse : But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amalgamation of multiple mythic figures from different religious traditions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dagon - Fertility and fish god of ancient Semitic mythology</p></li>
<li><p>Jeoud (Pheoniciain for &quot;Only Begotten Son&quot;)- Legendary ancient Pheonician prince who was sacrificed by his father, King Kronus, AKA &quot;Ilus&quot; (possibly the historical person upon which the legends of the early Semitic gods &quot;El&quot; and &quot;Elyon&quot; were based), and, according to the Sanchuniathon, this King was also referred to as &quot;Israel&quot;). </p></li>
<li><p>John the Baptist, (AKA Oannes) - Early Christianity incorporated many facets of the competing religion, Mandaeism, as well as characteristics of its most revered prophet, John the Baptist. It&#39;s been suggested that John, or &quot;Ioannes&quot; as he was called, was related and perhaps a later incarnation of the Babylonian god &quot;Oannes&quot;, who is typically viewed as one-in-the-same with the the Semitic God Dagon. Like Dagon, Oannes was a merman of sorts, and also had some goat-like features. </p></li>
<li><p>Kshitigarbha (known in Japan as &quot;Jizo&quot;) - One of the four great Bodhisattvas in Buddhism. He is prophesied to be the final Bodhisattva who saves humanity. He&#39;s the protector and defender of the souls of stillborn children. His full name in Japanese is pronounced &quot;Daigan Jizō Bosatsu&quot;, linguistically tying him to Buddha, Dagon, and Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p>Melchizedik/the Jewish Messiah/David </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mention it. I should probably also point out that Jesus shares parallels with Osiris and Horace (resurrection) in Egyptian mythology, as well as Dionysius/Bacchus (water into wine and resurrection) in Greek/Roman myth, and the Christian trinity is likely modeled after the trinity of Zoroastrianism (final battle between good and evil).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was the ultimate victim of his own success.</p>

<p>Look at the Christian Church, as it is today and as it has been ever since the dark ages. It&#39;s <em>everything</em> he despised and preached <em>against</em>. And look at him, he&#39;s has become the symbol of a death-cult, people literally crucifying themselves in order to &#39;get closer to god&#39;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how people praise Jesus so much, when they probably know his story. Poor guy.</p>
