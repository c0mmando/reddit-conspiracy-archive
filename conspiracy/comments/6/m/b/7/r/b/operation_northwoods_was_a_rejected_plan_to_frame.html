        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Operation Northwoods</strong>                 </p>

<p>In 1962 a false flag operation was proposed against the Cuban government by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government. The proposals called for the CIA or other government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civillians and military targets and use the media machine to blame it on the Cuban government. The motivation behind the proposal was to justify a war with Cuba. </p>

<p>The operation proposed creating public support for a war against Cuba by blaming it for terrorist acts that would actually be perpetrated by the U.S. Government. To this end, Operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government. It stated:</p>

<pre><code>The desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.
</code></pre>

<p>The plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer.     </p>

<p>The plan was rejected by John F. Kennedy and Lyman Lemnitzer was denied another term as Chairman of the Joint Cheifs of Staff. </p>

<p>In 1963 Lyman Lemnitzer was appointed Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and served from 1963-1969.</p>

<p>In 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated. </p>

<p>In 1975, President Ford appointed Lemnitzer to the Commission on CIA Activities within the United States (aka the Rockefeller Commission) to investigate whether the Central Intelligence Agency had committed acts that violated US laws, and allegations that E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis (of Watergate fame) were involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. </p>

<p>TL;DR - Lyman Lemnitzer proposed a plan to attack American people using CIA operatives and blame the attacks on Cuba to justify going to war with Cuba. Kennedy rejects the plans and Lyman is fired. Lyman becomes head of NATO in 1963, the same year Kennedy was assassinated. Lyman is the commissioned the &#39;rockefeller commission&#39; to investigate who assassinated Kennedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Northwoods was part of Operation Mongoose, which was run out of White House by Robert Kennedy. Some of the activities were approved, sabotage of Cuban factories. I don&#39;t know why people keep in bringing this up when it was JFK was the one who told him to do it. BTW, Lemnitzer was replaced by Maxwell Taylor who help JFK develop his  &quot;flexible response.&quot; Of course, this begs the question, why would a JFK appointee take part in the assassination of the man who hired? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lemnitzer came up with the Northwoods proposal. Lemnitzer was fired for it that&#39;s why I think he&#39;s suspicious in this. J.F.K may have approved other activities but he put a stop to a false flag attack on his own people and everything he did was made public. </p>
