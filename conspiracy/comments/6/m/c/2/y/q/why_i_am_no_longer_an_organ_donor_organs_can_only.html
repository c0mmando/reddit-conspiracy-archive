<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZyBM5UGi_I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=777">Woman lives another 30 years after husband was pressured to sign form to harvest her organs.</a></p>

<p>from the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1353436/Can-brain-dead-donors-respond.html">Telegraph</a>:</p>

<p>The debate was started by Dr Philip Keep, a consultant anaesthetist at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, who fears that brain-dead patients may still feel pain while their organs are being removed. Because of his reservations, he will not carry a donor card until medical guidelines are changed to make it compulsory for donors to be given an anaesthetic before their organs are removed.</p>

<p>Dr Keep, 58, has now provoked controversy with a letter in Anaesthesia, the journal of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, saying that many people within the profession feel uneasy about the issue.</p>

<p>This weekend at his home in Norwich he said: &quot;Nurses get really, really upset. You stick the knife in and the pulse and blood pressure shoot up. If you don&#39;t give anything at all, the patient will start moving and wriggling around and it&#39;s impossible to do the operation. The surgeon has always asked us to paralyse the patient.&quot;</p>

<p>Other experts have supported his criticism of the guidelines issued last year by the Intensive Care Society (ICS), which represents doctors, that anaesthetic is not necessary.</p>

<p>Yesterday fears were growing that people across the country would tear up their donor cards because they could feel pain while their organs were being removed. Dr Keep said: &quot;I am very much in favour of organ transplantations. I think everything should be done to obtain donor organs. I am worried about the process by which these donor organs are obtained at the moment because it is not necessary to give an anaesthetic to a patient who is having his donor organs removed.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I will not carry a donor card for that very reason. If I knew that somebody was going to give me an anaesthetic before my donor organs were removed I would carry a donor card and I think a lot of other people who have got these doubts would carry a donor card as well.</strong> The number of potential donors would go up if donors were given anaesthetics,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not saying that these patients are alive, I am not saying that these patients can feel pain. I am saying I do not know whether these patients are alive, I am saying I do not know whether these patients can feel pain in some sense and, under those circumstances, I am not prepared to carry a donor card.&quot;</p>

<p>The debate centres on the term &quot;brain dead&#39; and the fact that organs such as the lungs, liver and heart cannot be removed if a patient&#39;s heart has stopped. Dr Keep said: &quot;You have to keep the patient&#39;s heart beating [with a ventilator] all the way through the operation until the organs have been removed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a definition that was created when docs realized that you can&#39;t harvest organs from someone who has no heartbeat.

<p>Can you show me proof of this? Last time I went in for surgery they used an EKG monitor. I was under the impression this was also used to determine brain death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s related to the level of electrical brain activity, but because we can&#39;t measure that fully and we don&#39;t know where &quot;consciousness&quot; comes from, there is a chance that some people can survive or are currently alive/thinking while technically brain dead. Its an insanely small chance, but the remote possibility is enough to stop many people from donating </p>

<p>Learn how to care for your own body </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is good advice, but pretending the reason that people come down with cancer, heart, liver or kidney diseases or any of the great host of horrible illnesses that plague humanity is exactly because we &quot;didn&#39;t care for our own body&quot; is delusional.</p>

<p>Sure, people make themselves sick, but also, humans are mortal and fragile.  Even people who eat right, exercise and avoid modern toxic chemicals die of diseases all the time.</p>

<p>When your kidneys shut down due to an infection, all the &quot;diet&quot; in the world won&#39;t fix it up.  Perhaps you blew it by eating the wrong things, perhaps it was just bad luck, but either way, you aren&#39;t going to eat macrobiotic and have your kidneys spring back to life.</p>

The wealthy already exploit the masses and their continued existence only buys them more time to come up with new and more elaborate schemes to exploit the masses. In fact, this is one of the ways the masses SHOULD be peacefully protesting against the elite until they have a change of heart and decide to stop fucking over the masses. You can rest assured that those organs will find their way to an elite or their offspring much sooner than they will end up in an average citizen&#39;s body.</p>

<p>My 1st/main reason though is the suspicion that becoming an organ donor is potentially signing a death sentence if you ever have a major accident that you could recover from in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole organ donation idea seems sketchy to me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust the mainstream idea that consciousness is in the brain, if anything, it must be spread across multiple organs. For instance, there are so many stories of people getting organ donations and then their personality changes to take on traits of the donor. And these days scientists are calling the stomach the &quot;second brain&quot;. Your major organs all are connected to your nervous system and have neurons in them. </p>

<p>So if I donate my organs, what if it dooms my consciousness to some hellish confused state, being chopped up and stuck onto a foreign alien consciousness. Fuck that.</p>

<p>And receiving an organ does not seem that great either. Recipients get to live on immunosuppresants for the rest of their lives that have terrible side effects.</p>

Because of the donation, I&#39;m living a normal life, except I just take a lot more drugs than most people my age. The biggest side effects come from the immediate large steroid dose immediately after surgery. There are concerns long term, but what are we comparing it to? </p>

<p>If you believe OP, is this still something you would sign up for yourself (being the person live butchered)?</p>

<p>The ultimate win for everyone would be synthetic / lab-grown organs. It&#39;s hard to say if they have caused more harm than good, if we also consider that each donator may have lived their final moments in absolute agony. That would certainly contravene human rights too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I believe the OP anyway. I am on the donor list so guess I&#39;ll find out one day.</p>

<p>No I stand corrected. Just asked my mom. The hospital asked her if she wanted his organs donated right after he died (100% dead. No heartbeat, etc.) and she declined because I don&#39;t think he ever wanted that. The mortuary asked her if she wanted to donate his tissue. </p>

<p>Whether or not you &#39;want&#39; to be an organ donor, they will do it. At the DMV, when you fill out the form to renew your license, and it asks you 5-6 questions with YES and NO boxes?</p>

<p>Have you ever been convicted of a DUI? YES/NO etc etc etc.</p>

<p>The one that says &quot;Would you like to be an organ donor?&quot; DOES NOT HAVE A NO BOX. Literally. Its only a yes box, so you would leave it blank, waiting to be checked if you wanted no. </p>

<p>I literally draw a box in, write NO above it, and then check that box. 
Go to your DMV, check the fucking form. I can verify 3 states that do not have a NO box for organ donor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am the recipient of kidney transplant. That transplant allowed me to avoid dialysis and extended my potential life span significantly. About as many people die waiting for donor kidneys as receive kidney transplants in a given year. Cadaver organs save lives. </p>

<p>I find it dubious that people in significant numbers would tear up their donor cards because of a report they haven&#39;t read. Research shows that most people don&#39;t donate because its typically opt in instead of opt out. </p>

<p>Please consider being an organ donor. You might save some lives. And organs can fail through no fault of the patient, like my kidneys did. It happened to me. It can happen to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Surgeon.Interestingly, while doctor and nurse made the list of careers with the fewest psychopaths, surgeons were among the most psychopathic. As surgeon Wen Shen stated in a 2014 Pacific Standard piece, “the trouble with surgeons [is]...[m]any are abrasive, abusive, and wildly self-centered—so much so that observers have speculated that they suffer from psychiatric disorders.” Shen speculates this attitudinal tendency might be traced back to the horrible, pre-anesthesia days of surgery, when the field necessarily attracted a breed of person who could operate “to a soundtrack of screams” while keeping a cool hand. That may be changing—there’s a push for a kinder, gentler surgeon afoot—but doctors in other fields and other healthcare professional still seem to hold surgeons in unique regard.&quot;</p>
