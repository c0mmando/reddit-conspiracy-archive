<p>When Steve and I created this site twelve years ago, our vision was simple but powerful. We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now look at this post and understand what this website and its founders are actually about:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h1j3z/reddit_is_being_overwritten/"><strong>Reddit is being over-written</strong></a></p>

<p>This post marked an important observation made by a solid member of this community. Of course the comment section was full of people who didn&#39;t understand his point and the, unfortunately, all-too-common attitude of &quot;lets give the people in power the benefit of the doubt and come back to this topic later&quot;.</p>

<p>If I have noticed anything about the human race, it is that the masses have the attention span of a fruit fly. This attitude is intentionally highjacked and manipulated by the media and many others in the business of spreading lies and propaganda. The majority of people are simply too lazy, or have too little brain-power left, to actually follow up on the important things that <em>need</em> to be followed up on.</p>

<p>So remember, reddit is a site that has been around for 12 years. And the MAJORITY of that 12 year history is now nearly impossible to access and anyone who thinks that it was an &quot;accident&quot; or &quot;unintentional bi-product of good intentions&quot; should <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">look at the long list of other very convenient changes made by reddit admins that systematically wiped away freedom-of-thought from this website</a>.</p>

<p>But hey, no big deal right. We can all easily access the &quot;post election&quot; reddit and listen to the &quot;totally real users&quot; who constantly push the talking point that reddit hasn&#39;t changed at all. I guess those of us that have been here for years should just allow ourselves and our community to be gaslighted. Because you know, &quot;its just information&quot; and &quot;little ol&#39; reddit&quot; and &quot;imaginary internet points&quot; etc...</p>

<p>Its totally no big deal that a decade worth of reddit landscape was hidden from view. Now lets all go browse &quot;popular&quot; and eat our bread and continue watching the magnificent, politically correct, corporate-friendly, product-placement, commercial-ridden, government think-tank sponsored &quot;totally not propaganda&quot; circus that is infecting million of people hourly. </p>

<p>No big deal right. </p>
