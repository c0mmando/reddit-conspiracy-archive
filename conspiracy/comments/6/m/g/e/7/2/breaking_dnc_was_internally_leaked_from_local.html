       That's because all the shills who invade this sub will sometimes accept those.  Well, not really, they stop attacking the source at that point and usually come back with a deflection of one kind or another.

       this is why disinfo is so annoying to battle. they have no commitment to truth and change arguments and tactics with no regard to consistency, unlike people who are honestly trying to get to truth
      </p>
      <p>
       no honest person would knowingly say "wapo is fake news unless its agrees with my narrative" but if you are just trying to fool people you can go out and do that without a 2nd thought

       Also, it's about Guccifer 2.0's "DC Leak" which was resoundingly ignored because there was nothing in it of any interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, WikiLeaks' DNC Leaks story is extremely interesting. It is thoroughly substantiated by the source material--which has in turn been verified in multiple ways by multiple parties--and it is changing the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we'd very much like to know whether or not Seth Rich was WikiLeaks' source for the story.

       DNC vers of Guccifer 2.0 archive was locally inserted with "Russian" metadata. Not via internet. Local. I'm just a truth seeker, let me know if I'm incorrect please I'm not looking for any confirmation bias bullshit I want justice. Thanks all

       This report is breaking yes. The time constraint is physically impossible to have been over internet. Look into the data. You could just use crowdstrike oh wait it's completely redacted. Or you could just ask the FBI oh wait the DNC denied them servers 3+ times now.

       Do a google search for an excerpt of this blog post, it's pieced together from gatewaypundit and various other sources, which it does not indicate. No author or date of publication listed either. I have to dig into the post itself still, but for now this looks like copypasta with a clear agenda (not coincidentally being posted here on Seth's birthday, like all the other posts spamming us right now).

       Apparently it's based on date modified info in the zip file, but that doesn't automatically mean when it was downloaded, when you copy it the date modified is changed to that time you started the copy.

       I believe he was using the modified time difference between the first file in directory, and the last, compared to the size.

       But nothing in there shows that july 5th was the time they came off the dnc servers, which it would have to be for the transfer time to mean anything.

       "The Forensicator believed that using the possible 'think-time' explanation to explain the time-gaps was a less likely explanation for the data pattern available, with a large amount of data most likely copied instantaneously,  later "pruned" in the production of the Guccifer 2.0's publication of the NGP-VAN files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the most likely explanation and the less likely scenario provided by The Forensicator's analysis virtually exclude the possibility of a Russian or remote hacker gaining external access to the files later published as "NGP-VAN."  In both cases,  the physical presence of a person accessing a containing DNC information would be required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Importantly, The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an internet connection. This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the overall transfer rate of 23 MB/s. The Forensicator described this as "possible when copying over a LAN, but too fast to support the hypothetical scenario that the alleged DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania)." Guccifer 2.0 had claimed to originate in Romania. So in other words, this rate indicates that the data was downloaded locally,  possibly using the local DNC network. The importance of this finding in regards to destroying the Russian hacking narrative cannot be overstated."

       I am totally on board with you but that speed isn't unreasonable. Every game I download off steam I download at 25 mb/s on average. Granted I do spend 175 a month on internet! But still I'm not sure that speed guarantees this unless I'm missing something.

       Also I do live like miles from a steam center so that might matter! Anyway just curious what yours thoughts are on that and thanks for the good posts!

       To be clear... Flood was not caught fabricating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just know that it appears a copy of MS-Word registered to Warren Flood (with company name GSA) was used to create the the Russian template document (blank document with Russian stylesheet entry at that stage).
      </p>
      <p>
       While this COULD suggest Flood was behind it... it's worth nothing that GSA is a federal contractor and that the only place you'd be likely to find the Warren Flood+GSA combination was from when he worked at the White House under Biden... however, that was back in 2010-2011, he stopped working there 5-6 years prior to the documents being created.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means someone other than Flood may have initially used a computer situated in (or originally from) Biden's west wing office.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes that really odd... is that at the time those files were created... Biden was hosting 2 Ukraine themed meetings (and he rarely hosted meetings) which you can learn all about at
       <a href="http://g-2.space/sr">
        http://g-2.space/sr
       </a>
       - The west-wing office meeting was attended by US architects of the Ukraine Coup (Nuland, Pyatt, Hoch, etc), people that Obama and Biden already trusted to keep secrets.

       I'm not making an argument. When I point these facts out, nobody believes me anyway. It takes 15 seconds to confirm what I'm saying. But nope, people
       <strong>
        want
       </strong>
       to believe this anonymous "Forensicator" who's not willing to publish his "findings" under his own name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps subjects will believe an anonymous source if it said that the sky was green and that a green sky meant that they could continue their dissonance. People shouting at them "look up!" isn't going to change a single mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       So calling them retards isn't trying to win an argument. Because it's not an in good faith debate. This topic (and the stupid Alexa traffic data propaganda) is so easy to just look and see that it's even easier to see that nobody is going to believe you because they don't want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; My argument isn't discredited as I was stating facts. Not trying to win anyone over because anyone I could be targeting has already made their mind up.
