<p>On the other hand, WikiLeaks&#39; DNC Leaks story is extremely interesting. It is thoroughly substantiated by the source material--which has in turn been verified in multiple ways by multiple parties--and it is changing the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Forensicator believed that using the possible &#39;think-time&#39; explanation to explain the time-gaps was a less likely explanation for the data pattern available, with a large amount of data most likely copied instantaneously,  later &quot;pruned&quot; in the production of the Guccifer 2.0&#39;s publication of the NGP-VAN files.</p>

<p>Both the most likely explanation and the less likely scenario provided by The Forensicator&#39;s analysis virtually exclude the possibility of a Russian or remote hacker gaining external access to the files later published as &quot;NGP-VAN.&quot;  In both cases,  the physical presence of a person accessing a containing DNC information would be required.</p>

<p>Importantly, The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an internet connection. This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike.</p>

<p>This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the overall transfer rate of 23 MB/s. The Forensicator described this as &quot;possible when copying over a LAN, but too fast to support the hypothetical scenario that the alleged DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania).&quot; Guccifer 2.0 had claimed to originate in Romania. So in other words, this rate indicates that the data was downloaded locally,  possibly using the local DNC network. The importance of this finding in regards to destroying the Russian hacking narrative cannot be overstated.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear... Flood was not caught fabricating them.</p>

<p>We just know that it appears a copy of MS-Word registered to Warren Flood (with company name GSA) was used to create the the Russian template document (blank document with Russian stylesheet entry at that stage).</p>

<p>While this COULD suggest Flood was behind it... it&#39;s worth nothing that GSA is a federal contractor and that the only place you&#39;d be likely to find the Warren Flood+GSA combination was from when he worked at the White House under Biden... however, that was back in 2010-2011, he stopped working there 5-6 years prior to the documents being created. </p>

<p>This means someone other than Flood may have initially used a computer situated in (or originally from) Biden&#39;s west wing office.</p>

<p>What makes that really odd... is that at the time those files were created... Biden was hosting 2 Ukraine themed meetings (and he rarely hosted meetings) which you can learn all about at <a href="http://g-2.space/sr">http://g-2.space/sr</a> - The west-wing office meeting was attended by US architects of the Ukraine Coup (Nuland, Pyatt, Hoch, etc), people that Obama and Biden already trusted to keep secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such bullshit. The creation date could be the date <em>downloaded or the date copied</em> making this complete bunk. You don&#39;t need a fucking CS degree to understand this. That so many people are actually buying this is fucking disturbing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re complete retards and who don&#39;t understand how their own computer works, or if they&#39;re just going along with it because if you suspend belief, it actually helps prove what you&#39;re trying to prove. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not making an argument. When I point these facts out, nobody believes me anyway. It takes 15 seconds to confirm what I&#39;m saying. But nope, people <strong>want</strong> to believe this anonymous &quot;Forensicator&quot; who&#39;s not willing to publish his &quot;findings&quot; under his own name. </p>

<p>Trumps subjects will believe an anonymous source if it said that the sky was green and that a green sky meant that they could continue their dissonance. People shouting at them &quot;look up!&quot; isn&#39;t going to change a single mind. </p>

<p>So calling them retards isn&#39;t trying to win an argument. Because it&#39;s not an in good faith debate. This topic (and the stupid Alexa traffic data propaganda) is so easy to just look and see that it&#39;s even easier to see that nobody is going to believe you because they don&#39;t want to. </p>

<p>TLDR; My argument isn&#39;t discredited as I was stating facts. Not trying to win anyone over because anyone I could be targeting has already made their mind up. </p>

<p>This was oddly just after Comey recommended no charges be brought to HRC. Were they sitting on ngp van dump, this happens, decided to take action? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, it&#39;s about Guccifer 2.0&#39;s &quot;DC Leak&quot; which was resoundingly ignored because there was nothing in it of any interest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, WikiLeaks&#39; DNC Leaks story is extremely interesting. It is thoroughly substantiated by the source material--which has in turn been verified in multiple ways by multiple parties--and it is changing the world.  </p>

<p>Also, we&#39;d very much like to know whether or not Seth Rich was WikiLeaks&#39; source for the story.</p>
