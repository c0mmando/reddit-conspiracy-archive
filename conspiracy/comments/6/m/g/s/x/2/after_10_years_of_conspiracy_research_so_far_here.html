        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve made this post around this time for the last 3 years... It is interesting to see what progress is made each year and what new information/events come to light. My journey started in 2007 when I first watched <a href="https://youtu.be/OrHeg77LF4Y">Peter Jospeh&#39;s &#39;Zietgeist&#39;</a>. I was forever changed once this video presented the idea that the government actually lied about the events of 9/11. I was then compelled to continually dig around and find more and more information on all kinds of conspiracy theory related topics. Here is my list of what I believe... </p>

<p>JFK Assassination</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple shooters assassinated JFK, one of them believed to be George HW Bush</li>
<li>Lee Harvey Oswald was simply a patsy who had connections with the intelligence community</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/gZdd7aIDW9M">People from within the government made it happen or knew it was going to happen</a></li>
<li>He was killed because he wanted to change things like the Federal Reserve, the Vietnam War, and to dismantle the CIA</li>
</ul>

<p>MKULTRA / Mind Control</p>

<ul>
<li>Mind control experimentation on unsuspecting people</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/KRTOB8JPwa8">Bill Clinton went on CSPAN and apologized for 1000&#39;s of government sponsored radiation experiments that were unethical and without consent</a></li>
<li>Continually evolving as technology advances</li>
</ul>

<p>9/11</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/8DOnAn_PX6M">3 WTC buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition fashion</a></li>
<li>The pentagon was not hit by a plane but by some kind of a missile along with other explosives</li>
<li>No plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania</li>
<li>Dick Cheney &amp; Donald Rumsfeld were an integral part of the event</li>
<li>Osama Bin Ladden/Al-Qaeda/Taliban had nothing to do with the actual attacks</li>
<li>A false flag attack to get full justification for an endless &#39;War on Terror&#39; and further control</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia &amp; Israel are indirectly linked because they wanted the same outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>Afghanistan</p>

<ul>
<li>Took control of the land to seize the poppy opiate/heroin industry</li>
<li>Took control of the land for it&#39;s rare metals &amp; minerals</li>
<li>Perfect place to start the War on Terror to work it&#39;s way around Iran</li>
</ul>

<p>Iraq, Libya, Syria</p>

<ul>
<li>All a part of the War on Terror lie</li>
<li>Fueling the Military-Industrial Complex</li>
<li>Taking further control of energy resources - drilling in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy">Golan Heights</a></li>
<li>Controlling the government to work in their favor</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/HP7L8bw5QF4">Enforcing the &#39;Petrodollar&#39; economy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Al-Qaeda, ISIS</p>

<ul>
<li>Funded and supplied by NATO countries for many years</li>
<li>Utilized/supported to continue the War on Terror</li>
<li>Turkey (and other NATO countries) allowing ISIS stolen oil trucks to enter country</li>
<li>Lots of &#39;terrorists&#39; are simply paid mercenaries</li>
</ul>

<p>Sandy Hook, Aurora shooting, Boston Bombing, San Bernardino Attack, Orlando Nightclub Shooting, Dallas Shooting</p>

<ul>
<li>Simulated false flag events to further push gun restrictions and tougher gun/security laws</li>
<li>Hired crisis-actors are exploited to exaggerate the situations</li>
<li>Create more fear and less sense of security</li>
<li>Enables police/military to test/train for martial law tactics</li>
</ul>

<p>US Police Militarization</p>

<ul>
<li>Meant to be unnoticed by the public</li>
<li>Enables greater power and control over any public outcry or protest</li>
<li>Adds to the fear of standing up to authority</li>
<li>Allows for more abuse of power in any interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>War on Drugs</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeps private prisons full and making money</li>
<li>Gives a large percentage of police something to do</li>
<li>Enables the targeting of low-income/minority groups of people</li>
<li>Allows the pharmaceutical industry to own all medication</li>
<li>CIA has been trafficking all kinds of drugs from around the world (Cocaine from South America and Heroin from Afghanistan)</li>
</ul>

<p>Isreal / Zionism</p>

<ul>
<li>United States has given more money to Israel than to any other country (1949 - 2015 is $124.3 billion)</li>
<li>They are taking/killing Palenstine</li>
<li>They push the <a href="https://youtu.be/LM2Fi1rhYqc">&#39;The Greater Israel Project&#39;</a></li>
<li>Has never experienced an attack from ISIS</li>
<li>A major secret power controlling the USA/NATO power structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Illuminati / The Powers That Be (TPTB)</p>

<ul>
<li>Coming from lines of royalty, now most are involved as world bank owners</li>
<li>Rothschild &amp; Morgan family are major players</li>
<li>They don&#39;t necessarily control the world but they sure are trying to in every way using the current monetary system and government influence</li>
<li>Enforce the world banking system to keep us all in a state of perpetual debt slavery</li>
</ul>

<p>Pizzagate / Child sex trafficking rings / Satanic ritual abuse</p>

<ul>
<li>Numerous people tied to TPTB practice rituals and ceremonies - Moloch related</li>
<li>Used as blackmail within their circles to keep people doing what they want them to do and not say a word about it </li>
</ul>

<p>Chemtrails / HAARP</p>

<ul>
<li>They spray all kinds of chemicals for multiple reasons, mainly weather modification</li>
<li>The goal is to be able to control, modify, and create weather patterns</li>
<li>They do admit to <a href="http://www.weathermodification.com/">weather modification</a></li>
<li>They have a small amount of information on <a href="http://www.weathermodification.com/resources.php">what is being put into our skies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Aliens / UFOs (I know this one is pushing logic and reason)</p>

<ul>
<li>They are real (based on the idea that 40 billion livable planets exist in just our galaxy)</li>
<li>They have been among us for centuries (explains certain technology/evolution jumps)</li>
<li>There are multiple species of aliens watching us and among us</li>
<li>They have offered all kinds of technology to us over time</li>
<li>TPTB are fully aware of it all and either work with them or for them</li>
<li>I just can&#39;t believe we are absolutely alone in all of space</li>
<li>Most UFOs are explainable but not every single one of them</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuff I am just not sure about</p>

<ul>
<li>Huge elaborate crop circles</li>
<li>Moon Landings</li>
<li>Vaccination safety</li>
<li>Osama Bin Ladens death</li>
<li>Eugenics movement</li>
<li>The truth about &quot;The Holocaust&quot;</li>
<li>Mandela effect</li>
<li>Antarctica</li>
</ul>

<p>Conspiracies I don&#39;t believe</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat Earth</li>
<li>Trump/Russia collusion</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s interesting that you don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anything to the Trump/Russia thing.  I have to believe that if the exact same scenario had played out, with the same leaks and &quot;evidence&quot;, with Hillary Clinton and her campaign at the center of the investigation, a lot more people would give it at least some credence.  </p>

<p>Obviously, you do your thing and I&#39;ll do mine.  I just find it fascinating that so many people here dismiss that out of hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like it&#39;s all political theater to keep the big scary Russia threat going. They want us scared and divided. They want to keep the military industrial complex going so they must slowly but surely keep progressing the War on Terror to lead to a WW3... which is really just NATO vs. Russia/Iran/Syria</p>

<p>I see it&#39;s way above and beyond Trump and Putin actually in some kind of a connection... I see it as TPTB were so sure that Hillary was going to win and even though she didn&#39;t they still had Trump fall into place anyway (as always they own every side)... and they play out the Russia scare tactics as you see it.</p>

<p>If Hillary had won, we&#39;d still see the Russia threat but maybe more in a direct way because Hillary was ready and willing to start shooting down Russian jets that did anything wrong in the slightest.</p>

<p>In the end, who knows... we will never get believable answers from the very intelligence agencies that have committed untold atrocities around the world (CIA).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the Earth and our Solar System are in constant cycles of change. I also believe our governments are exploiting this to fullest degree and putting all blame on the common man while almost all of the problem is industrial / corporation related. I&#39;m not saying we all can&#39;t do things to help improve our environment... but so much of it is out of our hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice post. Funny I consider my eye opening event as watching the same video, but it was the part about how money system works that got me. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything about the belief or disbelief of God. </p>

<p>You said aliens are real because of all of the extensions of space, but what if you&#39;re lied to about that?  What if space isn&#39;t what you&#39;re tought?  Just a thought. </p>

<p>Again.  Good post. I don&#39;t agree with everything but a lot I do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, every time I go through my list after I post it... I always forget something. There are so many things to question in this world!</p>

<p>God / Religion</p>

<ul>
<li>The original mind construct to control people en masse</li>
<li>Our first crack at trying to understand the idea of spiritualism</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve always liked the idea that we are the Universe experiencing itself in many different forms...</p>

<p>You have a good point about Space... we truly have no idea other than what we&#39;ve been told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is..This is good. I like what you have done here, and hope to fill in some gaps. </p>

<p>Chem-trails - Weather is a public image on this one. The government has sprayed pesticides on us since the 1920&#39;s. To euthanize the population. </p>

<p>TBTP - Pushing towards a direction that is against mass population. Calling for mass death events. Ted Turner the Head of CNN literally quoted saying that last sentence. </p>

<p>Aliens - Real, but haven&#39;t visited. A psi-op established to create a new demographic. Project Blue Book is a lie. A farce much like Roswell to generate interest in a concept that is to far away from happening. Giving the masses a new enemy to fight therefor igniting the War machine. </p>

<p>Trump/Russia - Trump is a T.V. Show host who is very easily deflected in real life scenarios. Much like a pestilent child. Which means he would never be able to know if has committed treason. He is a patsy that is executed the second he steps out of their prison. </p>

<p>Moon Landings - Faked footage spliced with the help of Stanley Kubrick. (The video really is Stanley Kubrick) The Van Allen&#39;s belt is to much radiation for any human to sustain without serious protective gear. </p>

<p>Osama - An innocent man who was Gunned Down to inspire pride in the new president. We sank him to the bottom of the ocean with the rest of our secerts. </p>

<p>The Holocaust - Exxagerated to paint Nazi&#39;s as nonredeemable enemies for war machine to fight. Also gave the Medal of Honor, and COD franchise something to do for 6+ games.. That being said  the evidence doesn&#39;t paint the events to 100% inaccurate. Much more research is required in my opinion. .  </p>

<p>Vaccines - Have been contaminated with toxins, and leads to more eugenics. They want to the Euthanize the poor. </p>

<p>Antarctica - Is the mother land of the future. Once the poles shift, and the Ice melts every sane person will move to Antarctica. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my opinion is that it&#39;s unclear where he was because he was setting up plausible deniability. i think it was a triangular crossfire team set up from Dwight Eisenhower&#39;s last days for cuban revolutionaries. Operation 40 renamed to operation mongoose created 5 paramilitary bases where they literally trained in assassinations. the same dude on the national security council for kennedy were the ones who created the operation under Dwight E. the same guys who JFK pissed off by opening up a direct line of communication to Kruschev to dismantle the nuclear armaments. the same armaments the NSC has spent a decade hoarding  to remain in the power position over other non nuclear countries. like the governments in latin america that were destabilized when the economic hitmen couldn&#39;t sell loans to develop the natural resources. the spooks were sent in to kill and reestablish a pro-american corporation nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent my weekend reading this extensive and excellent series on the Bush Sr./JFK suspicions, which I believe are excerpted from a full-length manuscript I need to get my hands on. </p>

<p><a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/2013/09/16/part-1-mr-george-bush-of-the-central-intelligence-agency/">https://whowhatwhy.org/2013/09/16/part-1-mr-george-bush-of-the-central-intelligence-agency/</a></p>

<p>Some of the key claims to this idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>While ostensibly the head of a small Texas oil company, the young GWB was traveling the world and meeting various dignitaries-- suspected to be CIA before he entered politics. </li>
<li>In the days preceding JFK&#39;s assassination, there is an FBI record of a man calling in with a lead on a potential assassination plot, self-ID&#39;d as GWB. Records of this call were confidential until I think &#39;94. </li>
<li>In that call, GWB claims that a guy associated with his own Republican office has been talking about killing the president. He also says he is in a small town in Texas at the time. Either a day or two later, JFK is killed. </li>
<li>Later research suggests a meeting was set up between another GWB associate and his suggested conspirator, in order to provide an alibi for both that would only be discovered long after the fact. The suggested conspirator (whose name escapes me, my apologies) was supposedly a patsy who committed no crime, was just some politically-active weird but quiet guy. </li>
<li>The main idea here was GWB sending the FBI on a wild goose chase red herring while an actual assassination plot was underway, a successful one. If GWB was CIA even back then, this overlaps with notions that the CIA knew the eventual 9/11 hijackers were in the US at the time, but did&#39;t notify the FBI or the executive branch (allegedly). </li>
<li>Where GWB actually was on the day JFK was killed is still up in the air. His wife published a letter in her memoir supposedly from the era that places them in another town at the time, detailing whom they were with and activities they were a part of (sort of like an unprompted alibi for GWB). </li>
<li>There was some confusion about GWB staying at a hotel in Dallas, which he did just before the shooting. I forget the details exactly but it was portrayed in the article as another red herring-type thing that might cover the fact that GWB might have returned to that hotel but there&#39;d only be a record of the previous, pre-assassination hotel stay (like another planted alibi). This was mentioned in his call to the FBI.</li>
</ul>

<p>I very much suggest checking out the series, it lays out these things much better than I can here, getting into the meat of it around Parts 4+5. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zeitgeist was intriguing, but some pretty serious alarms went off for me when it got to the Lindbergh/FDR stuff.</p>

<p>Lindbergh had some nice words to say, for sure. But he was a Nazi sympathizer. There&#39;s just no other way to put it.</p>

<p>He went to Germany many times, to receive honorary titles and medals and ceremonial swords from the Nazi Party. He got to test German fighter planes and palled around with the likes of Göring, Hess, and Messerschmitt.</p>

<p>When Hitler violated the Munich agreement, Lindbergh recommended that Britain increase their defenses, and said that they should NOT attack Hitler because he hoped that Hitler would run wild for a while and kill as many commies as possible. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>He was an Anglo-Saxon master race theorist, a eugenecist, and an anti-Semite. He had seven bastard children from three women while he was married. None of the children knew their father&#39;s identity for decades.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the &quot;FDR did Pearl Harbor&quot; theory. If you believe that, you absolutely must ignore many crucial facts, most importantly the famous &quot;war warning&quot; sent to both Pearl Harbor commanders two weeks before the Japanese attacked. Among other things, the cable sent to Pearl Harbor said that negotiations had broken down, and that &quot;an aggressive move by Japan is expected within the next few days.&quot; The warning ordered them to &quot;execute a defensive deployment,&quot; and &quot;undertake reconnaissance.&quot; But they were not the most energetic officers and they didn&#39;t expect Pearl Harbor to be a target. How in the hell is that Roosevelt&#39;s fault?</p>

<p>The Pearl Harbor commanders had cruisers, destroyers, battleships, submarines, and a ton of airplanes. They should have done more. They were <em>ordered</em> to do more. General Short even had a couple hundred airplanes that could have been on recon patrol but instead he had them lined up on the runways so that he could make sure civilians weren&#39;t sabotaging them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if we were to dig deep into local Pakistani news archives from the time, it would reveal more detail about his death. It&#39;s not a subject I&#39;ve really put effort into researching. Everything about the raid on his compound with Hoax Team Six seems so fake and dumb, so I just have no problem believing that whole story was fake -- especially since it was right around the time that the Obama birther issue might have become a big story. And if he really did have kidney disease, I don&#39;t see how he would have lived for another decade while on the lam hiding in caves, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No planes hit the twin towers either. The footage depicted physically impossible events, therefore has to be fake, and was full of anomalies that prove it is fake anyway.</p>

<p>Why would they fake 2 crash sites and then use 2 real planes? Either way, the only argument people can make in favor of planes hitting the towers is &quot;hundreds/thousands of people saw it&quot; which they can not even begin to demonstrate because it&#39;s not true.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#39;re not sure about the moon landings, that&#39;s probably my favorite conspiracy theory so I&#39;ll recommend some stuff you can consider watching.</p>

<p>OP refuses to accept Trump colluded with Russia, but &quot;isn&#39;t sure&quot; about the moon landings or vaccine safety...but is 100% convinced that aliens have lived among us for centuries, and that Sandy Hook was a false flag? This is pathetic.</p>

<p>Did you also just throw &quot;flat earth&quot; in there to make it seem more credible that you dismiss the mountains of evidence (both circumstantial and primary) that Trump colluded with Russia?</p>

<p>9/11- There was a plane that hit pentagon and there was a plane that crashed near shankville (or whatever it is called) all the &quot;stories&quot; that denied these are just psy-ops preventing you for seeing the whole picture/conspiracy on 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are only two supported accounts of confiscated footage outside the five-frame Pentagon security tapes: Citgo and Doubletree. These tapes were publicly released years ago. </p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that more than three tapes around the Pentagon&#39;s vicinity were seized by the FBI.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no proof that other tapes apart from the parking lot footage depict a Boeing 757 impact.</strong></p>

<p>The rest of the claimed &quot;85 confiscated videotapes&quot; were <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php?title=FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos#The_videos_in_detail"><em>voluntarily sent in</em></a> from private individuals to the FBI&#39;s field offices, and are privately held footage. Thus, in order to release them publicly, permission would need to be secured from the individual who owns that footage. The majority of the tapes sent in have no relation to the Pentagon crash at all. </p>

<p>Neither the DoD nor the FBI ever claimed to have eighty-five tapes depicting a Boeing 757 crash into the Pentagon, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to. </p>

<p>A 2004 FOIA request asked for footage depicting the crash of Flight 77. The agent who replied to the FOIA request determined that the FBI &quot;was in possession of eighty-five videotapes <strong>related</strong> to 9/11&quot;. It then went on to categorize what was contained on 29 of the tapes she reviewed personally. (The other 56 cropped up in an initial database search and didn&#39;t even show the Pentagon building). </p>

<p>16 of those 29 tapes showed the Pentagon, but <strong>&quot;did not show the Pentagon crash site nor the impact into the Pentagon.&quot;</strong> Of the remaining 13 videos, 12 showed the Pentagon only <em>after</em> the impact. That leaves just one tape: the parking lot footage. Which was released. 14 years ago. 
The other videos weren&#39;t released, because <strong>those did not fulfill the claimant&#39;s request.</strong> The person asked for footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, and the <strong>closest tapes to that request</strong> that the agent could find were the Doubletree and Citgo tapes (i.e. it captured when the impact happened, but not directly).</p>

<p>In other words, the agent was simply itemizing the tapes she thought the FBI had, and excluded the ones which weren&#39;t relevant to the person&#39;s request. </p>

<p>Somehow, no-planers read the quotation above, and got the idea that the FBI confiscated 85 tapes that showed clear footage of the impact. This is how the &quot;confiscated tapes&quot; claim got started: from a misreading of a reply to a FOIA request.</p>

<p>In complying with the FOIA request, the FBI released the relevant footage it had. This is how we got the Doubletree and Citgo videos. Up until 2006 we only had the five-frame Pentagon video (which is the only tape the Pentagon has which clearly depicts the crash).</p>

<p><strong>The seized footage has been publicly released and is available on YouTube.</strong></p>
