        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I heard Richard Lighthouse recently discussing &quot;the Lighthouse frequency&quot;. I don&#39;t know if he discovered it and named it, or if he&#39;s maybe writing/working under a pseudonym. But the gist of his theory/discovery is that the universe blinks on and off at more than 1 trillion cycles every second (1.039 THz).</p>

<p>He has math to prove this, apparently, and uses the numbers to explain the science behind the propulsion system found at Roswell and the events of 9/11 (building off the work of Phil Corso and Judy Wood, respectively). His theory also lends credence (or flat out would confirm) the electric universe cosmology.</p>

<p>I&#39;m lazy, so I&#39;m pasting the math from his website for those interested. (<a href="http://www.rlighthouse.com/):">http://www.rlighthouse.com/):</a></p>

<p>&quot;I have provided 3 different mathematical approaches and 3 different empirical sources that all conclude the same thing: Our universe is literally blinking.</p>

<p>Electron Spin Resonance  X  1024 Elementary Particles [1024-QAM]  =  1015 MHz  X  1024  =  1.039 THz</p>

<p>The second method for calculating this frequency: Convert a &quot;fundamental&quot; energy of 66.6 milli electron-volts into a frequency, it results in 1.039 THz. This &#39;fundamental&#39; energy can be demonstrated using the Anthropic Principal, the fundamental temperature/freezing point of water, and the Boltzmann constant. Calculation is as follows: 66.6 meV / (hbar pi<sup>4)</sup> = 1.039 THz. Note that the pi<sup>4</sup> in general is pi<sup>D,</sup> where D is the number of spacetime dimensions in existence. The full equation can be found in &#39;Blinking Universe: Alternate Mathematical Solution&#39;.</p>

<p>The gravitational acceleration will be found to vary continuously (like a sine wave) between zero and a maximum = 9.81mps<sup>2/.637</sup> = 15.4 mps<sup>2,</sup> and yet retain a time-averaged value of 9.81. Similarly, the electromagnetic force will also be found to vary continuously and retain a time-averaged value.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found the EU theory to be compelling, even if it does accept NASA science/cosmology as gospel. But this is the same thing Tesla was working with, and he seems to be held in high esteem around these parts. Thought this was worth sharing. Can&#39;t recall seeing this on here before, but please do share any info on this if you have it. I&#39;m interested.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>EU seems like an incredibly easy theory to test for. </p>

<p>What happens to object put into EM shielded boxes? What about introducing additional energy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>any and all objects will emit EM waves. the box is shielding, meaning no more can get in other then whats in already. I think that we would need a way to examine the packets of information attached to the EM waves prior to enclosure in the box, during, and after. to see how the perception of the energy may have changed to to seclusion from em waves from an outside source.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But wouldnt this mean that EM isnt interacting with any field outside of the box?</p>

<p>This must have an implication to the weight of the object. </p>

<p>If we could put an object in a gravitationly shielded box we would expect to see only the gravitational field of the item in the box, aka a very very weak one. </p>

<p>Same should be applicable to EM. If the shielded box doesnt dramatically alter the weight of the object then we know there must be an attractive force other than EM</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, its just not receiving any em waves being emitted from anything outside the box, it will still collect energy from the box and everything in the box.it would still be interacting with a higgs field.I don&#39;t see how it wouldn&#39;t drastically change the mass of the energy inside the box.it would still be under the effects of electrical and magnetic fields that exist inside of the box.</p>

<p>The first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the Moon&#39;s surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length.[2] Similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a Q-switched ruby laser.[3] Greater accuracy was achieved following the installation of a retroreflector array on July 21, <strong>1969, by the crew of Apollo 11,</strong></p>

<p>To see each locale, a 4-inch or larger telescope magnifying 75× or higher will get the job done. But the larger the scope and higher the power, the closer you&#39;ll be able to pinpoint each landing site and better able to visualize the scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying I believe any of this (I&#39;m here for the entertainment value) but there are 2 responses for your question. </p>

<p>The first is that we did go to the moon but it was a suicide mission. Neil and Buzz and others did the &quot;fake&quot; stuff here on earth (for PR) and unnamed others actually went to the moon but either on a one way trip or died of radiation poisoning after the return (van Allen belts and cosmic rays and whatnot). </p>

<p>The second is that no one ever went there and the stuff that was put there (mirrors and anything else we can detect from earth) were sent and placed by unmanned probes and/or rovers. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not worth arguing with because I don&#39;t believe this shit, just like to watch the stuff on YouTube for entertainment so I&#39;ve seen both sides of the argument. </p>

<p>I actually haven&#39;t heard of the ISS being fake (mentioned in this post), so I&#39;ll have to add that to my watch list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easiest way to shut down the &quot;Moon landing is fake&quot; people is Russia(or USSR at the time).  They would  have called us out on it, and they didn&#39;t and haven&#39;t.  We&#39;ve seen the sites from Satellites now and both China and Japan has verified it. But you keep living in the Dark Ages and the rest will keep on moving forward.   </p>

<p>What&#39;s scary, is people like this doing what those teachers in the movie Interstellar where they denied we went to the moon and were spreading those lies to kids.    With all of the people who think that because they don&#39;t understand something somehow gives their ignorance equal footing with real science and real facts is downright depressing.  It used to be when you didn&#39;t understand something you doubled down on getting more educated so you could at least have cursory understanding of the truth.  Now, it&#39;s just lazy people who think learning is  hard  and it&#39;s easy to just make shit up or believe others who make shit up.</p>
