      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Today, March 31st 2017, WikiLeaks releases Vault 7 "Marble" -- 676 source code files for the CIA's secret anti-forensic Marble Framework. Marble is used to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marble does this by hiding ("obfuscating") text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection. This is the digital equivallent of a specalized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U.S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marble forms part of the CIA's anti-forensics approach and the CIA's Core Library of malware code. It is "[D]esigned to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation" as "string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop."
       </p>
       <p>
        The Marble source code also includes a deobfuscator to reverse CIA text obfuscation. Combined with the revealed obfuscation techniques, a pattern or signature emerges which can assist forensic investigators attribute previous hacking attacks and viruses to the CIA. Marble was in use at the CIA during 2016. It reached 1.0 in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        The source code shows that Marble has test examples not just in English but also in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi. This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion, --- but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Marble Framework is used for obfuscation only and does not contain any vulnerabilties or exploits by itself.

       Perhaps, but with measures come countermeasures.  The depth of cyber resources held by the security apparatuses of great powers is unknown, there may very well not be any such exploit but I've learned enough about history to not underestimate their capabilities, as there may be measures outside of cyberspace as their disposal that bypasses any assumed anonymity.

       Source code obfuscation != false attribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had actually read the Crowdstrike report you would see this doesn't really change what they said either, the attribution was mostly based on the tools used by the groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean the Crowdstrike report is definitely true, the only real 100% surefire ways of attribution are pretty much limited to capabilities reserved for intelligence agencies.

       Im not 100 sure but I don't think anyone has the ability to 100% verify without actually capturing the people responsible. Even if there was a concrete way to link it to russian hacking groups you would have to link those groups directly to the government, which is probably as difficult.

       That's not what's it's saying. It's impossible to fake the origin of an attack (i.e., a source IP address) which is why these attacks are run through compromised 3rd party computers or through Tor to try to make the originating computer harder to track down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they're talking about here is leaving misleading clues in the malware source to try to confuse investigators. Does it work? Probably not but it would make issuing a press release with the desired narrative easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       at all difficult to scrub a binary of anything that would point to a specific group. There's no magic in concealing the authorship of a piece of malware. This is more about -- surprise -- 'false flag' or falsely attributed attacks.
