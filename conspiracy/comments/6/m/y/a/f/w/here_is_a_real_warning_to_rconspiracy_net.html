       I have reposted the following on multiple threads in regards to Net Neutrality and you know the type of responses I got. Please read this and keep in mind that while I am not the first person to find this information and post it, almost no one else is.

       and in fact most of the internet that isn't controlled by the Globalist Elite (Neo Cons / Neo Libs owned by Soros for example) is fundamentally built on what Net Neutrality outlaws. Please read and look at how they completely outlaw trolling, memes, hell even trash talking on the internet or any form of communication over a telecommunication device. If you want the internet to have any chance then we need places like Conspiracy and many other great places that don't censor everything we read and everything we watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that never gets talked about in these Net Neutrality astroturf threads (look at the upvote to comment ratios) is that Title II Net Neutrality applies censorship laws to the internet. Notice how the pro-Net Neutrality posters always talk about the possibility that Comcast or Verizon will "censor" certain content. What they fail to mention is that the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Timeline_of_significant_events">
        Law that the FCC reinterpreted and applied to ISPs in 2015
       </a>
       and called "Net Neutrality" actually contains obscenity laws and speech codes that explicitly censor "obscene" or "annoying" content. What the FCC is calling "Net Neutrality" is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the (until now) open internet. Let's not forget the FCC's
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_States">
        horrible track record on our First Amendment rights.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The censorship portion of the Law is under Section 223.
       <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">
        But don't take my word on it, read the Law itself.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;

       Let's get something else straight: it's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       ISPs that have a dog in this fight. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Conde Nast,
       <strong>
        all of whom censor content,
       </strong>
       are pro-Net Neutrality.
       <strong>
        The idea that Title II will somehow prevent censorship is insane - we already have censorship on the internet and Title II will do absolutely nothing to stop Google/Facebook/Twatter/Conde Nast from censoring whatever they feel like censoring.
       </strong>
       In fact, the "Net Neutrality" passed down by the FCC does exactly what people say it's supposed to prevent - censorship - and it's important to cut through the bullshit and expose what's really going on here, which is one corporate lobby (websites) astroturfing public opinion to get a different corporate lobby (ISPs) to do them a favor by not throttling their traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FCC
       <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/08/fcc-rules-against-comcast-bit-torrent-blocking">
        was already enforcing a version of Net Neutrality before Title II.
       </a>

        Here
       </a>
       , a memo from all the way back in 2005. Remind me why we need Title II with its censorship laws, to protect us from censorship, again??
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a fucking break. This is bait and switch - get a censorship Law applied to the internet and call it "Net Neutrality," fearmonger/astroturf until the public willingly accepts it. "OH NO! COMCAST IS COMING FOR MY NETFLIX!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       They could pass literally anything and call it "Net Neutrality" and reddit would eat it up like the idiots they are, because some anonymous post with +590190818 upvotes told them it was a good idea.

       We do need net neutrality, but without censorship. ISPs will throttle the internet without regulation, but too much regularion is always bad, especially regulation that restricts free speech. Then again, that may just be my opinion, but I needed to say it.
