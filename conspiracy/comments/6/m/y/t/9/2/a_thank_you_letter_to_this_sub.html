        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I left a dead end overnight job a year ago looking for meaning in life and I found it in more ways than one.</p>

<p>About 5 months later I was &quot;red pilled&quot; as I would describe it. Long story short this led to me having direct involvement with powerful people in the occult and I ended up in a mental hospital for 10 days (if you want to read a more detailed account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hg2vt/pineal_glands_third_eye_is_one_of_the_biggest/diyrvre/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hg2vt/pineal_glands_third_eye_is_one_of_the_biggest/diyrvre/</a>).</p>

<p>I was told I was crazy, prescribed 5-6 different medications, diagnosed with bipolar and schizophrenia symptoms, and went into a deep state of depression for months.</p>

<p>About a month ago I found this sub and found a community in which I could explain my situation and not be told I was crazy. I actually had people private message me offering words of support and some people saying they had similar experiences.</p>

<p>This has allowed me to lift a big burden off my chest, and realize that whatever happened is okay and has helped me to develop effective methods to deal with moving forward. I no longer use any medications and moved into a healthier environment after being in a standstill for 6 months after these events happened. </p>

<p>This sub also allows me to have a healthy discussion with people who are open minded to the idea that the world is not the way it seems.</p>

<p>So thank you r/conspiracy for helping me move forward with my life and find effective methods to spread truth in a productive manner.</p>
