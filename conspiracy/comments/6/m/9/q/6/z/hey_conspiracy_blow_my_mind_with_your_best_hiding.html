        This photograph was taken on Air Force One.
       </a>
       Immediately after being sworn in as the 36th president in a coup, LBJ, standing next to Jackie Kennedy (with her husband's blood still on her dress), turns to his long-time friend, Texas congressman Albert Thomas and smiles, as Thomas returns a wink. And a smirk.
The White House photographer who took this photo, Cecil Stoughton, has stated he feels as if this photograph is "sinister".

       High school. AP classes. It was one of those whatchamacallits. The things where they give you a collection of photos or political cartoons and you have to write about their historic context (e.g. identify the people in the photos, describe their relationships to one another, then explain what happened as a result of the event featured.)

       See, I'm not convinced that is him. Don't get me wrong, I think he's a piece of shit (the only man on earth who "couldn't remember" where he was when JFK was shot, clue Georgie, it was fucking Dallas) but the mouth doesn't quite seem to match up for me.

       This, sadly, is one of the many, many double standards in this sub - it's ok to push this 'unknown, unverifiable and dubious' source because it fits 'the narrative' of the Oklahoma conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That aerial photograph could have been taken at any time at any location and then attributed to being in Oklahoma. For it to be an acceptable piece of evidence, the negatives need to be seen, the flight log checked and the claimed location double and triple checked. Otherwise it's just a picture that claims to show a 'bomb factory' (even though it looks more like a field hospital), and claims it was taken around the time leading up to the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really, really dubious and completely unsubstantiated.

       You're going out of your way to comment on this photo, twice and not bother with any of the others. Too obvious, you need to come at it a bit more discreetly. You'll get the hang of it, keep at it.

       Those photographs have no surrounding evidence. The posters are making claims about them that neither of them have been able to substantiate. This sub is supposed to be for critical thinkers but as soon as anyone picks up on two separate posters making the same unsubstantiated claim, that's apparently "desperate".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have actually taken more than just those two to task on the veracity of the images posted. If you have the time, stop and wonder why so many people are blindly excepting contextless images that have had a story attached to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is full of people claiming to be aware of psy-ops and deep state actions, yet a bunch of people who are posting images they have been told are this or that, without stopping to do even basic critical analysis of who/where/why/when/how these images are being used or on the Internet is perfectly acceptable. How is that possible? Everything here should be questioned and not just accepted on face value.

       Only if you think it's bizarre that within several years after this photo, Jim would become a rock and roll megastar and figurehead of the peace movement despite having no musical experience whatsoever (he once said he didn't even sing in the shower) and his dad would be directly involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident, i.e. the false flag that started the Vietnam War, and Jim would go on to deny that he even had a living father.

       Ok, it was the ship his father was in command of (The USS Bon Homme Richard). It was decommissioned the day before JM "died" (July 2 1971). There are conflicting accounts as to whether this was the aircraft carrier involved in the gulf of Tonkin incident but it seems that Morrison was in command of that carrier division at the time. Strange coincidences indeed.

       i still don't understand what conspiracy there would be...yes it's interesting that Jim and his dad were polar opposites serving very different sides but what possible connection would Jim have to any shady government stuff?? He likely disavowed his father precisely because he was ashamed of his role in helping to start the Vietnam War. I've seen theories about how the government hated people like Jim, Janis, John Lennon and Jimi spreading a revolutionary attitude and that's why they were possibly even assassinated. Yeah he didn't have musical experience but he wrote a lot of things and became a singer, reluctantly too if you know the actual story...he wouldn't even face the crowd in the early days because he was so shy/nervous. He knew Ray from film school and Ray already had a lot of experience playing in his own band before.

       You should probably read more about the Laurel Canyon scene to see the bizarre connections between all these 60s celebrities and the military/intel complex. Morrison's story is not unique. For there not to be some conspiracy here there would have to be a couple dozen insane coincidences.

       Yeah, but his voice is good.  Very on pitch for 1960s recordings.  His dad prob pulled strings but the lizard king stuff doesnt seem like something the establishment would sponsor.   I could believe a conspiracy it started that way and he said f that so they killed him thou..that seems logical.

       my understanding is that frank zappa's father was a chemist who had been employed at the edgewood arsenal chemical warfare center.
      </p>
      <p>
       from wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents.[10][11] The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident.[12] This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.[13]
       </p>
       <p>
        Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation,[14] and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.[15]
       </p>
       <p>
        Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore.[12][14] In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health.[16] They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California,[17] then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.[18]

       the way i understand it is that the cia (or some similar govt agency) wanted to morph the antiwar movement into something less potentially damaging to the military industrial complex, so they had people like the "lizard king" inject the notion of psychedelic drugs and similar sentiment into the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       the laurel canyon music crowd, timothy leary, frank zappa, et al., were all vectors for injecting distraction into the anti-war movement.  nobody's voting or protesting if they're high on LSD and psilocybin.

       I'm reading the book right now by Dave McGowan. 100 pages in. Extremely fascinating. I always liked the Byrds, Jackson Browne, the Beach Boys, and psychedelic 60s rock in general, but had no idea about that scene.

       This is one of the better conspiracies out there. Rock and Roll of the 1960s was essentially created by the CIA. It goes along with the 432hz conspiracy as well to make the American people more war like by brainwashing the public with disharmonic tones in the music they listen to. The Dorian mode as Aristotle called it has been known for millennia. It is suppressed knowledge that is not shared with the masses.

       Why would you not want to convince people that you have genuine evidence of your claim? Why leave it in the hands of fate? If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       have evidence of your claim in these photographs, point it out, otherwise you are supporting a position of ignorance and actively suppressing the knowledge whilst simultaneously claiming that everyone who questions you is beneath contempt. It's not going to help anyone believe that you actually have a solid point.

       So you have nothing. Nothing of substance, nothing to support your claim, just a bunch of images from the Internet that you claim to be evidence, but you want to keep everyone in ignorance because you are too much of a snowflake to put your money where your mouth is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about what I believe - it's about what you believe and why others should believe you. The abiding principle of this sub is "question everything" but that is a problem for you when you're being questioned about how three seemingly unconnected, unidentified and apparently normal buildings support your claim. You're not doing yourself or this sub any favours by your attitude. Question everything but you. Hmmm.

       I was very fascinated by this, but the fact that (according to a local who commented in your linked thread) this is only in some places in Europe which has me thinking it was most likely a natural disaster of sorts, like a few floods/mud-slides over the decades.

       However it is still strange as fuck that they would remain buried for so long. That being said do you have anymore pictures besides the one linked in your original - that genuinely looks like the aftermath of a natural disaster from sometime in the last 30 years.

       Well, they used the channels as open sewers. The tide would take out  the dirty water, bring in clean water. I wouldn't want to be on the first floor. It may have been a clean place back before the world discovered soap, but the water smells like shit, and it floods.

       I'm assuming that's Cleopatra's Needle in NY? (It was actually commissioned by a much more ancient pharaoh, not Cleopatra just FYI). I've seen it in person - it's an amazing thing to see something so old just sitting in a park in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that looks like a pretty hefty pulley machine to me. I don't really see why it would have to be hollow? I remember reading that there was a lot of misfortune that occurred with moving the obelisks out of Egypt. Several people died transporting the twin version to London.

       ah this ones actually 200 tons still a shit ton of cars. Way to many for those little ropes. Think of the ropes needed to erect the alexander column at 661 tons using even more primitive tools than the people who are erecting the needle in those photos because this was in the middle of no where in russia in 1830. Well the answer is really simple.

       i mean verify for yourself but many of these "basements" are vaulted. You can clearly see the original foundation strutting out from the side of the unburied wall in the op i made. why build an elaborate foundation if it was to be buried? How did they move all this earth? how did they dig in the Siberian permafrost? i'm sure some of the photos i provided show windows completely buried only recently excavated. Rooms that people didn't even know existed. In a few you can see that these are proper full length windows that in many instances have been converted. but like i said  look closely and decide for yourself.

       solid approach. read the comments in part 1 and part two. a few people have brought up good points. Yet i still see evidence that something moved a few billion lbs of earth at some point 200-300 years ago

       You know that can be true without it being a political conspiracy, right? Why take a chance with the only habitable planet we have? We already know we'll run out of fossil fuels, it's simply insane to not plan for the future with renewable energy. i'll never understand people who want to treat the earth like an ashtray.

       Most people can't afford to be Ju'd out of any more money.. Taxes are already to high, and if you want to donate to a good cause. By all means, Ju yourself out and fork out the money. Just leave the rest of us alone as we try to enjoy our lives away from big government.

       Corbett Report just did a pretty great video on this. Basically every couple years, we have just a few years to save the Earth by reducing emissions. I mean, we should reduce emissions so we stop destroying life around the planet, but it's a hoax by way of being blown out of proportion.

       One problem with your counter "theory" is that there are many more differences between the faces of these two men beyond the teeth and the age. Another problem with your theory is that it isn't based on any evidence, unlike the theory presented in the paper I linked to. It sounds like you pulled it out of your ass. Wait, let me guess: It's possible to pull theories out of your ass now, it just hasn't been made commercially available yet.

       You aren't convinced that there are civilian trucks, in a military enclosure, that are barricaded so they can't be identified at ground level?

       You aren't convinced that the OKC bombing was alleged to have involved a Ryder truck, and you aren't convinced that McVeigh 'attempted' to pass Special Ops selection part of which was linked to the base in that photo?

       It's still not great evidence for the specific photographs you posted. A square compound near to a stand of pine trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence I would accept is the flight log of the aircraft that the pictures were taken from. Seeing the negatives would be a help, too. Negatives have certain markings on them that enable basic dating. Even with the links you have, kindly, provided aren’t solid evidence.

       Being skeptical is the only way to make sure that the conspiracies that are uncovered aren't merely distractions.

       Oh come on. You're simply denying what's been put in front of you to retain your stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were skeptical and said it couldn't be verified where. I just sent you a link to Google Earth/Maps which so far as I am aware is considered pretty 'live' in the US. The points in the picture are specifically marked out for comparison.

       To suggest you want pilot log's is crazy. Do police require GPS data of a car if they have a incriminating pictures? No. Photographic intelligence is still one of the most reliable ways of verifying a location, regardless of your opinion.

       Strawman. The two are incomparable. The pilot of a aeroplane has to complete a flight plan and a log. No such information is required for a car driver.

      <p>
       Really, its not. Especially when the photograph is from film, the photographer unknown, the sequence of images unknown and the location - despite your links - is still in doubt. There's no supporting evidence to back up the images.

       Why are you so worried about my opinion? I am asking you to verify your claim that the place in the pictures is where you claim it to be, was taken when you claim it was, and the things in the image are what you claim they are. Those things aren't opinions, those things should be easily proven, if it is as you say it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am keeping an open mind on it but there's still no evidence to suggest that the pictures were taken, where and when they are alleged to have been.

       I provided evidence of the location. If you feel a truck like that, concealed like that is normal on a military base, you havent served.

       And if you had spent any time in any intelligence or military branch you would know that PHOTINT remains very real and in use. Navy, Airforce and Army.

       I am not interested in your opinion, you shared it. I showed the location but you must stick to your view rather than reviewing it properly and thinking 'hmmm actually that is odd'.

       Either way, your request for verification of the location was answered. You are choosing not to accept it.

       some of the jet fuel didn't ignite, seeped into the ground, and burst into flames. With nowhere to go, it somehow heated itself hotter than the chemical reaction could possibly make it, and melted the ground.

       Okay for real what really puts me off is how close the shadow of the lander is to the horizon of the moon like I know the moon is pretty damn tiny, but  there's no way it's that tiny. I still really wanna believe this happened cause it's not too far-fetched but just that one detail's really off-putting.

       That's incredible horseshit. The most advanced engineering feat of all time that hasn't even come close to being replicated is easier to do than film some footage in a studio? That's a line by the disinfo agent SG Collins.

       On mobile so I can't link the video but IIRC the argument was that you needed a high frame rate to record astronauts on earth jumping around them slow it down to look like moon gravity. Also the distance of the light based upon the shadows or something.

       What would the Russians have to gain? This is at the height of the cold war. If the Soviets come out and say its fake, the US media will just dismiss this as propaganda. Not to mention this would increase tensions at a time when tensions are already high.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a lot more beneficial for the Soviets to blackmail the US in some manner rather than spill the beans for little to no gain.

       Apollo 1 fire which murdered Grissom, White and Chaffee probably convinced the astronauts to shutup.

       Death of Robert Barron probably got the techs to shutup.

       I'm telling you now it didn't happen and look how emotional your reaction is! When the public at large has been brainwashed to believe that anyone promoting the fake moon landing theory is a kook, its easy to keep the public fooled.

       Tell me this: Why is there no radiation damage on any of the photos or videos? Why did Apollo use human test subjects to test the viability of existing beyond Earth's magnetosphere? How come this 45 year old feat hasn't been reproduced? Technology gets better, faster, cheaper, etc... except when it comes to the moon landing. On and on it goes...

       That's ludicrous. The Mercury program sent up dogs and chimps to test the viability of mammalian cells in low earth orbit. But for the first ever manned Saturn-V launch, they use human test subjects to verify the radiation outside Earth's magnetosphere?  To test the viability of mammalian cells outside the magnetosphere, likely the most inhospitable environment we could imagine, they'll just risk it because of the space race?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then years later, when it's discovered that the moon emits much more ionising radiation than previously thought, why didn't this additional radiation show up in the dosimeters of the astronauts?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would they send the third ever launch of a Saturn V rocket into circumlunar orbit? First, the previous Saturn V launch had failures. Moreover, the first time the can and LM we're tested beyond the magnetosphere was during Apollo 8?

       That implies calling us out would leave them in a better position than before. If not, then there is no reason to do so, just like China, India, and Japan are sending shit into space and not letting us know what is really going on.

       There would be gas created by the rocket fuel combustion. That's exactly how a rocket engine works, by creating gas and expelling it forcefully.

       But released in a vacuum, it behaves much differently. Additionally, the moon is 1/8 the earth's gravity. Landing under rocket power in this instance wasn't an issue because we had a trainer for astronauts here on earth that used a downward pointing jet engine. The LEM was piloted by a human. SpaceX made history because it was landed by a computer. It looks like it was made with flimsy materials because it basically was. It was designed to be light weight. Pressurizing a vessel to one atmosphere in a vacuum is different than trying to maintain a relative vacuum inside lots of pressure like a submarine. Flying in a vacuum meant it could be an odd shape, and there weren't forces acting on it like there would be for an airplane. The LEM was not a space ship. It carried astronauts from the CM to the moon and then back. It was used once for life support when the apollo 13 CM had to be shut down while they went around the moon and back and it almost failed at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that deny the moon landings happened always seem to do it based on stuff like this. The moon is not that far away. We can do almost anything when we stop trying to be a corrupt fascist police state for 2 seconds and try to accomplish something amazing. The apollo program was 300 billion dollars maybe when adjusted for inflation. We spent much more on that bombing poor people in the desert. Bombing the desert got us nowhere. The space program was one of the best investments in human history.

       I see, so if pretend for a second that we never did go to the moon, you're telling me that NASA doesn't exist? The space program didn't happen? Rockets were never built? Nothing launched? Millions of people worked on the space program either directly or for a contractor. What were they getting paid with?

       Vaccines.
There are thousands of studies published in peer-reviewed scientific literature proving that vaccines are neither safe nor effective.
Yet the media and big pharma have the guts to claim vaccines are safe and effective. People just don't read the studies and believe the media which is bullshiting them.
