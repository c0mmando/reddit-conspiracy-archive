        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was on GLP and saw this <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3572798/pg1">thread</a> , and it made me realize what a fucking reality this is. Feminism really has created a monster. I see it affecting all generations. </p>

<p>I am a multiracial female, and I see more men with mail order brides than ever before. I see more and more single women of America, getting older, with no real relationship in site. More obsessed with their pets, living lives inside, inside their social media personas, this false perception of safety, strength, and happiness. </p>

<p>I used to be like &quot;fuck men&quot;. I grew up with a father who cheated and abused my mom, that&#39;s all I knew. But after working with a bunch of good men, I know they have empathy, intelligence, and have strengths that I don&#39;t have. It&#39;s ok, we are genetically different. Women are better as &quot;stay at home&quot;, or jobs with caring and tending to, it&#39;s what we internally register with. </p>

<p>I am sick of the assault on men who are men. I am sick of complete confusion of our society. So many lonely women all over the world...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g82Eu8oER_Q">Japan</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKR_rZz-8M">China</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaWMX8JIw_4">Korea</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a--0C-xslUY">America</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECeJMPOEr8">Millennials</a></p>

<p>How do we combat this, or is it too late? I am trying to change, revert from the messages movies, media, my friends tell me. I have disconnected from most of social media, learning to can, ferment, get in better shape, eat better. </p>

<p>I get why men don&#39;t want to date the women of now. I understand the MGTOW. Shit, that movement might be also Rockefeller backed, like hell I&#39;ll know. And the fucking pro fat movement?!??!  I am overweight myself, but I am working everyday to combat it. It&#39;s something I don&#39;t. But it&#39;s fucking disgusting. I am seeing more and more women (and men) morbidly obese. </p>

<p>Also, no one really actually dates anymore, relationships are disposable, when it gets hard, try on someone new. Feminism, poisoned food, social media really has killed romance, love...the once beautiful things of life...extinguished. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading my rant...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something probably each one of us realises in our individual conscience but the collective, social conscience still moves in the direction of the technological wave and as a part of the society we are (sometimes) forced to participate in this collective herd behaviour.</p>

<p>While ofcourse there is nothing reversible about it as a whole (as major part of the world is still to access these as a significant part of the lifestyle). We can indeed exercise our individual conscience and not be a part of this. The inertia is ofcourse present for all of us, we can try like you&#39;re doing it. Good luck with your health choices!</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">Everyone does it because they think everyone else does it.</a> </p>

<p>A majority of opinions - fabricated consensus forcefully upheld by the authority of wise men aka charlatans/ sly tongues.
Plant ideas into the collective consciousness, seed ideas into people of distinct or familiar groups, and watch them try to approach each other with the ideas you feed them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please consider the following puzzle:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>On an island where everyone knows each other, there are 100 people who have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. Since the beginning of times on that island, no one has ever known their own eye color, as there is no mirror (and no one ever talks about eye color, it&#39;s very taboo). By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers he has blue eyes, he must leave the island at dawn on the day of the discovery.

At some point, an Internet troll comes to the island, calls all the people together, climbs on a podium, and makes the following announcement in a bullhorn: &quot;At least one of you has blue eyes&quot;.

The puzzle: assuming everyone on the island is completely logical and lawful, what is the eventual outcome of that public intervention?
</code></pre>

<p>(Think about it for a few seconds before reading further. Remember everyone already knows what he just said.)</p>

<p>The answer: on the 100th day after the announcement, at dawn, all the blue-eyed people leave the island at once. It works with any other positive number of blue-eyed people (that is, if there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave on the kth day). The explanation is actually quite straightforward and is at the end of the post.</p>

<p>The point is this: a troll came and didn&#39;t teach anyone anything. In this case everyone knew at least one islander had blue eyes, as they could all see it (although they didn&#39;t speak of it). Yet, they were living happily since the beginning of times; and now all the blue-eyes companions had to exile. What changed?</p>

<p>The answer is common knowledge. Not what anyone knows, but what everyone knows that everyone knows. What counts is not the fact the islanders heard the troll say what he said, it&#39;s the fact they all saw all the other islanders listening to him say it. The individual&#39;s perception of the crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is all purposeful and intentional. New wave feminism is there to help the destruction of family and gender roles.</p>

<p>There will be no family in the future. The world state or government will be our family.</p>

<p>Love won&#39;t matter. As brave new world states, &quot;Everyone belongs to everyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>People in movements like MGTOW or extreme feminsim are missing the larger conspiracy.</p>

<p>They want men and women to hate each other. Eventually men and women will not need eachother. We will all be &quot;equal&quot; in a brave new world.</p>

<p>But wanting to go against feminism...none of my friends get it. They have become different people. I am so happy to see so many people like-minded on this topic here though!!!!! I actually wanted to post this after I was watching videos on YouTube about Japan&#39;s going to extinct, then it became this rabbit hole on how this is happening everywhere.

<p>Jesus fucking christ.

I used to think it was fun to read feminist stuff and then men&#39;s rights stuff to get an idea of the different perspectives, but now I avoid it all. </p>

<p>Some MGTOW are aware of the larger conspiracy, but whether you see it or not, the winning strategy for men in this anti-male environment is to disengage. If men try to get married with the divorce courts as messed up as they are, they lose their children and much of their earnings. </p>

<p>MGTOW is a rational response to a broken system. Anyone who wants men to return to society needs to fix society. MGTOW feel no need to fix a society that they view as destroyed by men and women who capitulated to women&#39;s desires, needs, wants, and feelings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read what I wrote?</p>

<p>MGTOW have concluded that the current environment is not conducive to having children or marrying women, and dating women is a bit risky too. As such, they&#39;ve decided not to marry, never to have children, and often not to date at all. Western society has demonstrated that women are on top, their children are beneath them, and men are dead last (in terms of societal priorities). As such, the only good option for the few men who recognize this is to disengage from women. </p>

<p>If it turned out that feminism was a product of Santa Clause, Adolf Hitler, and the Wicked Witch of the West, it wouldn&#39;t make any difference to the optimal behavioral pattern of men who care about their own wants, needs, and goals (i.e. self-actualized men). </p>

<p>So yeah, I bet they don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve brought this up with numerous MGTOW. They&#39;re right not to care. MGTOW are motivated by loyalty to themselves, and they&#39;re not going to sacrifice themselves to raise families in a system that doesn&#39;t support them in doing so. </p>

<p>What part of &quot;IT&#39;S A CONSPIRACY&quot; is supposed to matter to MGTOW, exactly? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I read what you wrote </p>

<p>1) They should care because they are perpetuating the system they hate! By hating women, they are feeding into the very beliefs and paradigms they do not like. They are supporting the global agenda to further break down traditional roles and structures.</p>

<p>2) I am not really an advocate of any selfish philosophy. That&#39;s just me though.</p>

<p>3) They can do what they want, but to me the ultimate conspiracy is spiritual. Not only does God show us how men and women should be, he shows us how we should treat others.</p>

<p>So to me, the philosophy perpetuates hatred, and God would not want that.</p>

<p>Of course not everyone I know holds the same views as me BUT</p>

<p>4) You would see that all this destruction of male and female is directly correlated with what the bible says will happen. To me, it all makes sense.</p>

<p>5) I do get where MGTOW are coming from. They can do what they feel is right for them. However, ultimately I do not think it is the right path.</p>

<p>False rape accusations, false sexual abuse accusations, no-fault divorce WITH ALIMONY and default custody to women, zero enforcement of men&#39;s time with their children, zero support for men who are abused by women... </p>

<p>The problems are easy to see. Many men, after recognizing the litany, refuse to take on the burden of trying to undo the damage that Feminist advocates have done to men, families, and society.

<p>If men want to see better gender relations they must first recognize the larger conspiracy that is making women the way they are. </p>

<p>This goes back to the first argument - the conspiracy matters and most MGTOW do not want to here it.</p>

<p>They would rather sit there anger and bitter than try to bring awareness to what&#39;s causing the issues.</p>

<p>Women are fucked up today and it is no coincidence. Instead of hating women, I feel compassion is the better route.</p>

<p>I have been I guess what most people consider MGTOW for several years. I could probably hit the character limit if I have you my whole story, but let&#39;s just say I had a woman with severe BPD absolutely destroy my life. It has taken me almost a decade to recover from it and my life has been irrevocably changed for the worse. It derailed my life trajectory permanently.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t afford that to ever happen again. Focusing on my self improvement and nothing else is the best I can do. I volunteer quite a bit and work with kids, as well. But beyond that, there&#39;s nothing I can do as an individual beyond bettering myself and giving back to my community. Relationships threaten to completely derail that at any time, so I just don&#39;t date. </p>

<p>Before you tell me that there are plenty of good women out there, let me tell you that I know that already. The woman who ruined my life had a record of mental health problems, and yet, most people in her life had no idea. She was in excellent physical shape, had a great job, was articulate and well spoken, was charismatic, was funny, and was a highly skilled and educated person. She didn&#39;t reveal her problems until we had been dating for over a year. And it was an amazing year, but then she snapped.</p>

<p>I know several men who have been through similar experiences. I don&#39;t hate women. At all. None of the guys I know who have decided to bow out do either. It&#39;s just a matter of risk analysis.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you what can be done to fix the problem. I probably will never be able to tell you that. Me marrying somebody isn&#39;t going to change anything. The best I can do is work very hard, constantly improve myself, and help the people around me to the best of my abilities. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 Now to the unmarried[a] and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do. 9 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>25 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. 26 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 27 Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. <strong>But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.</strong></p>

<p>29 What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; 30 those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; 31 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.</p>

<p>32 I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. 33 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— 34 and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. 35 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>

<p>36 If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong[b] and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. 37 <strong>But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. 38 So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dint see your post there. But i would have dgaf-ed if i had seen it. Let me guess. You came there to tell us about how much you dont symapthize about our problems, that we are women hating monsters and we should get our asses back to plantaion now!</p>

<p>I am not surprised you got a DGAF. Every woman who shows up there has to come up with the same shit. (Besides we like our little man cave over there. Little refugee from hamstering. No offence meant.).</p>

<p>MGTOW is the only option for men. Want to know why? Because women and society will never sympathize with our problems. They are incapable of doing it. If we bring up legitimate progressive backed problems like hypergamy, afbb, etc, we get called women hating loser neckbeard virgin dwarf. Dating market place is ridiculous. Marriage is a suicide: mentally, emotionally and financially.</p>

<p>Tldr: women cant sympathize with our problems. To them, they are the only and sole victims. Men exist to toil and serve them. MGTOW shows us this. We dont hate the system, nor the people. We just dont want anything to do anything with neither of those. The word id indifference, nit hate. This has been said a <strong>million</strong> times.</p>

<p>If you really want to say something there, I would suggest you to create a throwaway with a name and history that doesnt give away your gender. Because a lot of mgtow are aware of how women operate on the internet. &quot;Here are my tits, where is my special treatment&quot;.</p>

<p>Its the only place on internet where tits dont give you free shit. True equality.</p>

<p>Try to make a rational, coherent argument. </p>

<p>Avoid these stuff:</p>

<ol>
<li>Muh. I am not like women you describe. So all women must be awesomeeeeee!<br/></li>
<li>You guys just bitter and hate women<br/></li>
<li>Look, me me me me. I have tits. Me me me me me.<br/></li>
<li>Understand tge difference<br/>

<ol>
<li>Criticism vs sexism<br/></li>
<li>Hate vs indifference<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>To combat &quot;the hate&quot; you need first to understand it. I&#39;m being 100% serious, non-judgemental here.</p>

<p>Just like most racist people live in black neighborhoods for example, people that hate muslims live around muslims or were attacked by them.</p>

<p>No one is born with full-blown hate against something, hatred is fueled by external factors. We might be predisposed to be friendlier to our own &quot;type&quot;, but not hate another race or religion.</p>

<p>The guys on MGTOW, which is a sub that I go on a lot, were burned badly. They have some trauma: getting divorce raped, cheated on, dumped, rejected a lot of times, etc. This isn&#39;t something that a person can just &quot;snap out&quot; of.</p>

<p>Our current state of society goes against the bonding of men and women. We are both free from each other, selfishness is encouraged indirectly, so this is what happens. I could go on and on about this, but I think you get the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when you have regular contact with a certain group you start to deal with it at the individual level.For example when you have a negative experience with lets say a black person, you&#39;re more likely to think &quot;another asshole causing trouble&quot; as opposed to &quot;another black causing problems&quot; because your everyday interactions are varied.

If you look up maps of where the most racist attitudes against blacks are in the US, for example, it will look virtually exactly the same as the map of where the most blacks in the US live. And the people who voted for Le Pen in France, who ran on a very anti-Muslim platform were the people who live in the areas with the most Muslims. I also saw a study saying that people who live in towns with more Mexicans are more likely to support strict immigration policies. Also, Robert Putnam&#39;s study shows that diversity in general decreases social cohesion and trust among all races.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mgtow - not a movement - it&#39;s philosophy. Not to let yourself be subjugated, as if your freedom and liberty were someone else&#39;s to give away. What a piss take. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no push to change anything - ergo - not a movement. It is to re deliver moral autonomy to the individual, to no longer be swayed from the truth no matter how much people will scream and yell and stamp their feet; you can&#39;t put the genie back in the bottle. </p>

<p>It is to understand female sexuality, that is to select the highest possible quality mate to propagate the best genetics. 
When there&#39;s no net negative outcome for you for making a choice and it delivers you benefit, you&#39;re going to take that choice 99 times out of 100, right? </p>

<p>So not <em>incentivizing</em> single motherhood is going to heal the broken family unit, not fucking tone policing the guy that had his wallet and soul ripped out his asshole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. I would say MGTOW is better because many ideas are backed by studies. Feminism is just a bunch of retards circle jerking. Whereas MGTOW is men using statistics to circle jerk.</p>

<p>Can the family unit even be saved now? I would say it&#39;s impossible to save the western family. Perhaps its my MGTOW bias talking. But the studies show a pattern and the pattern doesn&#39;t lie. It&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>There are cultures and religions out there where it is possible. Islam for example won&#39;t be gone for a looooong time. But who the fuck wants to live in that world?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how bad hate against females and other races is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You seem just as indoctrinated as those you seem against. This is a common misconception. Females are a human group. Races are human groups. As with all groups, they tend to exhibit similar behavior. There are exceptions to every rule, but it is fact that these groups within themselves exhibit similar behavior. The reason being is that they have similar experiences in life. The clothes they wear, the food they eat, the environment they grew up in, their culture, the media they did or did not consume etc etc. Similar people exhibit similar behavior.</p>

<p>If this widespread behavior is bad, then it is only natural to hate these groups. If black people are being raised with the &quot;white man&quot; being their enemy, if woman are raised learning about how men have oppressed them, if muslims are raised learning how  the non-believer (&quot;kuffar&quot;) is the enemy. They learn to hate a group. Therefore, that hated group in time will hate them back. </p>

<p>This is human instinct. To protect your people, you must hate your enemies. If you be nice and let them infiltrate you, you and your people are all dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This leads to single parent homes, and raising of kids in the hands of the state. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely see how feminism causes these problems. But...</p>

<p>I really fail to see how MGTOW is causing this. MGTOW men are known for abandoning the dating system, not abandoning their wives and children. MGTOW men in general advocate against kids because they believe it&#39;s too risky.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that MGTOW enter back into the system, marry and raise kids just to try to save the family unit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to live in an area where feminism was completely out of control. Women were brainwashed to look down on men and treat them like uncivilized savages. Although this is rare, it was real in this geographic area of about 75 miles radius. </p>

<p>These women were so lonely that it was killing them. They just learned to live without love but seemed empty at the same time. Men thought these women were morons but didn&#39;t know what to say. </p>

<p>Pretty much the whole dating scene had shut down. It came to a point that women wouldn&#39;t date men unless they suspected the man would be their future husband. They don&#39;t even know the man but they refuse to date unless they sense marriage might happen. This confused matter even more. </p>

<p>These brainwashed women would act extremely snobby and stuck up. They were unapproachable and very unattractive by personality. The personality was so unattractive that even women who looked like models were ugly. The ugly insides made the outside worst. </p>

<p>I finally moved away and although this stuff exists here and there, I had never seen it to the same extreme.

Men and women love and respect each other in these parts and they have an insanely fun time partying, falling in love, and even getting laid. </p>

<p>The government is sneaky. They us Hollywood to push feminism and separate mankind. </p>

<p>Also, the &quot;might is right&quot; myth is what screws up women&#39;s rights. Some women believe they have to act like a man to succeed but in reality society has to drop the &quot;might is right&quot; attitude and switch to something more logical. We are constantly drifting away from &quot;might is right&quot; and that is why we see such big advancements in women&#39;s right in history. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this a super fucked up way of looking at things? I don&#39;t spend time with my significant other because it&#39;s an &quot;investment&quot; that I&#39;m going to cash in on someday, I do it because I legitimately enjoy spending time with them. </p>

<p>Indeed. The level of selfishness I&#39;ve seen from women in north america is extremely disappointing. The worst part is that they don&#39;t even realize how their emotions and programming control them, and begets the treatment of women as disposable. And why not? Men have longer &#39;shelf life&#39; in the dating game. It&#39;s a gender dynamic both provoked and held in check by the losing side.</p>

<p>r/TheRedPill just keeps getting more popular and the methodologies better known yet these stupid bitches eat up this &#39;alpha male&#39; bullshit regardless.</p>

<p>Wanna know what an &#39;alpha male&#39; is ladies? It&#39;s a master. It&#39;s someone who you can relinquish agency to, because you think yourself to be lesser, and weak.</p>

<p>I honestly find the widespread &#39;beta female&#39; mentality to be a major turnoff. I personally expect a partner who considers themselves to be equal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most modern American women are sluts. They have no modesty or class, they bounce around from guy to guy for one night stands or short term relationships, they avoid self-reflection and taking personal responsibility for anything. They have no higher virtue or sense of duty, they just live on the hedonic treadmill. Men have always respected women who are respectable. The only women who are treated like disposable objects are the ones who act like disposable objects. Make yourself better, make yourself wife material, and you won&#39;t be treated like a cheap whore.</p>

<p>What defines good virtues anyway? Why is lust a sin? Because the old ways say so? Why should you even have a sense of duty, and what should this duty be towards? Towards the government? Towards reproduction? Towards the church?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a point the person before was reaching for was that with a lack of the old, traditional roles that played out in relationships many people, men and women included, lack direction in conducting relationships. Without an idea of what men and women are supposed to act like they are likely feeling pretty lost. </p>

<p>It may be true that old gender stereotypes were damaging to equality but a lack of constructs or &quot;embracing sexuality&quot; for instance is a nice thought but lacks guidance. I could tell someone it&#39;s best they embrace their sexuality but that could mean so many different things! </p>

<p>Maybe what people need is a foundation for cultivating relationships that is honest and fair. If a portion of women and men both feel disposable due to modern feminism or things related then that could possibly be a sign that although feminists aim to free women from stereotypes and gender roles they haven&#39;t replaced that cultural gap with anything of value. Or at least I would say anything substantial that leaves people feeling fulfilled. </p>

<p>I know many of my guy friends feel it&#39;s extremely difficult to get girls to give them the time of day, while in my own experience girls are allowed the choice of the litter so to say. Many girls that I know also lack any idea of what they would want in a man since his &quot;traditional&quot; role is dead in their mind. Because of this I see women cycle through many men unsure of what they want and men begin resenting that feeling of not knowing where they stand, what their value is to women. </p>

<p>On the other hand I think men not following the role of the provider has allowed them to game the system in some cases. An attractive man doesn&#39;t have to concern himself with respecting women or providing for them. He can talk himself into a 1 night stand and get sex, leave the next day and not have to worry about kids, marriage, responsibility etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a bit from both sides and I probably went off topic but I feel like there needs to be new ideals to replace old ones. Not just a destruction of something that wasn&#39;t working 100% in favor of everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continue this a bit further. A woman today doesn&#39;t need to be bothered to care for a man.<br/>
A successful woman outright doesn&#39;t need one.<br/>
An unsuccessful one is increasingly given support through force by government socialism or through &#39;child&#39; support so she also doesn&#39;t need to care for a man either.  </p>

<p>So what does she &#39;need&#39; him for? She only needs him if she wants to fuck now and again. Broadly you have your high-drive and low-drive women. The low-drive women will go through life and only ever have a couple of flings and be happy about it. They are essentially out-of-the-game. The high-drive women are all competing the for same top-tier sexually attractive men.  </p>

<p>This is how it undoes a society. You are already acutely aware of how both genders already feel detached. What happens next is the men increasingly withdraw from society. Why try and be materially successful if it no longer matters? Why would you subject yourself to that kind of stress?<br/>
You&#39;re not going to date or marry the hot women. Chad gets to fuck them silly.<br/>
So make your peace with that and try to meet a nice, decent-looking, loving young woman to have a meaningful life with.<br/>
Well ... they are out there but it turns out you only have a 5% chance of marrying one of them. 30% of the time you end up married and miserable and the remaining 65% of time you end up divorced with your life and your children&#39;s lives&#39; ruined. Who in their right-mind would take those odds? You would have to be an idiot or insane.</p>

<p>Our natural net growth rate is running at a 5% deficit and as more and more men withdraw from society this rate will increase until it collapses the society - the tell-tale mark being the government passing bachelor taxes in an last-ditch effort to try to steer the society back on course. Right now we are using immigration to prop us up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No more planned parenthood? Hold up.
Planned parenthood is merely a reproductive health center. Men are just as able to receive healthcare as women at these centers, namely in the form of std testing, condoms, consultations, etc. the reason mostly women go to the centers is because mostly women have to deal with reproductive health problems. Is this not obvious? Why would you defund a public reproductive health center solely because &#39;mostly&#39; women use it?</p>

<p>And regarding alimony: alimony is consistently paid by the partner who makes the most money and/or has greater assets than the other. It&#39;s not targeted at men, its merely targeted at whoever makes the most, which is usually men. You can advocate to abolish it if you wish, but it&#39;s important to understand this.</p>

<p>I agree with you on much of what you said. More assistance needs to be given to issues that largely affect men, such as homelessness etc. or, as you&#39;re suggesting, public social security could be defended entirely for everyone. Though I personally wouldn&#39;t regard that as a push for equality so much as a push for reversing what little good we&#39;ve done as a society over the last hundred years.</p>

<p>Unless by <em>Planned Parenthood</em> you mean <em>abortion</em>, which doesn&#39;t make sense either. I mean, forcing child birth and therefore child support payments would go against your apparent philosophy. Unless you don&#39;t want child support payments either, and somehow think keeping children in poverty with a mother who didn&#39;t want them is somehow just? That men should just be allowed to walk away from a child they helped create and gave women no option to opt out of is somehow fair?

<p>But women are also tax payers, shouldn&#39;t they get something back for the tax they pay, or a say in what their taxes go to pay?

<p>To answer your rhetoric, there is nothing wrong with any of what you say, but just like young men who never take shit seriously or settle down, we are seeing more and more of the female version of that, which is fine if everyone is happy.</p>

<p>The world would be a wonderful place if we never had to answer for our actions or take responsibility. To create a loving relationship suitable for marriage, trust is a big thing, and for some, sexual history is a huge element of trust.

Basically, our fascination with sex and violence is part of our ancestral biology as ape people and we now are smart enough to rise above our primal instincts and not live as wild animals who do whatever desire crosses their minds. Moderation and self control is the key with any desire. Virtually everyone who is married or in a relationship usually wants their partner to be monogamous for that time together, which is why as a species we typically consider &quot;cheating&quot; as wrong and don&#39;t do it. Respecting each other and not wanting to damage relationships...ultimately another part of our dna as a highly social species, the need to conform and avoid loneliness or being cast out of the group. The only sense of duty we should have is to help each other and love each other as compassionately as possible. It takes constant reflection and battling our primitive genetic instincts.</p>

Also, once again I disagree about what men and women want, I think that both of our viewpoints are anecdotal and don&#39;t have much basis.</p>

<p>I think that your point about a devoted and satisfying sex life gets to the real issue again - you&#39;re talking about women&#39;s sexual choices in terms of what men want, whereas if there were equality, they would be able to make their own choices.</p>

<p>It also seems like you&#39;re assuming that men can change their habits at will, but women are stuck in their nature, i.e. if a man sleeps around he can still be loyal to his wife later in life, but if a woman sleeps around she&#39;s likely to do it again even once in a committed relationship.</p>

<p>There are studies that demonstrate this as a biological fact though.  Women lose their ability to pair-bond the more sexual partners they&#39;ve had and that number also highly correlates to marriage dissatisfaction/divorce.  The same effect is not observed in men.  I recall it has something to do with oxytocin (the lovey-dovey chemical) being released in women during sex. </p>

Why is the burden on the woman to cover up because men cant control themselves? That&#39;s simply outrageous. If you blame men cheating on the behavior of other women I have absolutely no respect for you. Men and women who cheat BOTH do it because of a lack of self control and loyalty to their partner. There is absolutely no reason to blame a woman for sleeping with a married man - this is exactly the kind of demonizing of women that occurs in religious fundamentalist communities, which seemingly you support.

<p>Damn right.  </p>

<p>I hate to get all age-ist on people, but I often wonder how old some of you are.  </p>

<p>This is not to treat you as children - I&#39;m mostly curious about the environment in which you grew up.  My childhood and young adult experiences may be very different than yours.  I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m older and wiser (definitely older in some cases, not necessarily wiser), but I do have a longer timeline behind me.</p>

<p>Most of the political threads that wind up in here drive me completely NUTS because so many people act like the current situation is the end of the world, like shit wasn&#39;t totally fucked up in the 70s and 80s before you were born, and like the news hasn&#39;t always been mostly propaganda.</p>

<p>Title 9 made a big difference in my childhood and teen years, and now it&#39;s being destroyed by a radical agenda.  That <em>really</em> pisses me off, as it means there will be no real opportunity for girls in power sports, only in very feminine sports that involve a panel of judges (figure skating, gymnastics).  This is pretty much what Title 9 was supposed to fix, and now we&#39;re being pushed right back into that mindset under the guise of gender being a social construct.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see that part of the global agenda is designed to destroy the family and push us all towards moral relativism, I feel sorry for you, because it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll lead a happy life.  Eventually, you&#39;ll figure it out, but I hope it&#39;s not too late by then.</p>

<p>Let me flip this around - who is always told they can&#39;t fend for themselves? Who is always shown as helpless and requires the strong men around them to be saved?

<p>How are they being shamed by being rejected? They are not the same thing. It&#39;s not like guys are turning down women and saying to them &#39;I am not interested because you slept with too many other mean&#39; - it&#39;s a natural hormonal thing regarding trust and relationship. Again, you cannot argue with biology, and a woman who has had fewer sexual partners means something on a biological/psychological level to a man than a women who hasn&#39;t. It&#39;s not a social judgment thing like &#39;shaming&#39;, it&#39;s a preservation/evolution thing in regards to what men find attractive in a woman.</p>

<p>Basically, you are blaming evolutionary biology as if it&#39;s a choice. It&#39;s not, just as much as being homosexual or anything else like that might be. A guy cannot create sexual attraction towards a woman because you want it to be that way or because you feel it is unfair. She has to register as an attractive mate to him. There is nothing unfair about it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Women back in 1964? No young woman today is told they can&#39;t fend for themselves or get help. Why are you convinced we still live in the 1960s? I have a daughter myself and she&#39;d punch you in nuts for that bullshit excuse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, this seems very anecdotal. Is your community very old-school in some way? Why are you speaking of mid-20th century platitudes as if they are still relevant?</p>

<p>There was also one study (can&#39;t find it right now but you should be able to google it easily) where some researchers did not like the results of previous studies that showed women&#39;s partner count affected marriage stability so they decided to do their own research.</p>

<p>Being protected from harm is literally opposite of being disposable.</p>

<p>Women are treated as valuable and feminism tells you that&#39;s oppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I see your point. By that measure I suppose men are more disposable especially in being sent to die in wars. I think the bigger point I&#39;m trying to make is that when women are seen in these movies and in pop culture as unable to help themselves, that carries over into real life where often their ideas are ignored and they aren&#39;t treated as valuable members of a team.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The main causes of their problem are the sexual revolution and the female mating strategy. Throughout history females have always had easier access to sex than males as seen by the fact that we have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. Females have always wanted to reproduce with men with high quality genes (i.e. attractive men). Before the sexual revolution this behavior were for the most part kept in check. Even a man with low quality genes could expect to find a woman to marry and have children with. After the sexual revolution this would no longer be the case as females would rather share the top 20% of men since this would give them access to high quality genes for their offspring. This implies that the other 80% of men will have less chance of having sex than they would before the sexual revolution and thus, you get a quite large percentage of men who are involuntarily celibate.</p>

<p>I never said that. What I said was that <strong>less</strong> men will reproduce now compared to before the sexual revolution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Have you not heard of immigration? It&#39;s common knowledge that the birth rate among white europeans and white americans (people who were affected by the sexual revolution) is dwindling. </p>

<p>I disagree and this is why I read the sub from time to time. Instead of looking at reality through rose tinted glasses, like most people tend to do, they see and analyze things for what they really are which I find refreshing in today&#39;s overly politically correct world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some people can dismiss promiscuity, some can&#39;t. if you exhibit untrustworthy/&#39;can&#39;t be tied down&#39; behavior, people might not trust you. it&#39;s not a male/female thing. </p>

<p>however, before social media it was a) harder to find people to cheat with but also b) much easier to conceal cheating from your partner because there was just less spread of information. also, if a married woman cheats and gets caught, she can expect primary custody of any children she had with her husband and at least half of his assets, so there&#39;s much less risk. if you&#39;re saying women today see a guy who&#39;s promiscuous and think &#39;i have less of a chance of getting him to marry me&#39;, that&#39;s not the same thing as disliking promiscuity itself. </p>

I used to believe the things you believe and get just as offended as you when I heard dissenting opinions, but it&#39;s weird- when you accept nature and reality as it is rather than as you wish it was, it breaks up the cognitive dissonance in your psyche and you gain a sense of peace you didn&#39;t have before.

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with this, but not &quot;disposable&quot;; &quot;Interchangeable&quot;.</p>

<p>Most men I&#39;ve seen that have issues finding happy relationship are the ones that the MGTOW crowd would say are &quot;putting pussy on a pedestal&quot;, only it&#39;s a specific one.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t get hung up on a specific woman, if you learn to take hints whether she&#39;s romantically interested in you or not, you&#39;ll be happier. Men are taught to be persistent, but that results in guys finding a girl they like, focusing only on that one woman, and then getting hurt and upset if she doesn&#39;t feel the same way. </p>

<p>It&#39;s better for men AND women to accept that it&#39;s just healthier all around to never put a specific person on a pedestal until you have an actual relationship with them.</p>

<p>You are NOT a girl, thus you have no concept that women have different needs. Those needs include having children in their mid 30s but by then they are too old for most men to care about them, hence &quot;where have all the good men gone&quot; plus &quot;freezing eggs&quot;, etc.</p>

Capitalism does not require perpetual economic growth or population growth as tuyguy also mentioned, merely a sustainable system.  The debt based system the US has created does, but that is not a function of capitalism.  However, socialism does require this as the pyramid scheme grows.  Same for the pyramid scheme of social security in the US.</p>

<p>On the topic of jobs and robots, a productive economic system isn&#39;t based on job creation, it&#39;s based on value creation.  You seem to be falling into the Luddite camp with these thoughts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very common to want to externalize faults to some group you belong to. I think it has something to do with being low self-esteem and wanting to attribute your faults to others so you&#39;re less alone. Combine that with different groups being on the receiving end of different kinds of abuse and you can make a case for how <em>only</em> this or that group are victims to this or that type of abuse when it&#39;s really  just picking cherries.</p>

<p>A common example is how abusive gaming culture is towards women, especially online. Women <em>are</em> the targets of abuse online. So are men. The abuse for each is different and when you only focus on people yelling out make-me-a-sandwich abuse and ignoring the I-fucked-your-mom abuse, of <em>course</em> it looks like women are over-represented in receiving abuse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cherry-picking and confirmation bias. We ignore certain problems that men face and think only women face those problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First (total) fertility rates can&#39;t be negative. Second the Dutch government is not pushing immigration anymore. (Without taking into account the refugee crisis of the last years which is a highly controversial and is highly dependent on EU and international treaties.) The Netherlands have seen higher numbers of emigration as immigration (2010).</p>

<p>Furthermore, capitalism is not dependent on population growth. Actually I will argue the opposite. In Western countries values born within a capitalistic society have pushed away values that are more traditional in nature. In most societies the traditional notion of succes was the size of family one could support. These days the emphasis is less on the amount of children or the religious connotation that one should bear many children but on the material wealth and the social position one acquired in the corporate system. </p>

<p>Of course an abundance of labour will benefit the capital holders in a capitalistic system. This is rarely done by pushing up the fertility rate on a national level but through automatisation. Less labour dependence weakens the position of workers as jobs become scarce. This will shift more power to capital holders (the largest multinational organisations). </p>

My friends that are still feminists are all single, miserable, and in their 30s now. They spend all their time on social media, constantly posting pictures of themselves and their ideologies. The single 30-something men I know are literally opposites to the feminists. Neither side want to compromise.</p>

<p>I&#39;m married and my friends that are still married (2 out 12 now), say the same thing. It&#39;s compromise and communication. Social media has killed those two things. Thus it has killed relationships across the board. Think of the divide that happened in the 2016 elections and the relationships that ended. The people that are in the middle are doing fine, it&#39;s the people in the extremes that are struggling with finding a relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, my relationship would be called feminist by most standards. We&#39;ve never had a big fight, he seems happy enough. </p>

<p>The current face of feminism is very...young. Lots of empowered teenagers lashing out at things they don&#39;t understand, and lots of grownups cynically exploiting them. I&#39;m gonna scream if I see another ad for that Bold Type show. </p>

<p>I would advise against taking any of this stuff too seriously, since spinning away to the opposite end of the spectrum is just as unhealthy. Treat women like people, and avoid the women who think they are goddesses. That might mean adjusting your standards, if you&#39;re struggling with the women you meet now. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all just people. Be positive about finding a person you enjoy and you&#39;ll find someone. Stewing about the state of the world won&#39;t attract the kind of woman you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>Holy shit do I agree with this. It&#39;s like a bunch of children are running the conversation. It&#39;s hard to keep up, and things just get crazier as I get older.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I thought &quot;the goal&quot; in society was for men and women to be equal. Things like platonic friendships were the ideal. As I got older, however, it seems like society is actually getting MORE separated between all identifying lines, not just sex.</p>

Birth control increases estrogen in females, which is not the female hormone Big Pharma would have you believe, but a stress hormone which is why it makes women infertile.

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the millennial generation, I think it has more to do with the fact that everyone&#39;s poor, or in college or both. It&#39;s not a problem on it&#39;s own but culturally people feel like they should have some money and independence before pursuing a relationship. Like if you have to live with your parents, you probably aren&#39;t going to pursue a long term relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is this more of a frustration with the general societal construct we find ourselves in nowadays or the way that the feminism movement, from your perspective, has reacted to it? I know plenty of post-college millennials, regardless of their gender, who are more concerned with working enough hours to make ends meet financially than investing time and money into finding a significant other to settle down with. 2 jobs takes up a hell of a lot of time, and the fact that the general trend of working 50+ hours a week just to get by may be the root of the problem. </p>

<p>Ironically, settling down and living with a partner who also works full time definitely lessens the financial burden that many people feel when trying to live on their own. So is it the burdens of the current economy that keep us sleeping around in baseless, short-lived relationships or is it the desire to sleep around that keeps us struggling to keep up in this economy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I am a single male going on for about 15 years now. I gave up dating long ago, the reasoning for it is it just isn&#39;t worth the risk involved. The drama one needs to go through even to find someone compatible is enough of a deterrent. Then the time commitment, years of life, which will typically end in tears every time. We&#39;re not monogamous by nature, most of us are selfish and have a very difficult time in thinking outside our own view. The only reason why marriages lasted as long as they did during our grandparents generation is due to women being stuck in their situation.</p>

<p>I think the problem is our media dictates unexpected realities for relationships. Women still need to &quot;look&quot; a certain way, and men need to &quot;behave&quot; a certain way. Women may be more independent, but the same social stigmas are still in play. Many folks decide to try to marry in their 20&#39;s, we&#39;re still figuring ourselves out at this age, and we change. Often times we do not change together.</p>

<p>Women are better as &quot;stay at home&quot;, or jobs with caring and tending to, it&#39;s what we internally register with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just pseudo-scientific bullshit.</p>

<p>There is no evidence whatsoever that women are &quot;genetically&quot; inclined to stay at home. In fact, it&#39;s ridiculous to assert that, since the role of women as caretakers and men of earners is relatively modern.</p>

<p>During times when our actual genome was formed, all evidence points towards women being just as important in the aquisition of food and shelter as men. </p>

<p>And <em>even</em> if it was true, it&#39;s a prime example of the naturalistic fallacy. Even if women were &quot;genetically&quot; inclined to be stay at home moms (which again, there is no evidence for whatsoever) that does not mean that that is a desirable state of affairs. Women should be able to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Honestly, you do name a few problems of modern society. However, you completely fallaciously attribute those to some nefarious &quot;feminism&quot; instead of complex interaction of all kinds of societal processes. You do not raise <em>one single argument</em> about <em>why</em> feminism is the cause of all these problems.</p>

<p>You could replace feminism with &quot;the jews&quot; or &quot;clowns&quot; and the post would make the same amount of sense, since you never lay out one argument that shows the supposed causality between feminism and the problems you mention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The problem with this “blank slate” interpretation of gender differences is that it doesn’t jibe with results of developmental studies. Newborn girls prefer to look at faces while newborn boys prefer to look at mechanical stimuli (such as mobiles). When it comes to toys, a consistent finding is that boys (and juvenile male monkeys) strongly prefer to play with mechanical toys over plush toys or dolls, while girls (and female juvenile monkeys) show equivalent interest in the two. (See this for summary of this research.) These sex-linked preferences emerge in human development long before any significant socialization can have taken place. And they exist in juvenile non-human primates that are not exposed to human gender-specific socialization efforts.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see how such early emerging preferences can end up shaping career choices later on: Women tend to gravitate toward fields that focus on living things and agents, men to fields that focus on objects.&quot; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/truth-women-stem-careers/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/truth-women-stem-careers/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>To deny that men and women are distinctly different in their preferences for activities and what makes them happy is to deny reality itself.</p>

<p>Were on the internet, so take video games as an example. Women enjoy games with teamwork vs the computer AI, like world of warcraft. Men enjoy games where you compete against each other and there is always a winner and loser after the game like Counter Strike.</p>

<p>These types of differences dictate not only career choice, but hobbies, and how each gender prefers to spend their free time. There is a reason why women pay to get their nails painted, while men need to be reminded to get a haircut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I don&#39;t think infant formulas are as healthy as breast milk and don&#39;t promote morher-baby bonding as closely as formula does....BUT.....breastfeeding is f*cking hard. We&#39;ve got thrush, mastitis, blocked ducts, etc. You know those wetnurses? They were there because breastfeeding can be physically difficult. It always has been. </p>

<p>So back to formula....if a nursing mother is in pain, or a baby is losing weight because mom can&#39;t produce enough milk, then it&#39;s the next best thing. For a lot of families it&#39;s a life and sanity saver. </p>

<p>The point is that, whoile we think what&#39;s best for our babies based on scientific evidence, isn&#39;t always what&#39;s best based on the circumstances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Women are better at organization than men are. Men forget when to eat because they become obsessed with fixing or solving something. Women get stressed out easier than men do, and a man they trust helps to lower their stress levels by being their rock. In a healthy relationship, both tend to live longer and be more successful than they would&#39;ve been on their own. An unhealthy relationship is probably worse than being single, which feminism is making more common, by distorting the natural gender roles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re on pretty thin ice with this argument. For one thing your denigrating child-birth and child-rearing as some sort of oppressive burden on women and you invoke science. I tend to object to your argument which is essentially that the only relevant role of women in child rearing boils down to milk production. The importance of the bond between mothers and young children is an absolutely in your face undeniable fact. To even suggest that a father or anyone else can care for an infant in an adequate manner is completely wrong from a child development stand-point. Inadequate mother-infant bonding is precursor of mental illness. There is so much science that shows that a lack of bonding with the primary caregiver, ideally the mother as having a negative impact on society. It&#39;s been shown in drug addicts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if women were &quot;genetically&quot; inclined to be stay at home moms (which again, there is no evidence for whatsoever) that does not mean that that is a desirable state of affairs. Women should be able to do whatever they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But women AREN&#39;T meant to be stay at home moms. Look at any society in history where infant mortality was low. The women weren&#39;t separated from one another. They were actively part of their community and spent time with one another. </p>

<p>You can see this still today in &quot;under developed&quot; (read: &quot;primitive&quot;) societies. The default way of being is for the women to raise children together in groups. Stay-at-home mom-ing is detrimental to the health of the mother and the development of the child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do we really have to be so rebellious toward our own culture? It&#39;s entirely possible to offer a sane critique of ourselves without this total rejection of everything. Afterall, no-one seems to argue that our culture hasn&#39;t been enormously successful. That isn&#39;t meant to say that we are absolutely perfect in everyway but it also doesn&#39;t give you grounds to suggest that we should return to a hunter gatherer  lifestyle. Trust me, no-one would like it and it wouldn&#39;t be beneficial. </p>

<p>The real answer is not to pick some random primitive cultural appropriation but to go back within our own culture and figure out how we did it. Inconveniently, religion seems to play a major role in these tight knit communities that you seem to envy and which we had at one time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your argument is that we are using a different model than our ancestors did, but because it&#39;s kinda worked so far we should continue to uphold it because &quot;rebellion against culture is bad?&quot; 
The guy you&#39;re responding to isn&#39;t advocating returning to prehistoric methods, he&#39;s merely pointing out that the often-parroted beliefs about genetically predetermined gender roles are inaccurate to how we actually evolved. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a question of going back to our roots, nor is it a question of upholding what we&#39;ve been doing since. It&#39;s a question of how to move forward. That means questioning our old ways, studying the negative effects that these cultural practices have on us and our children, and weeding out those that are no longer suitable. We shouldn&#39;t remain stagnant simply because some of the population is somewhat okay with what we&#39;ve always done, we must move forward for the betterment of all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your definition of &quot;stay at home moms&quot;.</p>

<p>My mother stayed home with me until I went to school at age 5, and there were other kids and moms all over the neighborhood and they knew each other and the other kids.</p>

<p>For some young people here, that probably makes me sound super-privledged or something, but in reality, I&#39;m just old.  Old enough to have played outside every day in the summer, mostly unsupervised by any adults.</p>

<p>The other thing is that now, if you want or need to work and you have a baby, you&#39;re often handing them off to strangers.  People do not live near their families any more, and can&#39;t hand their child off to their parents or brother and sister every day.  That <em>was</em> very common in America not so long ago.</p>

<p>romance and love are alive and well, maybe you just haven&#39;t realized that chocolates and flowers and door opening have nothing to do with them. you sound like someone who thinks sex is love. you know what love is, someone pressing their forhead against yours as you cry uncontrollablly for the 20 year old cat you just buried. you want to know what love is? bathing the little, limp body of your dead cat who at the end had become incontinent, because he was too proud of a cat to deserve going in the ground covered in his own piss. if you think caring about another living being who shares your life is pathetic, i can see why you are a bitter, lonely, hateful person. </p>

<p>many women, my mother for example, are shitty care givers, many women thrive working in intense, competitive jobs, like big law. </p>

<p>anyone can be attracted to anyone they want. if some guy finds me not feminine enough or passive enough or what have you, then instead of there being some flaw in me as you say, it&#39;s more likely that we just are a bad fit. there are 7 billion people in the world, it&#39;s bound to happen.</p>

<p>you sound like someone who is bitter because you are alone and hate your life and have low self esteem, and instead of working out your own shit, judge and condemn everyone who is content living in situations that seem similar to yours, because the only way you can justify why you are so unhappy with your situation is to ascribe delusional mind control by feminism.</p>

<p>Thank you for saying this. I feel like a lot of women push equality as the ability to do traditional male activities. Unfortunately this just perpetrates the notion that these careers, etc are &quot;better&quot;.  Why aren&#39;t &quot;traditional&quot; female careers held in equal regards to male ones? Nursing, teaching, etc are as equally important to the well being of society as are rocket scientists and other STEM careers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a lot of thoughts on this issue. So many, in fact, that I could probably write a boo. So it&#39;s going to be difficult for me to keep my response to this succinct.</p>

<p>I believe you&#39;re mostly correct. I believe feminism, even first wave, but particularly second wave on are CIA funded movements meant to divide and destroy the nuclear family (and female dependence on welfare and take control of children), increase tax base by effectively doubling it, and bring in austerity as the new standard.</p>

<p>You see these programs going into new phases once education was targeted, agenda 21 plans enacted and so on.</p>

<p>I have more opinions that would be controversial even here, but I don&#39;t feel like defending my ideas against a horde of mouthbreathers.</p>

<p>I am MGTOW in the classic sense. Was one long before it had a label or a forum. Well before Reddit was ever born, in fact. Or 4Chan or any place. </p>

<p>I recognized the quality of women as something I wanted to minimize in my life to the greatest extent possible somewhere in the late 90s.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched this incremental creep into reviling male qualities, the creation of this rape paranoia/culture, and the superficial elevation of women well beyond their capabilities that requires the suspension of my reality to even accept, let alone endorse.</p>

<p>Women are the children of government now. Their education and reproduction are almost entirely subsidized by the federal government so that they can claim independence.</p>

<p>We could talk about how the bulk of taxes are paid by men and consumed by women, but that&#39;s another matter. The average woman will die as a 150 thousand dollar burden on the economy. Whereas men will die a significant positive unless they live long into old age (a small percentage). And even when that is the case, the deficit is minor compared to the female average. </p>

<p>They are also the overwhelming cost of medical care in the country while also having access to free coverage, welfare and abortions. The government has replaced the man as daddy and husband and have all but openly declared men to be disposable and inconsequential.</p>

<p>So there is no longer any reason for women to make good/responsible decisions with their lives. Women live in a reality in which there is a constant safety net beneath them. Single motherhood is celebrated instead of shunned like it used to be and they call it progress as the nuclear family dies.</p>

<p>How we combat this is women, like yourself, are beginning to see the consequences of feminism. Men, like myself have checked out. We&#39;re gone. A few of us do recognize the harm its doing to society. Some are gleeful (I&#39;m not). I feel nothing about it anymore. I refused to be used.</p>

<p>However, to me, MGTOW is much bigger than sexual relationships. It&#39;s institutional to its core. There is a lack of honor in everything, business and social.</p>

<p>The CIA came into existence last century.  First wave feminism dates back to the 1800s.  Knowing that is knowing the first thing about the origins of first wave feminism.  You think you can write a book about something you literally don&#39;t know the first thing about.  Astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing wrong with female empowerment, you&#39;re treating a nuanced topic as though it&#39;s binary. Don&#39;t let loud idiots direct your thoughts. </p>

<p>Lots of the problems you describe are just side effects of a comfortably gluttonous society i.e. &quot;there are too many fat people&quot; &quot;social media is..<em>gasp</em>...anti social!&quot;. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;d agree in saying that people are more likely &quot;living lives inside&quot;. People are comfortable to do that because nowadays everyone has access to the internet and you can get everything you need from your computer.</p>

<p>Unsuprisingly all these movements you namedrop (mgtow, pro fat) exist mainly online and that goes for both the far left and far right. i&#39;d say keep pushing yourself to go outside and you&#39;ll realise your average joe doesn&#39;t give a fuck about this &quot;culture war&quot;. Probably too busy getting fucked over by the greedy hoarders at the top of our society. </p>

<p>The people you should be worried about are these leeches with actual economic and political power, not a movement consisting largely of societally disillusioned young folk.</p>

<p>As for the joke I made, this post is essentially a cleaned up version of a typical <a href="/r/incels">/r/incels</a> post.

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if OP is a man or a woman. Her views are sympathetic to the <a href="/r/incels">/r/incels</a>. Just because she&#39;s a woman doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to mock her for repeating talking points related to a disgusting group of people. </p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll make the joke about everybody else supporting her point view:</p>

<p>They probably support this point of view, because they&#39;re bitter they can&#39;t maintain relationships and want to blame it on feminism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding. If your options are &quot;starve to death or marry some random dude&quot; you&#39;ll choose the random dude, but if women aren&#39;t at risk of losing their lives or children by NOT marrying, then it makes sense why they wouldn&#39;t want to get married. Sometimes marriage is a WORSE option than staying single, and women&#39;s ability to work and own property (and debt) is part of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing you can do on a personal level for yourself that can fix the situation.  If you&#39;re serious, and not just here to get attention/engaging in female mating strategies, then you&#39;ll take up the cause of reversing legal no fault divorce, elimination of alimony, and equal custody as de-facto.  That alone still won&#39;t fix the real problems:  Women + dependents live off the government now as their pseudo husband, until the welfare state is reversed, that won&#39;t change, the media gives no respect to men, and teaches women that we&#39;re all rapists, or idiots, what have you, abortion + birth control have completely eliminated women from the consequence of sex, and freed them to have sex with as many men as they want, read studies on female pair bonding, this behavior destroys their ability to pair bond, the economy is terrible for the young generation, which means women and men are even less likely to try to start a family, etc.  If you want to fight all of that, fight globalism and central banking, and then also fight against a woman&#39;s right to vote, (women voted most of this crap in), then live in the world you and your sisters have created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a woman, I am over 30, I am single, I am a professional, I am a feminist, and you&#39;re full of shit.</p>

<p>A &quot;stay at home&quot; life would be a nightmare for me. I could never be happy being reliant on another person. I could never be happy in a caregiver job. I do not internally register with that place in society. I would not thrive if I were forced to take that role. Instead I get to choose the meaning my life has. The direction I&#39;m walking in is mine. The strength and happiness I project to others is real.  </p>

<p>Feminism gave me that ability to control my life and define my purpose and live in a way that is true to me.</p>

<p>And you want to combat that? Take that away? Because you blame it for your failed relationships? Because you blame it for obesity? Because &quot;traditional family&quot;? Fuck. Off.</p>

<p>Feminism killed romance and love? Before feminism, women were forced to marry men. The decision was out of their hands, made by their fathers instead. How is that romance? Before feminism, men could beat and rape their wives as they pleased and the wives were forced to stay. How is that love?</p>

<p>You want to know why obesity is such a problem? Look up sugar addiction, and then check how much sugar goes into the foods you eat. Look up how much processing foods changes how our body metabolises it. Look up the changes in the percentage of employment that&#39;s physical vs sedentary. </p>

<p>The world is different, not worse. Romance is not dead, just dead to you. Stop projecting your personal failures on others. Stop blaming a long, diverse, multifaceted social and political rights movement for problems that you&#39;ve made up. </p>

<p>Stop fighting to take away my right to be me.</p>

<p>Feminism freed both men and wome from horrible no-choice traditionalist marriages.</p>

<p>Men dont have to toil and break their spines to feed a lady and her kids anymore. Men can earn their own money and spend whole of it on themselves. There is no pressure to support a woman, if not risk collapse of society and the country.</p>

<p>Feminism exposed female hypergamy, afbb, etc. Not that there is anything wrong about. You can change what ir who one loves. You can be aware ot it and do is best for you though.</p>

<p>A woman earns her own money and takes care of her own expenses. Isnt that a drea, A woman who pays her share?</p>

<p>I dont see why men hate feminism so much.</p>

<p>Traditionalism and patrirachy are romance killers and male oppressors not feminism.</p>

<p>Feminism is #heForHe, not #heForShe.</p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s all fine but your biological clock with 30 is reaching its limits and at some point you have to take in dependencies, kids, husband.

    <div class="md"><p>Modern women aren&#39;t some hive-mind monoliths who all desire the exact same thing. Some women only want a career. Some only want to have a family. Some want some of both. Some want a husband and a bunch of dogs. Some want a wife. Some want to have their own kids. Some want to adopt or foster instead. And some will change as they grow and mature and want different things.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s kind of the point. I work a very fulfilling career that in the past was not open to women. I <em>love</em> this job, and it&#39;s only going to get better for me as I advance. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have this job without feminism. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have my apartment, I wouldn&#39;t be able to live on my own and prioritise my career that I love so much. I wouldn&#39;t be able to <em>choose</em>.</p>

<p>When OP says that she wants to reverse feminism, she&#39;s saying that she wants to reverse all of those advances that allow me to be <em>me</em>. </p>

<p>And her excuses are bullshit! Feminism caused obesity? Really? Wage stagnation and rising costs of living coupled with the spread of cheap, fatty foods like McDonald&#39;s had nothing to do with it? The shift from an industrial to an information-age society? No? Some people are fat so I shouldn&#39;t be able to have a career, or vote, or own property? </p>

<p>She wants me to go back to <em>being</em> property? Because Tinder exists? Because she can&#39;t find a long term relationship? If she can&#39;t find it, it doesn&#39;t exist? </p>

<p>She talks about the death of love and romance, but the era she&#39;s apparently longing for wasn&#39;t exactly romantic. Yes, some areas of the world do have forced marriages. But it&#39;s been pretty much eliminated from the western world thanks to feminism. And OP wants to go back to it. And back to marital rape. And back to domestic abuse being a private problem, not a criminal one, and couldn&#39;t you just behave Mrs Shamblin? Your husband wouldn&#39;t hit you if you behaved like a good wife.</p>

<p>There is nothing stopping OP from living that &quot;Traditional Life&quot; she&#39;s longing for. She can arrange her affairs however she likes. But she wants to take away that right from me, because her choices aren&#39;t working out for her. Everyone must be forced to live her way because that&#39;s the only right way. No choice, no freedom, no me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what that rant above and this one is about. OP wants to force me to live a particular kind of life that I don&#39;t want. She blames all the advances that allow me to be me for all of society&#39;s ills and her personal problems. But she&#39;s wrong, and she can fuck right off.</p>

<p>im a sceptic when i see a message spammed over and over again and the last days (since this CNN drama stuff) i see here threads/postings about how everyone should stop looking at media, social media, news etc. and go out in the world ... even when this is a good message it has a smell on it.</p>

<p>and stinks like propaganda to disconect selfthinking people and make them stop digging ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There wasn&#39;t a magical time when men and women got along.  Hypergamy has always existed in women, women have always viewed men as disposable utilities, and women have always been deceitful concerning their nature and towards the unfortunate men involved with them.  Feminism is merely the overt expression of female nature.</p>

<p>You know what I hear as the most common compliment from very old women concerning their dead husbands? How they were such good utilities. Add in how they brag about fucking every soldier they knew and you have a very clear picture of alpha fucks, beta bucks. The current dynamic isn&#39;t even close to new.</p>

<p>MGTOW is men waking up to female nature. How they choose to deal with that is up to the individual man. I went monk mode a few years ago, because I don&#39;t find anything desirable about women once I took that red pill.  They&#39;re pretty much all whores, and are emotionally damaged from their diseased exploits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may sound cheesy, but I believe it to be true.</p>

<p>Love is one of the strongest forces in the world. The love between and a man and a woman is insurmountable. When a man and woman are truly in love their bond is unshakable and they will fight to do the death to stop anything that might threaten the peace of the world they want to bring their children into. </p>

<p>In essence, the family unit is the greatest threat to the New World Order. A strong family unit represents at its core a driving force for independence from Big Pharma and Big Agri. Men will fight tyranny and women will demand their children be educated well. And together they will fight any government that wishes to oppress them and their children.</p>

<p>Feminism is one of the biggest scandals of the century. It completely erodes all natural connection between the man and the woman. It doesn&#39;t create more equality for women. It creates more hate towards the disposable male, and society as as whole goes belly up. It happened to the Romans. First it was feminism, then came the mass immigration. Then Rome was destroyed from within. It&#39;s been going on for centuries.</p>

<p>The idea is to establish a love for consumerism. Destroy the family unit and fill that whole with selfish hedonism and gossip. Tell on your neighbors, tell on your wife, tell on your mom, tell on your dad, etc, etc. Get the centralized corporate government to fulfill all your needs. You belong to them, not to your family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to combat it successfully is to spread your message faster than the feminists are spreading theirs. Feminism is in the MSM and frankly it was also partially demonstrated / represented in some few of Hillary Clinton&#39;s supporters: those who only supported her due to her gender.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it will take many years of re-education. There are many brainwashed people, so I&#39;m not planning for my future to be one with fewer feminists. I&#39;ve seen the degeneracy in antifa being one of the few actual fascist groups in the U.S...</p>

<p>We need people to speak out on what feminist ideals have created. Feminized men raised by single mothers to be mommas boys, never able to lead, encouraged not to leave mama&#39;s basement. Lonely women, the destruction of family ideals, financial rape via &quot;I&#39;m bored of my husband&quot; divorce, not to mention the emotional trauma on the fathers who can&#39;t see their kids after custody battles. A welfare state that encourages women to become single mothers. All of which leads to some men not having the balls to marry if they wanted to, and a lot of men who could, but don&#39;t see any advantage in it, leading to many older women left alone, with or without children to raise.</p>

<p>We need viral videos, memes, on a scale much larger than it took to bring Trump over the margin and into the white house. Unfortunately, it will be a lot harder to meme your way to the end of feminism. Because this time, you&#39;ll have to convince not men who already live on the Internet, a place of meme culture, but rather you&#39;ll have to convince women, who statistically spend less time online (though more social media - this is probably where you must enter) and women who already believe feminism is a good thing.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t see it happening, it&#39;s too big a goal, but it could happen if many people get involved. For now, unfortunately, my plan is to only date younger women (20 - 30) before they demand marriage or kids, and if it happens, move onto the next. I&#39;m sorry, women, this is the best option for many men right now. It&#39;s much easier to find someone else with less brainwashing (younger) than it is to convince a 40-something to stop trying to take away all of your personal power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of complex problems raised by your comment.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Traditionally, women were suppressed and prevented from living out their full potential as scientists, workers, artists, etc. This is less common now but still with us.</p></li>
<li><p>Women are now financially independent and do not need to rely upon a man to live. So, they do not have to put up with a man&#39;s bullshit. This is good. But, it also means no relationship, no sex, cats.</p></li>
<li><p>Mail order brides are more traditional (generally) and can cook, keep a house, and make and raise babies. All of the things a man needs done.</p></li>
<li><p>Both men and women are large groups of people that include everything from saints to murderers in both groups. Some women are smarter than me. Some women are physically stronger than me. So what? It does not mean that I have no right to exist.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a big gap between sex, and love, and relationships. It is hard to build a good relationship now. I think that different people are looking for different things. Some people treat a hook-up like a handshake and that is ok, but that is their world: sex is almost meaningless to them. I do not want to live in that type of world/relationship. Call me old-fashioned.</p></li>
<li><p>The food is shitty. The life-style is shitty. We sit all day in front of a screen. We eat garbage. We get fat and tired and the deadline for the report is Thursday and I gotta crank it out. More coffee and doughnuts!!!! We need something better and soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Both Feminism and Men&#39;s rights are basically about increasing human rights, so I am in favor of both but the extreme ends of both groups are too much for me.</p></li>
<li><p>The media presents an image that is not reality. We would be better served by concentrating on reality.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The cause of all of this is social media 100%. </p>

<p>Our society has been transformed in an extremely short amount of time to pressure everyone to create and maintain this incredible picture of themselves that others view and judge them on.</p>

<p>Humans were never meant to have 5000 friends and be constantly competing with millions of people to stand out and get noticed. People are starved for attention because of it. Women especially, who have always really been very concerned with their looks and how others perceive them, are sucked into this more than men, but men are too.</p>

<p>For that, you see women becoming increasingly militant into &quot;causes&quot; and things so they can be noticed (men too). Also, women are incredibly picky now because they&#39;re not looking for someone compatible, they&#39;re looking for someone presentable to their 4000 friends and 20k followers. They need someone who subscribes to all of their causes, is good looking, yet, someone who is subservient to their whims yet strong and with resolve like a &quot;real man&quot;. Men like this simply don&#39;t exist and they go on and on in an endless sea of lonliness. Then, they&#39;ll turn to places like Tinder to get the sexual attention they crave, leaving them even lonlier inside. Men can have casual and detached sex much easier than women can. Women are cerebral and grow attachments easier as opposed to men who are sort of one-track minded in their thought and behavior patterns.</p>

<p>In summation, social media has unraveled hundreds of years of social interaction progression in about 10 years. In 10 years from now, things will be twice as worse. Social media isn&#39;t going away, and its only becoming more intrusive into our lives. People will become consumed with dolling themselves up, traveling to places they don&#39;t like, being with people they don&#39;t like, doing things they can&#39;t afford, and buying all sorts of shit they can&#39;t afford, all so they can impress people they don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Delete your social media. You&#39;ll be amazed at how hard the habit is to break of going to those sites to check on things. After a while you get used to it and you&#39;ll be amazed at how much you can work on personal development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a critique that says that male/female relationships have worked over time culturally to due to the essential division of labor between men and women, with men focusing on strength-based endeavors (hunting, farming, fighting, labor) and women around domestic endeavors (child rearing, cooking and keeping the home).</p>

<p>Feminism disrupts this division of labor, resulting in all kinds of cultural dysfunction, at least in the short run.  By no longer be dependent on male endeavors for support (whether it&#39;s hunting or office work pay), women find that men are more burden than benefit, and the relationships that do result are fraught with instability and conflict.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on the impossibility of a culture of male/female equality, but I think it&#39;s a difficult thing to transition from centuries (millennia?) of a culture based on gender division of labor to a culture of gender equality without a long period of chaos. </p>

<p>One of my other doubts is whether gender differences in sexuality aren&#39;t actually the basis of the division of labor, and that a major driver of female sexuality isn&#39;t a stable reproductive environment (ie, a provider to care for mother and child during pregnancy and after birth) which itself relies on divisions of labor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why men used to get married:
SEX, kids, meals made by wife while man works, so we don&#39;t look like a looser by society.</p>

<p>What men used to control:
Abortion, kids, money, house options, life, car choices.</p>

<p>What men can&#39;t control now:
Abortions, kids, money, housing options, expensive car for wife.</p>

<p>What men can get now without a relationship:
SEX (because hookups aren&#39;t taboo anymore)</p>

<p>Costs of marriage: 
$$$$ for wedding weekend, expensive car for wife, kids college, 50% chance of divorce (divorce is crazy expensive)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are seeing in action is Darwinism. Not everyone is meant to survive or procreate. That&#39;s unnatural. Those who have the instinct to pair bond and procreate will, those don&#39;t won&#39;t. Slutty women for one reason or another have weak pair bonding skills or desires to sacrifice for a child (I still know slutty women from when they were 14 till they are 33). And only really decide to chase commitment as their sexual marketplace value dips towards their late twenties if they haven&#39;t taken great care of themselves (I know Crossfit gals in their forties with incredible bodies, and women in their early twenties with ok bodies). </p>

<p>Only hapless pathetic losers (aka cucks) settle for these women and that&#39;s if they can&#39;t be shamed away from it (and more and more are not only being shamed away from it but also being educated on why it&#39;s best to avoid these used up damaged goods). </p>

<p>We also live in an era that seeks to redefine masculinity because we have enough loser scum in the media trying to make it happen. Saying naturally masculine men have toxic masculinity. Because what&#39;s worked since the beginning of humanity for one reason or another hasn&#39;t worked they believe. A masculine male&#39;s natural state is barbarism, sorry folks that&#39;s the way it is, and masculine men should only give it up when bribed sufficiently to do so. </p>

<p>For a long time males were sold on the idea of being &quot;good guys&quot;. That it would lead to happier and better relationships and interactions with women. And this was all a lie. Yes you have lots of women who are able to avoid being simple western whores that will seek out legit partners they can share a world with and be equal to. Those are the folks who get married and stay married typically (in the western hemisphere). </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not everyone. Lots of people are seduced by the lies and foolishness that surrounds them. They are getting game by not only consumer culture, but the culture sought to be established by the weak (commies, marxists, feminists, etc.), and those weak cultures don&#39;t create anything good ultimately and tend to fall apart while wreaking misery on the many (i.e. Venezuela). </p>

<p>So sit back, relax, and enjoy the decline. If you haven&#39;t found your partner by 25 and are fat, you still might find them and you still might not. Welcome to the word, would you like some matches?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with this, but not &quot;disposable&quot;; &quot;Interchangeable&quot;.</p>

<p>Most men I&#39;ve seen that have issues finding happy relationship are the ones that the MGTOW crowd would say are &quot;putting pussy on a pedestal&quot;, only it&#39;s a specific one.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t get hung up on a specific woman, if you learn to take hints whether she&#39;s romantically interested in you or not, you&#39;ll be happier. Men are taught to be persistent, but that results in guys finding a girl they like, focusing only on that one woman, and then getting hurt and upset if she doesn&#39;t feel the same way. </p>

<p>It&#39;s better for men AND women to accept that it&#39;s just healthier all around to never put a specific person on a pedestal until you have an actual relationship with them.</p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;alright&quot;? I&#39;m talking about:</p>

<p>What the guy wants and how to achieve it.</p>

<p>What the woman wants and how to achieve it.</p>

<p>If the guy just wants to sleep around, having previously slept around isn&#39;t gonna hurt his odds. If he&#39;s looking for a good wife, again, that&#39;s probably not gonna hurt his odds.</p>

<p>If the woman just wants to sleep around, that&#39;s gonna be harder and harder the more she had previously slept around. If she&#39;s looking for a good husband, those odds tank hard if she&#39;s been promiscuous.</p>

<p>Like the movement #CurvePower we have here. Women that are so obese, they are close to a heart attack. But they are portrayed as strong women. </p>

<p>Also entitled women here using the system to get control over the kids, even when the father is better for the kids. I&#39;m 29 now and I see many relationships having these type of problems. A woman calling the police and telling that the father is abusive, so she could get him out of the house.</p>
