I do believe 2 planes hit those 2 buildings in NYC that day, and nothing will change that because that&#39;s what I saw. What my brain can&#39;t wrap around is where the debris from all of those structures went... How do vehicles a block or two away get burnt or melt when an ambulance parked right in front of one of the towers before the collapse looks almost brand new after the collapse. It wasn&#39;t thermite, it wasn&#39;t aliens, it wasn&#39;t bombs. It just astounds me now at the amount of &quot;weird&quot; things that were discovered during and after that day. I don&#39;t get it and alot of it makes no sense now...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one really practical way to look at it is this way: In the 1960s, we invented the blackbird, a stealth bomber plane that can travel and supersonic speeds. Amazing technology for that time period. That was over 50 years ago. And the military has the largest budget the world has ever seen in its history. We can safely assume that there is a mass amount of super technology that has been invented that has not been made known to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t expect, with the video quality back then, to not have anomalies present when you zoom in on a video that was pre recorded. If that was a video taken today, then yes, I would agree, but in 2001 cameras weren&#39;t exactly the greatest. Not to say that camera technology has apexed, but it is definitely world&#39;s better when in comparison. Plus there would be far too many people involved to make 4 planes disappear that day without them being destroyed with the passengers and crew in them. The video you posted is assinign. This is all coming from the guy who posted what you read above btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not taking in everything you just saw. Even in 2001 a building that is 100s of feet behind the plane would not show up in front of the plane&#39;s wing. Same with the smoke formation. </p>

<p>Notice how there is no identifiable marking on the plane to show what airline it is. Notice that parts of the plane including the vertical stabilizer disappear then reappear. Notice how the plane does not slow down one bit while melting into the building. </p>

<p>On a basic level a hollow aluminum passenger jet cannot penetrate into a solid steel and concrete structure that is specifically designed to withstand such an impact. Planes suffer immense damage when striking birds in flight, and would be shredded horrifically by even just one of the twin towers&#39; exterior steel support columns. </p>

<p>2 of the planes were not even in the air that day. It&#39;s good that you&#39;re realizing the country was rooked on that day but you have much research still ahead of you, beginning with Sir Isaac Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the government payed or talked 1000&#39;s upon 1000&#39;s of eyewitnesses to just say there were 2 planes that flew into 2 building. Also, know how it&#39;s correctly spelt, auto correct has other ideas btw. The cameras back then were not exactly hd, so yes you will get some weird optical illusions that shouldn&#39;t be there when you zoom in on an object or zoom in on a pre recorded video, especially if it&#39;s moving at a high rate of speed. Do me a favor, go get a camera from that era and just take a whole bunch of video, after zoom in on things that are moving and I can guarantee you that you&#39;d get the same effect. After you&#39;ve done that and have found nothing like I described, then you can tell me I&#39;m wrong. Until then, go fuck yourself, I&#39;m not arguing with someone who doesn&#39;t know how videography works, and just wants to post a video that they think is true. Good day sir.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I had no idea that video quality could affect the speed at which a plane effortlessly slides into a building without slowing down when it should have (and would have) been smashed like a bug on a windshield. It&#39;s a good thing video quality has improved in 15 years enough that at least now, while not perfect, our camcorders at least don&#39;t change immutable laws of physics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even smaller aircraft have crashed into buildings at lower speeds and have gone in. Sorry to crush you fly into a wall theory, but that is fact that has happened. Don&#39;t use physics to try and back up your stupid ideas of &quot;There were no planes mmmmaaaaannnnn&quot; you sound like a fucking idiot. A plane moving at the speed of the plane in that video would absolutely penetrate you fucking tool. Do us all a favor, get out of your mom&#39;s basement, get some real world experience, and stop posting shit that makes people look at this subreddit crazier than it actually is.

<p>You are correct.  This statement does not contradict any of the video evidence.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right again.  The plane would be obliterated.  It would break apart into thousands of pieces of shrapnel.  Those pieces of shrapnel, traveling at around 500 miles per hour, would then penetrate deep into the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with all of their conclusions (mainly because I don&#39;t understand what they are), but I think the first 30 minutes or so of the September Clues movie should be more than enough to convince people that the news cast was just a coordinated fiction, and this is without even getting into the physics in question. </p>

<p>Anyone knows that a jet would be sliced in half like a carrot down the middle if it hit just one free-standing steel support column, so why do we have to think that the same jet would effortlessly melt through multiple of those massive columns with hundreds of thousands of tons of reinforced concrete and steel spandrels and trusses behind them?

Box cutters are more than enough match for people who are scared of getting slashed or killed, and all they needed to learn were the basics of the instrument panel and flight.

<p>There is no evidence available....The boxcutters, steel beams and passport were all provided by the same people who took all the actual evidence away. </p>

<p>Listen to what you&#39;re saying and hear how lost it sounds. First you say you believe the official story, given by the government, but you also believe the government knew about it and allowed it to happen. So you&#39;re saying the government helped blow up 3 towers, put a hole in the pentagon&#39;s accounting offices, fake Pennsylvania, killed loads of their own people......But we can still trust that the story they gave us is solid?

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, but it doesn&#39;t. Explosives were definitely used as well, but mainly to create the airplane shaped holes in the buildings. </p>

<p>The reason we know that MORE than mere explosives were used is because the towers were turned to dust. When you watch the videos of the towers &quot;collapsing&quot;, you can see that they were already dust before anything hit the ground. You can see steel girders being launched into the air only to turn into clouds before they come even close to hitting the ground. Mere explosives would not be powerful enough to turn the steel and concrete to dust. </p>

<p>Suqami&#39;s passport was reportedly found by a passerby (identity unknown), reportedly in the vicinity of Vesey Street,[8] before the towers collapsed.[9] (This was mistakenly reported by many news outlets to be Mohamed Atta&#39;s passport.)[citation needed][10] A columnist for the British newspaper The Guardian expressed incredulity about the authenticity of this report,[11] questioning whether a paper passport could survive the inferno unsinged when the plane&#39;s black boxes were never found. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satam_al-Suqami">Source</a></p>

<p>I just built my nuclear shelter entirely with passports as resilient as they seem.</p>

Even though the investigation wasn&#39;t started yet, they rushed those trucks to the site in order to clean it in the shortest timeframe possible.</p>

<p>The explanation is that the 9/11 attacks were promptly changed from a federal crime of terrorism to an act of war by the AUMF in the following days. The later designation suppresses the need for a forensic investigation and, therefore, the need to preserve the site for further inquiry. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why a large amount of debris are missing from the aftermath of the collapse. Since the rubbles weren&#39;t meant for preservation, New York City sold 175,000 tons of World Trade Center steel scrap. Some went to cities in the United States; about 60,000 tons went to companies in China, India, and South Korea. </p>

<p>You are not surprised the black boxes didn&#39;t survive the crash.  Black boxes which are designed to remain intact and survive crashes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As it turns out the tallest one listed on Wikipedia is not even half as tall as the twin towers were. However, there are some really good videos on Youtube of close-up shots during the destruction of the towers and it&#39;s simply not the same visual as what we see in other demolitions. A controlled demolition has a series of explosions, dismantling the support columns, and then gravity does the rest as the building collapses straight down. Whereas if you look at the sides of the trade centers, even from the second they start falling there are what look like mini explosions going on all the way down the entire time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely right, in fact I think the 9/11 Commission Report had them at even closer to 600 mph, like 590 or something like that. And these are hijackers who had never flown a passenger jet before.</p>

<p>Anyone can see that airliners suffer massive damage when they hit birds in flight. Anyone can imagine that if a Boeing hit just one stationary massive steel column, it would be sheared in half lengthwise like a steamed carrot. Therefore anyone should be able to realize that if the same plane hits the same massive steel column, but this time surrounded by other identical massive steel columns and reinforced by 100s of thousands of tons of steel and concrete behind it, it&#39;s not just going to slide right on in like a bullet into an apple.

<p>If you look through this thread you&#39;ll see people going out of their way just to shit on people who don&#39;t think planes hit the buildings. It&#39;s something that happens so often on this sub I wonder why it&#39;s so important that people don&#39;t figure this out.</p>

<p>Whereas the twin towers are blown apart in every direction from the top down while being turned to dust. You can see massive pieces of steel flying at 45 degree angles outward in every direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets just agree to disagree. All 3 fell into themselves just in different ways. Its my belief they were all controlled demolitions. </p>

<p>And &quot;massive pieces of steel flying at 45 degree angles outward in every direction&quot; would be considered debris.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You brain thinks it saw planes. Mine did too, at first. Why are there so many different video versions of plane impact, yet still none of them look right or match?

I didn&#39;t know humans could withstand such heat or shape shift, and duplicate themselves like wow. &#39;rip wacky wailing inflatable tube people&#39;  Did anyone actually study the footage like only a handful of us have, or did they let their emotions take the wheel like they were manipulated to? Why does &#39;Edna Cintron&#39; have a perfect doppelganger kneeled off to the side of her? Why does no one offer condolences for her twin? None of us can directly say what this is.

<p>Nothing. You&#39;ll just keep arguing and believing one of the two choices you were fed, and they&#39;re both wrong.
Nothing good will come of this, and you have mostly &#39;truthers&#39; to blame. They spread false narratives of history/sci-fi channel level bs and echo each other, and then you have a widespread cancer that operates among the citizenry as a hive mind. I think most don&#39;t want to know what was &#39;opened&#39; on that day, and why. 
I can understand, but you can&#39;t run from this forever. 9/11 was only one part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no planes. What you saw was CGI and live video compositing. The planes were inserted into the news footage, and poorly. The most likely scenario to explain what happened that day was the use of directed energy weapons (technology that has been purposefully kept from public knowledge for decades). Look into Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s research </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair enough -- as I said, the explanation of perspective does not touch why the smoke does the same thing but is quickly &quot;corrected,&quot; or why the vertical stabilizer glitches in and out of existence, why the jet has no strobe lights or airline insignia, or the many other inconsistencies in the other videos of this same scene, or why a jet would pierce the tower in the first place, which is physically impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, but it doesn&#39;t. Explosives were definitely used as well, but mainly to create the airplane shaped holes in the buildings. </p>

<p>The reason we know that MORE than mere explosives were used is because the towers were turned to dust. When you watch the videos of the towers &quot;collapsing&quot;, you can see that they were already dust before anything hit the ground. You can see steel girders being launched into the air only to turn into clouds before they come even close to hitting the ground. Mere explosives would not be powerful enough to turn the steel and concrete to dust. </p>
