       The Trillion Dollar boondoggle they were lobbing for was going to have a negligible impact on human production of CO2 and environmental impact. It was set to reduce emissions by 0.x% which would be offset by increasing production in countries that didn't sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no logical sense whatsoever. Global Warming is real, in that its been warming since the last Ice Age. Man's impact is a hoax. Efforts to "curb emissions" are geo-political and business/oligarchy related.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 80s/90s the US/Canada banned the majority of chemical production via regulations. It then went to China and increased exponentially. One might argue its better the West is less toxic but overall it did not decrease. So either you are a "racist" that is fine with offshoring pollution and descriptive processing/production or you care about the world and realize anything touched by Politicians is completely useless.

       Appeal to Authority. Firstly no actual "scientist" believes man has had an impact on global warming. There isn't enough data. Some hold reservations or will say
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       but very few actually agree and if they do they are being disingenuous.

       The 97% "Survey"...I mean...

       Well a scientist either knows or doesn't know. Belief shouldn't and doesnt play a part in any real science. For what cannot be known we have theory and models. And their models failed so their beliefs are as useful as religious zealots.

       He turned around nothing. Learn definitions and origins of science before it was twisted into "Life Sciences".

       Science is
       <em>
        observation
       </em>
       and
       <strong>
        experiment
       </strong>
       and without being able to prove your models with experimentation one cannot
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       anything. Their models are inaccurate and do not work.

        CLIMATE MODELS ARE NOT PREDICTIVE
       </a>
       this means
       <strong>
        they are wrong
       </strong>
       . That is science. If someone is claiming they are correct in their theories when it doesn't match observational data they are not scientists they are shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very simple. A 10 year old, when informed about the evidence for a previous Ice Age can determine its getting warmer. Any predictive model that says "it's warming" is correct in that its warming. To prove CO2 you would have to use
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       the data they claim is causing the warming which they did and the climate models are WRONG.

       Wow... That is a very informative graph. It does not include how prior to the 80's the temperature was rising at about 0.1 C a decade or how the industrial revolution has impacted global temperature. You're picking segments of data that you feel validate your stance without looking at the overall information. That's something that separates you from scientists. You just want to push an agenda, while the scientists look at the big picture.
      </p>

       The only conspiracy related to climate change is the propaganda campaign denying the science of global warming.

       Focusing on a subsection of a cycle that exists over millions of years is not going to yield accurate information. If CO2 and temperatures was much higher 10,000 yrs ago, 100,000 years ago, or 1 million years ago = how did that happen? Was there an industrial globalized nation wiped out were not aware of? How could it have returned to an Ice Age if its not a natural cycle.

       You're reading your methane graph backwards. And you're claiming there's no relationship for CO2, while providing a graph that shows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, notice how sharp and distinct the rise and fall of temperature is in the past, but currently it is staying in roughly the same area? That's because of man. Notice there's also more CO2 than ever before? Also because of man. Higher CO2 means higher average temperature means ice melting means trapped methane being released means we are screwing ourselves by favoring profits over the planet.

        Also, notice how sharp and distinct the rise and fall of temperature is in the past, but currently it is staying in roughly the same area? That's because of man.

       That's because the chart is over the course of thousands of years and we haven't gone near the peak levels.

       The estimates need to be looked at over long periods because any cross section would make it appear like a runaway reaction.

       Temperature precedes CO2 rise. The causality can then be interpreted as increased temperature creates CO2. Impossible for backwards causality [without some underlying alternative mechanism - which is possible but not what is promoted].

       The subsections of the temperature chart are for 50k years, with the exception of the last looking at 20k years. It is not difficult to visualize a comparison of half of any of the 50k subsections in approximation to the final subsection. The impact is telling.

       Again, you are reading the graph backwards. The X axis is going from past to present. So when reading left to right, if the temperature spikes and then CO2 spikes, it means the CO2 spike preceded the temperature spike.

       Ah, good catch. So your graph that showed the pink CO2 line rising, then the blue temperature line rising to the right of it was showing that rises in CO2 cause rises in temperature. It also showed the drops in temperature result in drops of CO2. Good thing you're keeping an eye on what I am saying, otherwise, you might have believed your graph showed CO2 rises following temperature rises.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your new reference, maybe look at some of their articles that aren't over a decade old. Seems they came to realize that CO2 is a factor in climate change. But I guess that's the beauty of data. You can generally find something that supports your argument. Just don't ignore the mountains of opposing data.

       You really like that graph. So what do you know about it? What data sets are being used by UAH to determine "reality?" What data sets are being used by RSS? How inclusive is the data? What do up-to-date comparisons show?

       You make a claim of cooked data in recent reports by one of your sources, then you turn around and post old data that you feel agrees with your stance. That is very dishonest and hypocritical.

       Take a step back from your passion; it is causing you to be unable to be objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying climate change isn't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying consider the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all I am going to say to you, because your emotional involvement is so high nothing anyone can say to you will cause you to consider any other information.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will need to seek it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actively seek out counter evidence to what I believe, so that I can remain objective.  It's a particular human failing that we all share and is worsened by the emotional involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, push against confirmation bias.  You may come out even more convinced that you're right, and you may find that one question which will lead you to better answers.

       Read the actual paper that claims "97% Consensus." It's junk. "Scientists" included biologists and others across many disciplines. 8000 out of 12,000 refused agree to AGW, but said "it's possible." The authors then stated "they support the hypothesis". The 97% figure
       <em>

       was a subsection of the actual people surveyed or it was cherry picking and twisting of words.

       The narrative is a hoax [although you are correct it's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       ]. Actual reproducible observations tell us it doesn't affect the environment except by putting CO2 back into the carbon cycle. Plants feed off CO2. CO2 produces larger plants. It's good for the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to argue about heavy metals, methane [actually problematic] again those are scientifically proven (negative) in observable experimentation and in large scale observation. But the push for "climate science" is focused on CO2. Maybe the question should be asked why the focus is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is alive. It's a living cell. It has a plasma sheath [ionosphere] which surrounds it,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane">
        just as your living cells have have plasma membrane
       </a>
       just as the sun is very similar to a plasma cell [white blood cell].
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Earth's case the environment utilizes CO2 for growth and produces Oxygen. It's a naturally efficient ecosystem. The only way its not "natural" is if the Earth itself was engineered.

       Yet the plants produce oxygen in return which is good for animals. The easiest solution here seems to be seeding more efficient trees and seeding where its possible with natural foliage.

       What happened 12,000 years ago that caused the Earth to warm up enough to melt the two mile thick sheet of ice covering North America then?  Maybe there's a cycle to this whole Earth warming then cooling again that we don't quite understand yet.
