    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious why you target political correctness in particular. It seems to me that there are many other factors more responsible for maintaining the current regime in the United States, like domestic surveillance and corporate control of politicians and police agencies. </p>

<p>OWS wasn&#39;t brought down by political correctness, but by FBI informants and digital surveillance at the behest of banks. </p>

<p>Political correctness may be a hurdle, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an insurmountable one, and it&#39;s possible that in very small amounts political correctness may serve a useful function of keeping people in a revolutionary movement from fracturing along identity lines.</p>

<p>I do agree that it&#39;s insane in its extreme forms, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s actually a giant existential problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it was a system like in Iran. A limited democracy under a theocracy where the supreme leader is appointed by a council and oversees everything. That might sound off-putting at first but I believe that in the case of Iran, the Islamic Revolution was necessary to keep the regime strong and resistant against globalist bankster imperialism.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure those globalist bankers have been butthurt about Iran ever since the revolution in 1979. That&#39;s why they&#39;ve been calling for all out war with Iran for decades because they realize that their little subversive tricks won&#39;t work anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you for real? Are you promoting dictatorship? Look at Africa, look back again, now look at Asia, look back again, now look at Latin America and pre-war Europe, look back again.</p>

<p>I like your idea and myself believe a technocratic custodianship would work to keep the government in check, but we kind of have that already through the law system - though the judiciary branch doesn&#39;t hold any actual power and in America, at least, it is still pretty corrupted if not overtly biased. And chosen partly by the partisan president bringing politics into it.</p>

<p>Yeah basically we need to clean up the judiciary branch and grant them more formal powers to keep the government in check. Then democracy should work just fine. And plenty of countries are doing well, just keep corporatism away from government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. What you&#39;d <strong>actually</strong> need to pull that off is an incorruptible authoritarian bureaucracy many times larger than the current US bureaucracy, which is already the largest bureaucracy in the history of humanity. Since you cannot hope to find that many incorruptible people you have to find even more incorruptible people to police them. On and on it goes forever ... except that the whole thing was corrupt from the get go because there have been like ten people in all of history &quot;worthy&quot; of being President of the United States much less King of the World and none of them would want anything to do with a fascist dictatorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See: communism, socialism, capitalism, anarchism, politics in general, religion, science... Etc etc. The list goes on. Any movement or idea that has existed has at least at one point in time had an individual, or a group of individuals, attempt to discredit or derail the movement to either ruin the original group/movement and/or further their own personal agenda. It&#39;s just the way the world in which we live in has been (at least up to this point). Just gotta try to not get sucked into that identity bullshit and recognise that every concept has infinite perspectives from which it can be viewed.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sorry, I misinterpreted what you said. I wasn&#39;t saying no to that question. But is there an incorruptible system? Probably. I&#39;m sure plenty of people have come up with ideas and concepts for incorruptible systems and even put them into use in some way or another. But since those systems don&#39;t currently exist in places that society needs them now, like politics for example, then that would suggest information on these systems has been suppressed by those who&#39;ve corrupted the current systems. Like I was simply pointing out earlier, that just so far in recognised human history the systems put in place by us and for us have been corrupted, and still are sometimes. </p>

<p>Nations would be better off with an incorruptible authoritarian leader overseeing the functions of the entire government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>

<p>Yeah, and the leader should be chosen by the Lady of the Lake holding aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water.</p>

<p>An incorruptible authoritarian leader DOES NOT EXIST. There is no such thing as an incorruptible person, nor is there an effective way of determining who is least corrupt without the oversight process itself becoming corrupted.</p>

<p>In other words, the system of government doesn&#39;t matter, and the evil aristocracy recognized this years ago.
 The moment the Federal Reserve was enacted, any overt description of government ceased to be relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I meant was, is there another system that is <em>incorruptible.</em> But you say, no, it&#39;s just the way the world has been, ppl ruin things for their own agendas.  So there is no system that is sustainable bec of the corrupt self-interests that derail them. </p>
