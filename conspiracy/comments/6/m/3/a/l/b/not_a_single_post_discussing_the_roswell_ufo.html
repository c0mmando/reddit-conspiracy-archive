    <div class="md"><p>Well the amount of ignorance surrounding this day is astounding. Look up FOIA or Freedom of Information Act. Then look up the fact that the documents have been declassified as of today.</p>

<p>Now you have to do a FOIA to ask the government for the files. Then you have to wait a few months for them to get it together. Then you get the documents. So researchers are submitting FOIAs and in a few fucking months we will see  the documents.</p>

<p>TL;DR: educate yourself mother fuckers</p>

<p>The second law of thermodynamics, otherwise known as the law of entropy, along with the fundamental principles of friction/resistance determine the impossibility of Earth being a uniformly spinning ball. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s when a talking head would say during a news report soon thereafter, &quot;For a while now there&#39;s been speculation among some of the country&#39;s top psychiatrist that President Trump was experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s.  Sadly, today this has been confirmed.  A quick decision was made overnight to swear in Vice President Mike Pence as the 46th President of the United States.  More information will be available following a scheduled announcement from the White House later today.  In other news...&quot;</p>

<p>And America would breath a sigh of relief because it was the rantings of an Alzheimer&#39;s patient.  Everyone will agree he couldn&#39;t be President any longer. Some will mourn, many would cheer.  In a couple of weeks, there would be a mass shooting. Between the President&#39;s Alzheimer&#39;s and the bipolar disorder the shooter will have been diagnosed and medicated for ignite a feud between the right holding tightly to their guns while praying away the demons and the left will scream stricter gun laws, especially for those with mental health issues. After a couple of weeks full of &quot;friends&quot; hurling insults at one another over mental health, a celebrity will die or breakdown or an animal will do something amazing on a viral video.  </p>

<p>Most will say all is right again but those of us awake will be wondering when the next shit storm is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you just say you liked Jimmy Carter?  If my reading comprehension isn&#39;t failing me today, I like you.</p>

<p>All my life, I was taught JC was a cowardly man who had no idea how to be president and had set America back decades.  If not for Reagan, America would be owned by Russia or China by now.</p>

<p>Then I grew up and decided to see for myself.  I spent several months emerging myself into everything Carter.  My final opinion:  Carter was too good to be President of a country which is actually run by greedy capitalist. He cared about people.  He lived as close to the tenets of Christianity as he could (even if I don&#39;t do religion, I&#39;ll respect anyone who does and lives accordingly).  He publicly admitted his flaws. He was humble and kind to everyone he met.</p>

<p>He was what America needed. With a second term, our country may have been entirely different today. But TPTB destroyed him. Made him a laughing stock by mocking his southern roots as a peanut farmer and ridiculing him over hostages; yet now that we know Reagan negotiated with terrorists to not release the hostages until he was elected, no one cares to re-evaluate the man with this perspective. </p>

<p>I notice he&#39;s still trying to warn us of problems today. I can&#39;t speak for everyone but I&#39;m damn sure listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first time I heard he was the only president to never go to war, I think on the Colbert Report or the Daily Show years ago, it immediately made sense to me why his Presidential legacy was still negatively viewed by so many Americans who lived through it. The level of propaganda going on at the time must have been astronomical.</p>

<p>This article is pretty interesting. He was very much ahead of his time.</p>

<p><a href="http://theelders.org/article/only-us-president-who-didnt-wage-war">http://theelders.org/article/only-us-president-who-didnt-wage-war</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carter&#39;s presidential legacy</p>

<p>As US President from 1976 to 1980, Carter established an energy policy that cut US oil imports by half. He also had solar panels installed on the White House roof, something that was ahead of the times. Carter emphasised human rights diplomacy in dealing with Latin America, negotiated with the Soviet Union for nuclear arms reduction, and contributed greatly to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (However, most of his policies – including the installation of solar panels – were overturned by his successor Ronald Reagan.)</p>

<p><strong>One of his greatest achievements, he felt, was that the United States did not fight against any countries during his presidency. Aside from the eight people who were killed during a hostage rescue mission during the Iranian Revolution, no American or any other national was killed under the banner of an American war.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>people always talk about who killed JFK but nobody ever mentions that the Zapruder film is really 3 films spliced together just like a Hollywood motion picture. Not to mention Zapruder was a 33rd degree Freemason and JFK&#39;s dad owned one of the biggest studios in Hollywood. </p>

<p>You can clearly see the splicing in the film when the motorcycles turn the corner and the car appears out of thin air. You can even seen the different people in the crowd between frames. Then, just a few seconds later when JFK&#39;s car is behind the sign in the film you can see another splice and then JFK&#39;s &quot;body&quot; remains in the same mannequin like position for the rest of the film up until the headshot.  </p>

<p>I honestly believe the assassination was a hoax and they shot a Hollywood dummy. Think about it. How could his brain possibly go missing? And why would JFK publicly announce that he was going to reveal secret plots and societies in the future instead of just revealing them on the spot? Thats just asking to be murdered. The whole thing is so elaborate its ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, now there&#39;s a new theory I&#39;ve yet to come across. Have anything to support the idea that I could check out? I have heard the Zapruder film is spliced before, but I don&#39;t understand where the advantage would be to TPTB to stage a public execution like this? Also, what happened to JFK then if they shot a dummy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only the I have to support the theory is the Zapruder film itself and the ability to play it in slow motion. At first I thought that idea was ridiculous but after the second splice JFKs posture remains fixed in position like a mannequin up until the head shot. </p>

<p>Also, the number of similarities between Lincoln and JFK are ridiculously suspicious as if JFKs assassination was a modern reenactment of Lincolns. </p>

<p>One theory on what happened to JFK is called Operation Second Farm. JFK was never assassinated and actually went on to become president again as one of Jimmy Carters many body doubles. Sounds absolutely nuts but just look at the two of them side by side and listen to their voices. If you have an open mind it&#39;s easy to see how it could be possible.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the link but there is a JFK speech/interview where someone asked him if he would be president again if he had the chance to do it over. He said maybe in the future or in another life. </p>

<p>As to why they would stage a mock execution of the president? Because &quot;Ordo ab chao&quot; which means &quot;order out of chaos.&quot; It&#39;s a Freemason policy similar to the Hegelian dialectic. In order to bring about a desired change, you must introduce a problem that will allow you to make that change. </p>

<p>JFKs assassination was the first major nationally televised act of terrorism. It became forever engrained in the minds of those who were alive then and even those who hadn&#39;t even been born yet. It was a major step in breaking down the subcultures of America and getting us to all identify as one homogenous culture like most of us do today. Whether you lived in an Italian neighborhood, a Haitian neighborhood, Chinatown, etc, everybody was united in watching the spectacle that was the assassination </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what purpose would the USFG have to &quot;confuse the shit&quot; out of them? US coulda just said &quot;I uh nuh,&quot; said they&#39;re looking into the increase in reports, and given an explanation along the lines of mass hysteria. It&#39;s probably not that simple; I&#39;d hesitate to wager the disinfo was intended not to confuse people, but to use them as a resource gathering. What was noticeable, what wasn&#39;t, is it an aircraft, is it ours, and if not, who the hell&#39;s is it? Kinda along those lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s when a talking head would say during a news report soon thereafter, &quot;For a while now there&#39;s been speculation among some of the country&#39;s top psychiatrist that President Trump was experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s.  Sadly, today this has been confirmed.  A quick decision was made overnight to swear in Vice President Mike Pence as the 46th President of the United States.  More information will be available following a scheduled announcement from the White House later today.  In other news...&quot;</p>

<p>And America would breath a sigh of relief because it was the rantings of an Alzheimer&#39;s patient.  Everyone will agree he couldn&#39;t be President any longer. Some will mourn, many would cheer.  In a couple of weeks, there would be a mass shooting. Between the President&#39;s Alzheimer&#39;s and the bipolar disorder the shooter will have been diagnosed and medicated for ignite a feud between the right holding tightly to their guns while praying away the demons and the left will scream stricter gun laws, especially for those with mental health issues. After a couple of weeks full of &quot;friends&quot; hurling insults at one another over mental health, a celebrity will die or breakdown or an animal will do something amazing on a viral video.  </p>

<p>Most will say all is right again but those of us awake will be wondering when the next shit storm is coming.</p>
