       Surely one should oppose islamism? Majid Nawaz makes good distinction between islam and Islamism. Basically islam is a private religion, islamism is anyone who wants to impose it over others

       Muslims choose to pick the beheading of infidels. That leads to problems. No other religion short of the Talmud teaches such violent actions towards people not of their religion.

       The majority in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa do choose to implement beheadings and other violent teaches of their religion.

      <p>
       The Old Testament is Jewish. I have my opinions on Christianity and religion in general but for the most part Christians are peaceful and do not teach violence nor do they perpetrate violence.

       For the most part, Islam is a monolithic religion. All of the Abrahamic/Monotheistic religions believe in the same God. As for the crusaders they were sent down because of the Muslim invaders. It was defensive not offensive.
      </p>

       Abortion is murder. Not saying those people are justified but yeah. Also, how many cases of that have actually happened in modern time compared to the violence of Jews and Muslims?

       Is Christianity a monolithic religion? No. Numerous different sects etc.  Same with Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crusaders wanted to have a reconquest. If you're an apologist you could say it was defensive. Surely this Jewish violence is also defensive? They were there first.  Nice hole you dug yourself. Also heard of the peasants crusade? Went through germany murdering jews and catholic priests who defended them
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats your opinion to hold, but it's very much subjective so should be decided by the individual
      </p>
      <p>
       All religions have the capacity to encourage a lot of violence, historically Christianity has been less tolerant than islam

       Firstly Islam has more than 2 sects.  Also within those sects there are major differences.

       Christians teach of conversion yes but through the peaceful act. If people do not want to convert the Christian has done their duty by at least trying to. It will be on the person they were trying to convert when judged by God.

       You're playing a game you can't win. As long as you try to justify your views as congruent with progressive values, you're not only constantly on defense but you're also legitimizing progressive ideology. Total tolerance for all ideas and peoples is not a positive thing and you know it, but you still struggle to admit to intolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Republicans and mainstream Western conservatives are so easy to make fun of and won't succeed in the culture war. They pay half-assed lip service to liberal values like equality and tolerance and then immediately push the government to treat different people differently. They won't just come out and say, "I am intolerant. I distinguish between groups and assign them individual values accordingly." They're timid and they're hypocrites.

       I think i said that pretty clearly and explained why it wasnt intolerance to oppose those who are intolerant.

       Firstly it's 'Mohamedism' not 'Islam' - translate/define properly.

       Secondly only shit interpretations are so intolerant- better understanding provides kinder forms.

       Thirdly, define opposition and intolerance- you're walking a fine line.

       Until there are roving gangs of moderate islam in the streets to protect people from extermists (like christians have done often in history) then I am going to call all muslims Islamosts and attribute the worst of  islam to all of them until they prove me wrong.

       Is Christianity a monolithic religion? No. Numerous different sects etc.  Same with Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crusaders wanted to have a reconquest. If you're an apologist you could say it was defensive. Surely this Jewish violence is also defensive? They were there first.  Nice hole you dug yourself. Also heard of the peasants crusade? Went through germany murdering jews and catholic priests who defended them
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats your opinion to hold, but it's very much subjective so should be decided by the individual
      </p>
      <p>
       All religions have the capacity to encourage a lot of violence, historically Christianity has been less tolerant than islam
