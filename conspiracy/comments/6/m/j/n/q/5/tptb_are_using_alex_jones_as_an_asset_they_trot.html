        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This dawned on me the other day...</p>

<p>So I had been a listener of Jones for sometime. I admired his passionate ramblings and his legitimate films that exposed the plot to establish a One World Government (which is absolutely real). </p>

<p>However, lately I&#39;ve been seeing him in videos on YouTube and Facebook trending. These are not videos exposing the elite, but videos that show him going crazy and yelling and acting goofy.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re turning the frogs gay&quot; is a HUGELY popular meme on Facebook.</p>

<p>I feel as if this is having a subconscious effect on the masses and people who watch these videos and get a kick out of them, that this &quot;conspiracy stuff&quot; Alex Jones talks about is laughable and far fetched. I feel as if this is the plan.</p>

<p><strong>And Alex himself is encouraging people to make even more memes of him.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/80TzHxlKySM">https://youtu.be/80TzHxlKySM</a></p>

<p>Does this sound like someone who should be in charge of representing our cause and our movement? I think they&#39;re purposely using him to act like an asshole to turn people away from things like 9/11, Pizzagate, ect, by associating him with those things. He&#39;s a joke on Facebook right now. </p>

<p>it will sell more of his products and make him and his cabal more profits. I no longer trust this guy, especially after his antics regarding the Piers Morgan segment. </p>
