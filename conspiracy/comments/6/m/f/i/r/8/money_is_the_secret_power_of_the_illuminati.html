    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why we have to change things around using the Sacred Economics model. </p>

<p>In Sacred Economics:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People can consume as they go so they aren&#39;t desperate. </p></li>
<li><p>We all own everything and use the caretaker system to share. If you are using it, its yours. If you aren&#39;t using it, donate it. This way, everyone has potential access to everything. </p></li>
<li><p>Trade it taken out of the picture since everything is essentially free. No more worship of funny green paper or pretty gold.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our quality of life would be entirely in our own hands. We would move up and down together meaning we would all be focused on the same exact thing which is improving planetary wealth. (IE we might create robot workers to do the manual labor jobs). Right now, the Illuminati is using robot workers to save money even though they are often billionaires. We would all be on the same page more or less. It would be a cooperative economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We, the people, need to run our own government from now on. I already figured it all out. It&#39;s a long explanation but the idea is to merge people and government together so that we, as people, use humane systems to govern ourselves. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, it would be an open source government where we have nothing to hide and where anyone, at anytime, can inspect anything to make sure its all moving along legit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racism has been promoted by the Illuminati as a way to divide us. Its simply not natural but a learned process. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that if we all run our own government without money, we will all have the same quality of life (more or less). That means, we would all team up together to improve that quality of life which would unite us like nothing we have ever seen with the current system. It would break up the racism. There&#39;s a psychological experiment where a man created racism and then destroyed it all in the same experiment. I forgot the name but when we unite for a common goal, racism will quickly melt away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By empowering the poeple. How do you empower the people?</p>

<p>First, understand, 2 types of power exist:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Light power - The power to build</p></li>
<li><p>Dark power - The power to enslave.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The 1 secret to light power is UNITY. Unity is the secret to empowering the people. This is why they put so much effort into dividing us between capatalist/communist/black/white/gay/straight/republican/democrat. The idea is to divide us up into independent groups so that we feel like our group is our family and all other groups are our competitors. </p>

<p>So... First thing first, we need to unify. How do we unify? We do it in our own minds. Each person is individually responsible for only 1 mind and that is their own. Its so easy but a lot of people always wait for others to act before they do and this is our downfall. Now is the best time to act. As more and more people do this, the more empowered we become. </p>

<p>Once we are unified, we can utilize ourselves like a giant centipede where we are all on the same page. Look how many good arms, legs, and brains we all have. If we put this to use together, we would be insanely powerful. Once we unify, the next step is cooperation. Cooperation is bigger and more noble than pure competition although we can still compete while cooperating. </p>

<p>The formula for cooperation is N(squared). If 3 people are cooperating, they have a power of 9. If 10 people are cooperating, they have a power of 100. The more people we get to cooperate, the more power we have. Eventually, that power is put to use (IE a bunch of volunteers just posted up 70 million trees). </p>

<p>Unity + Cooperation = Success</p>

<p>Another, more advanced technique is to blindy forgive all people and love everyone equally. This alone solves many problems but one would have to try it to understand why its so valuable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First thing first, we all need the right perspective and stance if we wish to succeed. To accomplish this, we need to forgive all people including the self and love all people equally including the self. This will instantly trigger opportunity to make cooperation work. Cooperation should be elevated to top priority because each of us act like ingredients and when ingredients are combined, flavor is made. Also, real building power comes from cooperation. The formula is N(squared) with N being the number of current cooperating participants. </p>

<p>Once the inside is fixed and a dedication to cooperate with all humans is set, the human centepede becomes more powerful. </p>

<p>Finally, each of us have friends and family we can redpill and encourage. </p>

<p>The beauty of it all is that all we have to do is a little bit of work because when each of us put a small bit of work into it, mountains are moved because there are so many of us. We are already doing this subconsciously with our families but it&#39;s time to expand into all of society and treat them like family too. The idea is that if everyone put some in a slight bit of work, the output will be so insane that nothing more is required. Basically, we either all put in a little work or we all individually put in a whole lot of work. This is why we can immediately lower work hours to 5 hours/5 days a week right off the bat since most Americans will work instead of just 65% as we have now. </p>

<p>Another way to think of it is by imagining robots. How would one arrange robots to be most efficient? They would set it up so each robot runs a job its body was designed for and with all the robots working, the strain of work is kept at a minimum. The only difference is that robots are soulless operated by humans and humans are driven by love. Love means wanting to do good things for other people. Love is the single most powerful quality of life raiser in existence. </p>
