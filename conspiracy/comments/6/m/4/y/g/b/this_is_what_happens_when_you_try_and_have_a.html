       Never, not unless they are asking for answers and responding with interest. I just thought I would give it a try for the hell of it. But it does provide a strong example of why it doesn't work with people who aren't seeking the truth. Those videos I provided are incredible, and he just blew them off like they are pointless drivel.

       Yes! It is worth it! You grow in a way where people in that mindset no longer bother you, but if you plant seeds they grow. It doesn't matter how much they object to it, just because they read it or heard it it will remain in their consciousness (or subconscious) and their brain will refer to it when the subject comes up.

       It does, I feel you! I had to end a discussion about vaccines recently because it was too much, the person vehemently shut down every single thing I brought into question. As much as I wanted to make a difference in his/her mind, I decided to take the rejection and let it slide. Sucks.

       It's worth it because if the lurkers.  You prob won't get anywhere with that person (likely a bot anyway).  But the lurkers might hit just one of those excellent links.

       It would be impossible for him to read/listen to all that so fast. I just posted that list for him and he had no particular comments on anything of relevance. I haven't heard a peep from the user after that last message, so I imagine he is either a troll, or a person who hates having his mind changed.

       First, I didn't downvote you. So stop freaking out.  Second, it was a fairly simple question so you should be able to answer it.  Since you didn't, I can only assume that you didn't know what you're talking about in the first place.  While the other guy in your post was a dick, you came off as a weirdo.  You'll never convince any "normal" person of anything if you can't speak to them on their level.  As it stands, it looks like you just came here to cry about not being understood when you should be reflecting on why.

       Weirdo. Nice derogatory statement. Way to dismiss someone who likely has a higher capacity for understanding than you. I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, that's the job of propagandists. I have no reason to stoop down to anyone's level if they can't hang with my own. I came here to show what happens when you give pearls to swine. If you can't see that, you're the shortsighted one.

       You might want to be more specific. America is more corrupt than Russia, in what specifically? So ask me that and I'll have an answer. But if you look through the comment history I posted the link to, you would already have your answer answered. Obviously you didn't do that. So why are you asking a needless question?

       You're still doing it.  You come off as being a pretentious pseudo intellectual.  Nobody likes that, or wants to "hang" with your "own" if you act like that.  I'm just trying to help you out, but you're doubling down on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question was a simple test as to whether or not you could state your argument clearly, but particularly concisely.  Again, to give you a chance to act normal, yet you continue to fail.  Pretty dumb for someone with a higher capacity for understanding.

       I really dont get people like you. I have a poli-sci/history double-major, and have worked for the government for the past 4 years since I graduated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume you also have a degree, or higher education, and yet you still have an arrogant patronizing tone to everything you say. How can you be "learned" and also trully believe you know whats right or wrong? I have opinions on everything, but to feel the need to gloat them over other people or to showcase someone elses
       <em>
        perceived
       </em>
       ignorance for others to deride so you can reinforce your own self narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, and I really mean this, you need to take a few steps back and look into a mirror for awhile. What are you trying to do? Proselytize the world? And for what? To what end here? I can tell you with the conviction of every atom in my body that no one is right and no one cares what you think. Make your own life a reflection of your OWN beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do I need to post a list of a bunch of rich peoples opinions for you to listen to what I said...

       I was a vegan communist when I was first in post secondary school. The entire environment seemed to foster and almost endorse it. After a fee years of having a career and travelling the world I was finally able to start seeing life for what it is. Unfortunately, you have to play the game to be able to advance in life, so academia should be more the focus of our disdain.

       I'm sorry that person treated you that way, when people are emotionally charged they're extremely irrational. Like way more than usual. And the words he used, along with those atrocious vibes, were rejecting anything that was coming at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so different from what he's used to, his brain is incapable of processing it at this present time. I honestly don't mean this as degrading, I only know this because I've experienced it and have learned how to handle it better, literally everyone does this. I've begun to wonder if those emotions (hormones) are kind of like a buffer, to scatter the information we receive so it doesn't destroy our ego. The ego is where we approach life from, it's like the main processing center everything goes through to determine if something is useful or not; if something is too different and threatens the current structure, hormones are released in the brain to make the information irrational and the ego declines to process it thoroughly.

       Don't sweat it, thank you for trying! Many more people will see the links and your words, and appreciate them. &lt;3

       Ah yes, the ego. I keep killing mine when it tries to make me ignore a well constructed opposing point of view. Hard to listen when I'm stuck in the mud of my safety zone. Thank you for your input! Much love.

       Saved this comment!! You have managed to give such a simple overview to a topic that I always seem to find so difficult to put clearly into words. Its all about planting the seeds of change and taking care to do so in a way that  isnt taken to be aggressive or patronising. Once defense barriers are up and people feel too challenged, its conversation over. I used to be like a bloody attack dog when speaking passionately about something important to me, or around issues that I have a really good grasp on. These days I am a lot more conversational in my approach and am genuinely interested in understanding where someone else is coming from. I find being curious (and authentically so) in these types of conversations to be far more effective when it comes to easing people into seeing another point of view.. ugh rambling.. sorry!!

       Aww, I'm glad I could help! Don't be sorry, you're not rambling, I know what you mean! Being interested in what the other person has to say definitely makes a huge difference, we all exist for one another to experience from our authentic spaces; so when an opinion is being forced people naturally reject it because it's slightly off-handedly saying what they believe is wrong and only you're right.  But it's not even a conscious thing, like it just happens, this type of phenomena piques my interest quite a bit! I know deep down that everyone are sensitive, beautiful beings (so mushy, I know, but it's true!) so it always baffled me how such two cool af people could start a throw down over... anything really. I'm not sure that last sentence makes sense, but I think you'll get what I mean!
      </p>
      <p>
       I took a few different psychology classes, including bio psych and abnormal psych (it's not what most people assume it is), and it helped me see how objectively we're kind of like machines. We're not at all, but at the same time we are. I have some text books I can get to you if you're interested (through something like dropbox or the like)!
