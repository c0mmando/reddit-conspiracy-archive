   r/conspiracy: As a Trump supporter, last night was hell. I can't help but think that Trump isn't who he says he is, and the mental gymnastics are killing me. Calling in sick this morning because I had zero sleep. God damn, anyone else feel like this? Hope I'm not the only one. | /r/Conspiracy Archive

       I voted Trump to make america great again, and now we, along with the UK, are the laughing stock of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole Russian collusion thing all seems like a giant nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still support the person I thought Trump was during the campaign, and I support draining the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental gymnastics are tough though. I don't want to call it quits on Trump just yet, because if I don't support him, then who will i support? Hillary? Fuck that.

       He fought.  Yes.  For that he deserves respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       However.

      <p>
       His current activism consists of him funneling progressives back into the dem Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why he told us to vote H and didn't fight the election fraud that stole our votes for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       That he didn't should be our reason for rejecting him.
