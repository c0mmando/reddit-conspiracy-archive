<p>This whole Russian collusion thing all seems like a giant nightmare.</p>

<p>I still support the person I thought Trump was during the campaign, and I support draining the swamp.</p>

<p>The mental gymnastics are tough though. I don&#39;t want to call it quits on Trump just yet, because if I don&#39;t support him, then who will i support? Hillary? Fuck that.</p>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>His current activism consists of him funneling progressives back into the dem Party.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why he told us to vote H and didn&#39;t fight the election fraud that stole our votes for him.</p>

<p>He should have.</p>

<p>That he didn&#39;t should be our reason for rejecting him.</p>

<p>The perfect is the enemy of the good enough?</p>

<p>NOPE.</p>

<p>Demand the perfect.</p>
