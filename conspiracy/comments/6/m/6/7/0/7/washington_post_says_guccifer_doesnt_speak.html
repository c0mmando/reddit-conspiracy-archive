    <div class="md"><p>This -- &quot;Guccifer <strong>2.0</strong>&quot; is the one they claim was secretly Russian, pretending to be Romanian, riding on Guccifer&#39;s coattails. </p>

<p>However, there is VERY good reason to doubt that Guccifer 2.0 was either Russian or Romanian -- he was most likely a fluent English-speaker feigning &quot;Russian-ness&quot; based on the inconsistency of his errors and his firm grasp on key aspects of English non-native speakers struggle with. Not to mention the metadata that strongly indicates deliberate fabrication of &quot;Russian fingerprints&quot; on documents he released. The most likely explanation by far is that the DNC/CrowdStrike manufactured the whole thing to discredit forthcoming leaks. All of this and more is very well explained and verifiable at <a href="http://g-2.space">http://g-2.space</a> -- I strongly recommend reading all of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Roger Stone connection is pretty easy to explain. Look how much effort they went to to sell their &quot;Russian collusion&quot; narrative. Republicans collaborating with a &quot;known Russian hacker&quot; goes along with it quite well -- and that&#39;s exactly how it was reported in the media. </p>

<p>The Seth Rich part is curious, and maybe irrelevant since the authenticity of those chat logs have been called into question (not by Adam Carter initially -- he added that disclaimer in response to people&#39;s growing concerns that the logs were fake). However, if we assume they&#39;re real, it seems far more likely that the DNC disinformation campaign intended to smear wikileaks as affiliated with Russian hackers would also attempt to tie himself to their alleged source, to carry the smear even farther. What makes no sense is why he would name Seth Rich as &quot;his whistleblower&quot; if he really was a hacker, since that would imply that he didn&#39;t hack the DNC at all... </p>

<p>It&#39;s strange. I just can&#39;t imagine the DNC wanting to mention that in any capacity unless they didn&#39;t have anything to do with it and didn&#39;t care(but even then I don&#39;t think they would.</p>

<p>I get the stone part, but I meant also the florida GOP guy who originally got the data, as far as we know the data was real and valuable, I don&#39;t think they would give all that away just to make a third hand link to stone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure they wouldn&#39;t, either. It really helped cement the image that the &quot;Russian hackers&quot; had a partisan agenda, to not just release that info publicly but give it specifically to a GOP operative. And it didn&#39;t hurt the Clinton campaign at all. Just looking at their whole DNC money laundering scheme, it&#39;s clear that they were more than happy to sell out downballot candidates to bolster the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>Agreed that naming Seth Rich is strange, any way you slice it. The only plausible motives I can think of are 1) plain old attention whoring or 2) aiming to discredit Rich with the Russia smear too. There&#39;s been some subtle telegraphing that seems to imply that if Seth Rich is proven to have been connected to WikiLeaks, they may then attempt to tie him up in the Russia narrative to save it. Like, that seems to be Burkman&#39;s whole angle, pinning his murder on the Russians. </p>

<p>It&#39;s strange though because the story about that happening only came out in like, may, when it happened before the election, wouldve been a lot more damaging earlier, and we only heard about the roger stone part of it earlier because roger stone himself bragged about it and posted his DMs with guccifer. and then the GOP guy cooperated with reporters on the rest of the story, we easily couldve not ever found out about it, or found out way earlier if it was intentional.</p>

<p>yeah I don&#39;t think anyone can be sure of what guccifer 2 is, even if hes not a russian agent, or a DNC op, he could be a second person who hacked into things, or a drama hog who didn&#39;t hack anything or was using someone else&#39;s work.</p>

<p>However, &quot;Guccifer&quot; is a hacker name / online persona. The notion that someone would name themselves Guccifer 2.0, is as absurd as a singer calling himself Justin Bieber Jr. </p>

<p>Perhaps, the media or IC dubbed this &quot;unknown Russian hacker&quot; Guccifer 2.0, but again the premise that a quasi independent, contract hacker, which is the story MSM has fed us, wouldn&#39;t have a self-created online persona/handle, is absolutely absurd. </p>

<p>So if MSM or IC community doesn&#39;t even know the hacker&#39;s online identity, why would I give a shit about what they say he did or didn&#39;t do? At best, they are clearly not very familiar with this person. In reality, he likely is a Western MSM creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh the media didn&#39;t name him that, he called himself that on his WordPress site when he first emerged. I totally agree that it&#39;s not something a real hacker would ever realistically do, but it serves a good purpose, muddying the waters and creating confusion with the original Guccifer, like you had. Further supports the notion that the whole thing is deliberate disinformation, IMO.</p>
