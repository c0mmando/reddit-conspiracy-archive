<p>Do just a minute of research. There&#39;s plenty to show what&#39;s actually happening without being a Trump shill.</p>

<p>We went from pissporn and Putin literally working with Trump to hack the DNC to Jr took a meeting that turned up nothing.</p>

<p>Anyone pushing this MuhRussia shit is an ignorant, MSM brainwashed moron or is being paid.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s not perfect but he did win and no one hacked shit. What this sub always opposed is media lies, the deep state, and corruption. Now, apparently we love all that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it. I believe this is shill central right now and the establishment is afraid they can&#39;t control us, so they need to divide us.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you dare let them allow you to forget the DNC cheated Bernie and everyone who donated. We&#39;re talking millions of dollars. Seth Rich was killed for leaking. John Podesta was phished. NO ONE HACKED ANYTHING.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the most likely scenario.</p>

<p>Trump and Putin don&#39;t make out and get gay like all these childish fuckwits online suggest and think they&#39;re cute for sharing.</p>

<p>As a gay, married man, I find it offensive that being gay somehow makes you a bitch. Yet all these &quot;tolerant&quot; lefties have no problem suggesting it.</p>

<p>I implore users and mods to please watch for the dividers. When someone wants to talk about Seth Rich, they aren&#39;t from r/The_Donald. Accusations of that sort should fall under rule 10.</p>
