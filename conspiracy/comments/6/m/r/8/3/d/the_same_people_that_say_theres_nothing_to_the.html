       Do just a minute of research. There's plenty to show what's actually happening without being a Trump shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went from pissporn and Putin literally working with Trump to hack the DNC to Jr took a meeting that turned up nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone pushing this MuhRussia shit is an ignorant, MSM brainwashed moron or is being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's not perfect but he did win and no one hacked shit. What this sub always opposed is media lies, the deep state, and corruption. Now, apparently we love all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it. I believe this is shill central right now and the establishment is afraid they can't control us, so they need to divide us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you dare let them allow you to forget the DNC cheated Bernie and everyone who donated. We're talking millions of dollars. Seth Rich was killed for leaking. John Podesta was phished. NO ONE HACKED ANYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the most likely scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Putin don't make out and get gay like all these childish fuckwits online suggest and think they're cute for sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a gay, married man, I find it offensive that being gay somehow makes you a bitch. Yet all these "tolerant" lefties have no problem suggesting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I implore users and mods to please watch for the dividers. When someone wants to talk about Seth Rich, they aren't from r/The_Donald. Accusations of that sort should fall under rule 10.
