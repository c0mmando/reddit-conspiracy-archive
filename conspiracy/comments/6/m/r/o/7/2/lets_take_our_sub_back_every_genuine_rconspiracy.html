        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve decided to turn <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mnyhp/if_you_want_to_talk_about_trump_and_russia_its/dk3g7td/">a comment</a> into a self post.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my response to the question of how we can take our sub back from those who consistently obfuscate and deflect:</p>

<p>Every <em>genuine</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user needs to let their voice ring. </p>

<p>Original content <em>must</em> be encouraged above all.</p>

<p>When comments that claim &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is losing its way&quot; get upvoted by the hundreds, and the commenters have little to no history of <em>any</em> participation in our sub, then you know shit is fucked. </p>

<p>The reddit hive mind refuses to accept that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might be skeptical when the hive mind has determined that something is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the very nature of the independent thinker to be skeptical when told what to think.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist has been shouting from the rooftops for decades about corruption at the highest levels of government (and perhaps higher). </p>

<p>The fact that the masses are finally &quot;waking up&quot; to this corruption is not even remotely comforting to the veteran conspiracy theorist, as the masses are merely following the memetic mandates of the hive mind. </p>

<p>Where was the <em>universal</em> outrage (in the <em>mainstream</em>) when Kennedy was assassinated? During Vietnam? After 9/11?</p>

<p>These were manufactured events...yet the hive mind wasn&#39;t triggered into the appropriate type of outrage (against TPTB). </p>

<p>The fact that only now, after nebulous accusations against the current POTUS and abuse of the tired Russia bogeyman meme (regardless of their veracity!), do we <em>finally</em> see relatively unanimous outrage...to the veteran conspiracy theorist, this is the most suspicious turn of events imaginable. </p>

<p>We are being played.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist knows this.</p>

<p>Trump could have colluded with the Russians until the proverbial cows come home...but it&#39;s clear that this current outrage is woefully misguided. </p>

<p>The one thing that the MSM/hive mind didn&#39;t question in the entirety of Trump&#39;s presidency was when he bombed a sovereign nation over obviously faulty intelligence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all you need to know to realize that this current outrage is utterly manufactured.</p>

<p>I weep for those who are blinded by this propaganda. </p>

<p>For those who have the courage to think for yourselves, you are the last hope for a free humanity.</p>
