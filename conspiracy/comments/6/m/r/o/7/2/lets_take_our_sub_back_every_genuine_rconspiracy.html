       I've decided to turn
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mnyhp/if_you_want_to_talk_about_trump_and_russia_its/dk3g7td/">
        a comment
       </a>
       into a self post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my response to the question of how we can take our sub back from those who consistently obfuscate and deflect:
      </p>
      <p>
       Every
       <em>
        genuine
       </em>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       user needs to let their voice ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original content
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be encouraged above all.
      </p>
      <p>
       When comments that claim "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is losing its way" get upvoted by the hundreds, and the commenters have little to no history of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       participation in our sub, then you know shit is fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reddit hive mind refuses to accept that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       might be skeptical when the hive mind has determined that something is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the very nature of the independent thinker to be skeptical when told what to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy theorist has been shouting from the rooftops for decades about corruption at the highest levels of government (and perhaps higher).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the masses are finally "waking up" to this corruption is not even remotely comforting to the veteran conspiracy theorist, as the masses are merely following the memetic mandates of the hive mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the
       <em>
        universal
       </em>
       outrage (in the
       <em>
        mainstream
       </em>
       ) when Kennedy was assassinated? During Vietnam? After 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       These were manufactured events...yet the hive mind wasn't triggered into the appropriate type of outrage (against TPTB).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that only now, after nebulous accusations against the current POTUS and abuse of the tired Russia bogeyman meme (regardless of their veracity!), do we
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       see relatively unanimous outrage...to the veteran conspiracy theorist, this is the most suspicious turn of events imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are being played.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy theorist knows this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could have colluded with the Russians until the proverbial cows come home...but it's clear that this current outrage is woefully misguided.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that the MSM/hive mind didn't question in the entirety of Trump's presidency was when he bombed a sovereign nation over obviously faulty intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all you need to know to realize that this current outrage is utterly manufactured.
      </p>
      <p>
       I weep for those who are blinded by this propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who have the courage to think for yourselves, you are the last hope for a free humanity.
