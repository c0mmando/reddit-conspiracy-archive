        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I originally looked over the massive banker cabinet he hired but he really lost me with his endless policies that benefit the cabal. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sessions trying to increase punishments on drug charges. </p></li>
<li><p>Removing laws that prevent bankers from abusing the people. </p></li>
<li><p>They are trying to increase private military forces in the Middle East which cost the tax payers an arm and a leg. </p></li>
<li><p>Attacking Yemen and Syria was really bad. </p></li>
<li><p>No mention of our hidden technology or resources. </p></li>
<li><p>He&#39;s constantly bending the knee to Israel. </p></li>
<li><p>The prophetic Illuminati card game makes it seem like he was planned to be president a long time ago: <a href="http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-assassination-illuminati-card-game-678x381.png">http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-assassination-illuminati-card-game-678x381.png</a></p></li>
<li><p>No mention of arresting Hillary and the swamp draining is barely even happening. He did get rid of James Comey but VictoryOfLight took credit for that claiming he sent Trump evidence that Comey was sitting on evidence that 9-11 was an inside job and yet did nothing. </p></li>
<li><p>Even r/the_donald is suspicious as it bans any criticism of Israel or Trump. They are afraid of something leaking out so they control people&#39;s posts like thought police. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump also bent the knee to Saudi Arabia which is a full blown terrorist state. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>He did throw a few bones our way like all presidents do early in their presidency. This whole thing looks shady though. It looks like we have been duped yet again. </p>
