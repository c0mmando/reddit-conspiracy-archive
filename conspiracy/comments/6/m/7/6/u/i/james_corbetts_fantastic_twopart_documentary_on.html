    <div class="md"><p>I have only watched cursory videos on pizzagate so I&#39;m no expert, but if it&#39;s this giant zero-sum waste of time, an awful lot of of time was spent by the media to try and discredit it. Colbert&#39; rant being a prime example. </p>

<p>And Ben Swann does a short segment explaining it and a week later he &quot;goes dark&quot;, deleting his social media accounts and erasing the brand he had built for himself over the course of many years, stating that he isn&#39;t being fired from his station, he&#39;s just going to be working &quot;in a different capacity&quot;. WTF?</p>

<p>The horrifying truth is that child trafficking rings and ritual abuse do happen in the upper-echelons of power all over the world. This is well-documented. Just look up the story surrounding Jimmy Saville. That&#39;s one of very many. </p>

<p>As far as pizzagate is concerned, it seems to only implicate high-level democrats, which makes me believe that it&#39;s being framed politically. However, I would absolutely not be surprised if a high-level abuse network was discovered within elite government circles in the US. </p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m afraid that probably <em>is</em> the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not just dems---- Dennis Hastert is a friend of Podesta&#39;s, an early lead. Mike Pence might also be implicated, which is potentially the real reason Trump fired Flynn....speculation, tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. A whole lot of time, money, and resources were spent making sure everyone <em>knew</em> it was a nothing story. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen so much attention given to making sure people <em>knew</em> a nothing story was a nothing story. </p>

<p>Almost proves that there&#39;s indeed something to it. Surprise!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Makes me reconsider Sandy Hook... And re-evaluate pizzagate. To (((them))), pizzagate actually poses a significant threat. It&#39;s so easy to point to the physical evidence.</p>

<p>Alot of people have been misinformed by the &quot;pedo ring in the basement&quot; story, which mentions nothing to do with Wikileaks. Very subtle mis-telling. </p>

<p>I hope Trump actually does something, though I dont think he can until after 2018 or maybe 2020.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way I terms of the media owners (the real ones) taking major action to punish a reporter for covering a conspiracy theory:</p>

<p>Geraldo Rivera has Richard Gage from <em>Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth</em> and Bob Mclevane (sp) ON HIS PRIMETIME MSM SHOW to discuss their belief that 9/11 was at the very least not what we were told by the government. </p>

<p>Nothing happened. </p>

<p>A talented, fair reporter at a local CBS affiliate does a 5 minute piece simply explaining what the pizzagate theory is. No accusations. He even takes extra  care to make sure it&#39;s known that all evidence is circumstantial. </p>

<p><em>He effectively loses his career</em>. </p>

<p>Just think about that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying pizzagate is true <em>as written</em>, but I am saying this is a subject the elite media owners do NOT want people looking into, and they ended a man&#39;s very promising career to send a very clear message to other reporters: Ignore it. If you must address it, debunk it, or we will destroy you. </p>
