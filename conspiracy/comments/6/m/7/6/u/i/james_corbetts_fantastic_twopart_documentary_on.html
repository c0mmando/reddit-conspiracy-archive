       I have only watched cursory videos on pizzagate so I'm no expert, but if it's this giant zero-sum waste of time, an awful lot of of time was spent by the media to try and discredit it. Colbert' rant being a prime example.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Ben Swann does a short segment explaining it and a week later he "goes dark", deleting his social media accounts and erasing the brand he had built for himself over the course of many years, stating that he isn't being fired from his station, he's just going to be working "in a different capacity". WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       The horrifying truth is that child trafficking rings and ritual abuse do happen in the upper-echelons of power all over the world. This is well-documented. Just look up the story surrounding Jimmy Saville. That's one of very many.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as pizzagate is concerned, it seems to only implicate high-level democrats, which makes me believe that it's being framed politically. However, I would absolutely not be surprised if a high-level abuse network was discovered within elite government circles in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I'm afraid that probably
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the case.

       Its not just dems---- Dennis Hastert is a friend of Podesta's, an early lead. Mike Pence might also be implicated, which is potentially the real reason Trump fired Flynn....speculation, tho.

       Exactly. A whole lot of time, money, and resources were spent making sure everyone

       Wow. Makes me reconsider Sandy Hook... And re-evaluate pizzagate. To (((them))), pizzagate actually poses a significant threat. It's so easy to point to the physical evidence.

       Alot of people have been misinformed by the "pedo ring in the basement" story, which mentions nothing to do with Wikileaks. Very subtle mis-telling.

       Think of it this way I terms of the media owners (the real ones) taking major action to punish a reporter for covering a conspiracy theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       Geraldo Rivera has Richard Gage from
       <em>
        Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth
       </em>
       and Bob Mclevane (sp) ON HIS PRIMETIME MSM SHOW to discuss their belief that 9/11 was at the very least not what we were told by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       A talented, fair reporter at a local CBS affiliate does a 5 minute piece simply explaining what the pizzagate theory is. No accusations. He even takes extra  care to make sure it's known that all evidence is circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        He effectively loses his career
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying pizzagate is true
       <em>
        as written
       </em>
       , but I am saying this is a subject the elite media owners do NOT want people looking into, and they ended a man's very promising career to send a very clear message to other reporters: Ignore it. If you must address it, debunk it, or we will destroy you.

       I used to watch those shows faithfully and enjoyed them until I noticed that they are partisan too, I just liked them because I was partisan myself and leaned the same way. But trying to be more conscious of influence I have noticed partisanship isn't good at all, any side. Not for news at least, even satire.

       Totally.  Does anyone know if he's a full time researcher?  I know he lives in Japan,  and has financial subscribers.  But that's all I know.  Given how prolific Corbett is it seems like he must do it full time.

       He does the Alt.media job full time now. He used to teach English in Japan but his writing, commentary and patron donations have helped him do it full time.

       "The Octopus" as Casolero put it...its tentacles wrapped around everything from Regans election, Iran-Contra, spy software distributed to our allies through the CIA, drug smuggling and arms smuggling. This is a deep deep hole that everyone should investigate themselves after listening to these excellent reports by James.

       This is a great series. The Terrance Yeakey one is especially eye opening in regards to OKC. Also highly recommend "The Secret Life of Timothy McVeigh."

       Good recommendation. Corbett is one of the best researchers and content creators we've got. And he's very well-respected even outside the "skeptic" community. Not an easy accomplishment.

       I used to watch those shows faithfully and enjoyed them until I noticed that they are partisan too, I just liked them because I was partisan myself and leaned the same way. But trying to be more conscious of influence I have noticed partisanship isn't good at all, any side. Not for news at least, even satire.
