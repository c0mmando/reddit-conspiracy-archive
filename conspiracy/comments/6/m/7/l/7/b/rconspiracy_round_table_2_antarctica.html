<blockquote>
<p>Operation Highjump (1946–1947) was a United States Navy operation organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Jr. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation Highjump&#39;s primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a fatal aviation accident, a death from a &quot;ship-unloading accident&quot; and increasingly poor weather conditions, the Operation was terminated early.</p>

<p>The enigmatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd">Admiral Byrd</a> subsequently made the following cryptic statements on his return home:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. </p>

<p>The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. </p>

<p>Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map">The Piri Reis Map</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 from military intelligence by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis.</p>

<p>There are two major discrepancies from known coastlines: the North American coast and the southern portion of the South American coast. On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day Rio de Janeiro. </p>

<p>A more popular interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the Queen Maud Land coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact hypotheses. </p>

<p>Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in Charles Hapgood&#39;s 1966 book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilization based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps.</p>

<p>As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of kilometres north of its proper location; second, the Drake Passage is completely missing, with the Antarctic Peninsula presumably conflated with the Argentine coast. </p>

<p>The identification of this area of the map with the frigid Antarctic coast is also difficult to reconcile with the notes on the map which describe the region as having a warm climate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the Wikipedia article fails to mention here is that the theory is that Piri Reis was using source maps that depicted Antarctica <em>at least</em> 10,000 years ago, so the climate would&#39;ve been vastly different.</p>

<p>Despite consistently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map#cite_note-dutch-36">only providing one source</a> to &quot;debunk&quot; the Antartica-in-Piri-Reis-Map Theory, the Wikipedia article ends with this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, Wikipedia passes off a conspiracy theory as &quot;debunked and settled&quot; when the jury is very much still out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is definitely something afoot in Antarctica. I speculate that, as you said, before the cataclysmic end of the last ice age around 12,000 year ago (10,000 BC) Earth&#39;s climate, sea level, and general landscape were quite different and therefore contemporary cultures and civilizations may have had knowledge of the Antarctic continent and even settled there. I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. </p>

<p>That being said, we need to let go of the Piri Reis map as the golden idol of evidence on this matter. It takes 1 minute for any objective person to do a side by side comparison of a modern map versus the Piri Reis map and see that all the distinct coastal points sloping to the east of the Piri Reis map are simply the capes, bays, and peninsulas of modern Argentina drawn without proper calculations of the Earth&#39;s curvature. There are countless examples of Piri Reis&#39;s cartography showing this same problem.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I accept the premise but not because of the Piri Reis map. We don&#39;t need the map. We have the climate models and projections of global temperature and sea level that prove a multitude of continent sized land masses (Atlantis, Lemuria, Yonaguni, Bimini, Sri Lanka, Australian land bridge, Antarctic land bridge, etc) were above water prior to the cataclysmic end of the last ice age. This map is one of the things that our detractors will associate with us because it is unprovable. We should stick to the empirical data when discussing this turbulent time period. </p>

<p>I agree completely and only referenced this because it&#39;s one of the first widespread &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; regarding Antarctica (along with Operation Highjump).</p>

<p>One of my favorite books on this subject is called Axis of the World: The Search for the Oldest American Civilization by Igor Witkowski if anyone is interested in alternative histories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m eagerly looking forward for when the true history of the last 10,000 years or so is completely rewritten.</p>

<p>I hate to be pedantic, but I feel it needs to be noted that we are still in the current 
 and fifth known ice age, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation">the Quaternary glaciation</a>. Ice ages proper are periods lasting millions of years and characterized by glacial ice sheets in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Each long-term ice age generally goes through periods of relatively colder or warmer climates, called glacials and interglacials respectively. Glacial periods are referred to popularly as &quot;ice ages,&quot; hence some of the confusion. </p>

<p>The last glacial (the Pleistocene) ended ~12,000 years, giving way to our current interglacial period (the Holocene). We&#39;re still in the ice age. </p>

However ... if there has been, it&#39;s intriguing to consider this:  there is a great circle on the planet that coincidentally passes through Israel, Venice, London, Boston, New York, Washington DC, and I believe it comes tolerably close to Mexico City.  What if that were the old equator before the poles shifted?  If it were, then Antarctica would occupy a tropical zone.   Just something to think about... </p>

<p><em>The United States Navy utilized extremely low frequencies (ELFs) as radio band and radio communications. The Submarine Integrated Antenna System (SIAS) was a research and development effort to communicate with submerged submarines.[22] The Soviet/Russian Navy also utilized ELFs for submarine communications system, ZEVS.[23] The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines</em></p>

<p>John Kerry (at the height of the 2016 POTUS election), Buzz Aldrin (who was evactuated), Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow Kirill III...etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to go back through and make it a little bit more coherent, but the main gist remains the same. Since writing that I&#39;ve read become entirely more convinced that there most likely <strong>are</strong> ancient ruins under the ice in Antarctica. Graham Hancock&#39;s extensive compilation of work identifying an ancient advanced civilization is impeccable. The most likely place for Plato&#39;s Atlantis has to be an Antarctica that was probably in a more tropical climate about 13,000 years ago.</p>

From what I gathered there didn&#39;t appear to be anything of quantifiable value down there... it was more like all the secrecy and hubbub about Antarctica arose from the fact that Antarctica exploration was viewed as an equivalent of the &quot;Space Race&quot;. People were using it to show off the technological and scientific prowess of their various nations. USA was worried USSR would actually find some use for Antarctica and it would be embarrassing for US. </p>

<p>There was a bit of worry that USSR could find a strategic advantage down there via surveillance since all other forms of military were banned via treaty. Later on in the 80s there was some talk CIA about how they thought Soviets used Argentina as a sock puppet to take the Falkland Islands to secure a shipping route by sea out of Antarctica for coal exports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DISCLAIMER: NO SOURCES</p>

<p>After many a late night conspiracy discussion between me and some of my like minded friends we have come to this conclusion(at least it is one of the more entertaining).</p>

<p>Prior to 12000 B.C.E. their existed advanced human civilizations which held much deeper understanding of their place in the cosmos and of the energies which compose the cosmos. Due to some (unknown) event of astronomical proportions the Earth was subject to a major pole reversal triggering the current mini-ice age which our planet is currently undergoing. As human induced climate change (think human impact rather than &#39;oh no humans gonna kill the planet&#39;) has steadily increased as our planetary civilization reemerges from the ashes of our past; in conjunction with shifting of the axis, we are I believe in the transitioning stage of another pole reversal, and soon(if it isn&#39;t already taking place). This period where we are shifting back into either an old way or a new way, is when knowledge of our ancient past and the abundance of life will be slowly disseminated to the masses. Using climate change as the guise under which to work, in the coming years (as the global temp increases) expect to see damning evidence of our ancient past and technologies far beyond anything we can currently comprehend or use. It is my belief, and solely mine, that the &#39;priest class&#39; and the &#39;elites&#39; have used secret societies throughout history to screen occasional individuals who rise above the masses through either intellect, power, or other means of influence. It is precisely these schools of &quot;esoteric&quot; knowledge which conceals the long known truth that our species contains much greater intelligence and potential than we are currently being educated to believe we have. This &#39;grand conspiracy&#39; to keep the masses dumb and under-educated is less out of malice and more out of the fact that our re-emerging culture has up until this point, not been ready to psychologically accept the consequences that would come from an ancient advanced human civilization ( to the point which would make our current intelligence and technologies seem like child&#39;s play). And that we are now progressing through this transition period where our species can reconnect with our ancient past and hopefully proceed with an enlightened and kind curiosity guiding our species through the Cosmos together. </p>

<p>But that was all buzzed hopeful armchair bullshitting. But hey, I can hope can&#39;t I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that there may easily have been a pre-historic ancient civilization similar to the one that existed in ancient Greece during it&#39;s Golden Age, that could have been based strictly on intellectual development and the acquisition of knowledge strictly for it&#39;s own sake without applying it for any form material gain or advantage over nature or others; or the pursuit of technological conveniences or the crass commercialization of such developments simply for private profit.</p>

<p>In our own world at this juncture knowledge is <em>only</em> pursued and sought out strictly for those reasons or explained and taught strictly in terms of them.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got news for you, we don&#39;t predict and don&#39;t calculate for any purely optical effects that might result from making any architectural structure as precisely as we can which is why many modern buildings are less impressive than they were intended to be or appeared as if they would be on drawings and scale models. In fact we have a difficult enough time simply trying to do that as any architect can tell you.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t even build an ordinary house 50&#39; long without it being out of alignment by at least a few inches and having to jigger the roof to compensate for the corners being out of whack. The Great Pyramid of Egypt by comparison is out by far less than a quarter of an inch across any of the four corners of it&#39;s base. That was discovered and confirmed by using a laser transit to measure them and the angles they form which means the that whoever built that huge pyramid had some way to not only measure them with that same laser-like degree of accuracy but to actually execute and build it just as precisely which is something we still can&#39;t do. All modern buildings, no matter how much effort is put into making them as precise as possible are always out of alignment and the bigger they are the greater the discrepancies that eventually result. They aren&#39;t noticeable due to the scale but many office towers and large structures are out as much as a foot or two from corner to corner and that certainly wasn&#39;t was planned but it was to some degree anticipated because it&#39;s just that likely that it would be. You merely <em>assume</em> and  <em>think</em> that we must be as capable or more capable than the ancient humans and the remarkable precision of measurement or execution some of their artifacts bear witness to but we quite simply aren&#39;t, nor do we actually expect that from any of our own endevors. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t predict the view from any approach to the structure that necessitated making one side of it three feet higher or the spread and positioning of the columns to correct the parallax effect a technically perfect arrangement and alignment of the columns would have on the eye, not just from one, but from any position within the building itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, like a few others, don&#39;t really understand your question.  What would ice cores tell us about a previous civilisation? If you mean in terms of emissions and such, previous civilisation did not use a lot of the technologies we have today that create these pollutions. So an ice core sample isn&#39;t going to show any evidence of human civilisation or settlement because that&#39;s not really the sort of information an &#39;ice core&#39; stores. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC humans have been in approximately modern form for around 300,000 years. It doesn&#39;t really seem all that likely that we never bothered organising ourselves for the first 280,000 years. It seems logical that we would have established societies, probably many different ones, over the millenia. </p>

<p>How advanced though... that&#39;s another question. I&#39;m not sure I buy much into the idea that they were heavily advanced. </p>

<p><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/265/5180/1841/tab-pdf">This</a> article describes evidence of extensive lead and silver mining/smelting during the Roman era, which I found interesting because I didn&#39;t really expect it that early.</p>

<p>The authors state that they couldn&#39;t analyse a period of time (which in their sample was between 3,500 - 7000 years ago) because the core sample was brittle ice, which prevents measurement of heavy metals. </p>

<p>Which naturally leads to what I assume would be other ice-core problems: the pollution needs to be widespread enough for the metals to reach areas where ice is fairly permanent and enough snowfall needs to occur to seal it in (if ice melts, pressumably a lot of the metals would run off with it. </p>

<p>The geographic centers of prehistory cultures would likely be a lot of different to todays because of the differences in climate and sea level, which is (IMO) the biggest issue. If a culture was present at a time when the climate was colder, they would likely not have been in Europe, probably more likely to be as close to the equator as possible, which means any industrialised pollution (unless of a huge scale) wasn&#39;t likely to make it to the Artic or Antartica. Sure if would have been trapped in some ice, but that would have melted off as the planet warmed. Even in the case of the pollutants reaching the surviving ice regions, it&#39;d have travelled a huge distance and be pretty dispersed reducing its detectability further.</p>

<p>Sea level would have been much, much lower (100 - 200 metres lower). Human societies seem to thrive best when closer to the ocean. The ocean provides food, fresh water runs down through rivers to it, trade is easier etc. The crux of this issue though is the same facing us right now: we built all our best shit right next to the water because of the economic and agricultural benefits. Even 20,000 years ago the sea level was approx 120m lower than it is today. </p>

<p>If early human cultures did the same as what we all did, then chances are all the evidence we would need to see has been underwater for tens of thousands of years. Hell, if there was a culture around 140-160k years ago, it would have spent a good 120k years underwater, come back out as another ice age hit, and then be submerged again. Assuming <em>anything</em> of those settlements survived the erosion they&#39;d be encased under thousands of years of sediment.</p>

<p>So really... on such long time scales I&#39;m not sure that evidence of existence would have been discovered at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My entire career in the military involved satellites and equipment needing them as sources for timing and location.  Granted the technology exists where computers tell you were they are, but we also have back up measures like slide rulers with coordinates to determine exactly where in orbit they are located.  There&#39;s a bunch of them out there, some only seperated by a few degrees if looking from earth (line of sight). We can shoot a telecom link full of info (up to gb of data) up to the satellite, and see it returned to us, processed by the satellite&#39;s equipment.  </p>

<p>Little bit of info.  Most communication/GPS satellites have a 725mhz beacon beam thats always being transmitted (unencrypted)  which we tune our equipment too in order to align our antennas so that we can achieve the best signal to noise ratio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you make of the inner earth theory? I&#39;ve been fascinated with it for a while now, and decided to devote today towards researching. Seeing your post was a really cool sync.</p>

<p>I watched this documentary yesterday, which introduced me to professor James Hurtak. I haven&#39;t heard of him before, but his information seems pretty on point. He&#39;s a shadowy figure though... if you google him, there&#39;s barely any info, and even a couple articles bashing his credibility. I&#39;m starting to think that his name has become deliberately sanitized within the truth seeking community, because of how close his research came. His books are also priced insanely high on amazon, which is very suspicious, as if steering people away. He speaks of 7 points of power on our planet, where pyramids / other ancients structures were built, which are entrances into inner earth: <a href="https://youtu.be/N25LSi2qLOQ">https://youtu.be/N25LSi2qLOQ</a></p>

<p>I then stumbled across this video, of an apparent gateway into inner earth, via one of the poles: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vadj0Nkby58">https://youtu.be/Vadj0Nkby58</a></p>

<p>Putting its credibility aside, if you search for Sunil Lama in the comments, he&#39;s a Nepal native who comments how knowledge of these entrances was passed down to him from his grandparents. He also mentions 7 entrances, so this is knowledge from oral tradition, which verifies James Hurtak&#39;s work.</p>

<p>The fact that pilots are always ordered to fly around the poles is also extremely suspicious. I just listened to this interview of a naval officer telling his story: <a href="https://youtu.be/GMybJ-HGUOo">https://youtu.be/GMybJ-HGUOo</a></p>

<p>I intend to make a post about this at some point, but am still researching. That holes in other poles article you linked to is fascinating btw, and adds more fuel to this fire. What do you make of it all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actuall flying on a polar route from say London to Tokyo would be quicker than flying out East. I am a travel agent and years ago I took an IATA exam for flight routings and pricing etc. The PO polar route was always cheaper and quicker than the EH eastern hemisphere.

<p>No it&#39;s not, it&#39;s attributed to the use of CFC&#39;s in aerosol and other applications. After CFC&#39;s were banned in the 80&#39;s the hole started closing immediately, though it&#39;s still thinnest down there. The ozone hole and global warming are two completely different issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is Operation Fishbowl not ever mentioned as the reason for the hole?</p>

<p>I mean, Fishbowl was in the Northern hemisphere, and we have a pretty clear causal mechanism around CFC&#39;s that predicts that hole quite well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was browsing Hollywood movies from the years &#39;47 to about &#39;53 using primarily Wikipedia and discovered two or three movies that had similar themes about discovering otherworldly stuff in Antarctica.  One of the movies was later remade into John Carpenter&#39;s <em>The Thing</em> but an earlier one was really intriguing and about something like a military base under the ice.  I&#39;m too lazy to find links now but there&#39;s an interesting very general trend about increasing numbers of sci-fi movies produced from this period onward where previously they were basically nonexistent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Graham Hancock&#39;s &#39;Fingerprints of the Gods&#39;, he (spoiler alert) ends the book, which talks about links between many ancient civilizations, with a note of why he thinks Antarctica could actually be the &#39;lost continent of Atlantis&#39;.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t have the book in my hands, currently, so these are not direct quotes... but, let me try to summarize.</p>

<p>Basically, I believe he said it was one of Einstein&#39;s theories, that if there <em>was</em> a &#39;polar shift&#39;, 10-12,000 years ago, that it could&#39;ve been caused by the crust of the earth sliding.  Basically, separating from the layers underneath.  Hence, why we see &#39;flash frozen&#39; woolly mammoths and the like.  It would&#39;ve been a sudden, violent change in climate for many parts of the earth.  Now considering that we&#39;re talking about a pole shift of 15-30 degrees &#39;off-axis&#39;, that doesn&#39;t seem like much... until you look at Australia.  Australia and Antarctica have very different climates, currently.  However, that same 15-30 degree shift could basically move Australia southward to where Antarctica is, currently, while simultaneously shifting Antarctica north (since you can go further south than the south pole), into the range of Australia.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m not really doing his hypothesis justice, but it&#39;s definitely worth the read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where to start...</p>

<p>Our sun is in a binary orbit with another star, Sirius, creating a roughly 26,000 year cycle in which it moves from lower energy to higher energy and back again. (Actually a trinary system with the Sun and Sirius A orbiting Sirius B, best I can tell, but it&#39;s simpler to visualize just a binary system.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quickie primer:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVjNRCup-e0">A Shortend Version of The Great Year, narrated by James Earl Jones</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re just at the beginning of the new Great Year, just leaving the darkest age -- the Kali Yuga or Iron Age. I suspect we&#39;re still being ruled, at a planetary level, by the dominant race of the previous Great Year -- call them the Atlanteans or Nephilim. More specifically, it&#39;s the Satanic faction of that race, the Angelic faction having long since left our planet to explore space. Would you rather serve in Heaven... or rule in Hell?</p>

<p>So in short, I think the Satanic faction of the Atlanteans are ruling the planet from a hollowed out area under the Antarctic ice.</p>

<p>Kubla Khan - Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan </p>

<p>A stately pleasure-dome decree:</p>

<p>Where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alph_River">Alph, the sacred river</a>, ran </p>

<p>Through caverns measureless to man</p>

<p>Down to a sunless sea. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That ice is now melting, and they will be exposed. There is supposedly a lot of activity going on in Antarctica now. I suspect the Deep State is throwing a military shield up for them, now that they&#39;re losing their cover.</p>

<p>They use advanced technology, developed in their Great Year cycle -- and some held over from previous cycles -- to rule over us, staying one step ahead. I believe Silicon Valley is their outlet to re-develop and release this technology to the public at a measured rate, as it benefits them -- from cell-phones to electric cars.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to suspect that all this crypto-currency activity is, essentially, R&amp;D for their new one-world currency and blockchain technology that will tokenize every aspect of life and utterly enslave us into a New World Order. And here we thought we were throwing off the chains of banks. <em>I-rony!!</em></p>

<p>Will the Angelic faction return to rescue us? Was Rush&#39;s <em>2112</em> prophetic? Stay tuned!</p>

<hr/>

<p>Lots of speculation, for sure, but a lot of things have clicked into place for me. It&#39;s a fascinating area of study that has really reshaped my view of history. Here&#39;s a longer playlist if you want to dig into this stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zhSARqcOEtsz7sZMVXke2tT-tNtJ5Or">The Growing Earth, Yuga Cycle, Sirius B Connection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this makes some sense and that others can modify or extend some of these ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this, but here&#39;s a fun, totally speculative theory (related to the black goo one): Anyone see that movie Life (w/Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds)? SPOILER: </p>

<p>At the end, the alien life reaches an Earth ocean. Let&#39;s suppose something like that (or, of course, the creature from The Thing) landed in Antarctica (lucky for us). Not 10,000 years ago, but maybe like 5-20 years ago. It&#39;s been growing, absorbing other life, but possibly at a slower rate due to the cold--maybe its been hibernating. Or it&#39;s been growing constantly, yes, but its still decades away from being large enough to spread/be a real threat. Maybe there are secret research teams there attempting to figure out how to kill this thing or stop it from spreading further (again, think of the creature from &quot;Life&quot; or the black goo from Prometheus if you prefer).</p>

<p>Last time I dove into this conspiracy, there was a lot of evidence that an ancient civilization lived there, and another cool theory that Nazi&#39;s fled there after WWII, meaning that we didn&#39;t actually win the war.

NK has an Alaska research base there along with US,Russia and a few others but the NK base has heated toilet seats and a nuclear barge for breaking ice better than the US 🤔. They all work together to research. Check out some youtube documentaries. There&#39;s also VERY clear footage people take flying in a helicopter throughout antartica...way clearer than Google Earth lol. Its a beautiful place and I believe there&#39;s definitely something there worth researching.</p>

<p>1963, WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, NEW MEXICO: Just after sunset, runway lights flooded the runway where President Johnson and fifteen of his highest military and civilian bosses saw the disk from our ET allies–the Ebes–pop in and settle down. Our people knew already regarded the Ebes as allies; they’d saved us from the Nazis in 1947 when we feared the Nazis in Antarctica would strike America with fighter disks like those they used to beat Admiral Byrd’s armada in the Antarctic battle of the Weddell Sea. The disks the Ebens helped us develop warded off a Nazi invasion.</p>

<p>Now, in ’63, a tall, lanky extraterrestrial humanoid, Ebe2, emerged from a hatch; she wore a coverall dark blue bodysuit. She was here for a four-hour visit. Ebe2 announced in English that she had as gift to Earth, the Yellow Book. The Yellow Book, she said, shows the viewer all Earth’s history and the history of the galaxy as well.
Len Kasten, in Secret Journey to Planet Serpo writes that as Ebe2 and the Americans spoke a screen in her translation device showed a printed form in both Eben and in English. She read the form aloud in English.
Her two flight companions loaded their craft with the nine bodies of the Ebes who’d died in the Roswell and Kingman scout-disk crashes and landings. They also loaded the body of Ebe1, the mechanic who’d survived one of the crashes. Ebe1 had helped us contact Serpo and arrange for the exchange program, Crystal Knight, that would bring twelve Americans to Serpo in the Zeta Reticula system, 240 trillion miles from earth. Ebe2 said she and an Ambassador would return to Earth in two years. The Ambassador would remain and help the U.S. for twelve years while twelve Americans lived and study on Serpo.</p>

<p>The meticulously documented record of the exchange program Kasten gives us in “Secret Journey” lets us see proof of the exchange program and the Yellow Book? President Kennedy made it happen.</p>

<p>The Ebes had been helping us since 1947, in a program run by President Eisenhower’s MJ 12 Committee and the Nazi-infiltrated CIA. MJ 12 included the “deep throat” whistleblower who put the story on the web. Kennedy wanted to cut off Allan Dulles, a Nazi sympathizer and the CIA chief (which was rife with pardoned ex-Nazis) from the Serpo Exchange Program. Kennedy felt the CIA had marred his presidency with their failed invasion of Cuba. He wanted the Serpo exchange program to be his triumphant legacy. And he wanted the program out of the hands of Dulles and the CIA. So Kennedy created the Defense Information Agency to take over all defense coordination. He charged the new agency to, as much as possible, share to our governments agreements with aliens and the technology they shared that could improve life on Earth. Thank Kennedy and his DIA for the documents and leaks to the website <a href="http://www.serpo.org">www.serpo.org</a>.</p>

<p>The website leader, probably a member of MJ12, wrote,
“The Yellow Book is an 8 x 11 inch object 2 1/2 inches thick made of a clear, heavy fiberglass. The border of the book is bright yellow.” When the viewer puts his eyes near the book and the device reads his electromagnetic aura, images appear, as do words in any of the 80 human languages the viewer uses. “Pictures tell the story of the Ebes lives, their exploration of the universe, their planet, their societal life and the Ebes longtime relationship with Earth.” The Yellow book showed their first ambassador to Earth, some 2000 years ago, was Jesus.</p>
