        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Basically the Infanrix Hexa - is a monster 6-in-1 jab for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio,Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Hepatitis B.</p>

<p>On September 23, 2014, an Italian court in Milan award compensation to a boy for vaccine-induced autism caused by the Infanrix Hexa vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/01/recent-italian-court-decisions-on-vaccines-and-autism.html">http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/01/recent-italian-court-decisions-on-vaccines-and-autism.html</a></p>

<p>So it appears that the Hexa vaccine this boy received contained Thimerosal, although it is not listed on the current product information. It does still contain aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant, however. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000296/WC500032505.pdf">http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000296/WC500032505.pdf</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this fairly significant public health news seems to have slipped beneath the radar, for some reason but here is UK government press release about Infanrix Hexa:
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/608537/Vaccine_Update_261_April_2017_.pdf">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/608537/Vaccine_Update_261_April_2017_.pdf</a></p>

<p>The only MSM source to cover this is the Mail, strangely.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4678522/ALL-newborns-given-hepatitis-B-jab.htm">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4678522/ALL-newborns-given-hepatitis-B-jab.htm</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that GSK has chosen to modify the contents of the vaccine, but stuck with the same brand name after losing a court case. Maybe the Infanrix <del>Hex</del> <del>Hexagram</del> lol, I mean HEXA is a name/number that has special significance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the explanation that Wakefield gives, and it may be true. I&#39;m skeptical after my research into Wakefield&#39;s history; he&#39;s found the money to sue a journalist twice for defamation. (He lost both times; the first time, the court found that the suit was an improper attempt to suppress criticism with legal threats.) He is also quite obviously a very wealthy man. A while back there was an article online about his real estate holdings in Austin, and the man lives lavishly.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it would have made a difference if he had appealed. His colleague was exonerated, but (a) one of his defenses was that he trusted Wakefield to make proper disclosures, and (b) he wasn&#39;t charged with the same things Wakefield was, like mistreatment of children in the study. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s too big a conspiracy for most people to get their heads around. People can&#39;t understand that Governments, Regulators, Big Pharma and the Media (and 90% their peer group) can all be wrong, and that they sometimes are.</p>

<p>But if you ask someone whether they think their government always tells the truth and always acts in your best interests, they will often say no. That&#39;s a start. </p>

<p>You can point out that Big Pharma is motivated by profits and has marketed numerous products over the years which have had disastrous side effects, and has cost them billions in court-awarded injury payments (Thalidomide). </p>

<p>You can point out that the regulators (which are too close to Big Pharma) make &quot;mistakes&quot; by approving drugs which are later proven and acknowledged to be unsafe (Pandemrix etc). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because it&#39;s very scary. Just even entertaining the idea scares people into an extreme reaction. </p>

<p>I did the same thing when first presented just the idea that the people were being lied to about 9/11. I would start screaming and getting angry at my (enlightened) friends whenever they brought it up, no facts, just the vague possibility. Now, this is not like me or how I have ever been. I entertain all ideas or concepts, no matter how strange or different they are from my own beliefs. I actually greatly enjoy hearing differing opinions and theories because it&#39;s all enlightening information, regardless of whether or not it changes my own opinion. So, at one point while I was actually yelling that I did not want to hear about it, I stopped completely shocked at how I had been behaving. I sat down and listened to them and it did end up changing my opinion on things, but more so, it shook m very core and tore apart my sense of security and safety.</p>

<p>This is why I suspect that, regardless of vaccine safety or possible lack there of, people have such a knee jerk reaction to the topic. The idea that you might have been doing harm to your child, or children everywhere is very scary. The idea that your own health issue might be related, is very scary. Even bigger is the scary truth that big pharma really is not out to help anyone over profits. What other terrible things could be happening if vaccines aren&#39;t in fact as good as I believe them to be? What good are studies and reports if vaccines aren&#39;t as good as they say they are? That is a scary path to go down. </p>

<p>I do believe that subconsciously people might be putting together that these meds aren&#39;t truly helping people, that medicine is being held back in the name of profit and keeping customers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that the people arguing about vaccination fail to make a differentiation between the concept of vaccination and the execution of vaccination. The former is a well documented scientific phenomenon whose disapproval would require a fundamental revision of everything we know about medicine and biology. The latter is an action carried out by humans that is subject to abuse, the same as every other action carried out by people.</p>

<p>Way to many people arguing against vaccination are too inarticulate to actually differentiate between the two. Rational people will then get angry because they think you&#39;re attacking well proven scientific concepts and being an anti-intellectual.</p>

<p>&quot;Fresh data from PHE (Public Health England) indicates that the number of pregnant women infected with the virus is increasing fast. A previous version of its ‘green book’ for doctors, from 2013, stated that about one in 700 was hep B- positive. But a new version, published three days ago, shows the national figure is now one in 250. Rates are higher than one in 100 in some inner- city areas. None of these facts is cited in PHE’s rationale for vaccinating all babies.&quot;</p>

<p>Pseudoscientific scares have depressed immunization rates in Italy to about 85% (the recommendation is 95%). Consequently, by <a href="https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/threefold-increase-in-measles-cases-as-anti-vaccine-movement-grows-in-italy">March 2017</a> measles were <em>triple</em> the 2015 rate, and as of <a href="https://www.thelocal.it/20170505/measles-cases-up-fivefold-italy-five-star-movement-beppe-grillo-vaccination-matteo-renzi">May</a> they were up <em>fivefold.</em></p>

<p>No indication that autism rates have declined at all, which is no surprise--vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. There&#39;s a reason why epidemiologists and autism experts <em>unanimously</em> reject the autism/vaccines theory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly difficult for me to empathize with people using the reasoning that you point out. All of us are susceptible to confirmation bias, but I feel like you should be able to recognize it in an instance such as this.</p>

<p>I would hope that a bit of introspection or someone like you pointing out the flaws in their reasoning would help to make that person cognizant of the situation.  Unfortunately, in my experience, most people just don&#39;t want to hear it or will outright ignore information that is contrary to their worldview.  Sorry for my cynical rant.</p>

<p>Should be, but definitely aren&#39;t. People just aren&#39;t good at challenging their preconceptions, and especially the beliefs of their community. It&#39;s true of you and me and everyone else. (Dan Kahan at Yale does really interesting research on this.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the reasons I love discussions like the ones at r/conspiracy - even though I&#39;m a skeptic, it provides those edge conditions where basically every preconception gets challenged.</p>

I think it&#39;s a great idea, and I&#39;m going to do the same thing the next time I get a flu shot.</p>
