       Many whites are also aggravated and annoyed with these accusations of being "oppressive" too though. It's a big stirring of the pot.

       This isn't even bringing up the new feminism wave, and the transgender/LGBT tension and hostility that is added to this equation. It's like they're just winding us all up and letting us go when the pull the rug out from underneath us...

       You're thinking too hard bro. What's wrong with those comments? If white people are going in there telling black people this and that they can't get angry when a black person says "Hey, shut up cause this stuff all happened and white people WERE horrible to black people. In general." It's the truth bro

       The problem with most of these movies that are "based on history or a true story" is that they are  not really actual historical facts. They have been rewriting history for many, many, many years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want to know some potential actual history about "African Americans"? They very well may never even had ancestors from Africa like MS academia says. You know, taken from the Africa jungles, sold, and brought over on ships. There is evidence and theories that hundreds of thousands if not millions of those "slaves" were actually aborigines to North, Central, and South America along with the Caribbean.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also evidence that they are furthering this by lying about the ancestry via DNA tests like Ancestry.com and the likes. Imagine if Black people knew that their relatives never came from African jungles?

       Does it matter because we still came from enslaved people. Like I don't even get the point you were trying to make with that. I wouldn't care if I was a descendent of Aborigine-American slaves, my people were still not treated like people and used to build a nation basically while the people with the foot up back then relaxing, their families have a foot up hand up head up nowadays. So yeah you lost me with that one.

      <p>
       Yes, it does matter because it's your history/ancestry. Also, the first slaves in the US were poor Whites of various ethnicities. Furthermore with a historical fact, the first Black slaveowner was himself a Black man.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, we (poor people) all got dealt a shitty hand throughout history. The word slave actually comes from the word Slav (Slavic). Wrongfully and ignorantly dwelling on the past does more harm than good for all of us.

       That's deflection. For what the thread I was involved in talked about, it doesn't matter. It's still the same story that I descended from people who were done bad in MASS AMOUNTS. This is not one or two slaves OR years we're talking about. Black people were the BACKBONE of America during slavery and ALL of them suffered. I wouldn't care if I was yellow blue or green. That doesn't change where I (ME) came from.

       Look up how much of an industry slavery was. Look at the wealth it accumulated for some.  Think of what that wealth allowed them to accomplish. Then come back and tell me America wasn't basically built off of the labor of slaves. But don't do that BEFORE you go look.

       The North waged economic warfare on the South. Had nothing to do with Slavery. You really think most of the South had Slaves? Poor people are going to fight with their "masters" because of the slaves they could not afford? You're going to need to look deeper than wikipedia. Abraham Lincoln was a traitor to the Republic and this had nothing to do about slavery, but about keeping the false Union in tact. Look into the treaty of Paris, and the green backs. I hate people who are ignorant, and you seem to one of them.

       Economic warfare huh? I think you're 100 percent right. Why? Because they wanted to stop slavery. I'd say that would slow up money in the south. The North was okay, they had factories remember? 😂😂😂

       It doesnt matter how many people had slaves. What matters is how many people WERE slaves. That's how you track how much was potentially made if you want to do all that math. I wouldn't care if it was seven families that got rich off of it. But clearly it was more because at least a part of that civil war was "don't touch my slaves". If you're going to keep saying it wasn't then you are the ignorant one, sir.

       This film is based on historical events from 1967. Would it be best if we never made films of real events that include US racism? Please don't base your opinion of this film on bonehead comment sections. I saw the trailer, I want to see it as an examination of the legacy prejudice has in the divide between cops and everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of non-blacks are killed by US cops every year, including whites. Racism is sometimes a part of it, but more substantially? Armed authority existing to police the poor and protect the rich.

       This film, the Tupac movie, NWA film that featured police brutality, and shows like "Dear white people" on Netflix? There is a clear motive behind the creation of these films and productions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you honestly believe this film is simply a legitimate and honest contribution from a director/screenwriter. However, there are clear themes of division and hostility planted in this film.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this film came out ten years ago, I wouldn't have a problem with it. But it's the TIMING of this "divide and conquer" agenda the elite are orchestrating that made me a little skeptical. Something is at play here, Hollywood is helping feed this divide and conquer wire narrative.

       The way I see it is that we never ended slavery, we just made it a non racial thing. We made it an equal opportunity employment type thing. Equal slavery for everyone, whether your white or black, your master just changed to the almighty dollar while we all slave to the clock. Some slaves work smarter/harder than others to bring home a bigger portion of cash, but at the end of the day we are nothing but cattle moving from cage to cage, while the people at the top (who have been there for generations), just sit back and collect.

       If you take all of the slaves on earth
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       , there are more of them then all of human history before these current slaves were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the USA was formed July 4th 1787, more then 50% of the citizens were slaves or related to slaves. IN order to come to the colonies, you were either enslaved. British convicts were sent to the colonies, and became indentured servants after their sentence ended, and these ofc were mostly Scots, Irish, Welsh, and English, and captured foreign soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the population of the slaves and indentured serfs became too high, the convict were then shipped off to Australia. It was only after this program that Spanish ships were bringing in mulattoes and Carib indians once white began to breed at a pace that there were no more white slaves. Most slaves who were born outside the western hemisphere were shipped and sold in Jamaica Cuba Puerto Rico Bermuda Bahamas/Bimini Brazil Suriname Guyana and what became Honduras/Guatemala, and their offspring were born into slavery, unlike the white slaves sold in Boston and Providence who were eventually released.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a slave in the US didn't speak English, then they were captured and sold at auction by the Dutch, Arab/Moorish slavers or Trans-Africans, many were captured at sea, press-ganged/Shanghai'd or transported back into a foreign African country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result is that nearly 99% of black slaves in the US were captured by citizens or inhabitants of Africa or the Dutch.

       I do agree that TPTB want to divide us. But living in Detroit and knowing its history makes me realize that Detroit has a history of being racially divided as fuck. It's like Detroit is the fucking proving grounds for dividing tactics. And I don't even have to look at those comments to know how racist they are.

       The movie looks interesting though. It's a telling of a true story that occurred during the Detroit Riots, the Algiers Hotel Incident.

       I used to be so into this. Everyone I went to school with is involved in this race war and I'd get triggered. It's best for you to not get involved with them or the other side. I've been a month retreat from social media and when I opened it up, a race war is exactly what I saw. I have to admit that this is really unhealthy for me and if I were you I'd just relax and stay away from this race war. I only hope that the people involved in this learn what a terrible mistake they made.

       They suck at what they do.  All they can do is try to stir us up with tv and movies, state false flag events, and control comments sections.

       Even after all of that we still understand, deep down, most people are good and wholesome and just want to live their lives.

       I honestly enjoyed that movie, but I am well aware of the racial division theme in that film. It's so fucked up.

       Being upset over the historical accuracy of a Hollywood film is like being upset your McDonald's burger wasn't farm to table fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only outrage that should be expressed here is that Hollywood is once again exploiting human suffering for financial gain and then rubbing everyones faces in it by giving themselves awards.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't make this shit to divide you, they make it cause you are already divided. All these triggered morons are doing is generating ticket sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans will get upset over a movie for not being accurate, yet say nothing about the current state of the MSM, get upset cos "some liberal" told em what they can and cant say, then get offended over the plot of a Hollywood film, show how open minded they are by supporting a movie that profits from the exploitation of the suffering of the people it claims to be helping...
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, its pathetic.

       You are "spinning" my message, sir/ma'am..

       I'm not "upset over the historical accuracy of the film", as you so eloquently put it...

       I am aware of the intentional themes of racial division and tension. Films, like these, are all coming out right now. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are TPTB trying to revive the racial tension in the 1960's? I think so. I think they benefit from us hating each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a black dude. That doesn't mean shit. But I am well aware that this isn't a "natural". Or normal progression. There is an outside force trying to get us fighting.

       Im not saying
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are, I am referring to the general reaction towards these things. Also every year since roots they have made a "black sports team overcomes racism" and "white teacher goes to the hood, good grades ensue" movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is most definitely outside forces dividing you, but they have been manipulating you for a very long time. You are witnessing people getting triggered over a movie and blaming the movie, I am saying the movie is simply cashing in on the current climate, which has been molded by people like George Soros who is funding both sides of the race war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im saying dont blame Hollywood for cashing in off the controversy generated by the masses getting triggered, they have been doing that since the dawn of film, ask yourself how you got to be triggered by a fuckin movie.

       The Blacks have lots of reasons to hate the whites historically.
      </p>
      <p>
       This racism continues today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Whites have lots of reasons to be afraid of the Blacks and to want to move to the suburbs to get away from them.

       So, while the media is fanning the flames of hatred, there are lots of historical reality to the divisions as well.

       Honestly, I wouldn't disagree with you.  In my day to day life, I see very few people falling for it as well.  There are a whole heck of a lot of people that post very racist, hateful stuff online, however.  That much is certain.  The cover of anonymity seems to help bring out the worst in a lot of people.

       Yes all over the world there are many corrupt politicians who are trying to divide people and get them to tear at each other while the parties in power rake in all the cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes there are a lot of bots and shills online. If you look at some Israeli-Palestinian videos, you'll see a lot of shills pretending to be Palestinian while worshipping Netenyahu and if you look at the profile, it is crystal clear it is a fake account.

       It doesnt matter how many people had slaves. What matters is how many people WERE slaves. That's how you track how much was potentially made if you want to do all that math. I wouldn't care if it was seven families that got rich off of it. But clearly it was more because at least a part of that civil war was "don't touch my slaves". If you're going to keep saying it wasn't then you are the ignorant one, sir.
