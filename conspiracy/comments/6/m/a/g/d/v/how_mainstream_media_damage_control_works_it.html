       I know this post will be heavily messed with by the anti-Trump cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       First it comes out on the main spot on Drudge report about the Trump team Russian lawyer meeting "participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,”.."the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS"    Fusion GPS is the same agency that put out the fake dossier.

       Then the very next day NYT starts spinning it's tales for damage control.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier. " "These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian Nationals to influence our election in any manner,” Corallo said.

       So the DNC paid organization set up this meeting in June 2016, using deception, so it would later be used in their Trump-Russia narrative.  This is a long running conspiracy to have something, anything, to use to attempt to turn the public against Trump. They are still trying to come up with something solid enough to pull off a coup. They hate the fact that Trump stopped their illuminati one world government plan.  They have invested trillions of other people's money into creating the infrastructure and the psychological atmosphere for the transition into a world government. They have been working on it for close to 100 years and Trump ruins it. They and their minions must be sooo pissed.

It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries."

       For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... "The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. "The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.

      <p>
       From your article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Vladimir Putin has long reviled the Magnitsky Act and fought to have it repealed. And according to letter from Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley, the Kremlin’s main fight against the law was led by Veselnitskaya’s client, Katsyv.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another player in the Russian influence scandal, the U.S.-based political firm Fusion GPS, was also involved in helping Prevezon, Katsyv and Baker Hostetler, according to the Grassley letter. Fusion has been a major focal point of the FBI and Congress because it hired a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele to produce a salacious intelligence dossier that made wild and still unsubstantiated claims about Trump ties to Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, I'm not quite understanding the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fusion GPS, a political intelligence firm, was contracted by Democrats to produce the Steele Dossier (by the way, do you have a link to supports that claim or is it just something Trumps team is saying)? The very same authors wrote this yesterday:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Grassley has asked the Justice Department to look at all the connections and is seeking information from Fusion GPS on whether opponents of Trump funded the creation of a salacious intelligence dossier to hurt his presidential bid. The FBI has said it has been unable to corroborate many of the allegations in the dossier that involved Trump.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       [
       <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2017/07/08/donald-trump-jr-met-with-russian-lawyer-during-election-but-didnt-follow-up">
        link
       </a>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it doesn't seem like it's been verified whether Democratic operatives paid them or not, but I'd love to see the public report.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Fusion GPS was also shown to have ties to helping Russian national companies and acting on behalf of Russian interests? So, which is it? Do they work for Democrats or do they work for Russians? Or are they a political intelligence entity that does work for everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, the Russian lawyer involved is almost certainly loyal to Russia, so where do her allegiances fall in your theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, the question I'm most interested in an answer for:
      </p>
      <h1>
       Where in your links does it say that Fusion set up the meeting?
      </h1>
      <p>
       The only thing I've seen is that she contacted Junior and he accepted, so did I miss something that says otherwise?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       But really, I think you're missing the primary point from the news, that Trump Jr. was more than willing to collude with a Russian nationalist for information against Clinton. And, at times failed to disclose the existence of the meeting and/or the contents.

       Trump's lawyer said the Russian lawyer that set up the meeting  "participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,”.."the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS".

      <p>
       He said that the person who associated with Fusion and misrepresented who they worked for.... That is pretty telling. It's like saying it without saying it. Just like a lawyer would.
