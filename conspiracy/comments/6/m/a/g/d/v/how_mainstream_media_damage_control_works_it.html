<p>First it comes out on the main spot on Drudge report about the Trump team Russian lawyer meeting &quot;participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,”..&quot;the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS&quot;    Fusion GPS is the same agency that put out the fake dossier.

<p>“Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier. &quot; &quot;These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian Nationals to influence our election in any manner,” Corallo said. <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2017/07/09/politics/russian-lawyer-who-got-inside-donald-trumps-inner-circle-had-been-denied-us-visa">https://www.circa.com/story/2017/07/09/politics/russian-lawyer-who-got-inside-donald-trumps-inner-circle-had-been-denied-us-visa</a></p>

<p>So the DNC paid organization set up this meeting in June 2016, using deception, so it would later be used in their Trump-Russia narrative.  This is a long running conspiracy to have something, anything, to use to attempt to turn the public against Trump. They are still trying to come up with something solid enough to pull off a coup. They hate the fact that Trump stopped their illuminati one world government plan.  They have invested trillions of other people&#39;s money into creating the infrastructure and the psychological atmosphere for the transition into a world government. They have been working on it for close to 100 years and Trump ruins it. They and their minions must be sooo pissed. </p>

<p><strong>quotes</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Unless we establish some form of world government, it will not be possible for us to avert a World War III in the future.&quot; <strong>--(Winston Churchill, 1945).</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot; <strong>--David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future.&quot; <strong>—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men&#39;s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the Field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot; <strong>—U.S. President Woodrew Wilson (The New Freedom 1913</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your article: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vladimir Putin has long reviled the Magnitsky Act and fought to have it repealed. And according to letter from Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley, the Kremlin’s main fight against the law was led by Veselnitskaya’s client, Katsyv.</p>

<p>Another player in the Russian influence scandal, the U.S.-based political firm Fusion GPS, was also involved in helping Prevezon, Katsyv and Baker Hostetler, according to the Grassley letter. Fusion has been a major focal point of the FBI and Congress because it hired a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele to produce a salacious intelligence dossier that made wild and still unsubstantiated claims about Trump ties to Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I&#39;m not quite understanding the theory. </p>

<p>Fusion GPS, a political intelligence firm, was contracted by Democrats to produce the Steele Dossier (by the way, do you have a link to supports that claim or is it just something Trumps team is saying)? The very same authors wrote this yesterday: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grassley has asked the Justice Department to look at all the connections and is seeking information from Fusion GPS on whether opponents of Trump funded the creation of a salacious intelligence dossier to hurt his presidential bid. The FBI has said it has been unable to corroborate many of the allegations in the dossier that involved Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2017/07/08/donald-trump-jr-met-with-russian-lawyer-during-election-but-didnt-follow-up">link</a>]</p>

<p>So, it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been verified whether Democratic operatives paid them or not, but I&#39;d love to see the public report. </p>

<p>However, Fusion GPS was also shown to have ties to helping Russian national companies and acting on behalf of Russian interests? So, which is it? Do they work for Democrats or do they work for Russians? Or are they a political intelligence entity that does work for everyone? </p>

<p>More importantly, the Russian lawyer involved is almost certainly loyal to Russia, so where do her allegiances fall in your theory? </p>

<p>But really, the question I&#39;m most interested in an answer for: </p>

<h1>Where in your links does it say that Fusion set up the meeting?</h1>

<p>The only thing I&#39;ve seen is that she contacted Junior and he accepted, so did I miss something that says otherwise? </p>

<hr/>

<p>But really, I think you&#39;re missing the primary point from the news, that Trump Jr. was more than willing to collude with a Russian nationalist for information against Clinton. And, at times failed to disclose the existence of the meeting and/or the contents. </p>

<p>LOL you know very well that Fusion GPS is stonewalling the congressional investigators and that you are asking for impossible truths.  <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/06/24/inside-the-shadowy-intelligence-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/">http://nypost.com/2017/06/24/inside-the-shadowy-intelligence-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they work for Democrats or do they work for Russians? Or are they a political intelligence entity that does work for everyone?</p>

<p>They work for money. The democrats are in bed with Russia more than Trump so probably both.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump&#39;s lawyer said the Russian lawyer that set up the meeting  &quot;participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,”..&quot;the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS&quot;.</p>

<p>He said that the person who associated with Fusion and misrepresented who they worked for.... That is pretty telling. It&#39;s like saying it without saying it. Just like a lawyer would. </p>
