       Let's have a Beatles thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Paul died and was replaced, but I still have many questions regarding the origin of the band itself. I love some of their music, but some of it seems not quite right. I have always found all members likable, but there are elements to their story that also make me raise an eyebrow.

       The question is how does
      </p>
      <p>
       The "O.K." gesture and " I love you" in ASL translate to a satanic ritual? Those are two prevalent and we'll known signs, I was hoping for supporting evidence...

       If you want to believe they are saying "OK" and "I love you," fine. But those same gestures also are widely accepted Satanic hand gestures and will both be prominently displayed in the results of a Google Image search for "Satanic hand gestures."
      </p>
      <p>
       The ASL sign for "I love you" is backwards anyway.

       I was actually thinking about this the other day.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are constantly critiquing modern celebrities and trying to make connections suggesting a less than organic rise to fame. If this type of manipulation of music is happening then it would make sense that one of the most influential pop culture forces of all time would be a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said I haven't actually done any research into whether or not there could be anything to this, and my knowledge of the Beatles is lacking so I don't have much to go off there.

       Their rise to fame is very well documented, a summary being John meets Paul through a mutual friend and asks him to join his band 1957, Paul asks his school friend George to join band 1957,

They release Please Please Me and begin touring UK then Europe, then Ed Sullivan sees them landing in London while he's at the airport there and invites them onto his show, and they make it in America.

       Yep, you can hear them getting better when you listen to their early rehearsal tapes compared to the Hamburg 1962 tapes, 8 hours of playing 7 days a week with 1 day off a month will do that for you. They were just insanely dedicated to becoming famous, that's basically the top and bottom of it.

       I think the Beatles were good guys, they caused way too much trouble for the establishment not to be. I do however believe that the Beatles independently explored the ideals of Crowley and occultism and put references to it in their music. Crowley himself appears on the Sgt Pepper cover twice and some claim the opening lines of the first song reference Crowley.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any of it was nefarious though and it was likely just an area of study that they found interesting and thought it would be neat to reference it in their art.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Paul, I used to believe he was replaced but I have since convinced myself that the task of finding someone who looks just like him, plays just like him and writes the same and even greater level of music like him is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that John's death was government involved, with Yoko Ono being a handler of sorts and I don't know enough to say if George's attack was government involved or not.

       I somewhat go back and forth about the Paul Is Dead theory as well, but the theory is not that they found someone who looked exactly like him. The persons pictured before and after 1966 do look different, and at the time there were Paul McCartney lookalike contests so there would have been choices of close resemblances, enhanced by plastic surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't play alike, as the replacement was a better musician and the composition of Paul's songs definitely improved after 1966. Also the replacement was more piano-heavy as he would have had to learn how to play bass left-handed. The theory is that he was talented studio musician Billy Pepper, or Billy Shears, of Billy and the Pepperpots.

       The pictures just don't provide strong enough evidence, you can cherrypick ones that look different or alike, you also have to consider so many factors when examining these pictures, lighting, angles, changing technology, and so on. The best picture or video evidence for me are the interviews, the characteristics show no change, and for a lookalike to be able to match these unconscious subtleties is simply impossible given the time frame we have here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The music aspect is a bit stranger, but you have to remember how 1966 marked a huge change in their music, but watching performances of Paul singing Yesterday, even decades later, I think you still have those subtleties that would be impossible to reproduce in a double. Also, if this new Paul was even better than the original, I can't understand why Billy and the Pepperpots weren't huge. Paul was among the greatest songwriters of his era at the time, if his replacement was even better I just find it very unlikely he was kept hidden away so easily.

       IMO, their interviews are not the same. Paul is much more charming and funny whereas Faul is more self-absorbed and wry. Most people are not very familiar with the early Beatles and so they have not seen how the early interviews with Paul show someone different in both appearance and demeanor from who we now know as Sir Paul.

       The blog post I linked to was talking about a Wired Italia article by a team of forensic scientists who had set out to prove that Paul did not die, but were shocked to find out that their photographic analysis proved the opposite: that they were two different individuals.

       Again, I suggest you watch those videos I linked to and see how the unconscious subtleties match exactly. Examining different interviews based on fleeting aspects like mood is faulty, a lot changes but your unconscious ticks and movements don't and for a double to match those is impossible unless he was trained for a very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the Wired article thrown around a lot but I don't put very much credence in it. It's primarily based on picture analysis, which is nowhere near conclusive for type of claims we're making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clues I think are a mixture of the genuine occult references they put in their music and a case of pareidolia where people are looking for symbols where none really exist. I'll admit I haven't looked into the eye color to know enough for sure, but we have to also consider that many early pictures of Paul were black and white, so in the process of coloring them there may be cases where the person doing the editing messed up the eye color.

       Like I said this is one conspiracy theory that I am not and can probably never be sure about, but to me the way things shook out with the Beatles certainly seem to indicate that at least something weird with Paul was going on. Like you said, to me the hardest thing to believe about it is that the guy not only looks so similar but is also an even better musician and apparently a great songwriter. I will admit that if the PID theory is true, I would have expected Faul to have receded into quiet retirement by now rather than still be touring.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the strongest evidence in favor of it IMO is the cover of Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band, which obviously depicts a funeral and even has Paul's left-handed bass on the grave, the words in the drum which cryptically spell out "II IX HE DIE" with an arrow pointing up to Paul, and the clues in the lyrics such as Glass Onion which says "The Walrus Was Paul." In album covers like Let It Be, Abbey Road, and Magical Mystery Tour, Paul is clearly distinguished from the rest of the guys such as how his background is the only red one on Let It Be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably because I'm trying to recover from a headache but I didn't even notice you had linked to anything so I'll go back and check that out. If you are interested here is a pretty convincing interview with a guy who claims to be McCartney's son and a blog from some lady that has compiled a lot of cool stuff about it such as a sketch by John Lennon that seems to depict a dead Paul.

       As far as the clues go, I'll go back to my earlier point that the Beatles studied and referenced the occult in their music and these symbols that often times related to death were misconstrued into meaning that Paul was dead. Of course, the Beatles could have deliberately made it seem that way, it's something that John would have gotten a huge kick out of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'll check out that stuff you linked, I absolutely love this topic and can spend days looking into it and it's a very refreshing break from the current trends on this sub.

       Regarding the idea that they deliberately made it seem that way, that is one aspect where their behavior actually makes me think there really is something going on there, because when you look at their reactions when the topic comes up it seems like they would rather talk about anything but that. And Lennon does say that he deliberately put clues in the lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul (or Faul), when asked about why he is barefoot on the cover of Abbey Road, says that 'it was hot that day so I took off my shoes,' which doesn't exactly make sense as if it were hot you wouldn't want to be barefoot on the pavement. It's this kind of bizarre explanation and almost nervous responses that make me think there is something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like, there is not one piece of evidence that is very convincing by itself, but when you go through the theory you find several dozen things that when taken all together seem like a strong indication of some kind of conspiracy or secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the topic too. I don't know the answers so I can't be argumentative or hostile about it, and it's like a "light" conspiracy theory that while a bit creepy is not too controversial or divisive. A good escape, like you say.

       I think it can all be explained with an analysis of the occult symbolism present throughout their work. For this I recommend "The Sgt Pepper Code", it's an online book, not too long of a read,  that gives a very detailed analysis of the symbolism on the Sgt Pepper cover and other work from their career and connects it together to show that PID is the wrong message and the Beatles wanted us to take the clues in a different direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond the obvious greatness of the music, I think the Sgt Pepper album also tells a fantastic story entirely through it's symbolism, and I think it's a message the Beatles didn't want to flat out say, which explains the secrecy in interviews or the red herrings with Paul Is Dead stuff.

       Fascinating, never heard of that book. I would love to read
       <em>
        Memoirs of Billy Shears
       </em>
       but it's so expensive.

       Yeah, no worries about cost for this one as it's provided free of charge (which always give a credibility boost for me). Anyways, I'm glad we had such a great discussion, I always love getting a chance to talk about Beatles conspiracies, it's my two favorite things rolled into one.

       Issue with Paul is Dead theory is that the body double would have been responsible for the vast majority of Paul's music catalogue, including the most memorable and significant works.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the point in time when Paul is alleged to have died, he was not a big name and could have been replaced with anyone like they did with the drummer. Why go through the trouble of having someone impersonate a low time musician?

       I agree with you up until your second point.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of Paul's alleged death, the Beatles were the most famous act in modern music history. Never before has any band reached that level. A death in the group would be disastrous and have a very large effect on society. That's the only reason why a double would ever be considered, sure you had other major acts of the 60s die prematurely, but none of them were at the level the Beatles attained. I'm not advocating the theory, I'm just giving a reason why so many would even consider the double theory in the first place.

       Paul is believed to have died in 1966, at the apogee of Beatlemania, when Paul was an international superstar and household name in the U.K. and the US.

       I think they were the Greatest band ever, never to be duplicated. I don't understand why people think its some Tavistock conspiracy. Do you think some sinister guys in some lab wrote all their songs to Hypnotize everyone or some such shit? Listen to all the in the studio stuff you can find where you hear them staring with the bare bones of songs. Over time, and by adding layers and working on take after take they, eventually, generated absolute Masterpieces.

       The Stones from about '69-Some Girls album were Fantastic. That's why I don't buy into the Beatles vs. Stones argument. The Beatles were done recording in '69. The Stones were, to me, just beginning to be The Stones in 1969.

       I was hoping that more people would provide insight into the Tavistock theory, which I don't know much about but am interested in. It certainly seems that something happened with Paul, and I feel that he most likely died in 1966. I left another comment that had a picture of John and Paul making Satanic hand gestures, an album cover that featured dismembered baby dolls, and a photo of the group with Jimmy Savile.

       I'm stupid, I took a quick look at the Paul is Dead page and thought it said he died in 1962. It was actually 1967 which invalidates what I said.

       Further proof that "Paul is dead" is made up. I've heard 1962, 1964, 1966, and 1967 which means it is spread in different ways and not one is true.

       I always thought The Beatles were a corporate band, like The Monkees.  Maybe I was wrong and misread their origins at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still love the story about how when touring with Roy Orbison their fans were so loud and anxious for the Beatles that people couldn't hear Roy.  Instead of complaining or anything, Roy took the stage and started singing.  He sang quietly so in order for the crowd to actually hear anything they had to shut the hell up, which they did and he apparently was very well received afterwards.

       Paul McCartney is the same Paul McCartney, that much I know. He was not replaced. Beyond that, Lennon was definitely killed by TPTB and not some lone nut. That's all I know for sure.

       Watch that David Frost interview someone posted earlier. Same voice and facial expressions as the Paul that was in the Chris Farley interview 30 years later, and every other interview in between. It's the same guy. Only explanation would be if he was cloned, but I don't think we were cloning people at that point to doppelgänger-esque levels.

       Those two photos look much more alike than before and after meth photos. Considering the amount of drugs he did, it makes sense. He also grew taller after the Beatles became famous, but before 1966. If he had shrank, or if the growth happened suddenly in 1966, I could understand.

       I think-and again, take what I say for face value-this is a man who's testosterone was elevated because he was one of the globe's alpha-males. All of the traits you see as different in his face in the second picture you linked to can be explained by elevated testosterone. Stronger jaw, longer face, etc. Normally that would be due to HGH or Steroid use, but for a Beatle who had pussy chasing him by literal millions, and what that would do to someone's hormones and therefore their appearance.

       Meh. Other than some joints and perhaps an occasional speed pill during grueling International tour schedules, by all accounts Paul did not use drugs. Even if he did, that can't change the shape of one's skull and definitely not in a year.

       The guy was the first mainstream-famous person to openly admit to using LSD. That is a permanent alteration of the brain. I've definitely noticed a change in people's appearance even when they started casually smoking weed. LSD is not meth-level appearance altering, but he was doing it, and it probably affected his appearance.
      </p>

       The funny thing is, Lennon's appearance changed way more during his Beatles tenure. He looked like Reggie Watts by the end.

       Also he's 20 in the first picture and 25 in the second one, obviously his appearance changed. He was still just a kid in the first picture. This is a genuine
