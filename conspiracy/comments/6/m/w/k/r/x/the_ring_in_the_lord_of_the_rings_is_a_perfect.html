        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Money = The Ring</p>

<p>Illuminati controls the ring. They create money with the Federal Reserve and control the flow of money so that it always bounces back to them. </p>

<p>Only a few people can withstand the corruption of massive wealth. The innocent hobbit of LOTR was chosen to hold onto the ring and it almost corrupted him. </p>

<p>No matter what we do, we can&#39;t control the corruption that is caused by money or any form of trade. The only solution is a gifting economy which would lead to a much more lavish lifestyle for the masses. The only economic model that exists for this is called Sacred Economics found here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs</a></p>

<p>Eliminating money would eliminate:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Illuminati power. If money is power then the Illuminati will always come out on top. </p></li>
<li><p>Drug cartels and gangs would not longer have a reason to exist. </p></li>
<li><p>Politicians could no longer be bought off. </p></li>
<li><p>No more recessions or depessions. </p></li>
<li><p>No more bills. </p></li>
<li><p>No more banks or bankers. </p></li>
<li><p>No more worry about financial theft. </p></li>
<li><p>No more homelessness. </p></li>
<li><p>No more wars for profit. </p></li>
<li><p>No more misery for profit schemes (IE killing off homeopathic doctors who offer cheap, healthy alternatives to barbaric hospital care). </p></li>
<li><p>No more drastic inequality. We would all be on the same page. </p></li>
<li><p>No more financial burdens. </p></li>
<li><p>No more lack of jobs. Anyone can do anything. We can&#39;t do anything we want with money as not everything is profitable (IE creating street art or finding homes for homeless people). Eliminating money would open up the market so anyone can work anything. Also, the immoral jobs would no longer be beneficial so people would have no reason to do them anymore. </p></li>
<li><p>No more 20 trillion dollar national debt. </p></li>
<li><p>No more top-down slavery. </p></li>
<li><p>Much less overall corruption. </p></li>
<li><p>No more starvation. </p></li>
<li><p>No more cabal hoarding our wealth and resources. </p></li>
<li><p>No more marrying people for money. </p></li>
<li><p>No more endless advertisements manipulating people to buy every product in existence. </p></li>
<li><p>No more taxes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>We can go on and on and on. The benefits are literally endless. If we ever want real freedom, we need to stop keeping count and just arrange ourselves to keep the world going. If 95% of Americans were to work instead of the current 65%, we could work only 5 hours a day (instead of 8) and we will have more coworkers to help us with our day to day activities (this would lighten up our load). People would be able to work their own passion. Some people will pick the jobs nobody else wants (IE trashman) just for the honor of doing it (just like people who join the military or police do now) and we will have our Employee Finding Companies hard at work utilizing TV commercials and paper ads in case we have jobs that need filling. We all work for free and consume for free. Our quality of life depends on how well we perform. By uniting everyone focus for a higher quality of life, we will have fun building society into a wealthy planet. Since we all focus on the same thing, that one thing becomes empowered by all of us. This would end all of our problems overnight. Also, in this economy, ownership would be replaced with caretakership because all humans would own everything together. This means when someone is using something, it basically belongs to them until they no longer need it. Once they no longer need it, they have to gift it to someone else either in the vicinity or on Ebay/Amazon or some 3rd party outlet. To make this happen nationwide, we would need to build an app where everyone who registers greenlights themselves as willing to participate in Sacred Economics. Once we have enough people, we set a date and launch the program. </p>

<p>I know this seems like a lot of work but we have no choice. The whole fucking world is crumbling very fast because of the money system which is broken. It has always been broken but we are really seeing the long term effects now because of our giant population and technology boost. If it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t work. Although we need to work to establish the system (using an open source method), we would also all be relieved to no longer have debts, criminal networks, corrupt politicians, ect.. Life would literally be easy. Instead of the &quot;every man for himself&quot; model, we would use a cooperate model which is clearly superior. </p>
