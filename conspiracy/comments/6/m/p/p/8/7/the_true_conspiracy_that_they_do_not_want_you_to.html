        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is in response to one of my comments I made in another post talking about all this Russian noise within our elections. Here is the comment in response to the question of &quot;where do we go from here?&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh I don&#39;t know, maybe people should be outraged/protest that our Sovereign Republic was hijacked and stolen from us by a Foreign Corporation named UNITED STATES INC and they use their privately owned Federal Reserve bank and their army of debt collectors at the IRS to further loot the nation and declare war on other nations to loot them.</p>

<p>But no, let&#39;s talk about how Russia tried to influence our elections or something. The real enemies lay within the walls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post is not a partisan post. This is a post from one fellow US countryman to my other fellow country men and women. I do not support any candidate, party, or the governmental system as it exists today and you will know why I do not and why you should not either by the end of this post.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It is true that foreign nations (including Russia) try and are successful in influencing our elections and our policies. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestoryus2012/2012/03/20123774029910326.html">If this is new to you, you should look into how AIPAC influences the elections of past, present, and most likely future if we continue down this road</a>. Truth be told, though, are the policies really policies of the people and our representatives? I think not, because think tanks such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations">CFR (Council on Foreign Relations)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC (Project for the New American Century)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee">AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Among others are the ones coming up with the policies that our politicians then write into law or enact. Just like how the Democrats and Republicans are different sides to the same coin, so are these think tanks. Ones being &quot;left&quot; and the others being &quot;right&quot; is all smoke and mirrors of the grand parlour trick and <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/18/48/59/18485975c42ccff5326aad8cc3c1518e.jpg">the illusion of free choice</a>.</p>

<p>Now that you know that our politicians are merely regurgitating and writing in laws that come from lobbyists, lawyers, and think tanks, we must ask ourselves &quot;are these really our (We The People) representatives?&quot;. I&#39;m going to inform you right now, that they are not. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Organic_Act_of_1871">The US Act of 1871 was enacted and it forever changed the Republic</a>. </p>

<p>What this did was effectively handed over the rulership of the Sovereign Republic of the United States of America to a <a href="https://youtu.be/N2Lw_5ex8KA">Foreign for profit Corporation of the District of Columbia, whose only jurisdiction is within the 10 square miles of the District of Columbia</a>. It has it&#39;s own bylaws, currency, rules, courts, security forces, employees, language (legalese), etc etc that they govern we the sovereign people with by implied consent.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act">Fast forward to 1913 when this private corporation established their private for profit central bank</a>. This private bank was the brainchild of the foreign bankers who were behind the Act of 1871. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k0DKa2GULo">In 1910, a secret meeting took place on Jekyll Island, where a handful of these elite bankers conspired to create this private central bank for their corporation</a>. </p>

<p>Like every corporation, they need a collection agency so they restructured an existing agency via<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service"> the IRS (Internal Revenue Services)</a>. Much like the Federal Reserve, the IRS is not a governmental agency. The truth is, <a href="http://mystrangemind.com/2006/08/irs-exposed-irs-is-privately-owned.html">they are a private corporate debt collection agency for said federal corporation</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/17/heres-what-happens-if-you-dont-pay-your-taxes.html">Failure to pay your dues via implied contract, you will be penalized.</a> A great analogy of this would be Union dues if you are in a Union (i.e. auto union, etc etc) within a company and if that company has an existing Union, you are birthed into that union without a choice. You have to pay your dues or leave.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7K6P7hlko">Our parents birthed us into this Union unwittingly via our birth certificates</a> as did their parents. The courts and law enforcement officers all work together to enforce these corporate dues and bylaws.</p>

<p>So, as the original questioned asked &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot;. The way forward is education. We all must become an educated society again and realize that we have all been robbed and hoodwinked for far too long. We all need to realize that everything we&#39;ve ever been told was deception and lies. Everything from the party system to the actual foundation of our very own &quot;government&quot;. </p>

<p>We are no longer the Republic that our Founding Fathers created, fought and died for. We&#39;ve returned to the status of Voluntary Servitude of Imperialism that some of our Founders vehemently detested and fought. </p>

<p>As with all rabbit holes goes, there is far more under the surface, but for now, these truths must be known in order for us to truly move forward.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/V8PblX_Qaf0?t=10">We cannot change Washington DC by voting for congressmen or presidents</a>, they are corporate employees. What we need to do is peacefully abolish the foreign corporate entity that is unconstitutionally ruling over our Sovereign Republic. </p>

<p>Millions of free men and women of all races, religions, and creeds, peacefully marching onto the Corporation that is the District of Columbia and demanding our Sovereignty back. That is the only way we can truly change things. Our votes ultimately do not matter and any voting influence talk is merely a distraction from the true conspiracy they do not want you to know about.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and let&#39;s get a discussion going.</p>
