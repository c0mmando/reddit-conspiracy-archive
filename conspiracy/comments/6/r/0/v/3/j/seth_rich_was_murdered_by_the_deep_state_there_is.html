    <div class="md"><p>DC has a 60-70% homicide clearance rate, so obviously a lot aren&#39;t solved. Stranger killing clearance rates are a lot lower because life isn&#39;t a tv show.  My best friend was murdered 17 years ago. Her killer has still not been caught and this was at 530 pm on a busy street and they set her house on fire, not a dark street in the middle of the night during a robbery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  Not DC, but somewhere else with similar clearance rates. It seems as if they don&#39;t immediately have a suspect they&#39;re never going to solve it. Cold case stuff is nice on tv, but it seems like without some random person coming forward with evidence that they were hiding or a drunken confession, reality doesn&#39;t really do that. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m pretty sensitive to this stuff so I&#39;m not objective. I really hope they figure out who killed Rich, but if it was a random opportunistic person looking for a quick buck, the chances that they&#39;ll find them is pretty much zero unless they brag about it or piss off the wrong person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fascinating. A group of people who hate public figures so much that they are 100% certain they executed a murder based on evidence that doesn&#39;t really exist. The fact that most people disagree with them isn&#39;t a sign that they may be mistaken, but emboldens them because they feel like everyone is trying to hide something and they enjoy the whole us vs. them shtick. I wonder if they see the irony when they don&#39;t believe in other conspiracies with equally &#39;certain&#39; believers. Or maybe they just distrust all authority and believe the Earth is flat and vaccines cause autism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad and all for the dude&#39;s family, but do you believe we all care enough to conspire and try to decieve you? What incentive does anyone have to defend some former politician Democrats aren&#39;t even talking about anymore? It just takes one second to think to yourself and ask, could I be wrong? and perhaps read an well-sourced and explained article that disagrees with you without bias. If the only people you talk to are people that agree with you, then you aren&#39;t the wise few - you&#39;re the willfully ignorant.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how all belief systems work. The brain is neuroplastic, which means it adapts its pathways and chemistry to that which seems to best suit it. When a belief gives someone the unconscious sense of security that comes from the strength of numbers (because others agree or support him), they become reliant on the neurochemical sense of relief is gives them, and introducing contrary information causes cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>We&#39;re basically addicted to beliefs to keep us in packs for protection; it&#39;s how our survival instinct has evolved. The only way around it is to teach children in the pre-rationalization stage (before age seven, approx) to be literate and think critically. Other than that, most people need to &#39;bottom out&#39;, because beliefs and addictions basically behave the same way in the brain -- they reduce anxiety through a shift in neurotransmitters. So until they no longer have faith in the protective group, they won&#39;t give it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me think of all those people who spend an irrational amount of time actively hating some one. Like when Beiber became popular with girls and some boys feel threatened by their attraction. Instead of ignoring the guy, like most people who dislike him would, constantly bash him on numerous social media platforms. They end up spending more time talking about Beiber than his fans. You have to really love being angry and hating things to go out of your way to incorporate things you despise into your daily schedule. I feel bad because that&#39;s a terrible way to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hersch claimed he saw documents which is more than enough for me.  Between Kim dotcom, the wikileaks retweet and Hersch, it&#39;s a done deal.  </p>

<p>They all have more credibility than those pushing the alternative theory. </p>

<p>Wasserman? Brazille?  Pfffft... Get the fuck out. </p>

<p>Then you have wasserman and Awan.  </p>

<p>Then you have wasserman threatening capital police for a laptop. </p>

<p>Move on,  this case is closed.  Imran found out about rich. Wasserman paid him to shut the fuck up and leave, and possibly murder rich. </p>

<p>If you cant figure this out I don&#39;t know what to tell you... </p>

<p>Wikileaks - Russian government propaganda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is wikileaks Russian propaganda? . That&#39;s the biggest, far reaching conspiracy theory that exists outside of reptilians.</p>

<p>You know wikileaks has been around for over a decade, had released documents on Russia previously... </p>

<p>Pretty sad that anything that goes against Hillary Clinton is deemed a Russian plot to overthrow our government. </p>

<p>You guys are truly psychos. </p>
