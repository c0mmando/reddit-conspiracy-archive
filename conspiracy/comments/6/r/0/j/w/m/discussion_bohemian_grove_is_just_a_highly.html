    <div class="md"><p>I was chatting with a friend the other day about something like this - basically we were at Toronto Pride and people were milling about the bar with their phones out taking pictures and selfies and snaps and all that nonsense  - because it&#39;s Canada and current year and nobody gives a shit if you&#39;re gay.</p>

<p>In my lifetime, I can remember that being <em>very</em> different, and it probably still is in many parts of the world. You enter an establishment and expect a certain amount of privacy. You&#39;d get 86&#39;d for pulling out a camera, let alone taking pictures.</p>

<p>I sort of look at the BG as a &quot;corporate team building&quot; type thing, without the lame trust exercises.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d read Nixon&#39;s take on it, OP, but it&#39;s a humdinger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NIXON: But it&#39;s not just the ratty part of town. The upper class in San Francisco is that way. <strong>The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time--it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine,</strong> with that San Francisco crowd. I can&#39;t shake hands with anybody from San Francisco.</p>

<p>Decorators. They got to do something. But we don&#39;t have to glorify it. You know one of the reasons fashions have made women look so terrible is because the goddamned designers hate women. Designers taking it out on the women. Now they&#39;re trying to get some more sexy things coming on again.</p>

<p>EHRLICHMAN: Hot pants.</p>

<p>NIXON: Jesus Christ.</p>

No doubt there&#39;ll be some homosexuals there, likely still in the closet and have the time of their life for two weeks.

    <div class="md"><p>You should work for NAMBLA or something... </p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is that you make excuses for extremely powerful people based on nothing at all. You just explicitly trust that they are totally not colluding to consolidate and protect their entrenched power, and that they&#39;d rather go to some weird forest party with contemporaries than spend a family vacation with Grandchildren or go do something with life-long friends.</p>

<p>The mental gymnastics you go through are impressive as opposed to saying &#39;I don&#39;t know and can&#39;t know&#39;. I&#39;d recommend the second. Far less karma that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have also taken that stance before (hopeless optimist) and I understand your angle, but it doesn&#39;t feel good to make excuses and fight for things that aren&#39;t actually what you claim them to be. &#39;The only thing I know is that I do not know&#39;. Life has a funny way of putting you in your place at times. I guess that&#39;s my point. Not emotional, just saying it&#39;s not responsible to make excuses for things you don&#39;t know about. And unfortunately you can&#39;t always give people the benefit of the doubt either - there is nothing offensive about compliance.</p>

<p>Have a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burning Man:  way different.  Public, open, photo&#39;d, video&#39;d, and personal.  Yea it requires tickets but that&#39;s the hurdle.  One does not need to be among the Top 300 Males in the World.  Granted, some of Burning Man smacks of occult and/or fire cult.</p>

<p>&quot;Weird ritual&quot;:  Is the Cremation of Care.  In the duality they worship, women are Care and men are Protect.  As men, they go to extreme lengths to to remove the Care instinct. This is an ancient occult ritual.  It may look melodramatic, but to those practicing it is serious.  Maybe the present day cremation is an effigy, maybe not.</p>
