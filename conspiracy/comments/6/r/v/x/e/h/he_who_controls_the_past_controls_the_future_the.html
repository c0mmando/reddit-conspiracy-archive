       Visit your local library. Remember when they held volume after volume of bound periodicals, that had been amassed over decades?
      </p>
      <p>
       At my own library, I once had access to the Reader's Guide to those periodicals, but the Guide has also gone the way of other print from the past. The entire reference section, and the entire bound periodical section, suddenly disappeared one Spring. "It's all on the Internet now, anyway" they reasoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that's not so. So much information, just discarded. Why? So that TPTB can better filter that information to the masses in future. So that TPTB can profit by reselling only profitable information in a way that only they want you to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try browsing the electronic Reader's Guide. Try finding one, in print. The destruction of periodic journalism is proceeding apace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save what you can. Steal an important book from your Library today. It may be the last copy to survive the current onslaught upon history.

       If they've bought into the 'digital is permanent' lie, there's nothing you can do to convince them.

      <p>
       I'd suggest talking to someone at the library, and letting them know you would like the material if they are throwing it away.

      <p>
       Your library would be profitable if we get hit with an EMP, or zombies, or even if a cyber-attack that takes out our electric grid.

       LoL you are so funny. One of those "pics or didn't happen" types? Do you actually think, that I would take time out of my day, to send you a picture of a microfilm case, just to prove my point to someone who, ultimately, has absolutely no connection to me?

       Public librarian here. Last year my library renovated--the director wanted a kind of minimalist look with clean lines. She reduced the book collection by about 70%, tossed most of the magazines as well as most of the microfilm. The only microfilm we kept was of local newspapers.

       Well you can buy all these things pretty cheaply now, but I suppose you're right about old medias importance. Lots of good stories never made it to the web. I've got old clippings of all kinds that you can't find online.

       Try checking out old psychiatry, counterculture, and mom rags like Time and Life. I've got a bunch. Check out this (subtly racist and downright creepy) 60's ad for Thorazine, a chemical restraint.

       If James Brown is coming at ya, try Thorazine!

       Like that seed thing in Norway, where they keep the seeds. Iron Mountain is a start, clear out all that insurance shit in there, and put some real reading in. Computers won't last forever.

       The Medium is the Message, Bra, like MacLuhan said. Interesting, that in classes today, about Media, they brush MacLuhan and other critics aside, b/c that is their AGENDA man, it is all part of THE PLAN.

       I issue a challenge, one that I undertook today: starting tomorrow a.m., set aside internet, television, radio, all media. Listen to white noise if you must (many sites provide that) or classical music. Read something heavy. You will soon feel your brain suffer the withdrawal symptoms of a heroin addict: you MUST get that fix from your NEWS, your MEDIA, your PHONE, your FACESTUFF...you will suffer, because you have become ADDICTED TO BULLSHIT AIMED AT KEEPING YOU WITHIN YOUR CHAINS OF ADDICTION.

       The Electronic Beast has taken control, and we must stop it. One way is to take control of the past, by demanding the retention of periodicals already bought and paid for (especially those BOUND by the ARCHIVISTS of our TIME, those who will, I hope, continue to retain the records of this great fall).

       Backups and archives. Some might be fooled some of the time, but enough people are paying close enough attention that I'm not especially concerned. If they try to change facts, I not only have my own brain with knowledge that might be more accurate, but I also have access to the hivemind of the super organism known as human society. The Internet. Crowdsourced communal memory might not seem ideal when you're used to hard copies, but we still have hard copies out there if you wanna horde newspapers. And people are definitely archiving physical media too, even if your local library might not be.

       Sure, but the average citizen wouldn't even think to go to their local library to look at ancient periodicals anyway. You're not going to "save" the average citizen even if every local library had a massive archive of old publications.

       I noticed that a long time ago. First time was when an article about the then new Iraq war said something about them finding wmds, then within hours it had been edited out. But not before most people reading it had "learned" that wmds had been found so yay Bush was right. I started taking screenshots of everything after that.

       If, like before when they went on book burning rampages, they decided to shut down the internet, restrict electricity and go on computer destroying rampages, then so much would be lost forever.

       Sometimes there is just no substitute for a hard copy. I wonder how The Vatican library would react if someone were to suggest that they could get rid of all their original manuscripts because they could just be digitized and kept forever that way?

       Fallacy: "When the EMP comes"...lots of things might come. Tsuami. Great Flood. Asteroid. Nuclear Annihilation. The thing that is OCD for me is, that everyone puts all their eggs in the "Cloud" and the digital stuff, esp. OFF LINE, and that shit is going to be WIPED man, I am telling you, the first thing "They" do is not kill all the lawyers (that is second) but erase all of history possible. And with this premise that archive.org (as much as I love them) is somehow some indestructible storehouse of knowledge, well, they just Library of Alexandria and it will be up to our ancestors to say just how we lost all that shit once again.

       Also if you love Eli Roth and see a lot of yourself in him, there's something seriously fucking wrong with you, so it doesn't surprise me to find you a voice for the fake establishment reality to keep the profane under heel.

       I had to clean out my parents house and they had a full original 27 volume set of the Catholic encyclopedia from like 1909.  thought it should be worth a few hundred bucks but no I literally couldn't give it away.  Nobody wants old books.  My library rents out more movie dvds then books.

       There, my friend, you have identified the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ... don't ... care. Just keep on feeding me my Internet feed, feed my my Reddit, keep me informed on what I need to think today....
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn that shit off, bra, and tell me how your brain feels. IT WILL FEEL LIKE A HEROIN ADDICT DEPRIVED, THAT'S HOW IT WILL FEEL, B/C you can't think one second for your self.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the feeling...it is hard to handle, not having your daily pablum fed to you. But it like sugar, once you get off the additive, your brain works a lot different. Try it some time, you might like it.
      </p>

       This is part of the attempt to keep the sheep as stupid as possible, and the rich in control. The 2 track system of education: good private schools for the rich and shitty public schools for the poor. No good libraries, no good books, no good teachers, bus thugs into the suburbs so that the suburban schools all go to shit. TPTB are just trying to keep us down. That is all that this is.

       This man sees beyond the b$ of war, the 15 trillion for war, but we can't save our libraries or house the homeless. You, my friend, deserve to keep reading what they don't want us to read. Carry on, steal that book, Dude. High Five.

       I've been saying for over a decade that it's unethical how online news articles are edited after they are written, with no notice. I've taken screenshots of articles that allege something, then the next day the allegation has disappeared.
