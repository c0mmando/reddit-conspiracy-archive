        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Visit your local library. Remember when they held volume after volume of bound periodicals, that had been amassed over decades? </p>

<p>At my own library, I once had access to the Reader&#39;s Guide to those periodicals, but the Guide has also gone the way of other print from the past. The entire reference section, and the entire bound periodical section, suddenly disappeared one Spring. &quot;It&#39;s all on the Internet now, anyway&quot; they reasoned.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not so. So much information, just discarded. Why? So that TPTB can better filter that information to the masses in future. So that TPTB can profit by reselling only profitable information in a way that only they want you to know. </p>

<p>Try browsing the electronic Reader&#39;s Guide. Try finding one, in print. The destruction of periodic journalism is proceeding apace.</p>

<p>Save what you can. Steal an important book from your Library today. It may be the last copy to survive the current onslaught upon history.</p>

<p>Peace &lt;luv&gt; READ</p>

<p>I issue a challenge, one that I undertook today: starting tomorrow a.m., set aside internet, television, radio, all media. Listen to white noise if you must (many sites provide that) or classical music. Read something heavy. You will soon feel your brain suffer the withdrawal symptoms of a heroin addict: you MUST get that fix from your NEWS, your MEDIA, your PHONE, your FACESTUFF...you will suffer, because you have become ADDICTED TO BULLSHIT AIMED AT KEEPING YOU WITHIN YOUR CHAINS OF ADDICTION.</p>

<p>The Electronic Beast has taken control, and we must stop it. One way is to take control of the past, by demanding the retention of periodicals already bought and paid for (especially those BOUND by the ARCHIVISTS of our TIME, those who will, I hope, continue to retain the records of this great fall).</p>

<p>Backups and archives. Some might be fooled some of the time, but enough people are paying close enough attention that I&#39;m not especially concerned. If they try to change facts, I not only have my own brain with knowledge that might be more accurate, but I also have access to the hivemind of the super organism known as human society. The Internet. Crowdsourced communal memory might not seem ideal when you&#39;re used to hard copies, but we still have hard copies out there if you wanna horde newspapers. And people are definitely archiving physical media too, even if your local library might not be. </p>

OFF LINE, and that shit is going to be WIPED man, I am telling you, the first thing &quot;They&quot; do is not kill all the lawyers (that is second) but erase all of history possible.

<p>There, my friend, you have identified the problem.</p>

<p>Just ... don&#39;t ... care. Just keep on feeding me my Internet feed, feed my my Reddit, keep me informed on what I need to think today....</p>

<p>Turn that shit off, bra, and tell me how your brain feels. IT WILL FEEL LIKE A HEROIN ADDICT DEPRIVED, THAT&#39;S HOW IT WILL FEEL, B/C you can&#39;t think one second for your self.</p>

<p>I know the feeling...it is hard to handle, not having your daily pablum fed to you. But it like sugar, once you get off the additive, your brain works a lot different. Try it some time, you might like it.</p>
