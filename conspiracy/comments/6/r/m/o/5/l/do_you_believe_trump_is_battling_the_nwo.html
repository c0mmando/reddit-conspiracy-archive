He killed the TPP and pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. Both of which you know are NWO schemes. He returning power back to the people (albeit very slowly)  Look at who hates him: Wall Street type and bankers, a large percentage of &quot;politicians&quot; (more than likely corrupt), and of course George Soros and parasites like him. These are just observable facts so no need to argue them. If he really isn&#39;t battling them, then I assume they are just putting on a show? Doubt it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A long time ago, if you chose to be a donor, you signed the back of your Drivers License. (This is in NYS, not sure if same everywhere) 
When I renewed it, I said yes to Organ donation. My new Drivers License came and they changed it. It&#39;s now labeled on the front <strong>ORGAN DONOR</strong> with a red heart. Its very easy to see.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into the details, but after my brother was in a motorcycle accident, I saw 1st hand how these people/vultures are.</p>

<p>I took a permanent marker to my license so fast to block that organ donor off of it. With a big NO! I constantly get laughed at when I have to show my license anywhere. I don&#39;t care lol </p>

<p>My license is up for renewal and don&#39;t ya know, I can&#39;t find any info anywhere on how to get them to take me off their list. I have to call them because I&#39;ll let my license expire before I ask for another license with the &quot;They are probably mostly dead, don&#39;t waste your time. We&#39;ll take them &amp; make use of them&quot; announcement on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the same as you do. The fact that everyone seems to be fighting to bring Trump down, makes me realize it is not an act/for show. It is real. They really hate him.</p>

<p>The more they fight to bring him down, the more I realize he must be on the right side (the Good side).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, step outside your bubble for a moment and ask yourself why most of the country hates him and wants him out. He&#39;s a career criminal that&#39;s doing long term damage. He&#39;s lying <strong>constantly</strong> to the American people and the world. And quite possibly a traitor. </p>

<p>That you equate people objecting to that as proof of the opposite of that is, literally, insane. </p>

<p>The &quot;good side&quot; isn&#39;t the side of a crook, liar, thief and sleazeball. That you&#39;ve been conditioned to believe this is actually my biggest concern/problem at the moment. It&#39;s textbook cult behaviour and not only can you not recognise it, you&#39;ve been convinced you&#39;re one of the few globally that hasn&#39;t been affected. Like every other cult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly have no idea anymore. If he was their choice, &quot;they&quot; did a great job masking it--no way Newsweek would print a million copies of a special Hillary issue, for example. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s a front, I think, in the battle against the NWO but I&#39;m not sure he even knows it. Certainly he has forces on his side, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re &quot;backing&quot; him.  He was needed to stop Hillary, so they allowed &quot;Bad&quot; to defeat &quot;Evil.&quot; But he may just be a stepping stone to something else. Hopefully not Pence.</p>
