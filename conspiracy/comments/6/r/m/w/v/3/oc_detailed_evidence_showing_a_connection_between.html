        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Hypothesis</h1>

<p>There exists a relationship between sightings of UFOs, contact with Extraterrestial Intelligence, and Psychic Phenomena. Intelligence agencies across the globe have come to this conclusion and the reason for their silence on these topics is that they still do not have a full grasp on what exactly the implications of these topics will have on the population.</p>

<p>To fully understand this relationship, we must get a grasp on each of these topics individually.</p>

<h1>Project StarGATE</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing">Remote Viewing</a> is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International">SRI</a> in the 1960&#39;s with the famous psychic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann">Ingo Swann</a>. Ingo was one of the first members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">Project StarGATE</a> which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program (<a href="http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562">source</a>). I will be referring to the CIA in this section because of their recent declassification surrounding a lot of these documents. 
<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">Here is a document</a> purporting to show a Remote Viewing session of Mars at 1 Million B.C. which we will come back to later in the post.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality">Nonlocality</a> is a property of Quantum Mechanics which states that entangled particles affect each others&#39; quantum state instantaneously, seemingly transmitting information faster than the speed of light. In <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">this</a> CIA paper we gain insight into what the CIA calls <a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/catalog/122">The Gateway Process</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-Sync">Hemi-Sync</a> technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then goes on to explain the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a>, <a href="https://npepjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40810-015-0015-7">Brain Coherence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">Holograms</a>, a universal consciousness matrix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience">OBEs</a> and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.</p>

<p>As if this isn&#39;t strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell&#39;s conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness</p>

<h1>Remote Viewing and Humanoid Contact</h1>

<p>Revisiting the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">Mars paper</a> with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUB: I&#39;m seeing ah.... It&#39;s like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it&#39;s only a shadow. It&#39;s as if they were there and they&#39;re not, not there anymore.</p>

<p>MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.</p>

<p>SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they&#39;re very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes. </p>

<p>MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was <em>specifically</em> the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.</p>

<p>SUB: They&#39;re ancient people. They&#39;re ah... they&#39;re dying, it&#39;s past their time or age. They&#39;re very philosophic about it. They&#39;re looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can&#39;t seem to get their way out, they can&#39;t seem to find their way out... so they&#39;re hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...</p>

<p>MON: What is is they&#39;re waiting for?</p>

<p>SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It&#39;s like I&#39;m getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It&#39;s failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?</p>

<p>SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn&#39;t know who I am. Think he perceives I&#39;m just a hallucination or something.</p>

<p>MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?</p>

<p>SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.</p>

<p>MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.</p>

<p>SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it&#39;s very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.</p>

<h1>Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs</h1>

<p>It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950&#39;s, so I don&#39;t intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.</p>

<h2>Emails to John Podesta from Edgar Mitchell and Tom Delonge</h2>

<p>Regardless of your opinion of Tom Delonge, I think it&#39;s important to include these emails here because it shows at the very least government and military officials involved with the coverup of the UFO phenomena cooperating with him and feeding him information which is tied to the psychic phenomena and crashed UFO sightings. For important sections of the emails I will include quotes.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3099">General McClasland working with Tom Delonge</a></p>

<p>When Roswell crashed, they shipped it to the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was in charge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6983">Email showing Terri Mansfield setting up a Skype meeting for Podesta</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>In ongoing requests for our Skype talk to discuss Disclosure and the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent obedient ETI and the celestials of this universe, and because Hillary and Bill Clinton were intimates of Laurance Rockefeller who had an avid interest in ETI, I direct your attention to Scott Jones, PhD.
In Scott’s book Voices From the Cosmos, he describes himself as an octogenarian in full karmic payback made following 30 years in the military, half in combat arms and half in intelligence.
He references you in his ETI matter, as well as the Catholic Church.
Disclosure is now top priority for ETI itself in protection of the people.</p>

<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk. Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41591">Email discussing extraterrestial disclosure</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>John, I would like to schedule a phone conversation at your earliest
convenience to discuss what I feel are intensifying imperatives for
extraterrestrial disclosure.</p>

<p>For many years you and I have shared a mutual vision of disclosure. I highly commend your public record urging disclosure which includes the forward you wrote for Leslie Kean’s book and your call for the Pentagon’s release of 25 year old classified government papers on UFO investigations. When our government releases this classified information we become the twenty-fifth country to make public disclosure.</p>

<p>You and I also share a mutual vision for earth sustainability apparent in the escalating demand for a change in global energy policy. Our phone discussion will also include the zero point energy research and applications developed by my Quantrek international science team. Advanced energy science is linked to consciousness research and public disclosure of the extraterrestial presence.</p>
