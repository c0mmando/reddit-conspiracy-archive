    <div class="md"><p>Warmongering. Let&#39;s be real, Obama tried to soften views on Russia. 80&#39;s policy? I can be more flexible? </p>

<p>Putin is probably racist. Looking at Russia demographics it&#39;s all white people and white muslims. That&#39;s why the American right loves them so much, they are the dream. A real white ethnostate that Hitler tried to destroy because Hitler did not realize Stalin wasn&#39;t a jew. </p>

<p>The plan was easy for Trump. Deny it all and eventually release all sanctions as Trump gets a better deal for Russia with us. Everything is about resources for the United States. </p>

<p>Honestly... it&#39;s easy to sympathize with Russia once you realize they are just like us but an old geopolitical enemy of the world. Stalin is probably the greatest ruler of all time and the world is worse off that he was not immortal. Instead here we are with the American right wing sympathizing with Russia because quite frankly Russia is full of whites and they love white Russian women.</p>

<p>First of all where is the hard evidence emails were actually &quot;stolen&quot; and &quot;used to paint Democrats in an unfavorable manner&quot;?</p>

<p>Second of all I never understand how you can definitively say that it influenced the election in any tangible way. And even if you could your entire premise regarding &quot;your side probably going to fare poorly&quot; is not only a weak hypothetical based off nothing other than your feelings as a Democrat, but more importantly both deflects from the actual content of the &quot;dirty laundry&quot; and is inherently predicated on the idea that both sides have the same amount of dirty laundry which may or may not be the case (Innocent until <strong>proven</strong> guilty which one side has been). </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not buying that as a valid argument.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight, if he doesn&#39;t do anything for Russia its proof that he&#39;s a Russian puppet and if he does do something for Russia it&#39;s also proof that he&#39;s a Russian puppet? Come on now you can do better...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking you what you saw, I&#39;m asking you to provide evidence for your claim, personal anecdotes aren&#39;t going to cut it. </p>

<p>From my perspective the emails we&#39;re shown little to no air time and when they we&#39;re the actual content was never addressed. Now I&#39;m not using that as evidence for my claim because I know I can&#39;t back it up you should do the same.</p>

<p>To demonstrate my point let me ask you this, had Trump&#39;s tax returns or emails came out would you have claimed that it was &quot;used to paint Trump in an unfavorable manner&quot; or used it as something to bring him down with? </p>

<p>If the latter then why do you think that the emails we&#39;re &quot;used to paint Democrats in an unfavorable manor&quot; rather than the emails painting them that way on their own? Can you see how your argument falls apart when you take away your own personal bias away from it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not and maybe I overreached there and I&#39;m not saying that you necessarily believe that, but can you see how easy it is to point out the cognitive dissonance of the current popular opinion to frame Trump in a certain way. You can&#39;t have it both ways.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a world of media outside CNN. Fox and Breitbart certainly didn&#39;t ignore them. Redditors and Twitter users didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Totes. The commentary about the clip was entirely negative. As it bloody well should&#39;ve been, because groping women isn&#39;t right.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From observing Trump and his words and actions, it&#39;s very clear he wants to improve relations with Russia...aka do them favors. He signaled resistance  in signing the sanctions bill and whined about it after ultimately relenting. He was clearly happy to meet Putin, as well as Lavrov and Kislyak. Of all the people he&#39;s talked shit about, never Putin. Why? </p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t know what both ways about it there are. From my perspective, he&#39;s clearly pro-Russia but hamstrung by other forces.</p>

<p>Tweets. The tweets that accompanied and/or announced email dumps and highlighted (literally) particularly damning portions. I think such tweets were coming from both the WikiLeaks and Assange accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure how you made the jump from &quot;improving relations with Russia&quot; to &quot;doing them favors.&quot; That&#39;s a massive leap in logic with no explanation... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really isn&#39;t for anyone that&#39;s been paying close attention, but I&#39;ll explain. From Russia&#39;s perspective, the only way to improve relations is to drop sanctions/Magnitsky Act and return those spy compounds. The US will likely receive nothing in return (Russia frankly has nothing to offer), thus making those actions a favor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly you are raising my larger point that no matter which side Trump chooses it will be used as evidence against him. If he supports Russia he&#39;s a Russian puppet, if he doesn&#39;t support Russia obviously he&#39;s trying to take the spot light off of it. Can you see how this is problematic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely problematic. The deep state has him in a bind right now and I don&#39;t see how he will get out of it. I tend to believe he has Russian money interests and Russia helped him get elected. Putin needs the money from the sanctions to appease his mob buddies.</p>

<p>But you are right. Trump is stuck big time right now. I do think he will either be impeached or suicided in the next 2 years. What happens then? I have no fucking idea.</p>

<p>His explanation for the delay was not recorded, according to McClatchy, but the decision to delay approval lined up with Turkey’s interests in the region. Turkey has been a staunch opponent of the United States partnering with Kurdish forces in the region. The recommendation to delay the mission approval took place during the Trump team&#39;s transition period, ahead of Trump&#39;s inauguration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight, Flynn delaying an attack that &quot;lined up with Turkey&#39;s&quot; interest &quot;during the Trump team&#39;s transition period&quot; is somehow evidence of Trump attempting to help Russia? Flynn didn&#39;t even comment on it so the &quot;evidence&quot; is nothing but weak speculation... </p>

<p>Link 2</p>

<p>Trump gave Russia the name of a city that was likely already known. That&#39;s all you have?</p>

<p>If Russia “hacked the election” (still have yet to hear a concrete answer on what was hacked and actual evidence to how it influenced the election in anyway) to be a Russian puppet like I see claimed all the time, then why has <strong>Trump done nothing positive for Russia?</strong> </p>

<p>Was shown to be false.  I never arguing how effective these action were, only that they happened.</p>

<p>Now if I believed you were arguing in good faith I&#39;d link you to this: <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe</a>. </p>

<p>Like lets go to Link 3. </p>

<p>It is in America&#39;s interest to have Syria be under their control. It is in Russia&#39;s interest that Assad stays in power. The CIA funds rebels to remove Assad. That is their purpose, it doesn&#39;t matter if they are &quot;moderate&quot; or not.  This is a provable action of Trump acting in Russian interests over American ones. </p>
