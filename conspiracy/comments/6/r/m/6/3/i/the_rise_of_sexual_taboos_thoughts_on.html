<p><strong>The Rise of Sexual Taboos</strong></p>

<p>This morning, I came across an article on the front page, where it explained that Robert Pattinson refused to perform a real bestiality scene with a dog:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/robert-pattinson-refused-perform-sex-act-dog-new-movie/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/robert-pattinson-refused-perform-sex-act-dog-new-movie/</a></p>

<p>For a moment, I was happy, thinking, “At least somebody finally stood up for something in Hollywood.”</p>

<p>After reading the article, however, I realized that he still did do a scene where he jacked off a dog with a fake penis. It left me feeling very disturbed. While the movie is about his connection with a dog (I guess?), I am not sure why that type of scene is essential for the movie or plot line. Why is that type of scene even necessary?</p>

<p>Before I write this post, I want to note that I understand most people have sexual fetishes, and that I am not necessarily trying to shame any person. However, I do think there is a strange push toward normalizing certain taboos, that in the past, were considered completely disgusting. Now, of course, this is all said to be part of ‘progress’, but I feel there is something more sinister at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Normalization and Desensitization</strong></p>

<p>I remember having a conversation with my dad, and he told me that divorce used to be one of the worst things a person could do. If a person in a community got a divorce, they were definitely ostracized and shamed. Now I am not saying I agree with that, but it had me thinking about what it took to change people’s views over the years. As we know, divorce is very common now, and most do not even think twice if somebody mentions a divorce. Again, I am not against divorces (I have to repeat these beliefs for the shills), and I understand the necessity of them in many cases, but how did people’s paradigms shift so drastically in a few decades? </p>

<p>Desensitization is linked to exposure. For example, if somebody has a phobia, there is desensitization therapy that helps them get rid of that phobia:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/Systematic-Desensitisation.html">https://www.simplypsychology.org/Systematic-Desensitisation.html</a></p>

<p>When I was a little girl (10-12), I really liked Eminem. He was extremely popular, and his music was catchy, but when you actually look up some his lyrics at the time, they are pretty…gruesome. Here is an excerpt from his song “Kim” that I used to really like:</p>

<p>Come on get out
(I can&#39;t I&#39;m scared)
I said get out bitch!
(Let go of my hair, please don&#39;t do this baby)
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)
Fuck you, you did this to us
You did it, it&#39;s your fault
Oh my God I&#39;m crackin&#39; up
Get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian&#39;s party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn&#39;t it?
(Yes!)
That was funny wasn&#39;t it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn&#39;t it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin&#39; on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it&#39;s double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could&#39;ve, hey! where you going? get back here!
You can&#39;t run from me Kim
It&#39;s just us, nobody else!
You&#39;re only making this harder on yourself
Ha! ha! got you!
(Ah!)
Ha! go ahead yell!
Here I&#39;ll scream with you!
Ah somebody help!
Don&#39;t you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what&#39;s comin&#39; to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed!
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don&#39;t want to go on
Living in this world without you</p>

<p>Think about that. I was 12 years old listening to that. Anyway, at the time, Eminem was extremely controversial, but I would say now the lyrics might even look tame compared to some of the things I see today. </p>

<p>Anyway, the point I am trying to make is that desensitization does work. I remember rolling my eyes at the super, fundamental, religious people who would say that this type of thing (violence, sex, etc.) in the media is <em>not</em> good for children. They were just <em>uptight</em>, I thought, and they did not understand that times change. As long as children <em>knew</em> the difference between right and wrong, they were fine right? They can distinguish fantasy from reality, right?</p>

<p>Well, science says otherwise. There is almost no doubt today that the more exposure we get to certain things, the more likely we are to be desensitized to it. For example, this study shows how exposure to media violence is linked with aggressive behavior:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522002/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522002/</a></p>

<p>This study indicates a link to sexual lyrics and sexual experiences among urban youth:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008595/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008595/</a></p>

<p>There are endless studies on this, yet when we think of groups like  “One Million Moms”, they are painted as hate groups:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/one-million-moms">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/one-million-moms</a></p>

<p>Generally, the media portrays anybody speaking out about too much sex or too much violence is painted as somebody who just does not understand how the world changes over time. Often they are shown to be religious, uptight, and bigoted, but is this really the case? </p>

<p><strong>Two Important Anecdotes</strong></p>

<p>The point is that if ‘they’ want us to get used to something, they show it to us over and over again until it no longer seems abnormal. </p>

<p>Before I move on to the real point of this post, I would like to post two more anecdotes (I just feel they are relevant!!)</p>

<p>First, before I was in an abusive relationship, I could watch basically any movie. However, after that relationship, I was not able to watch “Wolf on Wall Street” without walking out of the theater. I finally felt empathy for the victim, and I knew what it felt like. However, I now realize that I should have empathy even if I had not been through a particular circumstance (which is why it is now difficult for me to watch almost any movie today!)</p>

<p>In reality, this desensitization removes our empathy:</p>

<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6500/Desensitization-and-Media-Effects.html">http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6500/Desensitization-and-Media-Effects.html</a></p>

<p>Luckily, most people I know will not be in an abusive relationship like I was, but they should be able to empathize with me, right? I am wondering if that ability to empathize is slowly being eroded, and many studies show that empathy is definitely declining:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/born-love/201005/shocker-empathy-dropped-40-in-college-students-2000">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/born-love/201005/shocker-empathy-dropped-40-in-college-students-2000</a></p>

<p>Second, sometimes I like to listen to music with my students. There was a popular song called “Sucker for Pain” by Lil Wayne. It was pretty catchy, but when I actually started to think about the lyrics, I realized it was talking about BDSM. I looked over at the 6th grader singing it, and I felt kind of disgusted. </p>

<p>Now, I could probably do this with nearly any song that is popular right now, but that is what you need to ask yourself. Why do all the popular songs have to be about such topics? You can say that it sells, but I will argue that they can sell anything they really want to – that’s the point of good advertising – to make you want something you do not even really need or want in the first place. If they wanted to, they could sell a song about &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;peanut butter&quot;. I do not know, I believe, they are experts, and they can sell anything.</p>

<p>Further, how desensitized are you to modern music? And you cannot claim this type of music was <em>always</em> around because it really was not. Compare pop music to the 60s to today. Sure, there may have been music with controversial topics (I know I love Velvet Underground and they write a lot about heroin), but this music was not necessarily aimed toward youth at the time. Anyway, even if you disagree with my point, just know that 92% of top billboard songs are about sex:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/</a></p>

<p><strong>Rise of Sexual Taboos</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to address desensitization and some of my experiences before I went to the point of this post, so I do apologize if I was a little wordy. Anyway, I am noticing a huge trend toward normalizing sex acts that were once considered taboo:</p>

<p>1) Incest: There are some strange news updates about family members marrying. Here is one about a mom marrying her son:</p>

<p>://<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3785756/Mother-45-25-year-old-son-arrested-incest.html">www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3785756/Mother-45-25-year-old-son-arrested-incest.html</a></p>

<p>Here is an article that states that incest is real and on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/disgusted-by-incest-genetic-sexual-attraction-is-real-and-on-the/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/disgusted-by-incest-genetic-sexual-attraction-is-real-and-on-the/</a></p>

<p>2) Beastiality: I was thinking about how common it was to now see tv shows where this is a mixture of humans and animals having relationships, even shows I like (BoJack Horseman), and shows I do not like (Family Guy). Is this all innocent? I am not sure, but bestiality is becoming legal in more and more places:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/denmarks-bestiality-problem-its-legal">http://www.thedailybeast.com/denmarks-bestiality-problem-its-legal</a></p>

<p>Again, there have always been cartoons with animals, but I feel that the cartoons with animals + human relationships is a relatively new phenomenon.</p>

<p>3) Pedophilia: While many remain disgusted by pedophilia, there are more and more defending it. Many are claiming that it is a sexual orientation like being gay or straight:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophilia-sexual-orientation-straight-gay-criminal-psychologist-child-sex-abuse-a6965956.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophilia-sexual-orientation-straight-gay-criminal-psychologist-child-sex-abuse-a6965956.html</a></p>

<p>Also, I could probably do a whole post about this, but there is definitely an oversexualization of children in the media, and here is an article about some oversexualized products aimed at children:</p>

<p><a href="https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/11-insanely-sexualized-childrens-products/">https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/11-insanely-sexualized-childrens-products/</a></p>

<p>The group heart progress are claiming they are “born this way” (does that sound familiar to anyone?) </p>

<p><a href="http://nickmartinezofficial.com/">http://nickmartinezofficial.com/</a></p>

<p>While studies remain “inconclusive” (ugh) on what causes pedophilia, there is no doubt that there are links between a person being sexual abused and becoming a pedophile later on. Here is an interesting study on the cycle of sexual abuse:</p>

<p><a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/179/6/482.full.pdf">http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/179/6/482.full.pdf</a></p>

<p>4) Polyamory: I am not here to tell you what to believe about polyamory, but it is definitely on the rise. Again, this would have definitely been a taboo many years ago:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160623-polyamorous-relationships-may-be-the-future-of-love">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160623-polyamorous-relationships-may-be-the-future-of-love</a></p>

<p>5) No More Slut Shaming: I am going to get shit for this one, but you definitely cannot call a woman a slut anymore, no matter what practices she engages in. All sexual acts are seen as “sex positive”, and to say a woman is being a slut is really bigotry:</p>

<p><a href="http://elitedaily.com/dating/pretending-care-about-sluts-mental-health/1563095/">http://elitedaily.com/dating/pretending-care-about-sluts-mental-health/1563095/</a></p>

<p>I subscribe to <a href="/r/sex">/r/sex</a>, and I see posts that are something like “I slept with 400 men and I cannot stop.”</p>

<p>The top comments are usually that she is okay, and that’s just part of sex positivity! Do not dare suggest that there might be something wrong with the poster (though sometimes people do speak out!</p>

<p>6) Drag Queens: I am not against drag queens or anything, so do not twist my words. However, I do feel slightly disturbed by this drag queen story hour for children:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/style/drag-queen-story-hour-puts-the-rainbow-in-reading.html</a></p>

<p>Here is an interesting note on drag queens:</p>

<p>“From the 1870s to the 1920s, pantomime began the rise of drag. As a way of mocking females, men would put on acts as if they were women, characterizing femininity. It was until the 20s to 30s period that the first LGBT bars and meeting places began to be created. Called the &#39;pansy craze,&#39; we begin to see the start of &#39;the gay bar,&#39; where homosexuals could meet each other, and drag performances were just one part of the entertainment.”
<a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/history-drag-queens">https://www.theodysseyonline.com/history-drag-queens</a></p>

<p>7) Masturbation: Before you send me a death threat, I think masturbation is normal and healthy. I do not think this video is, but you can be the judge...I am extremely annoyed because they removed the whole video, but that is probably because it was getting too much backlash. Here is part of it though:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0vPqxSVaG4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0vPqxSVaG4</a></p>

<p>I probably will get the most arguments about this one, but I just feel it is not an appropriate way to talk to your kids about masturbation. Yes, talk to them about it, but do so in a way that will not traumatize…and maybe not in a place where millions of people view it?</p>

<p>Speaking of youtube, I am sure most of you have seen the oversexualized Elsa and Spiderman videos, so I’m not even going to bother linking.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is NORMAL</strong></p>

<p>I could probably go on for pages about the amount of strange sexual taboos that are now being normalized, and even if they are not yet “normal”, we are being desensitized to them slowly. 
Now, I am not really here to debate the gender/sexuality stuff today (I write too much about it), but the question is, when does it stop? Ever hear of pansexuality?</p>

<p><a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/11/pansexuality-101/">http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/11/pansexuality-101/</a></p>

<p>Or the woman who married a train station?:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/woman-marries-train-station-shes-10499237">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/woman-marries-train-station-shes-10499237</a></p>

<p>Or the man who married his dog in a sunset ceremony? (lol the title):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html</a></p>

<p>(Oh yeah, I laughed, but do not forget they desensitize us through humor, too).</p>

<p>Or the people who identify as…non-human?:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvxgwa/from-dragons-to-foxes-the-otherkin-community-believes-you-can-be-whatever-you-want-to-be">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvxgwa/from-dragons-to-foxes-the-otherkin-community-believes-you-can-be-whatever-you-want-to-be</a></p>

<p>I can keep going and going, and I am ready for this argument:
“As long as it is not hurting anyone and it makes them happy, who cares?”</p>

<p><strong>The Happiness Argument</strong></p>

<p>That is the argument I get all of the time, and I feel it is completely flawed and dismissive. First of all, in the past, most of these things would have been seen as mental illness. When we dismiss that mental illness is a possibility here, we could definitely ultimately be taking away somebody’s potential for a ‘normal’ life – whatever that means anymore.</p>

<p>My mom has mental illness, and much of her life, that mental illness was normalized. When she was younger, her OCD and other strange habits were normalized by my family. Instead of getting help for some serious issues, her issues were dismissed as “she’s just neurotic.” No, she had mental illness, and she had the ability to be treated. Instead, she was left untreated, and she had a mental breakdown later in life. Interestingly, mental illness is definitely a stigmatized word in our society (how many times do people call you mentally ill on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?). Sadly, the stigma of mental illness is making us sicker:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201405/the-stigma-mental-illness-is-making-us-sicker">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201405/the-stigma-mental-illness-is-making-us-sicker</a></p>

<p>And, if I dare call any of these people mentally ill, you better believe I will be called a bigot and attacked.</p>

<p>Next, even if they may not be directly harming anyone, what if they are harming themselves in the long run? For example, when I write about the 3 or 4 year-olds identifying as the opposite sex, think about the repercussions of that. Even IF they do not do any sex hormone treatment (many still do!), they are making a life-long decision at 3 or 4 years old. Many claim that they can always change their mind later, but I do not think it is that easy if your entire identity is tied to it. Yet the biased media continues to only show the positive side of this transgendered youth, glorifying it in shows like “Jazz”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.papermag.com/jazz-jennings-pride-1880835224.html">http://www.papermag.com/jazz-jennings-pride-1880835224.html</a></p>

<p>I think the “happiness” argument is an “Oprah morality” argument. Oprah always talks about how all that really matters is happiness, and we should do whatever it takes to get to that happiness (do what thou wilt!). Other words for this are moral relativism, and of course, our favorite, cultural marxism.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I think there is more meaning to life than “just being happy”, and I feel that is deceptive in itself.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the conspiracy?</strong></p>

<p>Well, everybody reading this is probably already completely desensitized (just kidding!), but I do think there is a larger conspiracy here. First, to state the obvious, they are trying to normalize some serious taboos (even cannibalism!!), but WHY?
This is where I probably will have a lot of people disagree, but I honestly feel it is satanic. Even if you do not believe in Satan, many of these ruling-class elite people do. There are so many ties to satanic sexual ritual abuse and pedophilia, for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations</a></p>

<p>The <strong>modern</strong> “do what thou wilt” or “thelema” movement is really inspired by Aleister Crowley, a professed Satanist:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema</a></p>

<p>and it is extremely popular today! No matter what you really believe about him, he definitely had an agenda that reached the masses.</p>

<p>Think about the youngest generation growing up right now. By the time they are teenagers, they will have seen it all, and maybe, to them, pedophilia will not seem like a big deal. Maybe as the years progress, we will see more and more movements normalizing pedophilia, and when these young ones finally become adults, they will be able to fight for the equality of pedophiles. Maybe that sounds crazy to you, but I really do not think it is a ludicrous concept. </p>

<p>Of course, many will say that we <em>know</em> this, but I certainly do not hear any discussion on it in real life. Parents I seem today seem to allow their children to do almost anything, even run the household. In an effort to be liked by their children, many parents are dismissive of what the watch on tv or what they do in their free time (I can really expand on this if anyone is interested).</p>

<p>As always, it takes me a while to write these posts, and even if you do not agree with everything I say, then at least have the decency to discuss with me. Also, please do not attack me, but rather, let’s have a good discussion! I’m always willing to hear other viewpoints, but I do not like being attacked. Thank you! :)</p>

I&#39;m in my mid 20&#39;s and I&#39;m starting to have that protect the kids! Mentality. Exactly like you said the parents knew what was best they were kids once too. But we&#39;re to far gone now. All you can do is educate kids and help them separate fantasy from reality. Soon we&#39;ll be normalizing pedophilia and it&#39;ll be offensive if you keep your kids away from them because they have feelings to smh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to clarify something important: being a bit repulsed by twerking asses on TV, and constant glorification of hyper-sexuality in the corporate media/products, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re changing/becoming more conservative or prude or getting old.</p>

<p>The establishment TV/corporate media exercises divide and conquer tactics like identity politics (that even other parts of the world do not recognize because some of it&#39;s specifically American made propaganda)</p>

<p>Stereotype boxes they push: - The &quot;Liberal&quot;: a Democrat™® voter who is sexually liberated [BUT also a sexual deviant weirdo]. - The &quot;Conservative&quot;: a Republican™® voter who cares about traditional family values [BUT is a homophobic idiot]. - The &quot;Moderate&quot;: someone who may pick Pepsi OR Coca Cola (Dem/Repub). It&#39;s a corporate scam as usual. Independents need to speak up.</p>

<p>These stereotypes not only anger different groups of people and thus cause dumb infighting, (while elites maintain control) but it also promotes their Dem/Repub corporate brands (like Pepsi/Coca Cola). Essentially a false dichotomy. Both stereotypes are idiotic and a trap.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just one example of many people who are politically center left BUT:</p>

<p>-is not a feminist (I find humanism is more balanced/less biased and with less of an agenda attached) -prefer at least some traditional gender roles like feminine women, masculine men, (but if someone is naturally unwilling to match their gender due to different hormonal ratios, then they may behave that way even if society didn&#39;t push the &quot;men and women are exactly the same, express your feminine side dudes, go girl power, etc. etc.&quot; competitive shit rather than the idea that males/females are humanly complimentary with pros/cons/differences that should be celebrated as opposed to be being wiped out and turning us into proverbial clones or androgynous beings that compete for dominance/status/wages or whatever) To those people, I&#39;m not going to force them to change but I&#39;d encourage society to match their agenda more than they currently do (tend to push the opposite deliberately).</p>

<p>-I respect LGBT people like anyone else but disagree with pushing this propaganda: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UdGsNAi.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/UdGsNAi.jpg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not the trans part that is disgusting, it&#39;s the &quot;GENDER REVOLUTION&quot; part and confusing children that annoys me (if the child is so badly suffering gender dysphoria, they likely will raise the alarm bells without such manipulative campaigns). It&#39;s clearly an agenda IMO. Awareness of gender dysphoria should not be presented as a mass campaign like this but rather, be a more case-by-case approach.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to judge your prof, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in his mind/heart, but internet shills have made comments for years saying crap like &quot;I used to be a libtard liberal but then I grew up, and so will you dumbass millennials!!! -insert stupid Churchill quote- &quot; sarcastic comments are propaganda to push people away from pro-worker left wing ideologies and instead accept right wing pro-establishment ideologies. (What the alt right want, is actually pro-worker left center policies! I hope they wake up soon. :/ )</p>

<p>Being left wing or centrist doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically a feminist or &quot;check your white privelage&quot; divisive crap, or anti-business. These are nonsense assumptions the establishment want people to paint &quot;lefties&quot; with. (Which some lefties even fall for, hence a few voting for Clinton only because she&#39;s a woman or whatever. Nearly everyone is brainwashed in some way.)</p>

<p>The establishment has tried to rewrite what it means to be left wing in general and demonize a whole half of the political spectrum with lame stereotypes as I mentioned earlier. Left wing is generally about protecting the people/workers/the vulnerable (such as minorities/disabled/LGBT that could be bullied due to being different....but the establishment takes things too far, echoing stuff like &quot;check your white privelege&quot; which is also ignorance, just in the other extreme direction).</p>

<p>But the establishment&#39;s deranged NEOliberalism (which THEY falsely call &quot;liberalism&quot;) is nothing like leftism of any kind. It only sprinkles left wing concepts in a toxic concoction. I.e. feminism may be considered by some to be a twisting of the &quot;treating men and women with humanly respect&quot; into the toxic: &quot;hey men and women are the same or are you sexist!?&quot;</p>

<p>This is the deceptive establishment version of the spectrum, (Brand A) VS (Brand B): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png">http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s an absolute fabrication. There is NOTHING moderate about Democrat &quot;liberal&quot; (actually NEOliberal) politicians and Republican &quot;conservative&quot; (actually NEOconservative) politicians. These are corporate far right authoritarian puppets.</p>

<p>This is the real political spectrum: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png">http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png</a></p>

<p>Even then, U.S. spectrum is shifted a bit to the right, American military-corporatism has gotten this bad. On this specific graph, what&#39;s centrist in the U.S. is approx. center right in Europe! (And Europe is already mostly NEOliberal and emulating the warhawk NEOcon style of the U.S.)</p>

<p>Let alone the divide and conquer, the fascistic establishment (ultimate goal: NWO world slavery) wants people to hate all leftism. But that won&#39;t stop them using different pieces of the spectrum to trick people. If their policies are 95% NEOcon crap and 5% lefty stuff, you can be sure it&#39;s a scam. (Just an example.)</p>

<p>Hope this post makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long-time lurker here, but you inspired me to post a response. My attitude used to be the same as yours was, until I had children of my own. Then I did a complete 180.</p>

<p>Your post reminded of a story I read that Jake Roberts recounted. Can&#39;t remember the specifics, but it went something like this:</p>

<p>There was a soldier that was in combat. </p>

<p>He was walking through the battlefield and came across a local citizen that was killed. He freaked out because he had never seen a dead body before. </p>

<p>Soldier kept walking, and came across a couple that had been killed. He was very sad, but didn&#39;t freak out.</p>

<p>He kept walking and came across an entire family that had been killed. He was sad, but not as sad as when he saw the dead couple. </p>

<p>Finally he reached a village that had been wiped out. 50+ dead people laying on the ground. He had no response to this, and just kept walking. </p>

<p>The point is, the more you&#39;re exposed to certain things, the less response you have to it.  Which is why I have become more selective of the things my boys watch, because I don&#39;t want them to have a skewed view of what normal truly is. </p>

A well respected historian by the name of John Glubb identified a clear pattern in human societies that spans 6 distinct stages. Essentially, a hardy and enterprising people with strong morals, values, and traditions, gets gradually transformed into a decadent and gluttonous population in a matter of ten generations. This has, apparently, been consistently true all throughout human history. It might just be part of what makes us tick. </p>

And his persecution of the jews led many scientists to flee germany and move to america where they helped develop the atom bomb, and that would have been a true wonder weapon... why didnt he wait for his atom bomb before starting a war? I think he was a methed out pscyhopath that ruined germany and put the politcal pendulum in motion so that germans feel they have to accept more refugees than anyone else.

    <div class="md"><p>Look I dont support unsustainable immigration either, but that&#39;s not because I&#39;m racist or hate immigrants. Some of my best friends in school grew up in Iraq and Palestine. The point I&#39;m trying to make is that arguably Hitler&#39;s extreme policies led to extreme policies to get rid of the stigma around Germany. And you are wrong that nobody is thriving in a Liberal government. Are Millionaires in Scandinavia not millionaires? </p>

<p>But please don&#39;t even respond to the above statements because it doesn&#39;t matter what you think about that. What I want to know is that if history is so filled with lies and Hitler was so smart then why did he lose the war? Why did he open up two fronts? Why did he create an environment where leading nuclear scientists fled Germany? Why didn&#39;t he wait till his atomic bomb was ready? Why didn&#39;t he embrace the Stg-44 and his weapons designers had to &quot;sneak&quot; it into inventory as the Mp-43? Besides the obvious strategic blunders his war was unethical for the most part, and how can a person really convince them self that Hitler was in the right and that his decisions were sound? There is a reason that well respected Generals like Rommel wanted him DEAD! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just in Sweden. Stockholm is still nicer and &quot;feels&quot; safer than an average American city. But I agree that their immigration policies are unsustainable and will decrease their standard of living, which immigrants who are already there should care about just as much as the people who are native Swedes. </p>

<p>But anyway I will just take your lack of response to my arguments against Hitler as agreement because anyone with even the slightest amount of common sense knows he was a strategical retard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but this was something that Hitler was really focused on. It was termed &quot;entartete kunst&quot; or &quot;degenerate art&quot; and Hitler blamed the Jewish elites for promoting this sort of art. He saw it as an attack on the cultural norms and foundations of society.</p>

<p>But anyway, I agree that the real question is whether a discrete group is pushing this sort of degeneracy, and whether there is a purpose to it all. Hitler certainly had his ideas on this, but of course he isn&#39;t an authority whom it would be productive to look towards.</p>

<p>You believe it is Satanists or Luciferians elite. I think that is as good a guess as any, and that group could go by many names. I prefer to call them Zionists. The purpose, in my opinion, is to degrade and wipe away Christian European values, such as traditional gender roles, a nuclear family, and adherence to a moral compass, so that they can mold society into something that works towards their purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by well written, you mean displays a clear ignorance of what &quot;degenerate art&quot; was, then sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the most important criteria for the selection of works to be displayed in the exhibition were not aesthetic, but racial and political. Of the nine sections into which it was divided, only the first and the last were based on aesthetic criteria. The others pilloried the subjects chosen rather than the manner in which they were depicted. The first section covered ‘barbarism of representation’, ‘garish-coloured blobs of paint’ and ‘deliberate contempt for all the basic skills of the visual arts’. The second showed work deemed to be blasphemous, and the third political art advocating anarchism and the class struggle. A fourth section displayed paintings showing soldiers as murderers or, alternatively, as war cripples. According to the catalogue, in these pictures ‘the deeply ingrained respect for every soldierly virtue, for courage, bravery and readiness for action is to be driven out of the people’s consciousness’. A fifth section was devoted to immoral and pornographic art (most too disgusting to be shown, it was claimed). A sixth part of the exhibition showed the ‘destruction of the last remains of racial consciousness’ in pictures supposedly presenting negroes, prostitutes and the like as racial ideals. In a similar way, a seventh section was devoted to paintings and graphic works in which ‘the idiot, the cretin und the paraplegic’ were depicted in a positive light. Section eight was given over to the work of Jewish artists. The last and biggest section covered the ‘ “isms”, that Flechtheim, Wollheim and their Cohnsorts [sic] have hatched up, pushed and sold at knockdown prices over the years’, from Dadaism to Cubism and beyond. All of this, declared the catalogue, would show the public that modern art was not just a fad: Jews and cultural bolshevists were mounting a ‘planned attack on the existence and continuation of art altogether’. Five out of the brochure’s ten illustrated recto pages carried antisemitic messages just to underline the point.143 Modernist art, as many Nazi polemics of the time claimed, was above all the product of international, foreign influences. Art had to return to the German soul. As for modernism, one writer concluded with the fervent wish: ‘May the degenerate suffocate in its own filth, without anybody sympathizing with its fate.’</p>

<p>The exhibition was enormously popular and attracted over two million visitors by the end of November 1937. Entry was free, and massive press publicity drew people’s attention to the horrors it contained.145 The exhibits were, the papers proclaimed, ‘shoddy products of a melancholy age’, ‘ghosts of the past’, from the era when ‘bolshevism and dilettantism celebrated their triumphs’. Lurid descriptions and illustrations showed readers what they could expect to see when they went to the exhibition.146 In its first few weeks, at least, it was visited mainly by people from the Munich lower middle classes, many of whom had never been to an art exhibition before, and by the Party faithful, eager to imbibe a new form of antisemitic hatred. The stipulation that children and young persons were not to be allowed in because the exhibits were too shocking added an element of titillation to entice the eager public. Despite this, some young people did attend, among them the seventeen-year-old Peter Guenther, who went in July. The son of a liberal art journalist who had been expelled from the Reich Chamber of Literature in 1935, Guenther knew a fair amount about paintings. He found the atmosphere at the exhibition frightening and intimidating. The visitors, he reported later, commented loudly on how incompetently executed the works displayed were, and how there had been a conspiracy of art critics, dealers and museum directors to fool the public, a sentiment encouraged by the fact that a number of the exhibits had price tags attached to them indicating how much they had cost (‘paid from the pennies paid in tax by the German working people’). One painting by Erich Heckel came with a price-tag of a million Marks; the exhibitors did not say that this had been paid in 1923, towards the height of the hyperinflation, and was in fact worth very little in real terms. Some Party groups who visited the exhibition telegrammed the Propaganda Ministry with messages such as: ‘The artists should be tied up next to their pictures so that every German can spit in their faces.’ Carola Roth, a friend of the artist Max Beckmann, noted how while older visitors went round the exhibition shaking their heads, younger Party activists and brownshirts laughed and jeered at the exhibits. The atmosphere of hatred and loudmouthed ridicule allowed no dissent; indeed it was an essential part of the exhibition itself, turning it into yet another mass propaganda exercise for the regime. Later on, however, when young Peter Guenther paid a second visit, the atmosphere was, he reported, much quieter, with some visitors lingering in front of artworks they clearly enjoyed and which they had come to see for what they suspected might be the last time. Yet overall, the exhibition was clearly a success. Like much else in Nazi culture, it allowed ordinary conservative citizens the opportunity to voice out loud prejudices that they had long held but previously been hesitant to reveal.</p>

<p>Many of the artists whose work was on display were either foreigners, like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, or Oskar Kokoschka, or had emigrated, like Paul Klee or Vassily Kandinsky. But some of the artists who featured in the exhibition had stayed on in Germany, in the hope that the tide would turn and they would be rehabilitated. Max Beckmann, whose last solo exhibition had been as recently as 1936, in Hamburg, left for exile in Amsterdam the day after the opening of the Degenerate Art exhibition. Though far from well off, Beckmann was still painting. He was supported by sympathetic dealers and foreign admirers in the following, difficult years.148 Others were not so fortunate. 149 The Expressionist artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, who at this time, like Beckmann, was in his fifties, had already been living for most of the time in Switzerland since the 1920s, but he depended far more than Beckmann did on the German art market for his livelihood. Until 1937 he did not give up hope. But in July 1937 he was finally expelled from the Prussian Academy of Arts, and many of his works were confiscated from German collections by the Ziegler commission, which exhibited no fewer than thirty-two of them in the Degenerate Art show. Kirchner was already ill, and for some years he had lost his way as an artist, never really recapturing the greatness of his period in Berlin from 1910 to the mid- 1920s. For him this was the last straw. ‘I had always hoped that Hitler was for all Germans,’ he wrote bitterly, ‘and now he has defamed so many and really serious, good artists of German blood. This is very sad for those affected, because they - the serious ones among them - all wished to, and did, work for Germany’s fame and honour.’ A fresh round of confiscations of his work only deepened his despair. On 15 June 1938 he destroyed many of the works he kept in his rural retreat in Switzerland, stepped outside the house, and shot himself in the heart.</p>

<p>Changes on society are not made overnight. These things need to be poured into drops at time.. what shocks today will be common place in a generation or two.</p>

<p>The cycle of normalization is : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;X&quot;, is presented. Shocks the people. </p></li>
<li><p>Gets backfire as the common man&#39;s opinion pushes the narrative back</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;specialists&quot; propose a dialectic opposite pov to foment debate and try to pull the public opinion closer to the narrative</p></li>
<li><p>Media portraits X in a positive or sympathetic way</p></li>
<li><p>The academical establishment tries to envelop X on Science (so it can assume the status of unquestionable truth)</p></li>
<li><p>X is taught in schools, so the new generations assume its ok</p></li>
<li><p>States passes laws favoring X and punishing those that do not comply</p></li>
<li><p>Once X is normalized, the narrative is taken a step further, with a new shocking concept, Y, that will be presented, just to be normalized as X..</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I think yea, there&#39;s a science to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know I&#39;m too honest of a person myself to undestand how an event could confuse your sexuality. Maybe you are also pansexual like me? </p>

<p>Yeah, It&#39;s no surprising that the gender roles are getting mixed, feminism is breaking familiy apart and the government takes on the father role. I talked about it in my other post but education takes on a similar role to that of MK ULTRA in order to brainwash students.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was exposed to too much sexual stuff at an early age. My parents let me watch literally anything on tv.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also suspicious I was sexually abused at an early age. I would have no way of ever knowing for sure, but I was hypersexual as a little girl (beyond normal!) And I hated men irrationally.</p>

<p>Then in my teens I experimented with my best friend, and it felt good, so since that was my first sexual experience, I wonder if it messed with me in some way?</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to this if anybody is interested. Haha</p>

<p>But I identify as straight...just I do have bisexual tendencies. But I am definitely 100% sexually attracted to men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good post. Honestly, I think that although a conspiracy here is possible in some way, overall the system we&#39;re in would have led to this inevitably. When people have a direct interest in selling things to people and profiting from selling more, they will tend to take steps to do so maximally, and the edgier people in each field (business, banking, etc.) will do it the most, and push for helpful legislation. And it turns out that the best way to sell irrelevant things to people is to screw with their brains, make them scared and insecure, and feeling the addicted sense of craving that can&#39;t be satisfied. Then people get their claws in government and it becomes corrupted along with them in the money train.</p>

<p>In the end the public&#39;s sense of self is eroded, and deep down people know something is wrong but cannot trace a villain and so are led to make villains of each other. Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t require an engineered conspiracy to achieve this result, just a good long time of moving in the same direction with the great god Money driving it all. I think this is a product of capitalism, not of overt Satanism, but as you say, Thelema seems to be a very good fit for laissez-faire society since both are founded on &quot;do what thou wilt.&quot; But there could be legitimate conspiracies involved as well, of course, but maybe within certain sectors. People in the military sector definitely conspire with politicians, and the same with oil. Bankers certain do (and probably must) conspire with each other. But what I&#39;m not sure about is whether there is a unified conspiracy that manages any of this from the top-down. I suspect not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some scriptures related to pursing or loving money. In some ways, Christianity is saying it&#39;s Satanism (the love of money), or at the very least, it&#39;s not of God and pushes people away from God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in Christianity the love of anything that isn&#39;t God is essentially idolatry, which we could argue is simply Satanism in a sense. My point was that for most it&#39;s probably inadvertent, in that they don&#39;t knowingly serve anything but themselves, but you&#39;re right that objectively a love of money can perhaps be summarized as being Satanism by any other name.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>in that they don&#39;t knowingly serve anything but themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some ways that is again in alignment with the Church of Satanism. Religious scholars have had this critique of LaVeyan Satanism (from wiki):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine described LaVeyan Satanism as having &quot;both elitist and anarchist elements&quot;, also citing one occult bookshop owner who referred to the Church&#39;s approach as &quot;anarchistic hedonism&quot;. In their study of Satanism, the religious studies scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen suggested that LaVey viewed his religion as &quot;an antinomian self-religion for productive misfits, with a cynically carnivalesque take on life, and no supernaturalism&quot;. The sociologist of religion James R. Lewis even described LaVeyan Satanism as &quot;a blend of Epicureanism and Ayn Rand&#39;s philosophy, flavored with a pinch of ritual magic.&quot; The historian of religion Mattias Gardell described LaVey&#39;s as &quot;a rational ideology of egoistic hedonism and self-preservation&quot;, while Nevill Drury characterised LaVeyan Satanism as &quot;a religion of self-indulgence&quot;. It has also been described as an &quot;institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A book of interest that I think relates to this is Ayn Rand&#39;s Virtue of Selfishness where she argues a rational defense of Selfishness and self-preservation as a sort of moral imperative. In some ways Satanism takes this idea and pushes it to its limits, always valuing the individual over the majority. It&#39;s rather anti-egalitarian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought about this quite a bit, and I believe you are both right and wrong in your final analysis.  </p>

<p>There are among the global elite a cabal of extremely religious Christians.  Their goal is to fulfill Biblical prophecy in order to ascend to heaven during the rapture.  In order to do this, they understand that they have to drive society to the point where the majority live in, and accept, abject sin.</p>

<p>They are not Satanists, or Luciferians.  They are in fact the very opposite.  </p>

<p>An awful lot of what happens both culturally and militarily around the world is driven by this desire to create the situation required by the Bible for the fulfillment of the Prophecy that leads to Armageddon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They (think they) are extremely devout Christians, and they believe they are helping people by bringing about the end times.  They believe the only way to free humanity from Satan is to speed up the clock, so to speak.  In order to accomplish this, they engineer events in the hopes that they can trigger the necessary groundwork for the fulfillment of the Prophecies that supposedly lead to the return of Christ and the &quot;End Times&quot;.</p>

<p>Much of it is done <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2009/aug/10/religion-george-bush">completely in the open</a> without any effort to hide or obfuscate it.  Obviously, other tactics must be used in social engineering situation like you describe.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not religious, but I believe there is <em>something</em> going on, and there is much historical truth to be gleaned from religious scripture.  I think there may indeed exist an intelligent force that is &quot;evil&quot; and bent towards the destruction of &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that many elites may have somehow communicated with something that has deceived them,  something that has presented itself as God or a god and blinded them with wealth and power and even perhaps promised them it could grant them <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9606/22/hillary.book/">abilities beyond human</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, asking you to name of one of these elite Christians and asking your religion is extremely &quot;aggressive&quot;. Do you react this way to every question you are asked? Is every question an assault on your person? </p>

<p>I believe in full disclosure. If you are going to claim there is a Christian conspiracy or that the elites are Christian, you should be able to stand up to a couple of questions asking you what religion you are and to name of couple of these elite Christian conspirators. </p>

<p>This is because you have nothing. What you are saying is crap and when given the opportunity to elaborate, you demure and claim your questioner is &quot;aggressive&quot;. Pathetic.</p>

<p><strong>Normalization and desensitization</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>on that note, have you ever read <a href="http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm">this</a>? to quote the first two paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first order of business is desensitization of the American public concerning gays and gay rights. To desensitize the public is to help it view homosexuality with indifference instead of with keen emotion. Ideally, we would have straights register differences in sexual preference the way they register different tastes for ice cream or sports games: she likes strawberry and I like vanilla; he follows baseball and I follow football. No big deal.</p>

<p>At least in the beginning, we are seeking public desensitization and nothing more. We do not need and cannot expect a full &quot;appreciation&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; of homosexuality from the average American. You can forget about trying to persuade the masses that homosexuality is a good thing. But if only you can get them to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders, then your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won. And to get to shoulder-shrug stage, gays as a class must cease to appear mysterious, alien, loathsome and contrary. A large-scale media campaign will be required in order to change the image of gays in America. And any campaign to accomplish this turnaround should do six things.</p>

<p>here&#39;s one representative example from the text you -- for whatever reason -- refuse to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A media campaign to promote the Gay Victim image should make use of symbols which reduce the mainstream&#39;s sense of threat, which lower it&#39;s guard, and which enhance the plausibility of victimization. In practical terms, this means that jaunty mustachioed musclemen would keep very low profile in gay commercials and other public presentations, while sympathetic figures of nice young people, old people, and attractive women would be featured. (It almost goes without saying that groups on the farthest margin of acceptability such as NAMBLA, [Ed note -- North American Man-Boy Love Association] must play no part at all in such a campaign: suspected child-molesters will never look like victims.)</p>

<p>the authors (both of whom were practicing homosexuals) also had no moral, religious, or personal objections to homosexuality. if you want to know what the unsightly derriere represents in this context, you could try reading the full text, reading <a href="https://www.advocate.com/health/2014/07/22/shocking-increase-hiv-infection-rate-among-young-gay-bi-men">a plethora of related material</a>, or just going to a gay pride parade in a major city. it seems that, for you, the entire thing is an abstract social issue -- score one for the authors, i guess.</p>

<p>As you said, these things &#39;correlate&#39;. I also don&#39;t have any problems with divorce, abortion, recreational sex or pornography. These could all correlate because they represent a progression of social mores, or a movement away from what some would call traditional values, and others would call puritan. </p>

<p>No one has ever been able to demonstrate how any of these things are objectively bad, just that they don&#39;t like them.</p>

<p>This is not a divide that you and I are likely to cross in this conversation. You probably see my viewpoint as degenerate and eroding the values you hold dear, and I probably would find your mores antiquated and prejudiced. I&#39;m not convinced there&#39;s anything to gain by discussing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are already some great comments here, so I will just throw out a few observations from the post.</p>

<p>There are 2 main theories to how history plays out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What we are seeing is an organic process which mostly repeats itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Society is being guided by those with inside knowledge. The idea that people without power would not collude and withhold information from those without power is a very childish way to think about human behavior. They have, do and will continue.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>One of the main drivers is to control the education system so nearly every generation is starting out on their own. A thought to ponder, when they say our generation &quot;Stands on the shoulders of giants&quot; they are referring to the big thinkers and inventors that came before us. But the giants shoulders&#39; we should be standing upon are those of our ancestors, parents and grandparents. Imagine the advantage that one generation that teaches the lessons of their life gives their kids over the majority of people who let the school curriculum do that for them....</p>

<p>The Freud/Bernays/Lippmann analysis of human behavior was groundbreaking in the subject to how to control a population. </p>

<p>I think they have found the magic formula for desensitization, make sure the message is delivered by a likable personality. They get us to root for the bearJew in Inglorious Bastards to beat the Nazi to death with his baseball bat, or Denzel Washington to kill a room full of Russians because they happened to be drinking vodka with the bad guy. Do not worry, they all had it coming because the wronged our charismatic star. All of this leads to desensitization, as you mentioned. </p>

<p>Desensitization is necessary for control. That is what it is all about, control. Religion was the backstop. It was the thing that allowed generational knowledge to be passed on. It was the moral compass that taught right from wrong. It was easy enough to kill, every generation thinks the last one is a bunch of idiots. I remember coming home from college the first time and lecturing the adults on how ignorant they were. </p>

<p>There is really nothing to talk about in terms of what is happening because you laid it out so well. It is not even a point of discussion to talk about if it is happening. It is. I do however, see a silver lining.</p>

<p>The population is becoming so dumbed down and desensitized that there will be blow-back. Right now anyone who offers inter-generational knowledge to their children will be so far ahead of the game that their kids will appear super-human. When the blow-back happens and the like minded congregate to form groups, those children will be the leaders.</p>

<p>R. Joseph said: Come and hear! A maiden aged three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition [intercourse], and if her deceased husband&#39;s brother cohabits with her, she becomes his. The penalty of adultery may be incurred through her; [if a niddah] she defiles him who has connection with her, so that he in turn defiles that upon which he lies, as a garment which has lain upon [a person afflicted with gonorrhoea]. (Sanhedrin 55b)</p>

<p>Rab said: Pederasty with a child below nine years of age is not deemed as pederasty with a child above that. Samuel said: Pederasty with a child below three years is not treated as with a child above that.24 (24) I.e., Rab makes nine years the minimum; but if one committed sodomy with a child of lesser age, no guilt is incurred. Samuel makes three the minimum. (Sanhedrin 54b)</p>

<p>A woman who had intercourse with a beast is eligible to marry a Jewish priest. A woman who has sex with a demon is also eligible to marry a Jewish priest.(Yebamoth 59b.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I was a huge gay rights supporter most of my life. I pushed for Gay Marriage and hated Conservatives from 2000 to around 2012/2013 because they wouldn&#39;t support Gay Marriage. But now I think they might have been right. Every married Gay Couple I know still does drugs and has sex with everything with a pulse. Men have been have sex with other Men and Women have been having Sex with other Women since the dawn of time. It was just always done in secret and almost always for fun. Many people who identify as &quot;straight&quot; still do it. I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with that. But I&#39;m starting to think it was meant to remain taboo. A &quot;Gay Lifestyle&quot; is a ticket to unhappiness for most people with those feelings. You can&#39;t though question it all in our society with out being abused and mocked though. It&#39;s pushed non-stop and can&#39;t ever be questioned.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really sad. I don&#39;t personally think it&#39;s as bad as you stated because I know plenty of happy, healthy gay couples and I know for a fact that there&#39;s nothing more I want in life than a happy family as a young gay adult, BUT I do agree that the drug / fetish / sex - craze is still a really big and actually quite disgusting issue in our community. That&#39;s why I refuse to be part of the LGBT community, I just exist by myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean for it to come off that way. I was trying to make 2 points. 1- Not everyone who has Gay feelings should live a Gay lifestyle. I think maybe some people would be happier marrying someone of the opposite sex or remaining single. 2 - There needs to be a discussion about the amount of Married Gay Men still screwing around after their married. When I was Supporting Gay Marriage I assumed it would be the same as straight marriages and people would settle down and at least pretend to be monogamous after they got married. But society won&#39;t even let us discuss this trend.</p>

Hall had a lot to say about this. &quot;The only way to rise from illusion toward the truth is to replace what has been removed, and that is our ability to care&quot;. It&#39;s true. Lack of empathy and the ability to care is arguably the number one problem that we must overcome if we are to survive as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to clarify something important:
being a bit repulsed by twerking asses on TV,
and constant glorification of hyper-sexuality in the corporate media/products,
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re changing/becoming more conservative or prude or getting old.</p>

<p>The establishment TV/corporate media exercises divide and conquer tactics like
identity politics (that even other parts of the world do not recognize because some of it&#39;s specifically American made propaganda)</p>

<p>Stereotype boxes they push:
- The &quot;Liberal&quot;: a Democrat™® voter who is sexually liberated [BUT also a sexual deviant weirdo].
- The &quot;Conservative&quot;: a Republican™® voter who cares about traditional family values [BUT is a homophobic idiot].
- The &quot;Moderate&quot;: someone who may pick Pepsi OR Coca Cola (Dem/Repub).
It&#39;s a corporate scam as usual.
Independents need to speak up.</p>

<p>These stereotypes not only anger different groups of people and thus cause dumb infighting, (while elites maintain control)
but it also promotes their Dem/Repub corporate brands (like Pepsi/Coca Cola).
Essentially a false dichotomy.
Both stereotypes are idiotic and a trap.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just one example of many people who are politically center left BUT:</p>

<p>-is not a feminist (I find humanism is more balanced/less biased and with less of an agenda attached)
-prefer at least some traditional gender roles like feminine women, masculine men, (but if someone is naturally unwilling to match their gender due to different hormonal ratios, then they may behave that way
even if society didn&#39;t push the &quot;men and women are exactly the same, express your feminine side dudes, go girl power, etc. etc.&quot; competitive shit
rather than the idea that males/females are humanly complimentary with pros/cons/differences that should be celebrated as opposed to be being wiped out and turning us into proverbial clones or androgynous beings that compete for dominance/status/wages or whatever)
To those people, I&#39;m not going to force them to change but I&#39;d encourage society to match their agenda
more than they currently do (tend to push the opposite deliberately).</p>

<p>-I respect LGBT people like anyone else but disagree with pushing this propaganda:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/UdGsNAi.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/UdGsNAi.jpg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not the trans part that is disgusting,
it&#39;s the &quot;GENDER REVOLUTION&quot; part and confusing children
that annoys me (if the child is so badly suffering gender dysphoria, they likely will raise the alarm bells without such manipulative campaigns).
It&#39;s clearly an agenda IMO.
Awareness of gender dysphoria should not be presented as a mass campaign like this
but rather, be a more case-by-case approach.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to judge your prof, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in his mind/heart,
but internet shills have made comments for years saying crap like
&quot;I used to be a libtard liberal but then I grew up, and so will you dumbass millennials!!! <strong>-insert stupid Churchill quote-</strong> &quot;
sarcastic comments are propaganda to push people away from pro-worker left wing ideologies
and instead accept right wing pro-establishment ideologies.
(What the alt right want, is actually pro-worker left center policies! I hope they wake up soon. :/ )</p>

<p>Being left wing or centrist doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re automatically a feminist
or &quot;check your white privelage&quot; divisive crap, or anti-business.
These are nonsense assumptions the establishment want people
to paint &quot;lefties&quot; with. (Which some lefties even fall for, hence a few voting for Clinton only
because she&#39;s a woman or whatever. Nearly everyone is brainwashed in some way.)</p>

<p>The establishment has tried to rewrite what it means to be
left wing in general and demonize a whole half of the political spectrum with lame stereotypes as I mentioned earlier.
Left wing is generally about protecting the people/workers/the vulnerable (such as minorities/disabled/LGBT that could be bullied due to
being different....but the establishment takes things too far, echoing stuff like &quot;check your white privelege&quot; which is also ignorance,
just in the other extreme direction).</p>

<p>But the establishment&#39;s deranged NEOliberalism (which THEY falsely call &quot;liberalism&quot;) is nothing
like leftism of any kind. It only sprinkles left wing concepts in a toxic concoction.
I.e. feminism may be considered by some to be a twisting of the &quot;treating men and women with humanly respect&quot;
into the toxic: &quot;hey men and women are the same or are you sexist!?&quot;</p>

<p>This is the deceptive establishment version of the spectrum, (Brand A) VS (Brand B):
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png">http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s an absolute fabrication. There is NOTHING moderate about
Democrat &quot;liberal&quot; (actually NEOliberal) politicians
and Republican &quot;conservative&quot; (actually NEOconservative) politicians.
These are corporate far right authoritarian puppets.</p>

<p>This is the real political spectrum:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png">http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png</a></p>

<p>Even then, U.S. spectrum is shifted a bit to the right, American military-corporatism has gotten this bad.
On this specific graph, what&#39;s centrist in the U.S. is approx. center right in Europe!
(And Europe is already mostly NEOliberal and emulating the warhawk NEOcon style of the U.S.)</p>

<p>Let alone the divide and conquer, the fascistic establishment (ultimate goal: NWO world slavery)
wants people to hate all leftism.
But that won&#39;t stop them using different pieces of the spectrum
to trick people.
If their policies are 95% NEOcon crap and 5% lefty stuff,
you can be sure it&#39;s a scam. (Just an example.)</p>

<p>Hope this post makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Cultural Marxists at The Frankfurt School hated hollywood:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The enjoyment of the violence suffered by the movie character turns into violence against the spectator, and distraction into exertion. Nothing that the experts have devised as a stimulant must escape the weary eye; no stupidity is allowed in the face of all the trickery; one has to follow everything and even display the smart responses shown and recommended in the film. This raises the question whether the culture industry fulfils the function of diverting minds which it boasts about so loudly. If most of the radio stations and movie theatres were closed down, the consumers would probably not lose so very much. To walk from the street into the movie theatre is no longer to enter a world of dream; as soon as the very existence of these institutions no longer made it obligatory to use them, there would be no great urge to do so. Such closures would not be reactionary machine wrecking. The disappointment would be felt not so much by the enthusiasts as by the slow-witted, who are the ones who suffer for everything anyhow. In spite of the films which are intended to complete her integration, the housewife finds in the darkness of the movie theatre a place of refuge where she can sit for a few hours with nobody watching, just as she used to look out of the window when there were still homes and rest in the evening. The unemployed in the great cities find coolness in summer and warmth in winter in these temperature-controlled locations. Otherwise, despite its size, this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger. -Theodor Adorno</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divorce became more common because marriage became less imperative to survival.  The reason it was shamed for a long time is because people who divorced had a lot harder time getting along in society and would become dependant on relatives and their community as a whole.  It made sense for parents to instill the fear of that stigma in their children because divorcees actually harmed their societies and parents don&#39;t generally want their children to be a detriment to society both because they depend on a strong society and because they want their children to be safe from the disadvantages that come from being seen as a threat to society; which can be rather damaging to their prosperity.  </p>

<p>Now things  have changed.  Resources are more plentiful due to technological advances and having children out of wedlock is less of a danger because of birth control, more effective condoms/spermicides, morning after pills, etc.  There are now far more living wage careers for women so they are more self sufficient.  So now we don&#39;t care so much about marriage as we do about people not irresponsibly having too many children.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this was a really interesting post, thank you. I think about this general topic a lot. my fetish is a part of BDSM (it&#39;s DDLG, daddy dom little girl) - I always question myself and where it originated for me / question if our society has normalized it etc. I definitely think DDLG has become more &#39;popular&#39; in recent years because of artists like Lana Del Rey and the whole &quot;daddy&quot; trend. I think it&#39;s good to always question even your own interests, beliefs, etc. again, thanks for this post! I enjoyed reading it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, read it a couple days ago and wanted to comment about &quot;BoJack Horseman,&quot; one of my favorite shows, but didn&#39;t have the time.</p>

<p>IMHO &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; is one of the most effective examples of subversive content on television. It&#39;s REALLY smart and funny and actually has a lot of positive messages mixed in with its overall society-undermining themes.</p>

<p>You mention the innate bestiality that comes with a show about animals and humans living together, and I&#39;ve certainly recognized that. But how about the pedophilia? In Seasons 1&amp;2, the cat agent Princess Carolyn is dating &quot;Vincent Adultman,&quot; who is obviously a young boy--Bojack notices it, but nobody else seems to. 
<a href="http://bojackhorseman.wikia.com/wiki/Vincent_Adultman">http://bojackhorseman.wikia.com/wiki/Vincent_Adultman</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a hilarious subplot, and the show is so effective, I&#39;m willing to go along with it. Same way I do with the bestiality. It&#39;s absurd, it&#39;s a cartoon, and yet....the subtext is softening, ever so subtly, the taboo of sex with animals and sex with children. </p>

<p>The abortion episode, too, is absolutely hilarious, yet completely subversive. Not only culturally, but to the SHOW ITSELF. On one hand, the rolling message the series carries is how show biz is bullshit, we shouldn&#39;t listen to what celebrities say because they&#39;re shallow and self-obsessed, yet the takeaway from that specific episode is that the casual mockery of porpoise pop star Sextina Aquafina about her abortion helps give courage to &quot;common&quot; young women who are intimidated culturally by the process of getting an abortion. </p>

<p>The Federalist did a great job deconstructing the episode on exactly those terms (and others) here: <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/03/bojack-horseman-shows-why-art-about-abortion-is-failing/">http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/03/bojack-horseman-shows-why-art-about-abortion-is-failing/</a></p>

<p>Most television and films have become very easy to shoot down in their political and societal manipulation of luciferian / satanic ideals to undermine the backbone of the nation and society, but &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; has deftly been promoting them through some extremely effective and emotionally resonant writing and voice acting. </p>

<p>&quot;Rick &amp; Morty&quot; is another very smart animated series that does this, though less effectively so far this season. Even though there&#39;s only been two episodes so far, we&#39;ve seen several boxes checked off on the luciferian agenda:
1- Breakdown of the family unit, as Marty&#39;s parents get divorced</p>

<p>2- Undermining and mockery of paternal authority, with Marty&#39;s dad carrying the majority of abuse</p>

<p>3- Cannibalism </p>

<p>4- Significant increase in the use of &quot;J3sus Chr!st&quot; as a profanity.</p>

<p>I very much enjoy your posts and wanted to weigh in, especially about &quot;BoJack Horseman,&quot; which is undeniably a great television series, but is so great that it makes me not even much mind themes and context that would otherwise offend me. That&#39;s about as subversive as things get. </p>

<p>Have a great Sunday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was exposed to too much sexual stuff at an early age. My parents let me watch literally anything on tv.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also suspicious I was sexually abused at an early age. I would have no way of ever knowing for sure, but I was hypersexual as a little girl (beyond normal!) And I hated men irrationally.</p>

<p>Then in my teens I experimented with my best friend, and it felt good, so since that was my first sexual experience, I wonder if it messed with me in some way?</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to this if anybody is interested. Haha</p>

<p>But I identify as straight...just I do have bisexual tendencies. But I am definitely 100% sexually attracted to men.</p>
