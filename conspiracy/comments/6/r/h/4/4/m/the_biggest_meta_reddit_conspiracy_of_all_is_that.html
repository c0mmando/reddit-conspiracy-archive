       edit: isn't it amazing how a subreddit accused of being a "Pro Donald Trump" subreddit constantly has comment sections where everyone not creating a r/politics atmosphere gets gang-downvoted.

      <p>
       In what bizarre universe is that the behavior of a "Pro Donald Trump" subreddit?

       I left the US and have been traveling the world for the last 10 years working from my computer. I spent many years living in countries where the "news" was on but I couldn't understand since it was in a foreign language.

      <p>
       Its extremely hypocritical to hold up "the Russians" as some kind of cartoon villain we are righteously fighting when the US is just as evil and arguably a lot more effective at being evil simply due to the nature of our military and world influence.

       I'm not one to advocate killing, but yes, this. Putin is bad, but he's no worse than Bush, Obama, Clinton, or Trump, for example. They're all dirty oligarchs and they're all guilty of crimes against humanity.

       Its very obvious that a common tactic is now:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) dig through users history

      <p>
       2) look for anything about Trump or Russia

       3) accuse OP of being from "t_d" or "being paid by Putin"

       4) get your accusal comment gang-upvoted to the top by the silent "majority" that always happens to be around to upvote anything that diminishes from what the thread is actually about

       It is interesting that you are both clearly frustrated with being called shills all the time. Maybe you are both just two real people who have differing views.

       All I have to say is thank god for Reddit Enhancement suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're tagged as "Too Obvious" - which you've been tagged as for about two months (the age of your account) as you appear in every thread that goes against your talking points, saying stupid shit like the comment above.
      </p>
      <p>
       14,000 karma in two months while almost exclusively just making hyper-partisan, shitty political talking points that contribute nothing. Just attack attack attack while whining as if you somehow are a victim - as if you're anything besides a cancer to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate how people like you have turned every single god damn discussion here into a partisan mockery. I'm anti-Trump, anti-Clinton, anti-alphabet agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a partisan hack and nothing more. Zero contributions besides smears against anyone who doesn't play for your political team. I hope more people on this sub start to call people like you out, because the teaming up that you and your ...similarly minded cohorts do to bully and slide threads is really turning this into a useless sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which I assume is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything with you people is a goddamn blatant manipulation.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I thought this was a conspiracy sub but you're not focusing on this conspiracy I demand you focus on!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Shit like that, everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be so bad if you all did what the TrumpRussiaConspiracy (or whatever it is) user did and show that you only care about one single thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just stop pretending you're anything but a partisan attack dog. Make the stupid, shitty comments you make, there's no rule against it. But please stop pretending that you're anything besides a partisan tool.

       Most people who voted for Trump were trying to keep Clinton from winning. The excited supporters don't represent actual Trump voters any more than the obvious shills represent the people who voted for Clinton just trying to stop Trump from winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump voters know Trump is bad for the most part. They weren't fooled into thinking he was good. They were just trying to stop someone they identified as being much worse. Same as the people fooled into going for Clinton.

       Yep. There are some bot comments, but they're usually pretty obvious. In my experience, they usually post copy-pastes of snippets of old posts, so they'll be talking about things that might be "on-topic", but their comment will be a complete non-sequitur. I think most of the bot comments are done to build up karma on accounts that will be sold later, so they don't really care if the users seeing the comments know it's bullshit.

       I would be satisfied with any answer at all that took a stance and had reason to back it up. I really will listen if you got something. It isn't that it has to be yes, it's just that there should be something some where tickling the back of your neck saying, "what if just one part of this is wrong?".

       How about this. What if Seth was the leaker? It still doesnt mean he was killed bt the DNC. A botched robbery still makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it doesnt stop the Trump russia collusion story. Donald Jr admitted he met with a Russian lawyer to get dirt on Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so fucking sad to see this murder exploited just as an attempt to kill a story, when logically it doesnt. Seth may or may not have been the leaker. It doesnt change the fact that Team Trump colluded with Russia.

       So now, ask what makes more sense to cover up? Trump administration trying to use a random botched robbery as a last ditch effort to shake a Russia investigation that produced no proof of collusion. Or a guy tried to leak info proving that the dnc was literally stealing the nomination from Bernie?

       "Literally stealing."  So now you're saying the DNC changed the votes?  Or maybe the simpler answer is, the DNC nominated the candidate with the best chance to win the general.  You think they picked Hillary and didn't care if they lost?  That makes no sense.

       The info was already leaked before he was killed as far as I know, so I see no reason to kill him to stop a leak that already happened.

       really so never saw the podesta email that said make "an example of leakers" ? Jesus use some critical thinking. He only leaked once, better not punish him cause it already happened hurr durr. Like thats your thought process on this? Cmon at least try.

       The info that was leaked was not damning enough to kill any body over. A botched hit would do actual damage. The leaked info was just embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       so let me get this timeline down. Emails get leaked, in those emails is an email that says "lets get this leaker". So Podesta knew that they had a person stealing emails and then sends another incriminating one, or he sent this before the emails were stolen and leaked, but somehow he knew this was about to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       You tell me to think critically but you think podestas leaked email is proof he wanted to kill the person that leaked said email.

       That's fair. I don't mean to say that there won't be any proof of collusion with Russia and trump, but just that there isn't much of anything at all after this long investigation. I don't understand which investigation was just getting started?
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as why to kill the leaker, that's a much bigger bite to take that doesn't make sense to throw into our talk right now. It is a part of the puzzle that takes a hard turn, but in on of the emails that was leaked, podesta is basically calling for an example to be made out of leakers.

       Just cause Fox trying to use it to kill the Russia story that doesnt mean it's not true. Anyone capable of logic is able to think of each case independently, and I think most Americans dont care that Trump Jr. was trying to get dirt on Clinton even if it was from a Russian source cause they hate Clinton soooo much. And the pee-pee dossier was from a Russian source but libs loved that shit. They say that Donnie Jr. should have gone to the FBI but that's a little silly because it is risky to go to the neo-liberal stablishment with dirt on the neo-libtard stablishment, so I think most people sympathize with donnie jr. Laws are like general guide lines but I would be willing to be most people have broken a law at some point in their life and if the intentions behind the perceived crime were just then I feel like most Americans would give him some grace.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, IT DOES kill the narrative that Russian hackers leaked the DNC stuff. Although ofc Russian hackers might have leaked plenty of other things, but it makes the neo-liberal establishment look pretty bad because they have been ranting and raving about "muh russia" so much and how it's unforgivable to accept information about corruption if it is from dirty russians even though for us measly voters knowing about corruption from any source is good.

       It does however, make what the intelligence agencies have said a complete fabrication and the "Russian hacking" narrative 100% false. If Seth is the leaker a MASSIVE amount of what you call "news" would be immediately proven 100% WRONG (FAKE NEWS) and yet the Resistance crowd would still hop on the next Russia narrative as if nothing happened. Isn't that dangerous?

       Its does not make any narrative 100% false. Stop trying to connect the dots like that. Look for actual evidence. It is certainly possible for Russians to have hacked the DNC, and for them to have a leaker.

       One does not negate the other. Its possible that they both could have happened. Like they could be two totally separate things. The Russians wanted to influence our elections, that much is pretty obvious. And the DNC could have had a leaker.

       Have you been paying attention? The entire argument that is the basis of the Russia narrative is that Russia hacked the DNC (apparently that somehow is the equivalent of the "election" explain to me that) and send these emails to Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Seth Rich send the emails to Wikileaks, then immediately the media and the intelligence communities claims are immediately proven 100% lies as Russia did not and therefore Russia did not influence the election in any way.

       Russia wanting to influence our elections is what this is all about. They are alleged to have hacked the DNC to steal the emails. The right wing media turned the Seth Rich murder into a conspiracy to deflect from this.

      <p>
       No, you cannot use assumed intention as evidence that's not how this works. Alleged means exactly that allegedly, it's on YOU to prove that it happened an evidence has to be hard and definitive and there is NONE of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you do realize that Seth Rich was popular well before Fox News made a story on it... The reality is that Fox news didn't turn it into a conspiracy, they turned it into a partisan argument where you can create this straw-man "right-wing conspiracy theory" to try and discredit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't even matter if Seth was murdered or not, if he was the leaker the Russian story is null and void.

       Why do you guys keep going around in circles about this? He cant officially give up his source so he is doing everything BUT. Do you understand how if he gave up Rich that might hurt other people? Someone who has released hundreds of thousands of docs which have ALL been proven to be legitimate cant even be trusted WITH THIS? How is his record not impeachable? Not one false document? Why cant you trust a guy that has such a good record? You understand that if he gave up rich that could implicate other people? He is asking his audience to trust him on this one without proof because he doesnt want anyone else to get murdered. How fucking dense do you have to be to not see that?

       You can always do what I do. Post reply comments exposing their bullshit frequently, but also just block all of them you see. If they're not posting in good faith, then I have no reason to allow their stuff to hit my eyeballs. You'll lose any comment threads below the trolls, so don't do this if you actually like reading the troll arguments that follow, but I don't mind that personally. I've got dozens and dozens blocked by now and sometimes when I notice a lot of comments missing, I log out and see what I'm missing out on, and I've never regretted it yet.

       All this does is push out the people who want actual discussion. Contest mode is made for contests, not for stifling conversations.

       Oh please, contest mode is literally designed to turn comment sections into randomized messes. What do you think the CONTEST in contest mode is? It absolutely stifles discussions and reduces people's ability to comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have such a problem with astroturfing then you should be against contest mode. Randomized top-level comments mean it's even easier for astroturfers to cover a thread. Now all they have to do is leave top level comments and they're automatically granted the chance to be the first comments to show up.

       That's not the only way to combat it. You also have to use your words to offer a rational alternative to the bullshit. Astroturf isn't just to demoralize you, it's to shift the world view of the majority of users who are only lurking.

       Once in a while, when something big happens(that I assume throws off someone's game), this sub becomes sane again for about 12-24 hours, then it's back to this. Right now it's all (some clickbait)links &amp; shitposts/memes(that
       <strong>
        <em>
         never
        </em>
       </strong>
       get removed, despite the rules clearly stating "No memes/images posts".) and no users posts - minimum effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once in a while, for 12-24 hours,
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       people make user posts that make it to the top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , discussing the esoteric, Antarctica, lost technology, ancient civilizations, holographic universe, the fed, that whole lot,
       <strong>
        <em>
         and it never lasts until the next day
        </em>
       </strong>
       . It's like somebody pressed a button to turn off the horde of bots waiting for the game plan and the next day it's back on again when they got their orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, just a week ago something like that happened. For the first time this year I've seen the online user count closer to what it should have been, around 2000 during peak hours(5-9PM). Usually it never peaked 2k, and if it did, I'd know something was up. Right now it would normally be closer to 700 users online rather than the 1.5k that are currently online.

       Exactly. There are those breaks and I think"ahhh maybe it's over!" But they always fire back up. Right after the Awan arrest, there was a really nice 18 hour (approx) break in the shit. I'll confess to reading other subs a lot more lately. I'm not interested in having an echo chamber, but some critical thought and the occasional non-political post would be nice.

       In my experience in this sub, one thread will be nothing but pro-Trump, and another will be nothing but anti-Trump. Then you have the occasional "both sides are evil" traditional conspiracy theory crowd that gets a thread to the front page once in awhile.

       I've noticed this as well.  You beat your head against people promoting/defending the MSM narrative all day and then suddenly everyone is sane again and the subreddit is full of logical, critical thinking, skeptics.  I haven't seen a pattern to it yet though.

       It does have a specific focus, which is conspiracies. Your comparison would be better if you were talking about major gaming news and people flocked over to r/gaming to discuss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your analogy only makes sense if you consider this story not to be relevant to the subreddit.

       Conspiracies is general. If it was a specific sub it would be about a specific conspiracy. If the gaming sub was exclusively anti dota posts it would be stupid.

       I'm not saying it's not relevant, I'm saying that these users strangely come out of nowhere to a non-default and not particularly popular sub to spam the shit out of a specific topic.

      <p>
       Conspiracy is not the defacto political discussion sub, that's what r/politics is. All I'm talking about is where the users are coming from and why. This sub is heading in a shitty direction just like r/politics. Anyone can tell, it's the same process.

       It's not the existence of a submission dude. It's the general state of this subreddit and the comments that follow. Anyone who was around last year knows exactly how political subs get taken over. The framework shifts, and in the blink of an eye certain things can't be discussed, and certain things can be. As much as people spammed crazy shit here, there was discussion. In any of the "questionable" anti-trump posts, you'll notice that anything that criticizes the article gets nuked within moments, that's how it starts. That's the framework shifting. By the end of the year, this sub will be 90% similar to r/politics.

       People go to those specialized subreddits because they are not being bombarded by information on those subjects multiple times a day on the reddit front page, every single day, for months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if every single large subreddit posted about how horrible the new season of GoT was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine 50 new subreddits being created solely to push anti-GoT content onto the frontpage while the reddit admins decided to make unique rules that only applied to keep the GoT support subreddit off of the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if a subreddit broadly named "r/television" only posted 24/7 anti-GoT content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if obscure subreddits like r/blackpeopletwitter "organically" pushed anti-GoT content onto the front page daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if r/jokes routinely used an image on their sidebar mocking GRR Martin or actors from the show?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if every time a person defended the show they were gang-downvoted to cries of "he is a member of r/GoT".
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if every time the comment section wasn't a full circlejerk there were cries of "r/GoT is brigading!!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if there were people still open-minded enough to see this obvious imbalance and point it out despite NOT being supporters of Donald Trump but instead being supporters of fair and balanced information and against the kind of blatant MSM propaganda warfare that led us into a "War against Terror" that led to deaths and displacement of millions and a Wall Street market crash that has crippled the world economy and made life harder for literally 99% of the people on the planet.

       Exactly. And its also not an anti-Trump subreddit. It's a conspiracy discussion subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is a majority US-based website. And 60 million US citizens voted for Trump. So why is there confusion that there would be an overlap between Trump-supporters and valid, long-term, members of this subreddit or any subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet every single day there seems to be an organized push to shame this subreddit for allowing those members to have an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why should I believe that the same people who have successfully done that to the rest of reddit are not doing it here? Because no matter what anyone pretends, plenty of us were watching and paying close attention when this website literally changed overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reddit leans left" is a bullshit excuse that only held water before a subreddit called r-politics literally changed overnight from a majority Bernie Sanders support platform into Hillary Clinton's personal propaganda factory.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't seem to realize the amount of woke conspiracy members who watched that happen and who even discussed it while it was happening.

       Let's be honest here. The threads that defend Trump and attack his enemies outnumber the Trump/Russia threads by at least a 10 to 1 ratio. This whole idea that this sub is being overrun is rediculous, take a look around. There are at least 20-30 new threads a day ( typically by the same people ) attacking Trump's enemies or defending Trump...... You're sitting there saying that it's not an anti Trump sub, but there's more threads devoted to attacking the Clinton's and Trump's perceived enemies than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that's changed is that as the Trump/Russia conspiracy gains momentum people are coming here because it's the fucking conspiracy sub. It's not the Trump sub, it's not the Hillary sub, it's the conspiracy sub...... Or that's what it's called at least.

       There's about as much hard evidence for the Russia stuff as there is for pretty much every major conspiracy posted on this subreddit, but only one conspiracy gets so much push back from this subreddit. There's always people denying conspiracies here, but it's never been on this scale before.

       See, here's the thing - I have no doubt that you believe you know what constitutes evidence. And I'm in no position to say that you don't, because you're entitled to your opinions and your own methodology to determine what you feel is valid evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing is, so is everyone else. I have my own opinions and my own methodologies, and I'm quite comfortable looking at the evidence and making my own determination as to what I feel is valid.
      </p>

       So why do you feel you are the only one qualified to determine what is valid evidence? I mean you're sitting here saying that you're laughing at the Trump conspiracy, so maybe we should go over it and see how we each determine what is valid evidence?

       So you don't think that the meeting with Junior, Kushner and Manafort qualifies as evidence? Because judging by the recent development of the grand jury, Mueller seems to think there might be evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other part of this is that we don't know what evidence is going to be revealed as the result of this investigation.

       Prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this subreddit was specifically targeted by share blue, then. You seem a bit hypocritical with your standard of guilt here. On the one hand, you make some serious claims without the evidence to back it up, and on the other hand you dismiss claims that actually do have evidence to back it up. What are you trying to cover up here?

       You mean like how trump is under an ongoing investigation?  I don't understand how people like you are trying to claim that nothing was found when the investigation is not complete.  You are speaking from a place without information on something that's not completed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be like if a cop is searching your car and you keep yelling at him that he hasn't found anything time and time again.  Just wait for it to finish before you make that sort of claim.

       Mueller just started his investigation, and most people seem to think it's going to go well into 2018..... And there's people trying to say that the investigation didn't find anything.

       If "you're" going to start ad hominem attacking me on the basis of intelligence, you should probably figure out the difference between "your" and "you're" first.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the conspiracy sub, everything is subjective....... Look at 95% of the threads here, all of the "evidence" would be laughed out of court and the lawyer that tried to present it would be disbarred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, would you feel comfortable that the prosecutor that tries Pizzagate would still have a job when it was over? Or maybe get Trump himself to do something about the birther conspiracy that he peddled for years, because that one sure looks like it's chock full of solid evidence.

       Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that there was a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian lawyers to get damaging info in Clinton. This is collusion, but we don't yet have a "for tat", per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump (and Trump Jr.) both said this meeting was just about adoptions. Adoptions from Russia were limited before the passing of the Magnitsky Act, which is arguably the strongest sanction placed on Russia. So we have both of them effectively saying "we were meeting about sanctions".
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also admitted that he helped craft the statement Trump Jr. gave about this meeting which we now know is a lie. So we have Trump caught in a cover-up of a meeting which involved somehow both sanctions and damaging info on Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put these together and you say we have no evidence.

       If you think we are "missing out" on Russian interference with elections, then you must be relatively new to conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my personal belief that the Russians most likely attempted to influence the election in some way. But I could care less. The reason I don't give a shit is because the United States has been influencing elections for decades. I can't find much concrete proof about HOW the Russians attempted the same feat, but I know what the US has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have pumped money into pro US sides of an election, started riots, assassinated world leaders, and supported dictators who as far as I could tell were much worse than Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I can thank this subreddit for is opening my eyes to these truths. The US isn't some shining beacon of democracy, tasked with saving the world from evil. The US is as much a terrorist state as any other country out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Russia wanted Clinton to lose, they are just playing by the same rules as the US. The US set the precedents here. The double standard presented here and in the media amounts to one of the most serious cases of collective amnesia I've had the opportunity to witness. Doesn't anybody remember what we ourselves have done? The Russians can't even compare.

       This sub is anything but a MSM echo chamber. It's a conspiracy sub, and the Trump/Russia thing is the best conspiracy to come along in years IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's cool that you are talking about the Clinton conspiracies for years. But I don't see anyone calling for the end if that ( I definitely wouldn't ) so why get upset because other people are interested in a different conspiracy?
      </p>

       Exactly, I was also here for that. There is a really great documentary attached to the famous "How Reddit Was Destroyed" post that basically shows how the mainstream media and DC establishment conspired to shut out RP.  And while that was going on, reddit also just happened to "organically" turn on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember that very well, how the circlejerk subreddit basically became the "mock Ron Paul headquarters" overnight much in the same way that r/politics became went from a pro-Bernie subreddit to a pro-Hillary echo chamber overnight.

       I saw it happen to r/politics, but it feels like the same is happening but from the_donald to here.  Mostly of what I see when I come here are the posts like yours that defend Trump and have zero information or evidence.  You posted nothing but your own idea about shareblue taking over and it got a bunch of upvotes.  Your post looks more like gaslighting than anything.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I think most people don't care if you want to discuss the Russian conspiracy. The problem is that anyone who disagrees with it is automatically attacked as a trump supporter or someone from t_d. Can't somebody have the opinion that the Russia conspiracy is a load of crap based off the lack of evidence?

       Do I have to mention that I don't sub to t_d or support Trump every time I disagree with someone here? It's getting ridiculous.

       But as far as being accused of being a Trump supporter, well, look around....... It appears as if it's the Trump supporters that are starting most of the threads focusing on Clinton conspiracies, defending Trump, and they seem to be also going after anyone that talks about a Trump conspiracy.

       Of course political bias is going to factor into posts from time to time. I'm sure users posting Trump conspiracies could be democrats as well. It goes both ways.

       As far as Trump supporters attacking people over Trump focused conspiracies, I'm open to looking at evidence if you can provide it.

        And this is a majority US-based website. And 60 million US citizens voted for Trump. So why is there confusion that there would be an overlap between Trump-supporters and valid, long-term, members of this subreddit or any subreddit?

       More people voted against Trump. Why is there confusion that there would be an overlap between non-Trump supporters and valid, long-term members of this subreddit or any subreddit?

       <p>
        And why should I believe that the same people who have successfully done that to the rest of reddit are not doing it here? Because no matter what anyone pretends, plenty of us were watching and paying close attention when this website literally changed overnight.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Reddit leans left" is a bullshit excuse that only held water before a subreddit called r-politics literally changed overnight from a majority Bernie Sanders support platform into Hillary Clinton's personal propaganda factory.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is consistent with "Reddit leaning left." In our current system, it is impossible for anyone but a Democrat or a Republican to win the presidency. I don't like it, you probably don't like it, but that is a fact. If you lean left, you might not necessarily support Hillary Clinton, but you can still see that she was better than the alternative once Bernie Sanders was eliminated. And for whatever it's worth, I voted Hillary in the primary and Stein in the general.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You don't seem to realize the amount of woke conspiracy members who watched that happen and who even discussed it while it was happening.

      <p>
       You don't seem to realize that big topics bring in outsiders that don't normally visit. Yes, most of the time this subreddit is full of the "true believer" types. But when there is a big breaking conspiracy happening before our eyes, you're going to attract the filthy casuals.

       But 62+ million voted against Trump, and Reddit is heavily left leaning compared to the US, so why can't there be an overlap between people that don't like Trump and valid, long-term, members of this subreddit or any subreddit? You don't need to bring in CTF/Shareblue or whatever.

       it was right before/during the DNC convention. i'll never forget it, the week reddit truly changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with you and know exactly what you're talking about. despite being conservative i used to sub to politics just to see what they were talking about and sometimes engage in a healthy (mostly) discussion. Despite leaning left, a lot of people were rational and willing to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all changed the day Hillary beat out Sanders. And it was painfully non organic. And then it spread to the entire site. I miss my old reddit.

       The numbers do not add up, even if you want to dismiss what is in clear view. The super majority demographic of reddit are millennials. The super majority of millennials support Sanders and his policies. Reddit does not represent this data at all. They're not neoliberals, which magically became the prevailing viewpoint after the convention. There is a lot of shilling going on, and likely requires less resources than you would think to achieve.

       The vast majority of Bernie supporters became Clinton supporters in the election. That's just a fact. People, at large do not love the DNC, but they obviously see Trump as a much much greater malignancy. Find me a poll or otherwise that shows different. Why wouldn't this also be true on the internet and on reddit?

       The vast majority of Sanders supporters don't support Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being critical of the DNC is one thing, but it's a huge leap from being critical of the DNC to supporting Trump. Look at the demographic breakdown from the last election, and the half dozen elections prior to that........ The older white vote is the Republican base.

       What does Trump have to do with any of this? I am referring to topics directly related to the DNC and Sanders policies. It doesn't add up. I despise Trump, but am very critical of the DNC. One doesn't translate to the other. The older population also voted for Clinton, in similar numbers to how the young voted for Sanders.

       Because it appears that he's saying that the vast majority of Sander's supporters refused to vote for Clinton. And if you look at the demographic breakdown, it followed all of the usual patterns with Clinton winning the youth vote by around 20 points....... So if Sander's supporters were young voters ( as has been suggested ) that would indicate to me that a majority of Sander's support swung to Clinton...... Otherwise Trump would have fared much better with that demographic.

       Yea, but the election is over. How is this relevant right now? They didn't join Team Hillary. They didn't stop criticizing the DNC. This is where your  defense crumbles. They didn't change their ideals. Hillary actually dropped in the polls after the election, and Bernie is the most popular politician in America. Millenials are the majority on reddit, and Sanders largest base is millennials. He has an 80% approval rating with D's. These numbers dictate that you should never see a downvoted post, that shines a positive light on Bernie Sanders. Would you agree with that?

       You're still trying to say that Bernies supporters didn't vote for Clinton? I just gave you the statistics, and explained it in detail, and you're still trying to say that Bernie's supporters didn't vote for Clinton.
Then how in the heck did Clinton win the youth demographic by 20 points? You're admitting that millennials comprise Sander's largest group of support....... But you're not seeing a connection that Hillary won the millennial vote by 20 points?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the down votes I don't understand what you're getting at, if you could clarify that for me it would be great.

       IDC who they voted for, it's irrelevant. What I am telling you is Bernie is really popular on reddit , and the country. You shouldn't see articles relating directly to Bernie or his popular policies get downvoted. The numbers are not there. This is about Bernie specifically.

       I haven't seen that too much on this particular sub, but I don't doubt that it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about any political topic is that it's inevitably going to be a target for spam and shills, it's just the way the game is played. This sub is a target for an obvious reason, being that a lot of Trump supporters are fans of conspiracy theories based on the Clinton's and the DNC.

       But yeah, it's a fact that social media and sites like this have become a political battleground. Last summer was the worst Ive ever seen it, the brigading was nuts.

       They're taking every piece of land though. They destroyed S4P and are now constantly brigading the subs people flocked to when they escaped politics. Conspiracy, WOTB. It's depressing really. It would be nice if the DNC was above such tactics, but who am I fooling.

       As far as that behaviour goes it appears as if the vast majority of it is coming from the other side, if we're viewing it in terms of the number of political threads started.

       If we're going by demographics, most Bernie supporters did hold their nose and vote for Clinton. I'm not saying they all did, but looking at the numbers it appears that most did.

Now one day they watch the latest episode which is far and away judged to be the worst episode ever by critics, fans, and all evidence, suddenly they love game of thrones.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this mass amount of people go into
       <a href="/r/gameofthrones">
        /r/gameofthrones
       </a>
       literally
       <strong>
        calling all users of the sub idiots for liking previous episodes and questioning that any other episode matters but this one
       </strong>
       and these comments and posts get hundreds of up-votes drowning out the normal user-base.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you think then?

       Shareblue. Cult45s go to boogieman that they have no proof is actually in operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there was a slide of potential tactics. But evidence of it happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's well known Russian troll factories doing the same for Trump/the alt right but do I have evidence of them in action? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the country, including conspiracy enthusiasts, hate Trump and can see right through his thin vaneer to his criminal gangster core. I know you're trapped in your bubbles but you got made fools of my this gangster. Calling the VAST majority of the population paid shills is delusional and pretty embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of defending your master, you revert to imaginary enemies. Because you can't defend him. Worshipping a billionaire elitist corporate establishment crook so blindly is the saddest case of Stockholm Syndrome I've ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least have the balls to stand by your decision instead of shifting responsibility for having to do it to imaginary "shills". It's embarrassing.

        “The use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election, most clearly with pro-Trump campaigners and programmers who carefully adjusted the timing of content production during the debates, strategically colonized pro-Clinton hashtags, and then disabled automated activities after Election Day,” wrote Howard; Bence Kollanyi, a Ph.D. candidate at Corvinus University of Budapest; and Samuel Woolley, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington.

        “I created this list of Russian trolls when I was researching. And I check on it once in a while, still. And a lot of them have turned into conservative accounts, like fake conservatives. I don’t know what’s going on, but they’re all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Outside of literally seeing one with your own eyes though, most Trump fans will dismiss it as "fake news". Meanwhile Shareblue creating a small budget (a few million dollars, I forget the exact amount) for online marketing is seen as 100% evidence that they are brigading every thread, months after the election.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       It unfortunately still doesn't answer my question. I'm not sure why people are responding without reading the question.

      <p>
       With all due respect, 100% of the answers I've received have been pointing me elsewhere proclaiming that the evidence is where they're pointing. Only to get stuck in a loop when asked where on their source it proves it.

       I always love this line that they take. There is so much proof out there of different shilling systems (on both sides of the aisle, plus corporate and NGO interests), from news stories to your ability to go fucking hire them yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But unless you somehow have the...hacked emails (?) of the shills admitting that they're shills and showing where they're shilling, it's absurd to mention the concept apparently.

       Emails are not reliable evidence.  Maybe for a civil case, but criminal cases will need evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt.  Emails can originate from anywhere and they are not secure in transit.  They are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and more.  Someone could gain access to an email account and send whatever they wanted.  It's too easy to manipulate or prove who sent an email or that the email that was received was what was actually sent.  Emails, texts messages, and any insecure text based communications are able to be manipulated.  Text based digital communications are constantly abused this way.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I love how you completely ignore Cambridge Analytica and the presence of shilling operations from the GOP side of the spectrum.

       Both sides are battling among themselves and using this subreddit's hands-off approach to censohip to throw shit at each other. The longtime regulars who see through all the bullshit from both sides just want all of you to go away.

       There are no both sides. There is the Deep State and the rest of us. There is no evidence that Cambridge Analytica pays people to post. That is just shill projection.

       You can call them out for being lying trolls without using the word "shill". That's an ad hominem fallacy anyway, you're not making a good persuasive argument to just call someone a shill, even when you're definitely correct in doing so. Use a logical argument to shut them down, because insulting them with a label like that will only make them look like a victim to outside observers.

       Trolls do it for teh lulz; shills do it for the paycheck. There's a difference.

       It's not insulting when accurate. There's no point in arguing with shills because they are dishonest on a fundamental level---they're not going to have their minds changed because they're arguing from someone else's position, not their own. For what purpose should anyone waste their time arguing with someone whose thoughts are limited to the script that was pre-approved for them?

       Or, people who aren't shills don't like it when you say everyone who disagrees with me is a shill. It's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy to call everyone shills then use the downvoting of that as proof of shills.

       Disagreeing is fine.  What we are seeing here is mass downvoting of logical comments that add to the discussion in favor of comments bashing this sub and it's users in general.  Or some smart ass quips about how if you aren't constantly painting Trump in a negative light that you are a Trump praiser and this is T_D 2.0.

       I think it varies a lot by thread, I think most of the t_d 2.0 people show up for certain threads just as
       <a href="/r/poltiics">
        /r/poltiics
       </a>
       people show up for certain ones. But there tends to be a lot more of the t_d crosspost ones than the opposite (peyote_the_coyote is the hardest working man in hollywood)

       There are crossposts but the actual discussions going on in either sub are vastly different.  Why can't
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       talk about a same subjectz as T_D? We also cover the same subjects as
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       meanwhile the comments in those threads are still making sarcastic quips like OMG this will get downvoted to hell because this is T_D 2.0 even though that isn't even close to reality. There is a lot of bitching about us discussing T_D topics and further bitching that we aren't discussing
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       topics with the exact same enthusiasm as
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       Well sure theres overlap, but theres sources and discussions that xpost from t_d that are inherently slanted, like it's one thing to talk about the awan scandal, but if your theory is "the awans were secret ISIS agents, and they tipped off about the botched raid in yemen, and thats why our soldier died, so even that one small thing trump may have done partly wrong was actually the DNC's fault too" you're probably a partisan hack

       I fully am a supporter of the president however I come to conspiracy for some sweet Bigfoot shit or stuff about 9/11 and occasionally I'll even listen to someone tell me the world is indeed flat.

       Giving an example is presenting as an authority? I didn't say it was justified, I told him why people would say that, I never called him a shill. He just needed to be more informed. I have a good other example though you don't really care for a discussion, but if someone asked "Is mueller going to investigate the russians hacking the vermont power grid and find trump's involvement" or someone who believed the vote totals were hacked, you would think they were uncritically viewing left wing news.

       Why would I bother explaining to the guy why people took issue with his question instead of just circlejerking about him being a shill?

      <p>
       Since I'm the implicit_brag appointed expert of examples, let me give another. If joe biden says "why do people keep calling me a pedophile!??!" and I say "because theres a lot of recordings of you getting too close to kids" I am neither calling him a pedophile, nor defending people calling him one.

       The premise of this is that anyone who says that shareblue isn't performing a complete takeover of reddit and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , is shareblue. Then implied all the people downvoting the ridiculously over the top thread were shareblue. I don't see how thats the same as you ignoring parts of my posts that directly contradict your version of me to only put ones out of context and keep assuming i'll react a certain way even though you know I won't because you creeped on my history.

       I've noticed a specific type of user always goes with the "stalking" angle in order to deflect from scrutiny. Looks like you conform pretty well to my "version of you", lol. Honestly, I've never seen some one who got called out on posting to the Donald go with the stalking angle. It's always a very specific type of user that goes with that deflection.

       It's not a deflection, I don't go through people's post histories, I just respond to what they're saying, and I'm pretty sure the creeping/stalking angle is the normal nomenclature such as going through someone's facebook is "creeping on their facebook" not "performing facebook research"

       You said I complain about downvotes, and that i call it t_d 2.0, and i call people shills, none of which i do. Hell, I invite you to find me going through someones post history and calling them out as a t_d user. I know people are t_d people by what they say, not by going through their post history.  I explained the difference in that other thread about specific kind of people that come in from the crossposts to whichever reddit.

       I've been reading this sub on a daily basis for years (I rarely post though) and the increase in shilling has become very apparent. Shareblue really needs to tone it down a bit if they want to actually be convincing shills. This sub is looking more like

       One of their gaslighting tactics seems to be brigading every comment section while loudly screaming "td is brigading!".
      </p>
      <p>
       They scream "conspiracy is td now!" while manipulating every thread into an r-politics clone.
      </p>
      <p>
       They clearly have coordination outside of reddit since they routinely gang-upvote anything that goes against their daily mission statement and sometimes they get greedy, or just cant help themselves, so they gang-upvote comments that blatantly insult the subreddit and the subreddit users. Then they expect those of us paying attention to pretend we didnt see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They turn every thread into a Trump-bash, a Russia-bash, and expect established conspiracy forum users to believe that the coming of Trump signaled the start of government corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can write: fuck Trump, fuck Clinton, fuck Obama, fuck Putin, fuck the US, China, and Russia, fuck politics. Yet I will still be accused of being a "Trump supporter" or a "Russian propagandist" every time I make an observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go into any comment section that is being force fed the r-politics kool aid and start clicking on usernames, use reddit detective, and you will find dozens of accounts posting in conspiracy for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only good thing about the current shitstorm is that you can post non-political conspiracy threads and better discussions happem because all of the shills are busy flooding the politic threads.

       I think it's more about gaslighting anyone who might happen upon this sub into thinking the r/conspiracy community falls into a specific single camp concerning particular issues — "Well if those crazy bastards

       Not everyone is a blind follower of Trump. I think that should be blatantly obvious since the very nature of conspiracy theorism is questioning TPTB.

       I have to wonder how this place would have reacted to Watergate, which as of now is the biggest political conspiracy in the history of US presidents. Washington Post broke the story, so does that mean the conspiracy theorists of the 1970s automatically assumed it was invalid?

       You couldn't be more wrong. This is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       not /r/makingshitupwithnoevidence . A real conspiracy is panning out and being investigated and so far has implications for the highest rung of the executive brach, and this is what makes it

       Frogs turning gay, aliens, moon landing, Jews controlling the world, illuminati, free masons, chem trails, intelligence agency black ops, end of the world prophecies, false flags, 9-11, weird shit from ancient times - all cool and dandy. Awesome and truly unique discussions and insight, even for the very obvious batshit insane stuff that gets people laughed at, at least they're fun to talk or read about.

       Donald Trump and his political campaign working with the Russian government to get elected? Woaaaah buddy, thats where this place draws the line. That's where everyone and their mother apparently looks at every shred of evidence and can do to it what most people do to stuff discussed here - dismiss it off hand for insert reason here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why people say this sub has been taken over by the Donald. At the very least this is a conspiracy theory, but never before have so many users tried to bury one.

       I think it's more that there are two conflicting conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Trump worked with the Russians in some way regarding an information campaign (Whether it's just social media propaganda or the hack of the DNC/Podesta emails and distribution via wikileaks), and the intelligence community are the good guys who unmasked trumps team to stop a coup, and are leaking information and getting special counsels appointed, etc, ultimately to stop Trump and Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Clinton avoided prosecution by being able to influence the IC and DoJ and is part of the DC/Global power structure that calls the shots.  Her win was all but certain, which is why no one cared much about Russia until after the election.  Now that Trump won, the goal is to undermine him at all costs.  The FBI was never allowed to review the DNC server that was supposedly hacked , and that was because the hack was fabricated to undermine trump and associate, as well as cover up a leak and massive internal scandal (Possibly Awan related?).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots more to each of these, but basically people are choosing one vs the other.  So, that's not to say that someone thinks the Trump/Russia theory is so far fetched but aliens are reasonable.. it's more that they probably believe some variation of one of those theories and as a result, in their mind, it invalidates the other theory so they take issue with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as this sub is often "anti establishment", whether that's DC elite, CIA, FBI, Military, Congress, Senate, etc, it seems reasonable that people in this sub might choose the anti clinton conspiracy over the anti trump one.

       I'm confused, is Shareblue the people putting every Trump-related comment section into Contest mode?  Are they the ones who mysteriously always push a bunch of anti-DNC stories every time our Manchurian president gets himself in trouble?

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Obviously Reddit can, has and will continue to be gamed... That doesn't explain why we're only talking about DNC-related issues when t_d is famous for it... Not to mention the whole Russian bots angle... But we don't talk about those, we focus on the side of the political spectrum that doesn't control any branch of government.  Kinda suspicious, isn't it?

       They must have also been the ones who stickied a post "Welcoming all refugees" from a 24/7 political rally sub for President Trump where even the
       <em>

       stepping out of the government line results in banning.

       Cambridge Analytica has a budget at least 10 times bigger than ShareBlue, and likely much, much more than that.

      <p>
       The only stories to ever get censored through "contest mode" that thwarts discussion are the ones that look bad for Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever there is a bad story for Trump, the board gets a sudden influx of posts claiming some kind of "evidence" (often weeks old) that they claim blows the narrative out of the water. This week, the lawsuit claiming that Donald Trump is pushing the Seth Rich story was drowned out by 100 duplicate submissions of Seymour Hersch's audio that says nothing and proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time anyone has actually gotten
       <em>
        caught
       </em>
       using bots was people posting similar stories/content from The_Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever there is a story critical of Donald Trump, you get posts throwing a tantrum complaining it must be ShareBlue that dear leader is getting criticized.

       That's why all of the anti-Trump posts get brigaded with upvotes and ridiculous comments compared to regular conspiracy posts.  And why the front page is plastered with the Mueller story, which belongs in /news and not /conspiracy...

       I couldn't have more perfect evidence that my post is correct than your reply. You're saying we're not allowed to discuss the Russia investigation on a conspiracy theory board because it's mean to the president.

       Yeah, the whining about a "complete takeover" of this sub is pretty fucking hilarious when this sub spent MONTHS as basically a direct extension of The_Donald. But we conveniently don't remember that now. I assume that 98% of the posting about who shills for whom and what side has taken over the sub is posted by the operatives of the other side. Does anyone remember what this sub was like prior to the campaigns and election? It was a sub about conspiracies. Now it's a fucking political cesspit. Fuck all of you.

       I am sorry that you cant seem to tell the difference between a valid criticism of posting history as opposed to telling someone with years of posting conspiracies that they are "paid by Putin" because you are angry they dont buy the muh Russia narrative.

       Hmm, gee Mr. Reddit Investigator, did it ever occur to you in your internet sleuthing that this is one of my alt accounts? Did your in-depth analysis of my posting history on this alt reveal that all of my comments are sporadic and usually in random subs? Did you think I'd post in this fucking shithole of a sub on my main account so Trump-cock-gobbling neckbeards such as yourself could dig through my entire reddit history in your attempt to root out all the big bad shills?

       That's because when there are posts that are "bad stories for Trump" we get a massive influx of outside users with similar posting styles to those from
       <a href="/r/politics">

       come in here and direct the conversation and bash
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       at the same time. When top upvoted post in the thread is bashing the sub and it's users it's pretty easy to tell that the discussion did not organically arise from

       The reason we get accused of being pro Trump is bc places like T_D use Trump as a rallying figure.  He is the one centralized icon that gives their effort cohesion - in a way he really does act like some kind of WH40k being because of the community collectively buttressing in the
       <em>
        meme
       </em>
       that is Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here at r/conspiracy, we have no idea or figure or icon to rally around - we are skeptics of many different calibers and each with differing points of view. It makes us diverse - but also easier to fracture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill agenda is to bash any idea (meme)that seems like it might provide a centralized focal point for the community to rally around to resist shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       We arent doing a bad job as it is, but we are fighting a losing battle. Worldnews is gone. Politics is gone. We are overflowing with astrotrufed subreddits by their multitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/conspiracy is helms fucking deep. If we lose this place to the shills.. Game over for free thought on Reddit.

       The amount of gatekeeping on this sub is ridiculous, and it's clear that the shill accusations are a transparent excuse to attack liberals. I'm not going to defend every upvote or downvote since that gets to a "can't prove a negative" level, but this not-at-all-subtle deflection shuts down free-thinking discussion, and it's main motivation is to push out those who don't support right-wing conspiracies. And the mods here clearly have different rules due to the ideological subject of posts and comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spamming the front page with gatekeeping is more censorship than gang-downvotes. If more people come to this sub that you don't like, then calling them shills is an asshole thing to say.

       Weird, the largest potential political conspiracies in American history and people are talking about it on the conspiracy subreddit.

       Late to the party, and I dont know if anyone will see this (unless they're looking for something to downvote), but I think I know what's going on, and I am pretty sure it's nonpartisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember thinking, about two years ago, about how weird it was that there were so few "leftist" conspiracy theorists.  Sure, there are hippies, populist-type socialists, and anarchocommunists, but I was never able to find a bona fide internationalist conspiracy theorist.  At least, not until the most recent election. Now why do you think that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's because, while plenty of normal, non-shill human beings are internationalist, they pretty much by definition cant believe in a high-level, closed-door, coordinated concentration of power that is larger than the international entities that already exist, and that they believe will save us.  There is opposition to their agenda, of course, but it wouldn't make sense for it to be coordinated, because the only reason someone would oppose internationalism is that they are backward and dumb, or else evil and crazy, and neither sort of person is capable of organizing a real conspiracy capable of challenging the collective power of Humanity(tm).
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that TPTB realized that almost everyone believes in some conspiracy theory or another, be it JFK, 9/11, aliens or Bigfoot, and that it looked really suspicious that the only worldview that was a priori incompatible with conspiracy theories was collectivist internationalist authoritarianism. So they started a new venture, where they spam conspiracy theories globalists and transhumanists can believe in, where the alleged culprit is something other than a collectivist internationalist  authoritarian.  The only problem is that they haven't figured out a believable endgame for their alleged conspiracies, since the best argument against trump is still that he's a secret internationalist, so they are left positing weird, nefarious and unmotivated kinds of racism, stupidity, or an egomaniacal drive for world domination as the impetus behind the conspiracies they allege.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what makes it easy to spot them as shills.  It isnt that they're "left-wing," or anti-trump, or anything else; it's that their theories lack the sort of endgame and motive that seasoned conspiracy theorists find believable.  Sure, conspiracies in local police stations, or in sports, or whatever, need not be perpetrated by internationalists, but as far as I can tell, every conspiracy theorist who is here in good faith is opposed to internationalism, because it is at the root of nearly all conspiracies at the national level and above. Thus, while Trump's appearance of having policies that are a thorn in the side of the internationalists has made users here appear more right wing, we actually just share a common enemy (if trump is acting in good faith, which is a perfectly reasonable topic to discuss here).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I really doubt everyone who buys into these new imitations of conspiracy theories is a shill; many people simply do not like trump, putin, etc. for ideological reasons. But those who view the world through the lens of conspiracy are not likely to suddenly accept a new villain in their narrative, especially if he or they lack motive, means, or opportunity to wrest power from the internationalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl; dr, the appearance that this board is partisan comes from the common threads that tie most political conspiracy theories together (mainly internationalism), colliding with Trump's supposedly anti-internationalist beliefs and the emergence of Big Shill's transparent attempts to copy the conspiracy theory model. And I could be wrong, but I expect we dont see as many "is trump secretly a globalist" threads as we should because everyone's busy fending off ridiculous Russian herrings, to the point that everything anti-trump seems like it's coming from a shill.

       It does seem like the worst place to discuss conspiracies these days is right here in the conspiracy sub. I enjoy talking about all different types of topics, but I am called a right winger with an agenda almost every time I post anything. I'm not here with any agenda, I just enjoy the topics we discuss in conspiracy. But if I question any sort of mainstream narrative my comment gets taken over.

       It's not the existence of a submission dude. It's the general state of this subreddit and the comments that follow. Anyone who was around last year knows exactly how political subs get taken over. The framework shifts, and in the blink of an eye certain things can't be discussed, and certain things can be. As much as people spammed crazy shit here, there was discussion. In any of the "questionable" anti-trump posts, you'll notice that anything that criticizes the article gets nuked within moments, that's how it starts. That's the framework shifting. By the end of the year, this sub will be 90% similar to r/politics.

       They're taking every piece of land though. They destroyed S4P and are now constantly brigading the subs people flocked to when they escaped politics. Conspiracy, WOTB. It's depressing really. It would be nice if the DNC was above such tactics, but who am I fooling.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       stepping out of the government line results in banning.

       It happened after Hillary collapsed, too. The shills were awaiting their talking points. Reddit returned to normal for a while. It was amazing.

       It's really amusing watching you wriggle so desperately to not answer the question. Throwing as much as you can out to avoid it.

       If you're not doing it deliberately, I feel incredibly sorry for you. If you are, doesn't that feel icky? Squirming like that?
