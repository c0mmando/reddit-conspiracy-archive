       Yes, it would be dumb to overlook the influence that Jewish elites have within our society and our culture. Hollywood, the US media, their status regarding banking and finance, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm still not totally onboard with this Notion of them being this all powerful ruling entity that created the New World Order all on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is "Jews rule the world" a potential psyop to distract from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the bilderberg group, and the trilateral commission, as well as other non elected groups/societies that truly set US and world policy?

       I think you're correct on many things (the world IS ruled by secret societies, and the Mystery Babylon system is real), but there are more recent events that have transpired that will update your views. The Vatican secret societies were rolled up into Grand Lodge Freemasonry awhile back.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example, you can see how the Vatican was working for the CIA during Operation Gladio. The CIA was founded, and continues to be controlled by Grand Lodge Freemasons and Mormons (who were created by Freemasons).

       The CIA is not running the world however, they are only one of many spy agencies that report to the Jesuits, who are controlled by the Vatican and the Black Nobility.  Behind the Rothschilds and Rockefellers you find the Houses of Massimo, Breakspeare, Orsini, Bourbon, Windsor-Saxe-Coburg, Pallavincini, Este, Pamphilj, Orange, and several more.  These are the true Bloodline families; they trace their lineage and descendants back centuries, predating Freemasonry and the "Illuminati", and some of them go even further back into ancient Egypt and possibly Atlantis.

       There's definitely something to this bloodlines stuff. There's a guy named Gary Wayne who has some good interviews on ]dragon bloodlines](

       Yes indeed.  They truly believe that they are not of this world, and that their Bloodlines (the Luciferians) are Venusian and Saturnalian in origin.  Several of them have made the claim of being descended from the Atlanteans, who according to the legend destroyed themselves with their own advanced / esoteric technology.  You should also look into The Hidden Hand interview and the Ra Material while you're at it, some very fascinating looks into the hows and whys of the Elite and possibly why they are here.  Without really delving into the subject matter as much as I could, just be prepared to have your mind blown if you haven't read into it already :)

       Zionists are just powerful in the Illuminati but the Illuminati bends the knee to the Black Nobility which stems from the era of the Romans and they run the Vatican, Mafia, and other groups.

       Why can't we agree that these groups have likely come to terms with the fact that they are more powerful when they cooperate and join forces?

       Powerful people get together and have a plan. It's pretty easy to understand from my point of view. A lot of the conspiracy is way easier to understand if you look at it with as if You were trying to take over the world.

       They do team up with each other but keep in mind these psychos only love themselves are only serve themselves. They serve others only when there is a direct benefit to themselves.

       ..and the internet is absolutely flooded with all sorts of information and disinformation. The topic is SO humongous that one almost has to specialize in just a couple areas/topics to really drill into and get a handle on all that is out there.

       The Catholic and Jewish power structures alone pre-date the concept of the 'NWO' by centuries. Someone could literally specialize and devote all their time into researching just the Catholic and Jewish histories prior to the NWO even being a thought.

       They definitely have. Grand Orient Freemasonry withered and was rolled up into the Grand Lodge. Jesuits and Knights of Malta now cooperate with Freemasons at the CIA.

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because some people,
       <em>
        even here
       </em>
       are ignorant and bias as fuck, who have not done enough research and know very little about ancient civilizations and history. Rothschilds, for example, are new blood in comparison to some of these much older bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've (Rothschild) married in, but just because you marry into a family does not make you the leader/authority of that family, especially with Royal families, there is a power structure already there. Names people do not even know about, are the true controllers.

       I know dude, it pains me to see u/AhuwahZeus struggle to get even double-digit upvotes on his posts when they're probably the most informative stuff you're ever going to read on here.  I don't think I've ever seen anybody put in the kind of research he has on the topic in such detail, and yet barely anybody even knows about him here.  I've even been cataloguing his posts in my own Word doc just in case.

      <p>
       As for their supposed pre-Adamite origins that predate The Great Deluge, I know that many of them believe it to be true, and if you believe in the legends about Atlantis, it's more than likely that some of those families survived.  The Law of One/Ra Material and The Hidden Hand interview are pretty convincing accounts that certainly left room for this interpretation.

       Be aware, there's a LARGE group of shills that pushes Jewish conspiracy theories. Any time this is discussed, the comment section gets botted to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish being powerful is largely a result of the prohibitions on Christians lending at interest. Jews were the banking families for centuries, so they ended up involved in a lot of high level places. It's got very little to do with Judaism or ethnic heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's good evidence that Grand Lodge Freemasonry is the top of the conspiracy, however you want to call it (the Cult of Saturn, Mystery Babylon, "The Illuminati," "The NWO," etc.)

       I think this "Jews rule the world" thing is a psyop to make us look like we're pointing the finger at ONE ethnic/religious group being responsible for this. That doesn't make us look good, and gives the MSM ammo against us.

        Is "Jews rule the world" a potential psyop to distract from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the bilderberg group, and the trilateral commission, as well as other non elected groups/societies that truly set US and world policy?

       ..and the internet is absolutely flooded with all sorts of information and disinformation. The topic is SO humongous that one almost has to specialize in just a couple areas/topics to really drill into and get a handle on all that is out there.

       The Catholic and Jewish power structures alone pre-date the concept of the 'NWO' by centuries. Someone could literally specialize and devote all their time into researching just the Catholic and Jewish histories prior to the NWO even being a thought.
