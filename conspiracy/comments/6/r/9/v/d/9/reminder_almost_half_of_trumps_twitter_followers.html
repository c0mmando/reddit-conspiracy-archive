    <div class="md"><p>I think the point they&#39;re trying to raise is a comparison to the post on the front page about twitter bots pushing the NPR story, but when half of Trump&#39;s twitter support is bots, nobody seems to care.</p>

<p>So you going to say he has organic support pushing his &quot;good news&quot; and the stories that try to delegetimize the Russia investigation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I&#39;d say I don&#39;t give a flying fuck about Twitter, it&#39;s followers, or bots.  The fact we&#39;re using retweets as a basis for news credibility and calibration, or Twitter as a medium in the first place, is an indictment on journalism, investigative reporting, and the state of our collective intelligence as a society.  Information is supposed to be vetted and scrutinized, not 140 characters and retweetable.</p>

<p>Also, if that&#39;s truly the distinction she is drawing, 1. she&#39;s doing a poor job as this post mentions nothing of the sort and follows in line with a series of other &quot;reminder&quot; titled posts by her and 2. Trump having bot followers =/= bots pushing a specific narrative.  Good try though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think that would be relevant for comparison and context? Don&#39;t you think that takes the edge off the point they were trying to make? This is the one-sided media BS that they just don&#39;t seem to want to fix, and you don&#39;t seem to care that they&#39;re doing it.</p>

<p>Fun facts: CNN has 12 million &quot;fake&quot; followers. Twitter itself has over 10 million &quot;fake&quot; followers. Katy Perry has 58 million &quot;fake&quot; followers, more than 50%.</p>

<p>See where this is going? Every large twitter account is determined to have millions of fake followers. It would be unusual if Trump did not. You didn&#39;t read about that in the article though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You already asked me that question. I explained why they should have given more context and comparison with other large Twitter accounts. You&#39;re just not interested in fairness. What I &quot;admitted&quot; was that this Twitter Audit service has concluded that all large Twitter accounts have a lot of fake followers - a lot of them over 50% fake. This news site itself has more than half &quot;fake&quot; followers, and even @Twitter has millions of &quot;fake&quot; followers. I don&#39;t know how I can be any more clear about how stupid all of this is.</p>

<p>What don&#39;t you understand about this? It&#39;s fake news because it&#39;s as fair and interesting as a headline that proclaims &quot;Trump drinks water every day&quot;, when the fact is that everyone does. But the headline &quot;Everyone drinks water&quot; would not get as many clicks / ad revenue. Just try to be fair about it. There is a lot to criticize Trump for, but this isn&#39;t on the list. It&#39;s a symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you call it? Hypocritical fantasy news? Blatantly biased news? One quarter of the real story news? I&#39;m open for new terms, but &quot;fake news&quot; is fine for now.</p>

<p>And yes, if they attempted to hit Trump regarding civilian deaths (I assume you mean in war), while completely ignoring that just as many died under Obama (if that was the case in this hypothetical situation)... then that&#39;s wrong too. Context matters. Comparisons are interesting and relevant.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to tell you... if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s interesting that this news website has more &quot;fake&quot; followers as a percentage than the guy they&#39;re attacking for &quot;fake&quot; followers... what DO you find interesting? How do they leave out that piece of information? The information is freely available on the same audit tool they used, and what... you think they just forgot to check? Come on. Let&#39;s be reasonable here. They had all of these numbers I showed you, and they chose not to tell you, because it makes Trump look worse when they don&#39;t tell you the whole story. Just one paragraph could have contained all of the extra information.</p>

<p>Is that acceptable to you? Is that real journalism that you can trust on any important issues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, so just so we&#39;re clear, any report on something Trump does has to be compared to Obama in order for it to not be fake news? It almost seems like people are trying to deflect from his equally wrong actions by pointing out that someone else has done the same thing tbh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, just reffering to your previous comment about how Trump&#39;s civilian death toll needs to be compared to Obama&#39;s to not be fake news. </p>

<p>You can compare his number of followers to newsweek or whoever you want, but I&#39;m pretty sure OP wasn&#39;t trying to make the argument that Trump had more than any particular person. I think you may have missed that and jumped the gun a little. </p>

<p>Of course they were. Newsweek was trying to do that as well, which is why they provided no context or comparison. No explanation that Trump&#39;s amount of &quot;fake&quot; followers determined by this audit tool is completely normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It goes back to what I said earlier. A headline that says &quot;Everyone drinks water&quot; is not interesting, because it&#39;s not unusual. It&#39;s also not unusual for a large twitter account to be determined to have a lot of &quot;fake&quot; followers. They left that part out completely on purpose. Otherwise known as lying by omission. Fake news. Whatever you want to call it... it&#39;s unacceptable and it&#39;s not journalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A headline saying everyone drinks water wouldn&#39;t have people screaming fake news because it&#39;s generally true regardless of the context, how is that different from this? I think you&#39;ve long overlooked the point op was trying to make about there being bots that support Trump in general. Nobody is making the statement that he has more or less than anybody, we&#39;ll except for you. Apparently it&#39;s auto fake news unless they compare Trump to someone worse? That&#39;s honestly what it seems like you&#39;re proposing. </p>
