       All he did was fill it with creatures from the black lagoon. Goldman Sachs, former Rothschild banker (Wilbur Ross), Betsy Devos? Doesn't her husband have fucking Dyncorp connections?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the dude met with Henry Kssinger and spoke highly of him! He also said he was with the CIA 1,000%.

       You people who support him can't honestly think he's going to help us right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to touch on the "pizza" subject, but Donny T is no Prince Charming...his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and his demeanor regarding young girls tell me this dude is at least "aware" of the nefarious sexual stuff that people of his status dabble in and get away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what. I realize now that it was all
A big fucking show. They "selected" this douchebag to beat Hillary, because they knew we were
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       expecting her to win...
      </p>
      <p>
       They bamboozled us and flipped the script, to make him look like a hero. But he's no fucking different than her. He's going to be a much more effective puppet than she could have been because he can work the people with his bullshit artistry.

       It's all a show.

      <p>
       Obamacare= Romneycare= Heritage Foundation think tank recommended policy, to combat US citizens from realizing that single payer is better throughout every other first world industrial country in the world, and is better and cheaper, especially in the long run.  What we have instead, is a gift to the healthcare system by providing citizens a minimum of what they expect in care and services, huge increases in Rx drugs with no cost limits... it was all a sham.  The GOP secretly love our system.  Anyway, this is the way I see what's happening.

       He's only been in office for 6 months, and if what you are saying is true... then why did you vote for him? I didn't, I didn't vote for anyone. You wanna know why? Because it doesn't fuckin' matter. This country has been bought and owned since 1871, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, maybe he is just using reverse psychology, while he gets his ducks in a row? Either way, meh.. I could care less. This country is far too gone.

       I voted for him because they presented him as an alternative to the obvious choice of HRC who had been bred for this role for so long...
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the way, the Oligarchs noticed that their groomed "first female president" puppet had lost pubic support throughout the years...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in typical fashion, all they do is re-write the script. We have a "self made billionaire" who "defeated the establishment", and even promises to jail his opponent!

       Bottom line, how do you not see that this is all a circus and theatre?

       Hopefully he will but you can't honestly expect him to do everything in his first 6 months while being attacked by the establishment and shadow gov daily. He's done some great things which are being ignored and overlooked. The war against him is clear evidence that he isn't a puppet President. Good things will happen over the next 4-8 years.

       I think he is a Russian puppets myself, I think Putin used him to basically make the US look poor and create distrust and chaos. Although I don't think trump necessarily went along with this and probably was just used by Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also could have been an intentional wild card, acting like he isn't a puppet, while really being planted with the intent he will he removed after doing crazy shit. Whoever is in charge could basically say to him go run crazy and destroy the chance of a real populist leader emerging in the next few decades and can be used to argue against there stronghold on the election system.

       Maybe it's the 81 comment karma from a 2 month old account. If you want a tip, you guys need to buy some older accounts or farm them yourselves over some time to make them seem like genuine people before you start advertising products or wanting to force narrative.

       A  lot of times when you have questions like this you can  type the question into your favorite search engine and get the answer you are looking for. (most use Google of course, but you really should use startpage.com or DuckDuckGo to better protect your privacy)

       I had to do this a while back when someone in the comment section accused another of
       <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sealioning">
        Sealioning
       </a>
       ..I have been on the internet since before there was even a world wide web and even someone like me can't keep up on all the terms that the internet invents.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, the consensus is that
       <a href="https://www.indy100.com/article/this-comic-is-the-most-apt-description-of-twitter-youll-ever-see--eJ4E7Y6Sre">
        this cartoon strip is behind the actual origin of the term "SeaLioning"
       </a>
       in case you are wondering why the term is named the way it is...

       I've never heard the term Sealioning. But I have heard "fapping" a lot, on the internet. I didn't know what it meant. Someone made a post about it on this subreddit last night, so I finally did a search for the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yikes! I'm glad I looked it up and learned what it meant before I used it in public, asking someone! Yikes!

       Trump has been and always will be about himself and his legacy. He will say and do anything to the ends of his greed and pride. I'm just sorry you and so many other voters had to figure this out about him this way. :/

       Lol you still don't understand how the social engineers "select" their puppets do you?

       The election itself is a giant opportunity to create political tension between the parties.

       The oligarchs knew that the "resistance" expected Hillary to be the puppet. They spy on us, read out emails, PM's and texts. So they threw us a curveball.

       Yes, this is
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       conspiracy forum, where people discuss conspiracies and usually provide
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       in support of those theories. Something you seem to be incapable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to see you prove that the electoral system is rigged. I don't know why you're sitting on hard evidence of this, information such as that would be highly valuable and important to a lot of people. Maybe it's because you can't prove it. Maybe it's because you're full of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a place where you can throw out wild claims and then look down on those who challenge you while you provide zero evidence. That's

       ...and we'll be saying the exact same thing 4 or 8 years from now. The president's job isn't to wield power, it's to distract from it. His only job is to follow the orders of our true masters. We all need to wake up and realize the problem isn't whichever figure head we put in that chair. The problem is the entire system has been corrupted on not only a national, but a global scale.

       But who are the "true masters"?
      </p>
      <p>
       To feminists it is the patriarchy, to socialists it is the capitalists, to conservatives it is the liberals, to conspiracy theorists it is the lizard people. and to natsocs it is the Jews.

       It's those with a vast amount of wealth and power who are working for their own self interests, and the interests of others with vast amounts of wealth and power. It's those who have stated publicly that they are working towards the goal of a new world order. It's those who are permanent members of the Bilderberg group. It's those who attend Bohemian Grove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who control the flow of money are the ones who influence, and in many cases actually draft legislature to benefit themselves at the cost of everyday people like you and me. They take advantage if the fact that presidential campaigns get more and more expensive each election cycle. Nobody gets elected without owing big favors to very powerful people. This is the reason Trump/Obama/Bush seemed to do a 180 after they were elected. It's because they had to go against their moral scruples because, well, they owed somebody. They were put in office due to favors, and they will inevitably have to repay said favors. Do you think that these corporations are dumping millions and millions of dollars into presidential campaigns because they want to "make America great again?" No, they're investing in favors.

       People need to realize that we need to unite and take our lives back, our resources back, our technology back, and organizations back. At this point, the cabal printed lots of money and bought all this shit off. We have become fucking slaves to them.

       How many of these empty fuck-all threads are we gonna have here?  You know nothing of his intent based on 6 months he's been in office.  You have no inside knowledge.  Meeting with Kissinger, knowing Epstein, and appointing questionable cabinet officials are all things we could say about most candidates and certainly about Hillary.  You feeling insecure about your presidential choice is NOT a conspiracy. Fucking shut up already.

       I dont really think he has done a 180. I think hes keeping enough promises to maintain his support.
      </p>
      <p>
       End of the day though, if he doesnt break down Hillary and Obama and show the world their lies and makes them accountable for their actions he will go down as a huge fraud of a man and his legacy will be dead before it even begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as he doesnt go to war with anyone a President / administration really cant do enough damage in 4 years that we cant recover from.

       Hopefully he will but you can't honestly expect him to do everything in his first 6 months while being attacked by the establishment and shadow gov daily. He's done some great things which are being ignored and overlooked. The war against him is clear evidence that he isn't a puppet President. Good things will happen over the next 4-8 years.

       Obama had a similar effect on me, on the opposite end of the spectrum. Trump has been in the same DC elite circles for decades now.

       OP youre a shitlord and retard and everyone here knows all politicians left and right are bought and sold actors for their corporate overlords this is r/conspiracy not r/bornyesterday; nice divide and conquer tactic, posing as a trumpette and pretending to be disgruntled, very innovative. Trump isnt going to do shit about human trafficking hes been to pervert island with Epstein. The status quo will continue because people are now being conditioned more than ever to worship the state.  Suck on that government titty for your shitty UBI, depend on their generosity with your socialized health care, eat their subsidized GMO food, work as a drone writing parking tickets, take your holidays in Vegas, and die at 60 due to a heart attack.

       youre shit is old homes, seen it on 4 chan. Tried and true shareblue tactic, anounce your political affiliation then renounce it and try to get others to do the same (through brigading) Then it appears to the average reader that people agree with you and that Trump is losing steam. There is a mutiny afoot and the tides are turning against him. Truth is you better buckle up because just like GWB and Obama, this ride isnt ending for another 7 years. He's the globalist puppet just like the one that came before him, you bought into the politics and got conned, welcome to the club, its called the "Hey at least its not Hillary" club and I'm the president.

       Not doing anything about human trafficking?  Have you not seen the more than 2,000 trafficking arrests since he took office?  The largest trafficking arrests in US history have happened under Trump.  Not to mention the politically connected who have been arrested on CP charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to see your proof that Trump went to pedo-island.  I know they knew each other and ran in some of the same circles but, I've never heard the claim that Trump actually went to the island.

       I agree with all the other stuff though, the American Dream has become a living nightmare.

       The way I see it is that the whole system is fucking corrupt. Trump may have had good intentions while running for office, but I'm sure once POTUS is sworn in he meets his boss amd sees the reality of how America is really controlled,I wouldn't doubt their lives are immediately threatened if the don't carry out the same agenda as the one before.There's a really big secret that they know which would shatter the reality of the paradigm we think we live in.

       You do realize that the president is not a dictator right?  He can't just snap his fingers and get done everything he campaigned on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, I'm not a fan of some of his cabinet choices (maybe half), but he needs people on the inside to get stuff done.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you expect a president to get his agenda through when half of his own party said they would
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       work with him?  The Russian sanctions bill passed both houses almost unanimously but the Republicans can't repeal the ACA after bitching about it for 7 years?  Give me a break, they never wanted it repealed because they're funded by the same.people as the Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been six months since he took office, that's twice as long as this BS account you're using for concern trolling, and he's already accomplished quite a few things he campaigned on (immigration, trade deals, TPP, Paris Climate Agreement, cracking down on gangs, shrinking the federal government...)

       I wish people would read this shit! This shit, this shit right here is why President Camacho won! Not because of the army of hidden racists crawling out from under the floorboards, or the mother fucking Russians! You want this shit to stop? It is the deeply flawed VOTING SYSTEM! That's it, that's all, nothing more, nothing less. Read this mother fucking article! Fuck Fuckity Fuck FUCK! Whew... have a nice day.

       There are greater things happening than most see. The Jesuits are behind Mr. Trump, and recent moves by world elites seem oddly coordinated in enacting the next Dark Ages.

       Health Care not going through is not President Trump's fault. I blame that on the Republicans. They had years to work on something. But they did nothing until the last minute.

       Give me a break, you still believe politics are real? It's all a sham 100% complete theater just like WWE. Trump literally performed for WWE. They are all actors.
