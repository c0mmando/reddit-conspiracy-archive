       Not just land, there are more than enough vacant homes to cover all of the US's homeless population as well. We don't even need to build homes for our homeless, we just have to actually let them live in those homes which are going to waste.

       Laws that limit the impact of outside of the area investors is a good starting point. In my area, we are seeing a bunch of out of state investment firms buying up prime housing, and it doesn't benefit the city at all.

       It's not that simple. Sure, there are abandoned houses all over the place. The real question is what would the neighbors do if homeless people were to live in those houses? Most likely they would move out which would destroy a lot of land value which would translate into tax revenues falling. Even if you help homeless people out, give them clothes, a job and whatnot, it won't change the perception of other people and I don't have a reason to assume otherwise. Wishful thinking about social issues is not my strong side.

       Also you have to look at what made the people homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may have been unlucky and had a perfect storm of events like loss of job, mixed with medical, and maybe another issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe they are vets with severe ptsd and cannot hold down a job, or work in certain settings.

       Or maybe they are drug addicts who spend their money on drugs, don't give a fuck about their body let alone their home.  These people may not take carr of their home, rob their neighbors for drug money, or just be more of an issue for where they live.

       I would love to help those that deserve it(see first two examples) but some times people don't deserve the help or don't want to help themselves.

       There's a lot of factors that go into all of this, some you stated and some I did.  Many people are quick to react and don't step back and look at all of the consequences.

       While your points are valid, they don't matter when it comes to neighborhoods. Once people hear there are houses for homeless people, they will immediately form an opinion and pass it along to others while decorating it with assumptions. Rationality doesn't scale well.

       Oh not disagreeing with that.   Also how many people will be pissed they had to work 40hrs or more a week to afford their home but someone else who fucked up in life gets a freeby.

       There would need to be rules, regulations, and some sort of payback into the system to keep it going.

       Some thing like giving homes away, and most likely fixing them up first, will cost money.  This money is going to have to come from some where, and I don't think the military wants to cough up any of their budget, and I dont know abkut you but paying higher taxes on top of what I already pay plus my student loans will make it so I need to get one of these free homes real fast.

       If you consider yourself an investor and your home is your only investment and equity, perhaps it's time to diversify. Real estate is not a solid market for investment, it's a long term game, and youre going to have major problems with your portfolio when the market resets itself (and it will reset itself) if your home is the only thing in there.

       Michael Savage has the best solution. Homeless villages. Where they have to work and provide for themselves. Basic housing provided and they have to build it themselves to a point. They have to garden, clean, raise chickens or whatever self sufficient community does. So much money is being wasted on the homeless 'programs' which in reality is going into deep pockets of you already know who. That money would be more than enough to buy some land, turn it into a village type atmosphere, and get the homeless there. If they refuse to get their asses of the streets, then it's either mental institution or jail. Hard working people in the cities have worked hard to create those sidewalks and streets, and they deserve to not be harassed when they get out of their homes as well as stoops free of homeless piss and shit.

       So your solution to this would be more government control over all means of production? Hmmm, so you advocate for a centralized authority to oversee the production of all industries creating a new class of elites that are equally oppressive? How revolutionary comrade!! Tell me more!!

       Homeless people don't have capital to get property. Do you own property? If so, then just let 12 bums come live in it for free. No? Why not? You are not allocating your resources for the collective good. Everybody wants everyone else to do something when they aren't willing to.do.it themselves. They really just want government to.do it with a gun.

       There is plenty of land, water and resources for the Earths current population and then some. The matter is politics, allocations, class and monetary systems which gets it the way so subsequently food gets thrown away in places of surplus which never reached those of famine.

       I would actually like that as another topic for a round table discussion. The overpopulation narrative seems to be the backbone of so much ideology that we really ought to shine a light on it and inspect its merits.
      </p>
      <p>
       What causes population growth? What would be a stable rate of growth? How many resources are there really and where are we just wasting them? How can we foster prosperity around the world without exploding or imploding our population numbers uncontrollably? Is growth necessary or can there be a stable population with more or less continuous numbers?

       Civilizations have fallen by going over the carrying capacity of their environment due to overpopulation. The only way it fixed itself, is if the people moved somewhere else making it stable or if some people simply died out. I am not sure how likely a world resource war will be, but I have an outrageous theory that might make some people laugh. The people effected by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Vesvius many centuries ago, lived in a city decorated with carvings (?) Architecture of male penises spread across some parts of the city that served a purpose like billboards do today. Why? Will they needed to gain an army to defend themselves, so they promoted sexual relations with these "bill boards" in hopes of increasing the population. The more kids you had, and that joined the army, the well off the parents would be as in recongized as some type of noble (Not sure what the appropriate term is). I saw a comment on a subreddit questioning why tv/movie sex scenes have become more explicit rather than just a couple seconds and it made me wonder besides appealing to the audiences' sexual interest, maybe in a way it is a modern way of getting people to fuck and reminding them to get BUSY subconciously or not. I mean subliminal messages are not exactly out there. (I could be wrong on this information).

       I have read another theory, which is essentially the opposite of yours. It theorizes that the purpose of this is to get to the point where the user preferred to be stimulated by the screen as opposed to having actual sex.

       What does that have to do with my comment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finite amount of drinking water. I would say that depends on your perspective. Is there a finite amount of water on Earth? Yes, we certainly aren't creating more water. However, the water you drink isn't destroyed by that process either. You urinate the water, and it is eventually evaporated back into the atmosphere. So I would say that our natural water recycling system dictates that the amount isn't necessarily finite.

       I agree with the first half of your statement.  If you look at certain countries they may not have a large population, but they have more people than their resources allow for.  Back in nomadic times if you didn't have food you wandered around looking for it(aka not enough resources in your area so you left).
      </p>

       As for the last half, it could be a new age version of the penis billboard, or we could just have a society that's more accepting of sex.  We are more open about it.  Do I enjoy it, of course.  Do I think some shows and movies test the limits , Yuppp.   I cringe a little and move on.

       Well you can also have discussion and educational talks with the kids so they understand the consequences of sex and other aspects of it.

       Used to teach and the things kids would say and think about sex was crazy.  I used to think my high school sex ed teacher was joking when he said "people believe they can't get pregnant if the female is on top" or she won't get pregnant if she doesn't have an orgasm.

       That's an important point. I'd say it's certainly worth striving for, but it seems to me that most critical resources would still largely be sourced from earth for up to several centuries into a colonizing effort. For example, if we could simply start to migrate to off planet colonies, most of the food and water for a big enough colony would like still be taken from here and sent there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, it might not offer any immediate relief, if resource scarcity is our problem already. I'm not convinced that's actually the case though. To me it's less about scarcity than it is about waste and inefficiency.

       I have to agree with you there. Water is certainly going to be one of the most sought after resources, but even then, we are finding sources outside our own planet. No reason to think that won't apply to other resources. Metals will be tricky and I think Musk got it right by suggesting we mine asteroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, the bottom line is: the movers and shakers in our society are neither using resources efficiently nor are they applying them where they will make the most positive difference to all humanity. We will continue to live in an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' until we can let go of greed and self-serving natures.

       I'd start by researching where this "overpopulation" idea even came from... you'll learn all about Thomas Malthus and his modern neo-Malthusian followers. During your research it's important to investigate what their motivations were in the first place (certainly not altruistic intentions). Then read about how they've been wrong at every step. They theorized we'd never make it past 1 billion people as the earths "carrying capacity" wouldn't allow it, they were wrong, then it was 2 billion, wrong again, then 6 billion, wrong wrong wrong, now they're saying the exact same thing today and they're still wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is rooted in totalitarian control of resources which is why they want you to think of resources as "limited" which is also a lie, nothing in this universities is limited physics 101 matter can be neither created or destroyed only modified and we have the technology to modify almost everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're overpopulated?? By what measure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not enough land? Bullshit put everyone on earth shoulder to shoulder and they make a literal pin drop on a world map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not enough water?? Bullshit 70% of the earths surface is water and we have the tech to make it all drinkable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not enough food?? Bullshit we already create enough food to feed 12 BILLION people it's about allocation not shortage. Plus we are still for the most part using extremely dated farming techniques. No matter your views on Israel politically they have extremely efficient farming which if we modeled globally there would be so much abundance of food we'd need to scale back or have massive waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damage to environment? Well this sub doesn't believe in global warming but if it did that's still a BS excuse because we have the technology to use 100% clean energy and if we would've continued nuclear development instead of appeasing the hippies we'd have cold fusion by now which means unlimited energy. It's a matter of priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the question is by what measure are we overpopulated?? We have plenty of everything we need and could have much much more if we coordinated as a human race.

       Thank you for the response. I will look up Thomas Malthus, as I am not familiar with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, I think that it is a mistake to say that we have plenty of resources, based on the way things could be done. So for instance, when you mention that we have the tech to make ocean water drinkable, I agree with you. But do we have the tech to make that process efficient. From what I understand, the answer is no. Water desalination on a massive scale, isn't yet possible, from what I've read. A lot of what you have mentioned is not the actual reality right now. You said yourself that matter is neither created nor destroyed, only modified. Physics 101, I agree. By its very nature then, resources are limited. We live on a finite planet with finite resources. The way we currently utilize those resources, dictates how many people could be supported by them. It certainly holds true that to use those resources more efficiently would make it possible to support more people, but I personally find that to be too hypothetical. In any case that's just my opinion, and I'm certainly open to the idea that I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as by what measure do I consider us to be overpopulated. This is anecdotal, but to me it's simply a matter of the fact that I can't go anywhere without running into other people. I'm big into the outdoors. I like to camp in a national forest near me atleast once a month, usually more. Even there, it is impossible not to run into other people.

       There have been studies that say we could end world hunger at a cost of 30 billion dollars annually.
      </p>
      <p>
       We spend 600+ billion annually on the military. We could cut our military budget by 5%, end world hunger with the money saved, and still spend 400 billion dollars more annually than the #2 highest military spender, China. We could end world hunger and still afford to spend over twice as much on our military as China.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that money is not allowed to be spent on productive things that help human society. That money is only allowed to be used for destruction and death. The military indutstrial complex makes great profit on selling bombs, they wouldn't make a dime on actually and completely resolving concrete issues like that.

       Your initial statement sounds harsh but is correct.   We have enough food now, but if we continue to feed people, they will be able to have more kids, and then more mouths to feed, then more kids, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there's other factors that come with population increase.  I'm not saying we need to go all Georgia guide stones and limit our population a lot, but we do need to think things through.

       I don't think we should worry about population increase, instead we should figure out how to explore and colonize space (anything outside our own planet basically). We will need people to do this and when people leave for wherever, we will have more room on this planet. Seems like a win to me.

       The space exploration would benefit in many ways, potentially.  We could look for a new place to live.  We could also find new resources potentially.  Or hell while researching ways to live in space we may find ways to make life on earth better.

       It's not entirely the overpopulation that's a reason behind climate, but rather overconsumption. Take the US vs India for example. India has the higher population by nearly 3 times, but the US consumes more.
       <br/>
       What would be so wrong with letting some people live longer and have kids if they were to have a small carbon footprint by living off their own land, growing their own food, consuming the bare minimal? It's a reasonable assumption on paper to say "more kids = bad for climate", but when you give it context it's actually not an accurate assumption. There's so many variables to address, and consumerism is one that's too frequently overlooked. People gotta learn to live sustainably!

       I was trying to make a similar point, that there's a lot of factors and variables to take into account, when people make statements like we can give homes to every one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a lot of people look at one fact(I see this at my job with marketing people all the time) and just run with it before getting all the info.  Especially if it suits their needs.

       Ok being sarcastic here but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that someone took and ideology and molded it to suit their needs, exploit people, and fuck over a whole different group?  Never in my life did I think that possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok back to normal discussion.  Now I get what you are saying and know of examples.  I'm not saying we kill off entire groups of people, becauer they are different or don't help society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more saying we need to look at all of the benefits and consequences of our actions. In this case giving people food because we have all of this extra stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for helping where I can and making the world better but our actions do have consequences no matter how good they are.  Do I think one entire group or country should be allowed to die no, but if they keep making poor choices on what crops they grow or putting their resources to work in ways that do not help them(like destroying farm land to build factories) then maybe they need to re think their priorities before they get outside help.  Now lets say a big storm or earthquake devastates a country and they lose the ability to farm or transport food for a while then I am all for helping.
      </p>
      <p>
       As stated in other responses there are a lot of factors that go into the decision factors for giving food to a country.  Its much like when I give a friend money.  Have I given them money before?  Did they spend that money before wisely?  Is it going towards a b.s. thing?  Do I think they will be able to help me out later down the road if I'm ever in a shit situation?  I won't just give them the money because its the right thing to do, or because they claim it will go towards their kids eating or school supplies.

       ‡≤†_‡≤† 
is also my reaction to such ignorance/elitism (come on dude that wrote that, what is this crap??).
The brainwashed people who think "fuck the poor because they have too many kids and I'm more important"
need to realize what shitty divide and conquer trap they just fell in.
Don't think like the parasite elites, fuck their opinions.
The elites socially engineer ALMOST EVERYTHING.
And yet the elites want us to be concerned about
"overpopulation"....well they should have thought about that before
increasing worldwide poverty which directly increases the population.
And they should have thought about that before injecting crappy
propaganda in daily life:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Music industry ("drugs, sex, cars, money honey"),
       </li>
       <li>
        TV ("TWERK DAT ASS YO")
       </li>
       <li>
        big pharma ("you need anti depressants! Oh and 100000% of those who don't learn the establishment way has ADHD! COME GET MEDICATED")
       </li>
       <li>
        Hollywood ("Pyschopath desensitising gore and sex sells, also fuck empathy")
       </li>
       <li>
        Food industry ("come and gets some near nutrition-empty sweets with cancer causing chemicals, YUM!!!")
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Education system 
("YOU WANT MORE FUNDING? LOGIC, POLITICAL SCIENCE, FINANCE AND ETHICS TAUGHT?? How dare you question the lobbyists' curriculum! YOU
GET NOTHING, YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY SIRR")
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Financial-corporate-military system (rigging the entire system to fuck the poor for the benefit of the fat cat elites)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I was going to make a point about
how tax is used badly deliberately (not to mention black budgets and aid to the corrupt Israeli government)
and that
increasing the socialism to capitalism ratio
would benefit us all and cost a lot less
than all the money/suffering that this shitty system has caused over 30+ years....
but then I realized, it would be a waste
with how many brainwashed people we have here even in /conspiracy.
If there are people/and or shills saying
"eradicating world hunger is a terrible idea"
then damn I'm wasting my breath.
I'm not religious, but Jesus would be disappointed.
Come on people, have more empathy.
Come back to the light side!

      <pre><code> Intuitively, that seems to make sense, but it is incorrect. Census data will tell you that the countries with the lowest per capita incomes tend to have the highest birth rates, while the richest countries tend to have to lowest.
 This is The Gates Foundation's stated purpose for vaccination programs in underdeveloped areas (I said "stated" purpose). He believes that lowering the mortality rates in these areas will contribute to lower birthrates because people won't need to compensate as much for their children dying.

       The cabal isn't interested in ending world hunger. They have the whole economy on volume control. If they wanted to, they could raise the entire economy to sky high levels but the problem is, they don't want to.

       The only solution is to kick their asses out or simply get off the money system using Sacred Economics here:

       It's mind blowing how much land there is just in the US alone that's not being used. There's hundred mile stretches of nothing. Literally no civilization just some huts on the side of the road. I never would've believed it myself till I drove through some of the middle states. Really makes you wonder what the game is here. Why aren't these areas being built up? I mean could you imagine the jobs that would be needed? Oh well there goes unemployment. Need a job? Go help build one of the 20 cities we are starting. Yes I say it in a simplified way but shit go drive through Missouri, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Kansas. Just tons and tons of land not being used. What a waste.

       Food, water, and power are given to us by nature, in abundance, and I think one of the basic functions of government is to provide the infrastructure that delivers it for free to everyone. If utopia was the goal, we could get there, but we've got some twisted people up there

       Forget the military budget. America alone WASTES 35 million tons of food a year. $165 billion worth, enough to feed the entire world's population 5.5x over.

       Though, people don't starve because there is a lack of means to produce enough food themselves due to being 'inferior'. People starve because certified psychopaths put sanctions on developing countries creating massive famine issues.
