    <div class="md"><p>It always creeped me out a little. Felt contrived, it obviously was contrived, but it felt like a fear based programming. As most of the episodes had life threatening choices. Abortion, teen sex, and homosexuality had a life threatening stigma attached to it.  Shows like these were designed to alter our generations views on these subjects. </p>

<p>Part and parcel of a government education, they social engineer each generation and this is how they do it, they hardly need books anymore.</p>

<p>You mean like how the episode about aids was one of the first times the issue was covered on television? Or how the newly pregnant character went on to become on of the most popular in the series&#39; history?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stole someone else work because I can&#39;t be bothered writing all of it and to make sure I don&#39;t miss anything. </p>

<p>&quot;He was responsible, working with NASA, to many significant achievements in the exploration of space, and some of our most groundbreaking discoveries regarding our Solar System, which have inspired the missions which fruits of we have just recently began to harvest.</p>

<p>He was the first to suggest that Venus&#39;s climate was far from being tropical but rather has a &quot;hellish&quot; surface temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit and a crushing atmosphere, based on radio emissions. NASA&#39;s Mariner expeditions confirmed this.</p>

<p>He has correctly deduced color variations on Mars as an indication of wind storms. Mariner 9 and Viking expeditions to Mars during the &#39;70s confirmed this.</p>

<p>As a member of the Mariner 9 imaging team he helped select the landing sites for Viking 1 and Viking 2, the first successful orbiting and landing missions on the red planet.</p>

<p>In addition to many other aspects of these planets of which they made us aware of, both studies taught us a lot about global warming, and are relevant then ever before.</p>

<p>Sagan was also a member of the science teams selected by NASA for Pioneer 10 and 11, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn, and - OF COURSE - for Voyager 1 and 2, which visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and took the first photographs of the solar system from beyond Pluto. Later on it would become the first man made device to leave the solar system and travel interstellar space, carrying with it the Voyager Golden Record - our &quot;message in the bottle&quot; to other civilizations, which Sagan partook in shaping.&quot;</p>

<p>He also made the show Cosmos, which is one of the reasons I&#39;m so fascinated by space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite quotes to drop on people is by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a></p>

<p>Final Proof of the Non-Existence of God</p>

<p>God, creating the Universe, as illustrated by the Guide.</p>

<p>The Final Proof of the non-Existence of God was proved by a Babel Fish.</p>

<p>Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some have chosen to see it as the final proof of the NON-existence of God. The argument goes something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;I refuse to prove that I exist,&quot; says God, &quot;for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; says Man, &quot;the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn&#39;t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves that You exist, and so therefore, by Your own arguments, You don&#39;t. QED&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; says God, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What general wavelength would this be? Science that has mountains of evidence to back it up and can be demonstrated and observed before your very eyes? </p>

<p>What&#39;s the truth then? What&#39;s your theory? Also, if you could please elaborate on your evidence, it would be appreciated. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight. </p>

<p>Bills explaining basic climate science knowledge to tucker. Bill is answering Tuckers questions as he is presenting them. 
Tucker responds with shouting at him and claiming he&#39;s not answering the question. </p>

<p>Please explain to me what I&#39;m missing here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill didn&#39;t answer one question. He asked him plain and simple, how much are people actually effecting the rate of climate change. Bill dances around the questions and avoids answering them, Bills only answer is &quot;I know the answer&quot;. Have you seen his new tv show? He tried claiming that it&#39;s scientifically PROVEN there are more then two genders. I&#39;m all for being who you wanna be, buts that&#39;s a hell of a claim. </p>

<p>Again, fuck all to do with climate change. </p>

<p>I edited my previous comment to answer your question. But again, how does bill not knowing the exact % of the rate make him wrong? Explain that please? 
Do you think 98% of climate scientists are wrong? Or somehow less smart than you? Just because Tucker screams &quot;HAA YOU DONT KNOW THAT ANSWER HAHAH YOURE WRONG&quot; literally means nothing. Bill was giving a basic explanation of what climate change is. It&#39;s not his fault that you don&#39;t understand it. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that I agree nor disagree with anything that was said in that video. I&#39;m just saying that &quot;I know the answer to that&quot; is not a sufficient answer to any question&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He answered what some of the world would look like without human intervention, which was one of tuckers answers. Why is not knowing the rate % mean he&#39;s lying?</p>

<p>Please read up on climate change. Please. 
It&#39;s real. It&#39;s terrifying. It&#39;s getting worse. For the sake of your offspring and their offspring, read on it. You don&#39;t need to understand the exact science. Just watch a video on it. </p>

<p>Climate change has literally caused near world extinctions millions of years ago. </p>

<p>I leave with this point, say the religious science deniers and the corporations who are trying to protect their interests are right, and climate change is &quot;fake&quot;, then what is their to lose? At the very least, this has brought about innovation and growth in the renewable industry, which helps the planet in many different ways. </p>

<p>But say the religious science deniers and the corporations are wrong, and we&#39;re right (which evidence form 98% of world scientists claims we are), then it doesn&#39;t bare thinking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Countless other videos hahah. You know Bills not even an actual scientist? He&#39;s just a very educated guy. He tells people time and time again to ask actual climate scientists questions he doesn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But anyway, I&#39;ll accept your question.</p>

<p>Bill says &quot;fine you wanna know the %? It&#39;s 100%&quot;. It&#39;s actually probably more than that, but it&#39;s difficult to answer such a silly question. </p>

<p>Bill O&#39;Riley does these stupid tactics as well. Scream an obscure, hard to answer question that someone may not know and then keep shouting the same question over and over again to validate your &quot;point&quot;. </p>
