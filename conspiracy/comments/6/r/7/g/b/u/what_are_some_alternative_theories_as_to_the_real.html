       The widely accepted reason for the Vietnam was is that was a battle of idealism between capitalists and communists. Another was that is was a show of strength, or perhaps battle practice, between the 2 most powerful superpowers on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are some other reasons, maybe involving deep state or illumiati?

       One widely accepted view is that it was a gift to France. France lost almost all of its colonies during WWII. The Vietnamese communists worked along the US in fighting the Japanese. After the war the Vietnamese communists were given weapons by the US military and guarded Japanese prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the British showed up they were like, "Why the hell did you give these people weapons." and took them away. Then the French returned and tried to take control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The French fought the Vietnamese for a decade but lost. Once they lost the US moved in and took their place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vietnam was mostly about colonialism.

       The real reason the war broke out I can't speak to, but I always felt the war in Vietnam had multiple players pulling the strings to prolong it. The Military Industrial Complex was using it as a testing ground for their new toys, the politicians were using it as political capitol to prop themselves up and rile up their base. The drug czars (those within our government and outside) were using the conflict as a way to move drugs around the world quickly and cheaply. Opportunists will always flock to areas where human suffering is common and exploit it.

       In the 1950's a method of undersea oil exploration was perfected which used small explosions deep in the water and then recorded the sound echoes bouncing off the various layers of rock below. The surveyor could then determine the exact location of the arched salt domes which hold the accumulated oil beneath them. But if this method were used off the Vietnam coast on property Standard didn't own or have the rights to, the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the Japanese and probably even the French would quickly run to the United Nations and complain that America was stealing the oil, and that would shut down the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 1964, after Vietnam was divided into North and South, and the contrived Gulf of Tonkin incident, several U.S. aircraft carriers were stationed offshore of Vietnam and the 'war' was started. Every day jet planes would take off from the carriers, bomb locations in North and South Vietnam, and then using normal military procedure when returning would dump their unsafe or unused bombs in the ocean before landing back on the carriers. Safe ordnance drop zones were designated for this purpose away from the carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Even close-up observers would only notice many small explosions occurring daily in the waters of the South China Sea and thought it was only part of the 'war.' The U.S. Navy carriers had begun Operation Linebacker One, and Standard Oil had begun its ten year oil survey of the seabed off of Vietnam. And the Vietnamese, Chinese and everybody else around, including the Americans, were none the wiser. The oil survey hardly cost Standard Oil a nickel, the U.S. taxpayers paid for it."

       The two main outputs of heroin are the "golden triangle" and "golden crescent". The triangle being in Afghanistan and triangle in vietnam. Us army herne also were caught smuggling heroin under coffins of dead gis. I also think it had a lot to do with military industrial complex. Someone made a fortune off of the prolonged war. Very similar to Afghanistan today. Commis or taliban, just a different flavor.

       My understanding from college course was that Vietnam was a huge resource for rubber and was going to jack the price up, therefore crippling US tire manufacturers and the whole auto industry as well. Can't have that.

       Britain reconquered their colonies, completed with the assassination of JFK. This was done beginning in the late 1800 with Cecil Rhodes and the Round Table groups, continued with the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, John Birch Society, and other anglophile groups controlling most of American policy.

       At the end of WWII, Roosevelt and Stalin were going to carve up the imperial empires, particularly the British Empire. FDR died, with Stalin suspicious he was poisoned. Truman had no backbone, and didn't insist on breaking up their empire. Eisenhower went along, but by the end had realized what was going on (his "military-industrial complex" speech), and warned everyone.

       The war in Vietnam was about opposing communism, but it was also about preserving colonial empires and stopping nationalist movements that would resist the supranational control by the bankers.

       It's because of how Ho Chi Minh change the entire course of the revolution and how to turn a seemingly idealogical revolution into an actual nationalistic revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This scare the TPTB much, MUCH more than just a normal revolution since it seems that Ho Chi Minh can never be corrupted OR radicalized and so did the rest of his team. And if Vietnam grown to be a superpower all by their own (which they very well might be if the US doesnt jump onto Vietnam after the French left), what stops Cuba, Korea or other colony to just follow their footstep and rival the US power, and start to open up the world by their own?

       Yeah I think so. Basically no one except high school teachers accept that Vietnam was about stopping communism.
