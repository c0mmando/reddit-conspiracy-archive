        It's a Brennan operation. It was an American disinformation operation fucking the fucking president. And at one point they even started telling the press, they were back-briefing the press, the head of the NSA was going and telling the press - fucking cocksucker Rogers - was telling the press that we even know who in the Russian military intelligence service leaked it.

       I'm saying it's an unproven claim. Hersh made the claim based on his sources, but notably hasn't written them. Sources and info have to be more heavily checked before he'd have enough faith to write a story and make the claim public, and as a pulitzer winner you know he's a good journalist. A claim made when caught on tape off the record isn't necessarily based on good information

       There are many Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalists that are backing and reporting the IC's conclusions regarding Russian hacking and election interference. Eric Lipton of the NYT and the WSJ Staff, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seymour Hersh, the journalist at issue here (whose word you are willing to accept without question while attempting to claim that you're the skeptic and we are the sheeple) has had some high highs and some low lows in his career. His book on JFK includes some very out-there fabrications, for example. He has also falsely claimed that US soldiers were raping small boys in the Middle East. And he has admitted that he does not apply the same standard of truth and accuracy to his speeches and oral reporting as his applies to his written work.

       You're clearly trying to portray yourself as a person thinking more critically about this issue than those who accept the mainstream consensus. Except that, in reality, like most conspiracy theorists, you're thinking about the issue at hand less critically than the mainstream, because you're eager to accept any narrative that runs counter to the traditionally accepted view. Specifically, here, you've argued for crediting the conclusion of a single journalist (with a noted propensity for exaggerating and fabricating stories), over the conclusions of the IC, the many private-sector security service companies that investigated that matter, and the many investigative journalists of equal or better repute than Seymour Hersh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, you've extrapolated Hersh's statements to reach non-sequitur conclusions. Even if Hersh were correct that Seth Rich leaked DNC emails to the wikileaks, that certainly would not foreclose the possibility that Russian intelligence services also gained access to and distributed DNC files. Moreover, even if Seth Rich were proven to be the sole source of the DNC materials, that would not prove that the IC lied in its report, but rather that they were incorrect.

       I don't need you to say, "I am a skeptic and you are sheeple" in order for me to conclude that this is how you perceive and present yourself in relation to the mainstream. I can ascertain this from your strident and anti-establishment arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of derailment, you're clearly trying to avoid addressing the substantive points I've made regarding the flaws in your logic and the non-sequitur nature of your conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, by what chain of logic and evidence to you get from (A) one often discredited journalist claims to know someone who has seen information indicating that Seth Rich supplied DNC emails to wikileaks, to (B) the entire IC lied to all of America? As Whitney Houston once said, "Show me the receipts, Diane!"

       Ignoring the Seth Rich aspect of the clip, there's evidence for the leak theory, whereas there's no evidence for the hack theory.  Incredibly, none of the "Intelligence Agencies" would even be permitted to testify in court on the subject, because none of them have 'personal knowledge' owing to the fact that they never even examined the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly impossible to overstate how giant of a red flag it is that the FBI didn't collect the server.  I'd be less surprised if I gave my dog a whole bag of treats and he ate one and prudently decided to save the rest for later.

       That's exactly what happened.  Bush and Cheney were going to war no matter what.  There was a huge scandal because Valerie Plame, a CIA agent, and her husband Joseph Wilson, an ambassador, were very critical of the WMD claim, so the White House decided to out her, effectively ending her career.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had a fall guy convicted of obstruction of justice, Scooter Libby, and of course he never spent a day in jail because Bush commuted his sentence.

       The worst part about that claim? When made it sounded to me like bullshit. Why would 17 agencies have such overlap. That is extremely inefficient and makes no sense. When I looked up the list it was clearly hyperbole at best and a outright falsehood designed to build confidence at worst.

       So kind of like what you're doing right now?  Any organic user in here knows that the amount of heavily anti-Trump, pro-liberal, pro-MSM viewpoints that have been pushed in the sub lately are fucking vomit-inducing and
       <em>
        definitely

       not coming from TD.  In fact it's a very well-known deflection tactic to accuse the sub of being The_Donald 2.0., because anybody that comes here regularly like I do would know that that statement is full of shit and in no way speaks for even the majority of the sub.

       A true conspiracy theorist does not get gummed up with petty distinctions of left and right when looking for the truth, because they are inherently bullshit in the first place.  We absorb information from all sources and parse out the political crap for the meat of the story.  A common sense, universal opinion of CTs is that the Democrat-Republican game is a shitshow for the plebs and always has been, it's just there to dupe the emotionally gullible, sensationalist idiots who are essentially watching a WWE match, only they think it's real.  You're definitely right that the sub has been completely taken over by partisan hacks, but your obvious political bias puts blinders on your ability to see objective reality.  Yeah there's TD trolls here and there, but they're not coming into threads specifically to police discussion and manipulate our opinions with petty attacks on the sub and our mission here, which is the find the truth at
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go into any fucking thread, pretty much anything on the front page, and look at the top rated comments and the posts that receive the vast majority of upvotes - they are almost universally attacking the central point of the post in question, pushing a mainstream viewpoint, putting down conspiracy theories or slandering the users of this sub as crazies or TD cutouts.  If you think that in any way is an organic feature of this sub, or that TD shills push the ideas I mentioned, you're out of your goddamn mind.

       Bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Immediate Release
      </p>
      <p>
       DHS Press Office
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber “hygiene” scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.

       The U.S. Intelligence Community is comprised of 17 agencies.  To this day this formal public statement, coming not from the DNC and not from Hilldawg but from the DHS Press Office and it was not published with the help of the NYT or WaPo is still readily available on the Department of Homeland Security's website.

       Well, to be fair I argued against that. It wasn't 17 agencies then and it's not 17 agencies now. IIRC it was the director of national intelligence who said it and because he speaks for 17 agencies, it was taken as "17 agencies said."

       Turns out not one of those agencies said anything.

       You're right it is hard to say. Especially since the investigation is still ongoing and certain aspects of it are classified. It is entirely possible that they just don't feel like they need access to make a case. Or at least didn't need it bad enough to go through the trouble of getting a subpoena.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also important to remember that the DNC hack is not the entirety of the case. There is also the hack of John Podesta's personal email and the propogation of fake information on social media.

       Probably not all 17,  but the FBI under Comey and even now doesn't seem to be serving the people.    Who the fuck are they serving?    Why are they protecting the DNC?    Probably just freaked that the charade in general has been exposed,  the charade of two parties,  the charade that keeps the MIC flowing in money,   and lets the top political criminals get away with murder,  literally.

       This needs to be explained apparently. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is an umbrella Office. Including the Odni there are a total of 17 agencies they oversee.
The Odni announced that 17 agencies have agreed with the assesment that Russia hacked the Dnc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres the tricky part. Most of those 17 agencies do not have the mandate, resources nor intelligence to make an accurate asseent on the matter. These would include agencies like the coast guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assesment was made by the FBI, CIA and the NSA. These agencies did have the mandate, resources and intelligence to make an accurate assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ODNI with agreement from the directors of other agencies agreed with the cia, nsa, fbi  assesment. Only 3 agencies made the assesment, which the other 14 agreed with.

       Yea sure hillary is responsible for all this! You give her and democrats too much credit. You really think they convinced every mainstream media outlet, every democratic senator and half of the republicans, the entire USIC, all of their major allys, 63% of the population and that all these russian coincidences are planted or incidental?

       That's your response? It's shows contiguous coordination across the board. One person makes the stories, and that one person is controlled by the deep state. I.e. Hillarie's people.

       You're partly right.  Local news affiliates receive national news stories from main corporate news headquarters, which they can use as filler when local news is slow, or there are not enough resources to write and produce all local stories.  The stories often come with graphics, a script template, and sometimes video.  It's not necessarily nefarious.

       I can't tell if it was you since the comment is deleted, but if you ain't a shill you ain't a shill man. But if someone in a fucking conspiracy sub says the deep state has nothing to do with media, you're either a fucking idiot or a shill, I'm sorry.

       The ENTIRE media can't be corrupt and ran by the  Deep State since there are so many Media Corporations and there's no way. Wrong.
In 1983, 90% of US media was controlled by 50 companies; today, 90% is controlled by just 5 companieshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States

       yes our media is conglomerating, the free market is a bitch. do I question the narratives, all the time. But this Russia story keeps hanging around because Trump and his allies are Balls deep in Russian Influence. Read Bill Browders testimony on Putin and the start of the Magnitsky act and you will Know why pour Nation needs laws to counteract Russian Propaganda.

       There's actually a pretty reasonable explanation for those specific kind of clips/examples on that video (the clips are from Conan I believe, or his talk-show popularized them). I'm 100% agreeing with you otherwise, and fucking despise those douches trying to break up conversations here and elsewhere on reddit. I have paid attention to how they work (what they say, when they are on reddit/what hours of the day/days of the week, when they are away, what the weekly "talking points" seem to be, how they attack users by projecting/mirroring words and phrases back like babies/always asking for "Source? Proof to back that up?" even when it's obviously an opinion just to make the genuine real user admit they "don't have proof" because none was even needed... they're so malicious and obtuse) and it's SO FUCKING ANNOYING. Fucking snotty dishonest and fake assholes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, sorry for that rant. The explanation is that they buy certain news as "packets" from news organizations that sell them to them. Kind of like a wholesale, selling packaged news ready-made and written for smaller news networks. That's why so many news and journalist stuff (movie reviews and game reviews too for example!) sound SO similar. It's always either nearly identical or saying the same thing with slightly different wording here and there. The less lazy journalists usually tweak the ready written stuff to make it seem more like their own, but many don't. It's like a company that resells goods to you they bought cheaper from a warehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're essential re-selling you news they bought themselves. Like a variety pack, with serious topics and a couple of bonus feel good stories with puppies added in, along with the video footage and images.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prepackaged news bought from a private news aggregator company that specializes in selling all kinds of news packs for lazy journalists or ones that want to not be shunned as an outcast by the trendier journalist groups etc. Basically just childish peer pressure bullshit from grade school and teenage years ("unless you do THIS, you're totally lame and not cool and we can't hang out!") transferred into adult life and work. Not exclusive to journalism but journalism attracts the childish narcissistic types that preferred to just sip on coffee and mash the keyboard and feel important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Promotional "articles" or "news" are also a thing I wish more people would start to notice. A HUGE chunk of news is actually just ads disguised as news - usually when they're just describing a company, PAY ATTENTION from now on and you'll notice it (and yeah, not gonna provide a "Source..?" saying "FACT: THIS MUNDANE BUSINESS SHIT HAPPENS ANYONE FROM BUSINESS SCHOOL KNOWS"). Not directed at you, but
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       users... I also have personal experience with them as my friend was one in real life (not online but actually in real life, shilling for companies on the streets downtown, trying to get people he knew into thinking he was genuinely enjoying some brands or products instead of getting free stuff and money for it...he always did shady shit like that and used me as a "confession booth" to vent how bad he felt about tricking people for companies' profit).

       <strong>
        Golfing:
       </strong>
       trump has cost taxpayers 55 million dollars by just golfing 41 times! Thats more money than the cost to the military for the transgenders he wants banned due to how much they cost the government! And guess what? He only golfs at his resorts, which the government pays for and he profits off of.

       <strong>
        Trump Lies:
       </strong>
       And he Lies alot! for most people lies happen, to lawyers if you lie you will get disbarred, For the president it is completely unacceptable. Trump Lies only like one other person and that person is Vladimir Putin. Putin Lies to establish a norm, if you hear it enough you get used to it and it becomes reality. Trump utilizes the same technique especially with fake news. You have seen people especially on this sub completely disregrd good information simply because it is from CNN, Washington Post or other mainstream sources. Now instead of arguing the content of an article we argue over its validity. This propaganda technique has been used for years and goes back to 1930's germany. Demonize the source that will expose you

       LMAO you had that saved somewhere. You even felt like you needed to paste that to my "Russian Collusion" question, which this bible you just posted didn't answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I go through your history, and on Politics it's clear you actually think Clinton is a saint, and that we think Trump is being picked on? LMAO again. How old are you? Do you understand how the world runs? Do you know who is the enemy of the enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I hope to fucking god Trump isn't being run by the Deep State, as Hillary was her whole life. I hope to fucking god he isn't. Now, get of your liberal high horse and try to understand how the world runs. Putin is fighting the Deep State, whether he is good or bad, no one can deny that. What he has done to the USA in the middle east and Ukraine is a great move by a political leader (he hasn't done anything worthy with this hacking BS). I'm sorry if your media says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       My Prime-Minister? No good. See how some of us arn't on a certain team just cause we are born there or because our school or media brainwashed us?  That copy paste shows how dumb you are. When was the first time you visited this sub? Did you and fellow redditors conspire to come here and feed us your bullshit? It's not worth it man, only people who already have the same viewpoint as you will latch on the the bullshit you spew. Go march the streets and make a fool of yourself. Your attacking Trump, not the corrupt dems. and Reps...only Trump. Do you finally feel like you are apart of a team for the first time in your life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Google that Rothechild lady who gave shit to Podesta on Twitter. They run the world, and they gave Podesta shit for loosing. Do you have anything else you can copy paste that adds no relevant info to this discussion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to sound like a dick cause shills are usually dicks, but IDC for you incompetent bullshit when you arn't even attacking the real corruption, only Trump because Grab him by the Pussy!!! or Russia.

       First off I shouldnt even respond to you since you wrote that wall of... I dont know what to call it. Lets go with total horse shit.
No actually I was really excited to hear Clinton might go to jail when it first came out and I really despise her. Would love to know how you cam up that bs.

       And no I didnt just copy paste that, it only took me 5 minutes of googling and writing, I'm amazed that you think that takes that much effort.

       the rest of that wall of shit, I didnt read, It started to hurt just thinking like you.

       How the fuck am I supposed to predict the future? Your question is what will russian collusion do to affect America? right? How am I supposed to answer that without just making assumptions? Your question is stupid. I have answered what trump has done and how it affected america and now you want me to answer hypotheticals?

       Here is my answer: It may result in government not decided by the American people and instead by Russian Influence.

       Well I don't know their official position on supposed Russian involvement in the election or in the data breeches of the dnc and Podesta. But the evidence that is public pretty clearly does not indicate that the Russian government did much, if anything. And we know the CIA has tools to make it look like Russians or Chinese or whoever carried out cyberattacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless they are providing evidence I will strongly doubt anyone that pushes that narrative. If it is monumental as some seem to think then the CIA or whoever should provide evidence even if they have to make a strategic sacrifice with regard to assets in the field. It's too big a deal to take on faith from agencies that have shown they have no problem lying to the public.

       "The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin."

       Ignoring the Seth Rich aspect of the clip, there's evidence for the leak theory, whereas there's no evidence for the hack theory.  Incredibly, none of the "Intelligence Agencies" would even be permitted to testify in court on the subject, because none of them have 'personal knowledge' owing to the fact that they never even examined the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly impossible to overstate how giant of a red flag it is that the FBI didn't collect the server.  I'd be less surprised if I gave my dog a whole bag of treats and he ate one and prudently decided to save the rest for later.

       A true conspiracy theorist does not get gummed up with petty distinctions of left and right when looking for the truth, because they are inherently bullshit in the first place.  We absorb information from all sources and parse out the political crap for the meat of the story.  A common sense, universal opinion of CTs is that the Democrat-Republican game is a shitshow for the plebs and always has been, it's just there to dupe the emotionally gullible, sensationalist idiots who are essentially watching a WWE match, only they think it's real.  You're definitely right that the sub has been completely taken over by partisan hacks, but your obvious political bias puts blinders on your ability to see objective reality.  Yeah there's TD trolls here and there, but they're not coming into threads specifically to police discussion and manipulate our opinions with petty attacks on the sub and our mission here, which is the find the truth at
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go into any fucking thread, pretty much anything on the front page, and look at the top rated comments and the posts that receive the vast majority of upvotes - they are almost universally attacking the central point of the post in question, pushing a mainstream viewpoint, putting down conspiracy theories or slandering the users of this sub as crazies or TD cutouts.  If you think that in any way is an organic feature of this sub, or that TD shills push the ideas I mentioned, you're out of your goddamn mind.

       when did I talk about the deep state and its connection to the media? All I said in this thread is how the ODNI works and that its stupid to think the democrats were able to coordinate such a massive disinformation campaign. If you think deep state has something to do with it provide proof, until then your just another dope who bought a load of goods from americas top con man.
