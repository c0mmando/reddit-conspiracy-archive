       It literally does not say the opposite. There are real, physical fossils that show these creatures.  Which argument in this article do you think is the strongest, and I'll do my best to debunk it in a way that makes sense.

       If I may be so bold: as a huge dino fan, I am curious what evidence exists against claim #3; I found little in my own research; quite the contrary even: it is, by and large, even
       <em>
        supported
       </em>
       by some "mainstream" "pro-dino" articles I stumbled over, which honestly quite upset me.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <h4>
        A full skeleton or a dinosaur has never been found - not even close to one
       </h4>
       <p>
        You go to a museum and you see dinosaur skeletons. At least, you think you do. You see, those dinosaurs are amalgams of various things ranging from chicken bones, to random bones, to straight plaster casts. Not even the teeth are real. Various bones have been found that have been claimed to be a part of a dinosaur.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, no dinosaur skeleton has ever been found. The only few that have been, have long proved to be a hoax. As a result, the only way to make a dinosaur skeleton for a museum is to, quite literally make it. That is, they have to create what they think it might look like by filling in 99% of the bones with other things to make what they think the whole thing would look like.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it is most probable that the few bones that have been found belonged to other animals. Thus, what you see in a museum is nothing more than an artist's rendition of what they think those dinosaurs could look like if they existed. If they put in a skeleton of a dragon, you would probably believe that too, especially if they told you in your class science book that dragons existed and could even talk English.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I concede that the way this is worded is a little strong for my taste; maybe a few bones
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been found here and there; but it seems it is an open secret that almost all skeletons on display in "Jurassic Parks" are entirely made out of plastic. No need to explain that true dinosaur bones are too valuable to put on display, and that they might be hidden safely somewhere and accessible only to experts – I understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am looking forward to a true and honest debunking, thank you in advance for your efforts!

       It is not a secret or conspiracy that most of the items on display in museums are cast replicas.

       How many real dinosaur fossils are there? Millions. How many of the ones that you are referencing are there? I have no idea. But here is a link to a complete dinosaur fossil that was found.  That debunks the bolded premise that "not even close to a full one has been found" right?

       Because the majority aren't something that the general public, who aren't ESPECIALLY interested in dinosaurs, would be that bothered about seeing.  The same reason that the millions of ammonite fossils aren't displayed, or fossilised plants.  They are common, and most examples aren't spectacular.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, if something is broken, or partial, it's difficult to display.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, they aren't fakes, they are replicas or completed specimens.  The two halves of one dinosaur might exist, but not from the same creature.  A skull might be half colapsed on one side.

       I was referring to the ones that were proven fake, like the infamous Archaeraptor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, it is a huge disappointment that your "debunking" is actually only a "defense" for an admitted fraud – the scientific truth would be too boring for the public, so the gaps are filled with fantasy and plastics. This is supposed to be science, not a spectacle!

       I am shattered that the doubt raised by dinosaur skeptics turns out to be not that unreasonable.

       The original fossils exist [in some case - in many they are reproductions or abstract representations of not even full anatomy, also not to scale]. Dinosaurs as you think you know them were a psy-op.

       No, they are not. I need more information from you to tell you why you are wrong. You can't just say skull and bones created them.  It doesn't work like that. That's not evidence.

       I think that they do. I like to believe that we are at a point in time, like in Dark Souls 3, where all the events of past cycles are catching up with each other. So maybe in one cycle they didn't exist at all, but now there was no need to fake them at all since the earth is as old as scientists are saying and that dinosaurs did walk on this planet all those years ago. Would explain the reptilian race of people that live underground if they are a thing as this could have been when they were alive and prominent. But that's just my take on it.

       dinosaurs are a ridiculous theory that got way out of control. why they all gotta be lizards? why they supposed to be hundreds of millions of years old yet you see paleontologists in a measly five foot hole, cleaning them bones off with a toothbrush? why they trying to hide other kinds of giants from our history? flat out screw the smithsonian.

       That's a gross oversimplification. An asteroid contributed to their extinction. We know it hit in the Gulf of Mexico. We know roughly when from the sediment it threw out.

       No, an asteroid would not destroy the earth.

       Dinos are real.

      <p>
       Yes, it is true that fully fleshed depictions are likely inaccurate simply because its hard to tell things like skin color/pigmentation when all of have are calcified bones. So you look to examples of the closest living analogue you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dino's are inching closer and closer to birds as we find better preserved fossils that have the finer details left intact, like feathers.

       Oil and dinosaurs have nothing to do with each other. Most likely oil was formed from algae and plankton deposits. Dinosaurs are all around us today. We call them birds since they learned to fly.

        Yes, elephants exist, and elephants are large. However, an elephant, which is a fraction of the size of a Brontosaurus, has to eat for 18 hours every day in order to survive. However, even in ancient times, there was still only 24 hours within each 24 hour period (basic logic). 
Since an elephant can't survive without eating 18 hours per day every day, and a Brontosaurus was supposedly 5 to 10 times larger than an elephant, then a brontosaurus would have to eat for around 90 to 180 hours per day. Yes, you read that right, and it's not a typo. It is logically impossible to eat for 90 hours per 24 hour day.

       I like to think that they were real, but were here from another planet fighting a war with a Mars civilization. Both civs were fighting for control of the planet for it's resources. Ultimately it was a nuclear weapon that ended the war and destroyed the alien "dinosaurs." The martians won the war, merged their DNA with apes, and voila, you have humans. The rest is history.

       Plenty of bones were found, they simply weren't labeled as dinosaur bones because people did not yet understand dinosaur were a possibility prior. This is were many myths originated such as dragons and cyclops, the bones were present, but misunderstood much like much of our physical world had different interpretations before modern science.

       Of course. They would have been sold as the real bones of the dragon slain by this or that saint. Other than a nail – or a splinter from the cross, or a shroud, or a pair of sandals – such a huge bone, or even a small skull, would have been a true anomaly, a verifiable rarity; possibly even revered as undeniable evidence for the veracity of biblical accounts of dragons and behemoths, but, in any case, preserved somehow into our age. If, as you claim, "plenty of bones" had been found, there would at least be accounts of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       bones having been found prior to them being postulated in the 19th century, just as

       I'd like to make a sound argument for the existence of dinosaurs, really, simply because I dislike the religious fanaticism associated with the debate. But the more I discuss the matter and learn on the topic, the more it seems like hoaxes, skeletons frankensteined from birds and mammoth bones and plastic replicas are the rule, not the exception.

       It seems like your conclusion is based more on what you feel is true rather than what we actually see playing out in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that bones were found prior to the 17th century:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1335 "Der Klagenfurter Lindworm" was discovered. While actually a bone from an ice-age wooly mammoth, the people at the time believed it to be a dragon bone and regarded it as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in this same example we can also see the propensity of people to misidentify the remnants as monsters of their own time instead of recognizing them as evidence of species long past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient Greeks recorded evidence of marine life fossils, allowing them to understand where they lived on dry land was once covered in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that all fossil discoveries are recent in patently false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that dinosaur bones particularly are recent is misguided, and fails to recognize the records we do have that indicate these bones were found, but simply misidentified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional point:
-Evidence suggests Native Americans have long found and interacted with bones and even dinosaur eggs
      </p>
      <p>
       So now that I've addressed your point, let's have you return the favor:
      </p>
      <p>
       If dinosaurs aren't real how can we accurately predict where specific types of fossils can be found based on sedimentary rock layers? We can with a high degree of accuracy say that This species lived during this time, and then go through the layers of rock in dig sites and turn up the fossils we expect to see. This is a process that is not only verifiable, but so reliable that entire jobs operate on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you explain all the amateurs  that find fossils? Where is the funding for this lie coming from? What is the purpose of it?

       You have not shown that any dinosaur/dragon bones were found, but misidentified as elephant, horse, dog or lion bones, you see. My point stands.

Endorse? Not quite. It does not specifically go to show “giant lizards existed” but it does establish the behavior of taking the remains of something else and mistakenly assigning it the identity of whatever animal better fits the reality for that time period.

       This issue isn’t exactly a hot topic, so providing easy internet links isn’t really an option. However The First Fossil Hunters is a well known book in which Adrienne Mayor outlines Dinosaur Bones and other fossils found by ancient Greeks and surrounding civilizations and the likely way those manifested as the mythological creatures we know of today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worth noting that the book Indians on the Great Plains (by Daniel J Gelo) specifically mentions Native Americans finding dinosaur bones in the eroded badlands of SouthWestern South Dakota. They were also known to grind these bones and use them medicinally (same source).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, let us bear in mind the likely hood that creatures understood to be lizards or other known species (especially aquatic life) would not have stood out and therefore would not have been recorded or maintained. It stands to reason that it is not unlikely many dinosaur bones discovered would not have appeared out of the ordinary. There is no way to know how common (and I never meant to imply they were a frequent discovery, only that they were in fact seen before the time suggested here in this thread) the findings really were. These are massive skeletons often embedded in rock (so you’d need to be digging in most cases), that are also (paradoxically) incredibly fragile.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the note of the Native Americans specifically, aside from the above mention Adrianne Mayor also has a book addressing just the Native American history of discovering fossils (including dinosaur bones) and the ways it likely manifested in their mythos. Title: Fossil Legends of the First Americans.

Lol, no. I said, jobs, not good paying ones. The average Paleontologist makes 60k at the high end, most falling closer to 40k which isn’t that far above the average income for an American household. This isn’t exactly a lucrative career choice as far as these things go. Doesn’t seem like a compelling argument to me.

       I hope to get them into my hands somehow some day, I am interested which evidence/reasoning is presented and in which context.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It stands to reason that it is not unlikely many dinosaur bones discovered would not have appeared out of the ordinary.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I must disagree here. At least the skulls and femurs of the larger dinosaurs would have raised an eyebrow or two and could not be mistaken for any living species, even in times when skeletal anatomy was not as well understood as today.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well, it’s not true.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I chose my words carefully; I said
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       , not "most" or "all" ;)
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists regularly get accused of pareidolia for better evidence.

       <p>
        And this obviously leaves out the tons of trilobites and other ancient creatures discovered all the time by students and children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I have no beef with trilobites, or fossils in general; I have one or two myself. We were talking about dinosaurs!

        You realize this would be a massive coverup right?

      <p>
       I do, no worries :) But we know other coverups have been perpetrated.

       <p>

       The taxpayer, for a large part.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the idea here is that you’ll be hard pressed to come up with any compelling reason to orchestrate this “lie”.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A self-perpetuating mania, confirmation bias, research grants? It would not be the first time in history that a misconception, or lie, has been perpetuated over a century or even more for ideological reasons.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I’m not sure what the real issue is here… you don’t like how precise they are trying to guess? OK. Sure. Not really a reason to not believe in Dinosaurs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe not, but good enough reason for me to reserve some healthy skepticism and be prepared for the day when "conventional wisdom" is turned over again, the evidence reviewed with a fresh eye and a better interpretation or explanation forwarded.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I said, jobs, not good paying ones. The average Paleontologist makes 60k at the high end, most falling closer to 40k which isn’t that far above the average income for an American household. This isn’t exactly a lucrative career choice as far as these things go. Doesn’t seem like a compelling argument to me.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is, if you think about how many jobs depend on the official explanation being true, or, let's say, alternative theories and approaches being wrong. I understand that in academia, everyone strives to prove everyone wrong and hence, the the best theories mendel out somehow –
       <em>
        theoretically
       </em>
       ; but we know there is not really a mechanism to prevent a situation where the learned are divided over whether Jesus laughed or not, but both camps agree that he was born to a virgin. As an outsider, it is impossible for me to judge whether that is the case, I mean this only as an example for how a whole field of science can be, accidentally or intentionally, fundamentally wrong for a long time.

       Science is the main religion of this subreddit. Its like saying jesus didn't die on the cross to a Christian. Here's a fact everything you know is a lie. The Opposite of what they tell us is ussualy the truth.

       It literally does not say the opposite. There are real, physical fossils that show these creatures.  Which argument in this article do you think is the strongest, and I'll do my best to debunk it in a way that makes sense.

       It seems like your conclusion is based more on what you feel is true rather than what we actually see playing out in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that bones were found prior to the 17th century:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1335 "Der Klagenfurter Lindworm" was discovered. While actually a bone from an ice-age wooly mammoth, the people at the time believed it to be a dragon bone and regarded it as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in this same example we can also see the propensity of people to misidentify the remnants as monsters of their own time instead of recognizing them as evidence of species long past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient Greeks recorded evidence of marine life fossils, allowing them to understand where they lived on dry land was once covered in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that all fossil discoveries are recent in patently false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that dinosaur bones particularly are recent is misguided, and fails to recognize the records we do have that indicate these bones were found, but simply misidentified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional point:
-Evidence suggests Native Americans have long found and interacted with bones and even dinosaur eggs
      </p>
      <p>
       So now that I've addressed your point, let's have you return the favor:
      </p>
      <p>
       If dinosaurs aren't real how can we accurately predict where specific types of fossils can be found based on sedimentary rock layers? We can with a high degree of accuracy say that This species lived during this time, and then go through the layers of rock in dig sites and turn up the fossils we expect to see. This is a process that is not only verifiable, but so reliable that entire jobs operate on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you explain all the amateurs  that find fossils? Where is the funding for this lie coming from? What is the purpose of it?
