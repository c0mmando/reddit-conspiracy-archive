    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of thoughts I had back in college when I first started getting deep into meditation. There was a span of time where whenever I would start going very deep into my meditation (moving beyond sensations of my gross physical form into a more energetic state) a very loud helicopter sounding noise would start. It was strange because it would sound like a low flying helicopter but it seemed like it would just appear right as I would get deep into the meditation, and it happened with enough frequency that I started wondering if it was just a sound produced to disrupt my meditation. Its a bizarre thought, but now after learning more about voice to skull technology, it makes me wonder if this was being done automatically via cell phone towers / satellite networks / electricity monitors (&quot;smart meters&quot;). </p>

<p>This would have to be an extremely sophisticated set of monitoring programs with intelligent AI ready to beam radiation at precise locations and timings. It seems extremely unlikely that our government or some group of people would be capable of this. Its more likely that I happened to meditate in the evening when a helicopter would often fly by. If I were to examine the flight logs of choppers in the area I would realize they are fairly common, and it was only more noticeable in my heightened state of awareness during deep meditation. This is the sort of rationale that would be given for the phenomena. But ultimately its still one of those synchronicities that made it seem like my subconscious was telling me something. I think at that time (this was 2011 - 2012 ish) I was more paranoid about government and powerful entities monitoring me and trying to subvert any &quot;rebellious&quot; type behavior, and perhaps the chopper noise symbolized that for my subconscious. Thus I looked at it as a sort of indication of whether or not I had overcome my fears - if I am able to continue with the meditation without the noise affecting me then I pass the test. </p>

<p>Btw in relation to your post - could the beeping be coming from a carbon monoxide alarm or something of that nature? Do you have a smart meter in your home by any chance? I&#39;ve read those have harmful radiation but I doubt it would be making a beeping noise. Its possible the beeping is some random device in your house which is nearly unnoticeable in your normal awake state but in a deep state of astral projection you may be more aware of it and its enough to wake you up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I hear is not a tinny type beeping such as might be emitted by any alarm in my house, i.e., alarm (which I don&#39;t use) or appliances (which in any case are downstairs).  It&#39;s rhythmic and more of a dulled sound. It&#39;s been a month or two since I heard it, but from memory, it&#39;s a two note sound: duh duhh, duh duhh. </p>

<p>I have never had hearing problems of any kind, my hearing is very acute.</p>

<p>The sound seems to be transmitted, by or through what I cannot say.  I hear it when I lie in bed, before sleep. Switching positions in bed do nothing to stop or change it.  I&#39;ve wondered if the sound is in the background of everyday life but only heard late at night when other sounds have ceased.  My computer is switched off and is downstairs.  I live in a very quiet neighbourhood and have low tolerance for noise. Those whom I&#39;ve asked say they haven&#39;t heard the sound. The sound does not have a physical origin and is not blood pressure or anything like that.  The sound seems as if it&#39;s being transmitted.  I don&#39;t use or have a cell phone. Have no idea where the nearest cell tower is located although as I live in a large city, it&#39;s probable there&#39;s one reasonably close-by, say half a mile or so .. I&#39;ve no idea.</p>

<p>Due to the fact I&#39;ve experienced what I&#39;d consider to be profound &#39;paranormal&#39; type activity life-long (spontaneously, definitely not solicited) I choose not to engage in deliberate astral-travel or anything of the kind.  I consider the sound I hear to be intrusive and a violation, if it&#39;s being deliberately transmitted.  Searches haven&#39;t produced many results which conform to what I hear, which is why this thread caught my attention (as did
comments by knockers, which always raise suspicions when they arise in seemingly innocuous threads such as this is)</p>

Have you ever posted in the Mandela Effect sub or glitch in the matrix sub?
Also, is astral projection dangerous? Do you recommend it?
Just wondering. I entertain spirituality concepts but have never been convinced as I haven&#39;t experienced much to suggest a spiritual reality or matrix or similar concepts.</p>

<p>Well, other than syncronicities and basic color hallucinations in the dark (not under the influence of drugs at all).
Perhaps I&#39;m just impatient and haven&#39;t meditated enough or my fluoride free toothpaste has some other neurotoxin crap in it?

Cause I&#39;m pretty damn sure you haven&#39;t spoken to a single deceased person in the astral plane, and that you have not verified those conversations later.  Seems like another one of your many extremely dubious claims/delusions, of which there are very very many.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is at all related but occasionally (very common when I was younger, ages 10-14) right before I drift off to sleep I hear a very intense and loud noise in my head that is impossible to ignore. It wakes me up completely and sometimes even causes me to flinch. It can happen multiple times too, up to 10 times in a row. Also I had a reoccurring dream at least 2 times a week for years around the same age range. I would see all white with black dashes and lines of different sizes and thicknesses, all heading towards a chaotic center piece of black. I would follow from an unknown distance going faster and faster to the center of the chaos then bam I&#39;d hit the center and wake up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one thing we know for sure - it&#39;s not at all related to your mental health.</p>

<p>Even though you seem to think you&#39;ve found the all the answers to life&#39;s biggest questions and that you need to let the world know about it.
Even though those &quot;answers&quot; you&#39;ve found are complete bullshit: the archons (reptiles) have entrapped us in a fake universe, there&#39;s no such thing as matter.</p>

<p>Even though you think that there is a mall in the astral plane which you&#39;ve been to on many occassions, as well as various frat parties on the astral plane - you&#39;ve been to those too.</p>

<p>Even though you think cats have magical powers.</p>

<p>Even though people tell you that you&#39;ve lost your grip on reality on a regular basis for quite some time now. Dozens of people. Maybe more than that.</p>

<p>Even though there are red flags galore (in your post history and the language you use) which indicate that you have disconnected from reality.</p>

<p>Even though you&#39;ve shown a reoccurring pattern of defensive deflecting and/or blaming when this kind of thing is brought to your attention.</p>

<p>Even though you&#39;ve argued that you don&#39;t have any mental issues because you can &quot;have full blown conversations with people&quot; which is a weird sentence to use, especially when trying to defend your mental state.</p>

<p>Jesus christ dude - enough.  You are not well and you should seek professional help from a psychologist or psychiatrist or counselor or something.</p>

<p>Those beeps will be voices soon enough. And you will be certain that those aren&#39;t related to your mental state either. I&#39;ve little doubt about that.</p>

<p>Even though you seem to think you&#39;ve found the all the answers to life&#39;s biggest questions and that you need to let the world know about it, which seems a little like a grandiose delusion but whatever.</p>

<p>Even though those &quot;answers&quot; you&#39;ve found are really crazy and far fetched theories being peddled by charlotons: the archons (reptiles) have entrapped us in a fake holographic universe, there&#39;s no such thing as matter.</p>

<p>Even though you think that there is a mall in the astral plane which you&#39;ve been to on many occasions. Not to mention those awesome s frat parties...that you attended...in another plane of existence. </p>

<p>I could go on and on and on - but the point is that
I&#39;ve seen your posts on reddit for a very long time now and it definitely seems as though you are not well and that you should seek professional help from a psychologist or psychiatrist or counselor or something. Because something is askew inside your mind, and the longer you let it persist untreated - the worse it&#39;ll end up being.</p>

<p>Those beeps will be voices soon enough. And you will be certain that those aren&#39;t related to your mental state either. I&#39;ve little doubt about that.</p>
