       I watched all the YouTube videos and was 100% convinced this was a conspiracy designed to get stricter gun laws passed in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       My boss is big into conspiracy theories, so we were discussing a few of the most popular ones earlier today. Then I mentioned Sandy Hook and he got super serious. "Chlou" he said. "My very very good friend lost their child that day. I went to the funeral." Turns out he knew the couple since before they got married, they still spend weekends with the family, and yes, they did loose one of their children that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe my boss 100%. He has no reason to lie. Really made me think. I buy into these theories so much, and the one I was really really convinced of was just debunked by someone close to one of the families. I was so convinced these kids were in hiding somewhere until they grew up a little and could be passed off as a sibling, that their parents were actors, that it was a big elaborate scheme. But no, some sicko really did murder a ton of children that day. :(

       Yeah, I'm just a random person on the internet and when I was researching this theory I never would have believed this. I probably came across comments just like the one I made and skipped over them because I wanted the theory to be true.

       There is no childlike wonder in doubting grieving parents. Just a malicious troll-like streak. And your edit; did you mean "you're glue"? Because what you wrote is certainly childlike.

       That's. On me. My iPad anyways. I apologize. This op is fake as shit though. This story anyways. Touches on everything we have been warned against recently. YouTube is getting censored. Believing and allowing more stories like this helps form the argument for conspiracy related content to continue being censored.

       No politics. Straight up truth on the line. The ability to question everything. Isn't that why we are here?

       I have just seen too much bullshit surrounding SH here. As a parent myself I chose to believe OP. People on this sub seem to believe much more outlandish shit than this thread with as little proof as we get here. That's my choice. I don't believe SH was a hoax.

       We all have limited knowledge, to think otherwise is just (stupid)? Was looking for another word, but english is not my first language so it escapes me. But what do you mean exactly, if you can elaborate?

       But you assumed my account was bought? Do you still believe that? I wouldn't call myself naive but certainly sometimes filled with childlike wonder. There's enough cynisism in this world that I sometimes react against it, like in this thread.

       With an underlying assumption that I had. As is a regular occurence on this sub. Not me personally, as I've been lurking a lot, but I see it regurlarly. I'm not pissed or anything but it seems like a kneejerk reaction to opposing opinions?

       Asking a question isn't a knee jerk reaction at all. If you've been lurking here long you would see that. I don't give a shit if you're pissed or not to be honest. As the world turns. OP is either fake or stuck in a mythological tale of falling for absolute shit bosses in her life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust her boss 100% she's known, for less than probably her last dead boss she fell for I Assume, who is super into conspiracies. All they have discussed is pizza gate and sandy hook. And he knows someone in the sandy hook incident and calls her crazy for believing the pizza gate theory. All of OPs knowledge came from all the YouTube videos she admitted to not actually viewing them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me whatever you want and believe what you want. That's the truth. And there's a lot of holes. So trust it based on how you feel.

       But I see a lot of bought account/shill accusations here when posters/responders don't agree on a conspiracy. And for all the free thinking on this sub there is also a tendency towards hivemind on some subjects. Maybe this sub is not for me but I enjoy reading about conspiracies. 
 I'm not calling you anything, maybe sassy, but that's all. 
Edit. So are phones  ;)

       I think something awful happened that day but I'm not going to let this liar come in here and taint the waters more. This is nothing new. Nothing zero. To believe otherwise is insanity. How I see it anyways. Not saying you're insane.

       It's these two sentances I'm having trouble with:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Also, you just touched on the sandy hook incident with somewhat so deeply invested in conspiracies?" - the phrase 'with somewhat so deeply' does not make sense to me.

      <p>
       "You yourself just so attached and this just comes up?" - this entire thing is jibberish.

       If you are able to rephrase your sentences to actually mean something, I could answer your question! :)

How well did he know them to go to the funeral? Weekends still? Wonder where you work now. Iunno that better?

       We discussed Pizzagate at length and Sandy Hook. Pizzagate is the one I'm super into, he thinks I'm insane lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really passionate about Sandy Hook - but from watching YouTube videos (the long ones, hour or so long, it was a while ago) I had enough info on the topic to begin a conversation with my boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't known for 3 years, he told me this today! Few hours ago!
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't ask for details, like the name, or date of funeral. It seemed to be a sensitive topic. He said he knew the couple before they got married, so he went to their wedding and their child's funeral.

       Appeal to emotion. The meme is how people are trying to "prove" it happened not whether or not it happened. None of us were there so we cannot know what happened. But emotion doesn't prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people originally questioned it -
       <em>
        every time
       </em>
       a SH thread came up someone would start posting they are from the town or they know someone or they were at the funeral. Suggesting it was an auto-response. Thus became the "I know xyz and I can assure you it really happened" meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFyexz_IuHE">
        "Somebody think of the children"
       </a>
       supposed witness meme'ing themselves on the news - there's actually another meme in this.
       <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/190/072/d66.png">
        "

      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using memes to "prove" something and people will stop using memes to point out how retarded the effort is.

       My thought on the theory that Sandy Hook was all really fake... Why would whoever pulled off the hoax want to pay likely hundreds of millions of dollars and involve hundreds of thousands of people at some level of the conspiracy ratger than just brainwashing one borderline psychotic person into actually killing those kids?

       exactly. if this was the case, my boss would have to be in on it also.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really makes me sad that it did actually happen -- I great up in the area and never knew of anyone who knew any families involved, until my boss mentioned he did. I guess I just wanted to believe that it was all fake.

       Hey op, have you worked long for your boss? If not why are you giving 100% to him, seems a bit hypocritical to me. Most people aren't so trustworthy of their authority figures and bosses.

       My theory was kids not that kids died. It was that they did, but it was an organized event not by Lanza, but by someone powerful. Just my opinion. Sort of like 9/11, people died, but it was a very planned and coordinated event.

       No one died because all the actual children showed as killed were about 16-21 during that time.

       It's these two sentances I'm having trouble with:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Also, you just touched on the sandy hook incident with somewhat so deeply invested in conspiracies?" - the phrase 'with somewhat so deeply' does not make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You yourself just so attached and this just comes up?" - this entire thing is jibberish.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are able to rephrase your sentences to actually mean something, I could answer your question! :)

       We all have limited knowledge, to think otherwise is just (stupid)? Was looking for another word, but english is not my first language so it escapes me. But what do you mean exactly, if you can elaborate?
