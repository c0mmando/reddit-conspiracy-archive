    <div class="md"><p>Police refuse to release the autopsy or medical reports. Remember that Rich did not die on the scene - he was taken to hospital, they cleaned up his wounds, and left him to rest. He later died due to &#39;complications&#39; in the middle of the night, which can happen but is rare. They could put a lid on this all by proving to the public that this was what they say it was, but they stay silent despite these things going to the national media. Is it that they can&#39;t share or that they won&#39;t?</p>

<p>If they have a sworn testimony from him saying that it was him getting robbed and then he later died in hospital, why when they release his statements in order to clear this stuff up ASAP?</p>

<p>If there is a statement I think they should release it too...... Hell, I think they should release everything. But you know what? Even if they did, it&#39;s not going to matter to most people that think this is a DNC coverup. </p>

<p>His family has said numerous times it was a robbery. There were numerous robberies in that area. But go ahead and bring that up, they&#39;ll dismiss it because it&#39;s a press release or a spokesperson speaking on behalf of the family.</p>

<p>No matter what happens, they won&#39;t give this up...... Just like Pizzagate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you follow his whole family after it happened? His brother was convinced that something was off in the initial few days after he died. Only after a week or two did he fall back behind the family (DNC) rep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was &#39;assigned&#39; to them by the DNC, and initially the family seemed to be perturbed by him speaking on their behalf. It wasn&#39;t until the fever pitch built that they made their statement asking for privacy and then shut up about it.</p>

<p>I agree - I hope they can solve the murder. I just think there is a lot of strange circumstance involved, and we&#39;re in a conspiracy forum. His link to the wikileaks leak isn&#39;t really hinged on him being murdered either - it could have been bad luck, like Hersh thinks...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. They should release as much info as possible to help track down the killer. That&#39;s the first and most important thing.</p>

<p>The DNC emails is another thing. Today I just read that about Seth supposedly asked for money for the emails. Somehow I don&#39;t believe it. That sounds more like something the Awan brothers would do especially with smashing hard drives, hiding that laptop, threatening a marine, threatening their step-mother, bank loan fraud, fighting over car dealership, rarely on site, at least 5 of them on payroll... who would hire them?</p>

<p>And wow! get paid $165,000 a year just to set up cellphones, computers and buy equipment? Geez! They must be joking!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that makes it more curious. If he was conscious. Wouldn&#39;t he have at least told the police who attacked him? how many of them? ethnicity? what clothing they wore? were they trying to rob him? A lot is missing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Release of autopsy reports are quite common in murder cases... For Rich they have released nothing. Remember that he died of &#39;complications&#39; in the middle of the night and not necessarily due to the gun wounds themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, so his family could release it if they felt it would help calm the fever.</p>

<p>However, his cause of death is not the issue here, unless it was malfeasance or a mistake at the hands of a hospital professional. Maybe they are getting a settlement and cannot speak about it as part of that. Who knows? All we know is that the murder is unsolved, and the official reasoning of the story doesn&#39;t make that much sense considering he was apparently robbed without any eye witnesses and the thieves took nothing. Additionally, Rich was conscious according to police reports, and yet they cannot provide an accurate statement or idea of who it was that killed Rich. The lack of information and the cold response from DC police is what people are getting riled up about. If the police and officials actually seemed to want to solve the case, I don&#39;t think people would be so into this, but the response from the top down is very suspicious. Comet Ping-pong was the same with the FOIA showing that police had not even looked into the original complaints/reports. I think people are getting sick and tired of corruption, and the reaction by the government/media/authorities in regards to Seth Rich is setting off alarms. Information is too good these days - it&#39;s all suddenly a very dangerous game that the politicians are playing. I think that&#39;s what is behind everything - people are fed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, also, there are three CCTV camera at Flagler Market (<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qIKCwqfhk2Y/V5mGcNOCRNI/AAAAAAAAEVk/eiVBTUrduL8yudyC7fLrs-JxYp6zM2LNgCLcB/s1600/SCR004A.jpg">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qIKCwqfhk2Y/V5mGcNOCRNI/AAAAAAAAEVk/eiVBTUrduL8yudyC7fLrs-JxYp6zM2LNgCLcB/s1600/SCR004A.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>In that picture there&#39;s another camera on upper floor, 4th window from the right. Those should have clear views of Seth getting shot. His body is literally at that intersection. (<a href="https://projectastralblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_6120.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;h=432">https://projectastralblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_6120.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;h=432</a>)</p>

<p>How is 13 months after his death, there is no footage released to the public. Does it mean there is nothing recorded? Surely if they really wanted to catch the culprit they would release something, anything that can help residents identify the shooters.</p>
