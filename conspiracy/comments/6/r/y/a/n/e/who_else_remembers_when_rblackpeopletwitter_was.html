       Instead of pushing a Liberal Obama loving agenda and just another Trump hatefest or else you get banned? 
I am getting down voted and banned all over for speaking facts they don't like.....like Democrats make everything about race... I was banned from r/the_donald for asking if a recent rash of anti Bernie posts meant I wasn't supposed to feel welcome there and was banned and called a "bernie bro" which is a shill thing to do but actual shills are all over comments and aren't banned. They are even infiltrating r/trees and I'll end up banned there next. I'm not even going to go into how my votes are just pretend and sometimes even bring vote % down when I upvote a post but every site is getting hit hard because they are getting closer to taking Trump down by force before he accomplishes his mission and need to make it look like there is plenty of support for their agenda.
Here is what they are trending today and all those comments do not represent real Redditors....

       No, it is a perfectly valid observation.

       And those of us actually paying attention appreciate it and don't give a single thought to the hordes of gang-voting "totally real conspiracy members" who run through every comment section on this subreddit that is even remotely about Trump.

       Crazy that I just posted this last night.  The shills HERE don't likey and will try to burn your resources by saying it's a meaningless post.

      <p>
       Glad I'm not the only one.

       I do need to to point out to you that Bernie is agreeing with the "Russia- Trump" narrative which makes him equally bad.  Anyone who won't call out the corruption is a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not be a Bernie supporter but your comment sounds like you are- as a FORMER Bernie fan girl, it's important I make sure anyone who still adores him pay attention to this: there's always a hero to follow right back into nowheresville.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's it.  We are supposed to follow him and get excited about what he says and does so we accept it when they do NOTHING about it.  That's his role- and he's accepted it either explicitly or de facto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie fans hate hearing it but it's true.

       Yes, but I was Bernie supporter way before he was ever mentioned running for president and know that he is not the same. When he isn't behaving they come down on him and even Jane. He knows they can easily set them up. I remember when he accidentally let it slip out and called CNN fake news....they cut his mic but just before they did he looked panicked and said he was just kidding. He is doing what he has to in order to keep his family safe. I just hope they were never legit successful at catching him with their brownstone ops. I am also a recovering Liberal and am not freaking out with fear over Trump. I don't think he is part of the swamp and hope they don't succeed at taking him down.

       As I said, Bernie supporters don't like the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bc Bernie TALKS but never actually puts his ass on the line speaking out about the deep state, does he?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bc he's NOT SUPPOSED TO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I like what he says too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has he actually accomplished for anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally nothing.

       Anyone who still believes in Bernie is a fool who is just like any fool back in the 60's who liked McGovern.

       Yes they do.  That doesn't make them right.

      <p>
       Is he honest about the corruption in the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if not, is what he DOES say putting him at any real risk?
      </p>
      <p>
       They know there's a growing market of people that believe their government should serve them- we have existed since the US began.

       Look, I recognize this is hard to hear- I believed in him with my entire soul.

      <p>
       But someone has to HERD the progressives to nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what corruption is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if he's not calling it out, he's not serving us.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's serving them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're fools for not recognizing it's been happening for 100 years now- only the faces change.

       He's the face.
