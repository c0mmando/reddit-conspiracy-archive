       why can't i objectively dislike jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       in my neighborhood the only jews are the slumlords, who have open disdain for the goyim.
      </p>
      <p>
       40% of my check is taken out in taxes, so that we can pay for wars in the middle east to defend israel's interests, rather than rebuild roads and provide healthcare for my family and community.
      </p>
      <p>
       i pay interest on my house, my car, my credit card; and i need all of these things to survive, even the credit card - trying running a household with no credit...
      </p>
      <p>
       the vast majority of bankers @ the top? jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       many jews are good people, and i have some friends who are jews. but these are jews like i am christian - dont go to church, dont follow the "rules," am not an active part of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       the really religious jews, the ones that actually believe themselves to be superior, are a scourge.
      </p>
      <p>
       '"Benjamin Netanyahu was meeting in at Finks bar in Jerusalem, a well-known Mossad watering-hole. Here is what he said as taken directly from the transcript of the recording which was witnessed and has been 100% fully authenticated:
      </p>
      <p>
       “If we get caught they will just replace us with persons of the same cloth. So it doesn’t matter what you do, America is a Golden Calf and we will suck it dry, chop it up, and sell it off piece by piece until there is nothing left but the World’s biggest welfare state that we will create and control. Why? Because it’s god’s will and America is big enough to take the hit so we can do it again, again and again. This is what we do to countries that we hate. We destroy them very slowly and make them suffer for refusing to be our slaves.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you, why would I be wrong to resent these people? and before you call me a racist or other bullshit, being Jewish is a choice, its not a race. Black is a race, chinese is a race; Jew is a plague.

       You can dislike whomever you choose but you must accept opposition to your views if you air them in a public forum of any sort.

       But as you've shown an understanding that the problem is a group within the religion, i dont understand why you then go on to say

       there to me is no benefit of being a "sorta jew" or whatever - one of the non-connected, not really religious Jews.  they are @ best like the rest of us and @ worst like the zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       most of the casual jews i know support israel and despise hamas, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       its like like people that dress "ghetto."  there may not be anything wrong with wearing your pants beneath your ass, but if i see you doing it im going to make some generalizations based on my experience and im going to not like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       same thing for jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically, there is no benefit to a jew - its at best a negligible thing and at worst the literally most evil thing in the world.

       Well im no religion apologist, i tend to think there are disproportionately large concentrations of evil people in all religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the few (lapsed) Jews i know are into music, tech, smoking a little weed and they have no interest in the religion. They have a family background that is Jewish but not much else... So we'll have to disagree.

       my point is those are the "good jews."  the ones that essentially aren't jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       the further down the jew scale you go towards zionist, the more bad.  therefore, jews = bad.

       The vast majority of Zionists are not religious. Zionism began as a secular movement.

       Jew here. Judism and Jewish arent the same. That said.. we have a extreme proportion of our populace in very rich and powerful positions compred to our % of the populace. Israel thrives as a nation that takes 8 minutes to cross by plane. Tiny amongst giant nations. American Jews are wealthy i wont deny that. So then add on the conspiracy stuff. 9/11. World banks. Rothschilds. I get it. Ill tell you though i dont have a Rothschilds platinum card or secret jewy powers or id be in Haifa with 6 Gal Gadot look alikes right now. I pay $800ish a week in taxes. I do my fair share too.

       Many of us are working on that. We were brainwashed from birth that we are "victims" and the whole world hates us and wants to kill us. So naturally, we are always on the defensive. Many liberal Jews, including myself, do not believe we are better than Gentiles. But, you have to admit, the majority of Gentiles are not the brightest lot. Why is that?

       Do you seriously not know that the Jews are Semitic people? Have you ever heard the word antisemitism? I was making a pun that anybody with basic understanding of the relevant nomenclature would have understood. Next time you see a word you don't know do a quick search before you post a response.

       Your attempt at a pun failed dismally because you can't spell.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had spent 'semitic' or 'semitics' correctly, maybe people would understand your clever pun, but when you responded to the word 'semantics' with 'semetics' you confused people.

       If I had "spent" semetic correctly? I think you just proved the point that everyone makes typos occasionally. So maybe don't say I "can't spell" because I made one typo in one comment.

       You really have no clue. You're a walking insult. You're why racist twats on the other side of the coin make generalizations about all white people being racist.

       Maybe he's trying to say he was raised with "Christian values". I'm atheist but I still celebrate the family rituals of "Christmas" and "Zombie Jesus day". Now, I feel that these rituals are ingrained in the American doctrine in schools to force their capitalist ways and not the true meaning of the original holidays.

      <p>
       No, it's not a "choice". I know a guy who is a Christian, but both of his parents are "full-blooded" Jews and they too are Christians. They raised him to be a Christian, and they have a Jewish last name, and they all look very Jewish. Yet, he knows nothing about Jews, or Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You apparently have had some bad experiences with some unsavory Jews. You need to reach out and meet some more Jews. You would be surprised. They are some of the nicest people you will ever meet and they will give you the shirt of their backs. (literally)

       But, in America you can dislike and hate whomever you want. It's against the law, though, to do an individual any physical harm, or destroy their property.

       It's actually more complicated than that; what we know as Jews in Israel today are actually descended from the Khazars, so technically they are not actually Semitic. And since Semitism is actually a linguistic distinction, and since they are concerned with geocoding Palestinians and fomenting middle eastern wars, it could be said that modern Jews are the most anti-Semitic of all people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that yes they are a distinct ethnicity that, like other ethnicities does not have clearly defined "edges" and has intermingled throughout the centuries with other races, but nevertheless enough of a genetically distinct race that they can even use
       <em>
        genetic testing
       </em>
       as part of their immigration process.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words yes it is a complicated subject but you don't just get to make up the rules. I'm not calling you a racist or anything, just letting you know that they have been a race, still are a race, and will continue being a race.

       if i put up a picture of 100 random people and say "find the black guys" "find the europeans" "find the asains" thats pretty easy because they are different races.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can not put up a picture of 100 random people and say "find the jew" because its a fucking religion not a race

       I could name many of the Jews in a group of 100 because it is a race and as a race they have defining physical features, especially if I knew their names as well.

       Jewish populations were segregated in Europe for thousands of years. Thus, it produced a slight genetic variant.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, no, it's neither ok to hate that genetic variant of a person, nor is it ok to hate all the people that practice the religion simply because you've identified what you think are a few bad people. That's quite literally the definition of racism, bigotry, and intolerance - take your pick.

       The Jewish Encyclopedia defines us as a "civilization"; much like Gypsies are a civilization. If a Gentile converts to being a Jew, and then later on "drops out" he (or she) is no longer Jewish. But a person born a Jew cannot "drop out" from being a Jew. Bob Dylan became a born-again Christian, and yet he was still a Jew. If you're born a Jew, you die a Jew.

       I always thought Christians were the willing slaves to the God's chosen people. Quite literally their messiah is a Jew. Or Israelite whatever they want to be called. They worship the Judeo-God like they do. But Jews don't get hell, Christians do if you're a bad bad bad slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly don't see how they have power unless there are serious money guiding hands, blackmail, or just people who don't care if the country is being used for modern day crusades. Christians always doing the military dirty work for them.

       You say you are a Christian? Jesus is supposed to come back and kill all non-Christians who don't believe in him. Then he is going to send them to a fiery place where they will be roasted alive for eternity. This sounds more like the leader of ISIS than a "god of love".

       Okay. So you acknowledge that there is "good and bad" in every collective. That includes Jews; that includes blacks and whites; that includes ALL groups. Except one. There is one group that if anyone belongs to this group they are evil and wicked; each and everyone of them: there are no exceptions. Do you know who this group is? (I'll give you a hint: Jesus condemned them. And no, it's not ALL Jewish leaders. He condemned the Jewish leaders OF HIS DAY. Sorry, for the caps; I just need to emphasize my point. So, back to my question: who is the group that Jesus condemned?)

       You can "resent" anyone you like, but doing so objectively as stated in your title contradicts the reasons for which you are doing so. For it to be objective you would need hard facts. You provided anecdotal evidence which is by definition a personal account, which is completely subjective and based on your own opinion. I am not religious, but if there is even one Jew that falls outside of your reason for resentment, then that resentment is bias and subjective, not objective as you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't wish to debate whether Jews are good or bad people, I just wish to point out why your feelings towards them are not objective. America is widely controlled by Jews in the media, banks, etc. but making generalizations and having feeling of resentment towards the whole race because of it is not objective.

       I'm certainly not going to agree with the OP's anti-semitism, but for the purposes of the discussion, I believe he's attempting to delineate between a religious community, and the practise itself. A community includes strong relationships outside the church. He's a 'lapsed' Christian who hangs out with Christians, follows Christian values , but doesn't really believe in God.
And now, back to the silly anti-semitic generalities.
(OP, life is more complicated than this. No religion, in general, is made up in majority of bad people. It's always a determined fringe base, whether you study the religious zealots, or the amoral crooks).

       my point is those are the "good jews."  the ones that essentially aren't jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       the further down the jew scale you go towards zionist, the more bad.  therefore, jews = bad.
