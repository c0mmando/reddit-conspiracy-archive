Pizzagate is believed to be a underground child paedophilia ring controlled by known politicians such as the Clintons and podestas.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure about the exact nature of the motivation to murder them, but this is more or less what I believe. They were both involved in projects to help abused children. My sticking point is it seems that these child abuse relief orgs are often fronts for actually finding, grooming, and abusing kids. Evil people have a sick sense of irony or something. Chester&#39;s org was also involved in Haiti. Given what is suspected about Clinton&#39;s involvement there, I begin to wonder about Chester, or at the very least what he knew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes this more conspiratorial than anything else is the fact there was no indication PRIOR to their deaths that they were depressed.</p>

<p>Sure, if you peel back enough layers in ones life depression, is bound to rear its ugly head. Some deeper than others but I don&#39;t think anyone is devoid of depression now-a-days.</p>

<p>Chris showed no sign of depression. In fact he had plans in the near future and just purchased a house. Chester on the other hand, might have had more reason to be depressed (given his best friend just died) but it still is bizarre.</p>

<p>So if given the two options (suicide due to depression OR suspicious death) it seems the latter makes a little more sense. Besides, for two known party-animals, wouldn&#39;t taking a shitload of sleeping pills been a better way to kill themselves? Suicide by hanging just isn&#39;t very popular especially when one has choices (unlike an inmate in a cell).</p>

<p>I feel there will be another significant &#39;suicide&#39; very soon (within the next 2 weeks) with ties to the DNC.
When it comes to the Clintons-----no one is safe. They are ruthless sociopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i couldn&#39;t agree more. And I actually was just thinking about if another &quot;suicide&quot; happened. And I hope that pizzagate conspiracy isn&#39;t true.

    <div class="md"><p>Well many people claim who research suicide and those who have suicidal thoughts say that suicide is a planned thing. And when you finally come to the agreement with yourself that you are gonna go through with it, you finally come to peace because you know the suffering will end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>about 2 years ago one of my closest friends committed suicide, he was a great guy and all outward appearances would lead anyone to think he was a regular, happy person.  Myself and his closest friends, even his wife, were shocked.  Depression and suicidal thoughts often go unnoticed even by people close to the person who is suffering.</p>

<p>I have been a huge Soundgarden/Cornell fan since the early 90&#39;s, if you listen to a lot of the lyrics of his music a lot of them deal with depression and suicide.  I also love Linkin Park and their music also has those themes.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard for me to believe Chris Cornell suffered from depression, and it&#39;s unfortunate and sad but I think he decided to take his own life.  It&#39;s also not too hard for me to believe Chester, being so close to Chris, was depressed and also took his own life.</p>

<p>What is a little hard for me to believe is that both of these guys were about to crack open some sort of huge pizzagate ring.  It just sounds silly to me, no offence.  </p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy.  Some people have serious depression, even millionaire rock stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, sorry to hear about your friend. Suicide is a real thing, I think we all know that. And I think your absolutely right about the song lyrics and meaning behind both bands music. I&#39;m not claiming this is all a conspiracy. I truly don&#39;t know what happened because I wasn&#39;t there and I think all the signs point to suicide. I was just trying to see what other people thought on the matter. No matter what happened i think we can all agree they were extremely talented musicians that nobody wanted to see go.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not that I know anything for certain either, but if all the signs pointed to suicide we wouldn&#39;t be talking about it. Chris was found with 8 broken ribs, after supposedly hanging himself with a method that would require him to physically pull on a rope until he died. That would be nearly impossible without the pain of several inexplicably broken ribs. </p>

<p>Chester was found with 9 broken ribs and a head trauma.</p>

<p>Both of those aspects potentially point away from suicide and towards a physical confrontation, as well as a second person pulling the rope, at least in Chris&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Granted, these are second-hand internet facts, so they may not show the whole picture. It&#39;s conceivable that the broken ribs occurred during resuscitation, although 8 and 9 respectively would indicate some pretty extreme chest compressions.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know either, and it may well have been suicide after all, but to say all signs point towards that being the case is far from the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen rashes of suicides among friends.  In a town I used to live in a kid committed suicide.  Not long afterwards another kid, friends with the first, killed themselves also.  People talked about how bad the person felt that their friend killed themselves and they couldn&#39;t stop it, which is primarily what people contributed to their own choice of suicide.  There was another person who was friends with the second one, and she killed herself also.  Basically within a few month span, I think 5-6 teenagers killed themselves.  They weren&#39;t part of a close knit group, but each subsequent suicide was friends with at least one of the previous ones.  Sometimes people are so close to the edge that a bit of a push sends them over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Linkin Park has this Haiti relief foundation, and has a small history of interaction with the Clintons. Chris Cornell also has a child relief organization. The theory goes that Cornell was about to uncover something, so they killed him. Bashed them the head, broke his ribs, and staged it as a suicide. Perhaps he confided this to his friend Chester, but someone got to him too, and killed him on his birthday to send a message. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little far-fetched, but hey, maybe this is how conspiracy theorists grieve. </p>

<p>B-B-BONUS ROUND: Chester bennington looks eerily similar to J. Podesta. More eccentric conspiracy theorists speculate that he is his biological father. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everything is a conspiracy BUT i&#39;m pretty sure these guys got murdered. On the EMT (?) call for Chris Cornell the responder said that he had a gash in the back of his head and broken ribs. I&#39;ve seen people argue about the broken ribs saying that could have been from CPR or whatever but regarding the gash: I&#39;m pretty sure when medics, emt&#39;s, first responders or whatever find a guy hanging they don&#39;t just cut him off the rope and let him fall to the ground. The head injury wasn&#39;t reported or put down in the medical report.</p>

<p>Chester committed suicide in a house he had literally just bought and moved into with his wife and kids. That&#39;s an incredibly weird decision for even a hugely depressed father to make imo. </p>

<p>Add that to the fact that Chris was working in an org for victims of child abuse, the fact Chris was by all accounts really happy at the concert that took place right before his death- even talking about how excited he was for the next show, and the fact that both Chris&#39; and Chester&#39;s friends and family wanted their deaths investigated as homicides.

I still feel like shit, but now I&#39;m in a new place that doesn&#39;t feel like home yet and there&#39;s no calming familiarity like in the old house, bad memories associated with it or not&quot;.</p>

<p>He might have thought the new house will fix everything but it just made him realize things were even worse since now he was in a less familiar place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chester did receive a large amount of money from Killariy&#39;s foundation. Chester and Chris also were both involved in a charity that was trying to spread awareness about child trafficking in Haiti. So there is a lot of connections that are there. I would side more on what the minority is saying in this since 90% of media is controlled by 6 corporations and they are all pushing suicide. Neonnettle and yournewswire could be telling the truth. They even recently came out with an article about Katy Perry talking about the music industry and its elites and how they also might be apart of the pedo ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what gets me, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence. I would say it at least warrants more people to look into the connection between Hillary and Chester more. Plus there is also the whole thing going around that he may be related to Molesta Podesta. And honestly they look eerily alike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it.  You can&#39;t just casually accuse someone (especially a public figure) of being a pedophile.  You need to have solid evidence otherwise you&#39;re going to sued and if we&#39;re talking about a pedophile ring then even more so.  So assuming this ring is real, it&#39;s not that much of a stretch to assume that anyone researching it will be under surveillance from an early stage.  If you get too close, you&#39;re suicided.  All this stuff about depressive lyrics is a joke.  It&#39;s one of the most common song topics ever.  It&#39;s evidence of nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, sorry to hear about your friend. Suicide is a real thing, I think we all know that. And I think your absolutely right about the song lyrics and meaning behind both bands music. I&#39;m not claiming this is all a conspiracy. I truly don&#39;t know what happened because I wasn&#39;t there and I think all the signs point to suicide. I was just trying to see what other people thought on the matter. No matter what happened i think we can all agree they were extremely talented musicians that nobody wanted to see go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen rashes of suicides among friends.  In a town I used to live in a kid committed suicide.  Not long afterwards another kid, friends with the first, killed themselves also.  People talked about how bad the person felt that their friend killed themselves and they couldn&#39;t stop it, which is primarily what people contributed to their own choice of suicide.  There was another person who was friends with the second one, and she killed herself also.  Basically within a few month span, I think 5-6 teenagers killed themselves.  They weren&#39;t part of a close knit group, but each subsequent suicide was friends with at least one of the previous ones.  Sometimes people are so close to the edge that a bit of a push sends them over.</p>
