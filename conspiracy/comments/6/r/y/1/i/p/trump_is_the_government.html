        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all seen the new push to label Trump as &quot;the government.&quot;  The corrupt government through the DNC tried to hijack his political platform and now they&#39;re coming after our anti-them platform.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the president is in fact, not the government.  Since this seems to be a difficult concept for some to grasp as of late, here&#39;s a little ELI5 for those of you who are confused.</p>

<p>There are three separate branches that make up the United States government; the president only being the chief executive of one of those.  Our founding fathers were smart enough to create two other branches for something we call &quot;Checks and Balances.&quot;</p>

<p>Our founding fathers realized that one man could not rule a nation, like King George III did (who they were at odds with at the time), so they added a congress to represent &quot;the people.&quot;  The congress is comprised of two separate houses, the senate and the house of representatives.</p>

<p>Now, many of our founding fathers were lawyers so they knew they also had to create a high court, to rule on whether or not the laws passed by congress followed the constitution.  This high court is what we call the &quot;Supreme&quot; court.</p>

<p>Because this is a nation of, by, and for the people, we elect our representatives and executive, and entrust that between the two they can agree on who should sit on the supreme court.  </p>

<p>However, there are appointees and hirings made by the branches that are not chosen by the people, beaurocrats to keep the machine turning if you will.  These beaurocrats run the most influential parts of the US government and stay hidden in the shadows for decades, to include every person in the &quot;intelligence community.&quot; </p>

<p>The intelligence community comprises what most now accept as the &quot;Deep State.&quot;  A nefarious group with untold power and wealth who believe it is in their best interest, and the interest of those with whom they deal, to keep &quot;the people&quot; in the dark as to what actually happens behind the scenes in our government.  They believe that morals and ethics have no part in their profession, and would sell out their grandmother if it was beneficial to them (not all).  </p>

<p>This Deep State is connected to every major corporation in the United States, and has the ability to blackmail just about every single important American in both the private and public sectors.  The American people are waking up to this deep state and are sick and tired of them running it into the ground for their own gain.</p>

<p>The Deep State is suspected of assassinating a sitting US president, is known to have incited violent revolution in democratic nations such as Chile and Nicaragua (among others around the world), is known to have operations in wich they use their media contacts to sway public opinion, has been caught trafficking in weapons and drugs, and is generally extremely shady.</p>

<p>This Deep State corrupted our government to such an extent that the United States of America <em>actually</em> elected Donald Trump to be their warrior in Washington.</p>

<p>At first President Trump tried to play nice with the government and country in shambles, that he inherited from his predecessor<em>S</em>.  But it has been shown that the Deep State is unwilling to play nice with the people&#39;s choice so, President Trump has been attempting to isolate himself from those who make up the majority of the government who wish to see him, and through extension the people, fail.</p>

<p>So you see, no, Trump is not &quot;the government.&quot;  Today you learned.</p>

<p>Spez: besides the fact that the deep states is controlled by even more shadowy cabals.  But that&#39;s a theory for another post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is a necessary evil in the region and is <em>also</em> being led astray by evil forces.  The vast majority of Jews around the world live Israel but wholeheartedly disagree with Zionism and the fascist state is has become.  Ol&#39; BeBe is under investigation as we speak.</p>

<p>He never said military war against China, he said economic war.  And that is because China has essentially been waging an economic war against the west since the early 2000&#39;s (maybe after they saw the west was crazy enough to pull off 9/11and start unfounded resource wars).</p>

<p>Uhhh... he <em>doesn&#39;t</em> want a war with Russia, that was kind of a huge part of his platform.  If you can&#39;t point me to a recent clip or written statement of his that we need a military war with Russia I&#39;m all ears.</p>

<p>IIIFFF (yuge IF) it is true that NK has a nuke and a decent, reliable missile, and China isn&#39;t stopping them, what would you suggest the world do about?  Should we just let the lunatic start launching nukes at SK and Japan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK won&#39;t do shit. Wanna know how I know? Because the leaders of NK wanna <em>live</em>. Sure, the population is brainwashed, but their leaders aren&#39;t complete idiots and don&#39;t actually buy their own rhetoric. Hell, Un was educated in Europe. He knows NK going to war against the American hegemony is a no-win scenario for them.</p>

<p>They know the moment they push the button it&#39;s curtains for them. But if they&#39;re attacked why should they think we&#39;ll grant them leniency? Saddam was executed, Bin Laden assassinated, the administration of the Third Reich was executed almost to the man. So, them thinking they have nothing to lose anyway makes them far more likely to push the button and end millions of lives in a nuclear fireball. </p>

<p>So let them saber rattle. They&#39;ll collapse due to economic strain sooner or later.</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny because, I&#39;m pretty sure somewhere close to the top I say that he is the chief executive of one of the three branches of government.  Not sure about you but, to me that constitutes part of the government.  </p>

<p>Part of.  A very small part of, with very little actual control.  My argument is that when someone here says &quot;Trump <em>is</em> the government,&quot; they are referring to the larger deep state that has a control over our country.  Are you telling me Trump is a dictator who controls all three branches and every &quot;bureaucrat?&quot;  From what I can tell, most of those people are doing what they can to smear and fight him.</p>

<p>But go ahead and twist my words some more.</p>

<p>Some of those bosses are still holdovers with whom he&#39;s trying to play nice to get things done.  And changing the boss doesn&#39;t automatically change every bureaucrat within the agency, or even the holdovers within.</p>

<p>We all saw what happened when Trump did what he &quot;had every right to do&quot; in firing Mueller.  You honestly believe TPTB would sit back and allow the American people to think that Trump is doing what he has every right to do?  </p>

<p>No.  They would get on the phone to their numerous media contacts and start spreading bullshit about how it&#39;s chaos, and insiders are up in arms, and he&#39;s a dictator usurping the power of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m giving specific examples to back my points while you wave your arms and spout generic phrases like &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;, but <em>I&#39;m</em> the one being disingenuous.</p>

<p>Trump thought he could run the government like a business, hiring and firing who he wanted without consequence.  Although obviously not a smart guy, even <em>he</em> is starting to learn that there are consequences to those actions.  Thus why he abruptly fired Comey, but has not yet fired Mueller.  Republicans in Congress are slowly abandoning him and he knows that if he fires Mueller, they&#39;ll probably assign an independent investigator, in which case Trump is screwed.  There are no boogeymen to see here.  His power is being checked the way our Constitution meant it to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m giving specific examples back to your points as well and you are completely glossing over them. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another specific example.  The Republicans &quot;fought&quot; for the repeal of the ACA for seven years, Trump partly ran on it, and when it came time for the Repuicans in congress to live up to their end of the deal...  oooh whadya know, one vote short.  Screw the rest of us, they&#39;re not paying what we pay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even he is starting to learn that there are consequences to those actions. Thus why he abruptly fired Comey, but has not yet fired Mueller. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so now he can&#39;t just do whatever is within his right to do?  Which one is it?  And &quot;abruptly&quot; fired Comey?  After months of waiting and getting him to reassure Trump multiple times that he wasn&#39;t under investigation is not &quot;abruptly.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republicans in Congress are slowly abandoning him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  You mean the never Trumpers who were <em>never</em> with him in the first place?  The Republicans in congress that I have <em>repeatedly</em> said are part of &quot;muh deep state&quot; who are working against him?  Okay, let&#39;s play games.  He&#39;s gaining such massive support that he got a Democratic governer to become a Republican.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His power is being checked </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good.  I&#39;m glad that you agree that he is not an all powerful ruler and that those with the capabilities of stopping him are doing everything they can to stop him. </p>

<p>Yes, <em>you</em> are being incredibly disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, posts like this offend me and the other &quot;totally real conspiracy subreddit users&quot;!</p>

<p>How dare you post anything defending the 24/7 reddit attack on Trump! People should be allowed to post anything they want smearing him regardless of how incorrect it is and if you even lift a finger to defend against it, then you are clearly a member of &quot;t_d&quot;!</p>

<p>Anything less than a 99% anti-Trump new queue in this subreddit is clearly proof that conspiracy is &quot;turning into t_d 2.0&quot;!</p>

<p>I mean, even if the things being said about Trump like &quot;Trump is the government&quot; or &quot;Trump is the establishment&quot; or &quot;anyone who becomes president is automatically the leader of TPTB&quot; are completely made-up talking points, the fact that you are even trying to defend a person as vile as Trump is proof that you are being paid by Putin.</p>

<p>Why would you even defend Trump? Its like, he deserves to be lied about because nothing in the US was bad until he became President. </p>

<p>I cannot believe this subreddit is being turned into t_d 2.0. Everyone knows that the mainstream media and &quot;popular&quot; reddit page dictate reality. </p>

<p>I did an analysis comparing the front page of r-&quot;politics&quot; with the front page of this subreddit and my &quot;totally balanced data&quot; clearly shows that there are too many differences between the two. </p>

<p>The US president is literally in charge of every single decision or action that occurs because the world works like a cartoon written for a 4-year old!</p>
