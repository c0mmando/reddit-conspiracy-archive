       I reposted an article by Pilger about the US / Russia / China situation and it got promptly removed because 'unacceptable source'. I expected it would be, but since it didn't break any of their rules in the sidebar, I was wondering how they were going to spin this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that now, after years of having to invent reasons to remove posts and in the process show their bias, they have now figured out a way to create the safest of spaces, simply create a list of sources that are allowed and ban everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so incredibly sad to see people point to a completely controlled North Korean population, while witnessing people asking for their own censorship in the free West. As if we're all kids that need to be protected from hearing things that might be damaging.

       I kinda don't give a shit what politics does. At this point if you are going there for any reason other than seeing the animals at the zoo, that shit is on the person going there. This sub is not the opposite of politics. It really doesn't have anything to do with politics directly.

       Well, I'm not subscribed, nor do I visit it with any frequency, but seeing that new rule does concern me because it affects many people and it is evidence of how far people are willing to go. The upside is that for some it will be the final drop that makes them look elsewhere for information.

       Perhaps you need to look further, r/politics doesn't exist in isolation. It isn't about their ruleset but about the mentality that can exist in a so called free society. It isn't about the mods who rule over its visitors but about the users who are happy about it, they exist outside that sub, they are everywhere around you, if these people are not your target then who are we spreading information for, our own indulgence? Beating our own chest because we know better? I can be cynical too but I prefer to overlook that in favor of some pragmatism.

       No. This bill would cause premiums for sick people to skyrocket making it unaffordable. The fucking CBO came out and said millions would lose healthcare. I'm sure to the right that's just liberal propaganda though.

       Without the mandate, many healthy people are expected to drop coverage. People making these arguments are gaslighting the fact that Obamacare didn't exist before 2010 and the world was not in chaos before then.  This whole idea that the sky would fall if we went back to pre-2010 healthcare is a farce.

       This just reeks of "fuck you, I got mine".  Pre Obamacare was horrible for a LOT of people. It may not have helped you personally, but it has helped millions of other people who otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford insurance to get healthcare. I don't see why more people getting insurance is a horrible thing. I'd gladly pay more if it meant other people could get insurance who weren't able to before.

       I'm not against poor people getting free healthcare, I'm against the government taking my money without my consent. Maybe if I wasn't getting taxed out the ass so hard I could afford to donate to a charitable institution once in a while.

       Calling a majority of the people normies as if that makes them irrelevant isn't going to bring a solution though, the only thing it brings is our own isolation. The truth has never been popular, but being cynical about it has never changed anything.

       Actually cynicism has brought change before. It's called The American Revolution. Your Precious normies were okay with paying taxes to the Queen because she went broke from the French and Indian war around the 1760s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normies back then didn't know any better and CHANGED
       <sup>
        Nothing.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       It took several people who thought &lt;B&gt;cynicaly&lt;/B&gt; about politics to change the political mess of taxation without representation in the English parliment. As well as other political issues.

       I wasn't talking about a well founded argument that there is self interest and how it is causing issues. I'm talking about low effort bitter pessimism that is meant to halt all discussion, just like your reply, in a typical "no need to talk about this because these people are complete shit and there's nothing to be done about it but lets beat our chest because we're not part of it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think there would've been an American Revolution if people resorted to your type of remarks? People had actual discussions and came up with ideas that went beyond "oh look, dey stooped".

       Wait a minute. Are you seriously trying to say that a gold-standard source of unbiased political news like r-"politics" is... not that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is literally named politics and literally nobody was around when it switched overnight from a Bernie Sanders leaning subreddit into Hillary Clinton's (who I still honorably refer to as Madame President) personal rally center! And since nobody was there and you cannot prove it, then it is obvious you are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         literally trying to turn this subreddit into a clone of t_d
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         officially disrespecting my
         <em>
          fellow conspiracy members
         </em>
         who all find r-politics to be an amazing source of genuine journalism
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         literally getting paid by the Russians/Chinese/North Koreans to make these posts
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         seriously disrespecting the integrity of reddit, reddits popular page, and the #1 unbiased source of politics on the internet which r-conspiracy could learn a thing or two from.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In conclusion, when this subreddit perfectly resembles r-politics, only then will we know that we have beaten those evil TD'ers whose only goal in life is to manipulate this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only when every comment section is a graveyard for any dissenting opinions to the MSM, will we know that we have finally won that battle!

       From what I have seen, shareblue is heavily slanted but I have not seen any outright falsehoods in stories. Would you care to support your assertion with examples of their lies?

       You got the reason why that link isn't allowed, and yet for some reason decided it was because of something else.
This isn't to do with the whitelist they recently implemented, this is because your linked website isn't ran by a news org.

       If you had read the complete set rules that are linked in the sidebar, you may had realised it wasn't allowed.

       It is tagged as "unacceptable source" and I didn't see the rule they quoted in the sidebar. But that's all irrelevant, I'm not complaining that it was removed because it wasn't against the rules. I'm complaining because of their new whitelist policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly your comment is a bit brainless because it seemingly fails to see the issue I'm addressing and instead goes on about how they're technically in the right. You know, it isn't hard to be technically in the right when you can decide what the rules are, the discussion is whether those rules are just. I thought that was obvious, but some people need everything spelled out it seems.

       It is an unacceptable source according to their rules and there is a link to the rules in the sidebar. The guidelines in the sidebar are a summery of the rules, which is why not every rule is quoted in the sidebar (their rule list is far too long to fully include in the sidebar). Again, this has nothing to do with the whitelist but to do with the fact the source is not affiliated with a news org.

       If the removal of your submission is irrelevant, why include it here in this submission? If the removal of your submission has nothing to do with the whitelist, that means you either thought it did and don't want to admit you were wrong or you included it knowing it was irrelevant to the discussion you apparently want as a means to back up your viewpoint. The former makes you look like an idiot, the latter makes you look like you intended to misrepresent the situation.

       The point of my post was purely about the whitelist, whether there is another rule that disallows blogs is irrelevant. I wasn't wrong about anything, I simply used the wrong example because I went by the visible rule list in the sidebar. Does that change anything? And if it doesn't change anything, that would mean that those who are repeating your argument are nitpicking, perhaps in an attempt to steer the discussion away from the real matter at hand, or perhaps just an incessant need to mold the discussion into something you can claim victory over. The real issue I've addressed is glanced over by you or anyone arguing like you in this thread because it can't be argued with.

        It seems that now, after years of having to invent reasons to remove posts and in the process show their bias, they have now figured out a way to create the safest of spaces, simply create a list of sources that are allowed and ban everything else.

       of your post again does not directly reference the whitelist. Instead it makes a comment hyperbolic about censorship (which is now completely unsubstantiated) and says they are protecting people from content you... freely admit might be damaging.

       Sure seems like your post was more about your post getting removed than about the whitelist!

       There was no debate or discussion as to what qualifies as an acceptable news source when the mods rolled it out. It's a limit on free speech, on purpose, to shape the parameters of "acceptable" discussion.

       You are defending the intellectual paucity of that sub as something that is right and good. All that the whitelist does is cordon debate into "acceptable" channels. Same with the elimination of self-posts there. It's frankly a joke sub at this point, that is obviously heavily shilled to anyone with a modicum of critical thinking ability.

       So you are complaining because the post you want to put up, which has always been against the rules, will now be automatically barred instead of requiring a moderator to manually remove it for... still breaking the rules?

       Is another definition of retrograde. Limiting sources of info, in light of the internet's ability to allow a cornucopia of sources. BAR is a radical leftist blog owned and operated by African-Americans that is highly influential in circles of leftist and radical thinking.

       Have you tried messaging the moderators and making that case? If it is influential then make the case for it, don't just bemoan that they aren't already aware of it.

       How so? I have seen many people complain about the trash in /new... far more than I have seen bemoaning the changes. That would seem to me to actually be living up to the democratic principles of reddit- the majority wants some low bars of entry for sources, so it gets implemented.

       Key word in that is NEWS. Not opinion. Not thought. NEWS. How are self-posts in any way necessary to providing NEWS?

       Are you taking the position that rules regarding veracity and notability of a source are not necessary? That, say, the things floating around facebook should qualify as news, even if they are verifiably false?

       is shill shithole now. I've got better things to do with my time than try and talk to mods who will ignore me anyways. I have argued for sites inclusion in the past (when they first rolled out the blacklist), and was roundly ignored. I argued for self-posts, and was roundly ignored. If they refuse to reply to modmail why should I waste my time there, or continue to try and change it. Instead I encourage to people unsubscribe.

       No, I just don't care. I'm slowly weaning myself off of reddit and tech in general, mainly because I don't think we have much time left as a species (a few decades) and I'm tired of wasting my time with people like yourself who are self-righteous twits bent on ignoring the fucked up nature of reality online and off. So keep defending that social consensus, and make sure those you support politically, will soon rule over ash.

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it is bothersome that their posts are literally constantly on r/all and on r/popular (to beautifully mislead and brainwash unsuspecting visitors and even regular Redditors that don't know exactly what's going on), but it's probably impossible to fight it at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making and promoting other high quality subs, as well as making this sub one of a higher quality is probably where our efforts should be aimed at (instead of fighting them - though to be fair, a post here and there bringing awareness to the obvious one-sided insanity that is r/politics is still perhaps at times a good idea).

       It is tagged as "unacceptable source" and I didn't see the rule they quoted in the sidebar. But that's all irrelevant, I'm not complaining that it was removed because it wasn't against the rules. I'm complaining because of their new whitelist policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly your comment is a bit brainless because it seemingly fails to see the issue I'm addressing and instead goes on about how they're technically in the right. You know, it isn't hard to be technically in the right when you can decide what the rules are, the discussion is whether those rules are just. I thought that was obvious, but some people need everything spelled out it seems.

       There was no debate or discussion as to what qualifies as an acceptable news source when the mods rolled it out. It's a limit on free speech, on purpose, to shape the parameters of "acceptable" discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently read Black agenda report. It is not acceptable source for  r/politics even though it is an incredibly insightful blog about American politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are defending the intellectual paucity of that sub as something that is right and good. All that the whitelist does is cordon debate into "acceptable" channels. Same with the elimination of self-posts there. It's frankly a joke sub at this point, that is obviously heavily shilled to anyone with a modicum of critical thinking ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you go back there and bloviate endlessly about what ever propaganda morsel rules the news cycle for the day.

       I wasn't talking about a well founded argument that there is self interest and how it is causing issues. I'm talking about low effort bitter pessimism that is meant to halt all discussion, just like your reply, in a typical "no need to talk about this because these people are complete shit and there's nothing to be done about it but lets beat our chest because we're not part of it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think there would've been an American Revolution if people resorted to your type of remarks? People had actual discussions and came up with ideas that went beyond "oh look, dey stooped".
