       America is not a democracy. It was supposed to be a Constitutional Republic...This is how they like to twist the narrative. Divide and conquer as they say. When do you think the real change will come? Looking for intelligent thoughts here, not trolls or shills...Please discuss.

       I think we will see the real change in 2018 when we get rid off all the obama republicans from congress. Trump can't do this himself, we need to get him some support, only then will the tide turn.

       Well it looks far more likely that the republicans will loss seats next election. I think his days are numbered as at some point the republicans are going to remove him before the democrats get the chance. Once he hits a certain low in the polls they will see him as a threat to their jobs and find a way to remove him if they can. If republicans see impeachment and removal as inevitable they will want it done as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that is my guess on what could happen.

       Republicans may lose seats but it doesn't matter because candidates who want to advance Trump's agenda will be the ones who get elected immaterial of party. There are already lawsuits against the GOP by GOP donors suing them for fraud and racketeering for failing to repeal Obamacare. Impeachment ain't going to happen. There has to be a reason to impeach a president. He has to have done something wrong, not just "we don't like you". Your guess is improbable.

       Impeachment all you need is the smallest of reasons and enough hatred towards the president. They got Clinton for lying about having sex with a women and they nearly removed him from office over that. You don't think that they can dig up something to nail him to the board with if they really wanted to. Plus republicans can remove him by a vote of nonconfidense among his cabinet, they just would have to convince the right people.

       Give me a break. You can think of all the piddly shit you want to try to get him out of office but you forget who put him in power. The people did and the people won't stand for some dumb political coup.

       The people will if his poll numbers keep dropping, he is at like 30% now if it gets significantly lower, especially among republicans, then not enough people would care to actually do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the republicans to remove him his approval rating among republicans would have to drop below 50%, so he is fine for now considerijg among republicans last I checked be was at 90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republicans would only remove him if they think his unpopularity will lead to many of them lossing seats.

       The same pollsters that said Hillary had a 96% chance of winning? GTFO of here with that crap. The republicans are going to lose seats because they failed to repeal Obamacare, because they failed to advance trumps agenda...they are failures and should lose seats. Trump has huge support all across America and his supporters are taking note of what's going on.

       I don't think the real change will come. I think the U.S. is doomed. It's already so far away from its founding ideals that it is effectively gone already, never to be recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change may change the changes we've seen, but the U.S. will never be what it was meant to be ever again. People just get fatter, dumber, lazier, more domesticated and feminized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have now is nonsense chaos and people trying to loot what they can while the chaos rages. All these little special interests groups appealing to a necrotic state for measures that will only ensure that nothing is ever restored and continues its incremental decay.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're headed for a total wasteland of conquered traditions and purpose. All the while the grip of bloated government continues to squeeze away all notions of freedom and autonomy and normalizing new measures that men would have fought against and died just 50 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never would have guessed this social engineering could affect its purpose so quickly and absolutely.

       This was the kind of response I was looking for! The entire situation is fucked if you ask me. This "race war" is total manipulation of the masses. Such bullshit. I am a 32 year old living in America who has a Puerto Rican best friend and several black friends. I'm also a white native American that listens to Slayer and oldschool​ blues.

       Moving forward slowly but deliberately, I feel is superior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government used to make laws proactively, now they are reactionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       A government that moves slowly, studies and observes, and allows  situations to develop and mature before trying to legislate, and then does so in a broad manner open to interpretation, are superior to a government that moves quickly, creates laws before situations develop and are generally understood poorly, and creates legislation in a knee jerk fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving slowly, with eyes open, observing everything is how it should be done.

       Define "real change"
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal beliefs lead me to believe no major changes will be sudden; it slowly transitions over time so that it's not easily detected. The change derive mostly on the divide and conquer as you mentioned, whether it's racially, religiously or politically. Division of the people typically grants them more power over us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The racial divide was brought back in full force during Obama's terms. I remember him speaking out against police brutality, killings and oppression against the African Americans. I also remember him speaking, giving his condolences for the guilty suspects killed by police either on T.V. or at their funerals, whilst he stayed silent on some police officers who were killed in the line of duty. As a result I can remember clearly of the spike of police KIA; specifically the one officer in Tx pumping gas who had an entire magazine unloaded on him randomly by a black, just because he was an officer of the law. I don't need to go into any detail about Furguson, nor the BLM movement that came about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The divide between the republicans and democrats is more prevalent than ever. One of John Adam's biggest annoyances.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only concern of it all is what's the climax? What's their endgame? What's this all going to lead to? All I can do is prepare for the worst...whatever that may be. Until then.. Stay educated, stay aware and healthy.

       You are right, but you are relying on the modern (twisted) definition of democracy imho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy etymologically means the people (individuals) rule, i.e. are the sovereigns, i.e. are
       <em>
        above
       </em>
       the State. It doesn't (or shouldn't) mean "mob rule", or be reduced to universal suffrage (as it commonly is nowadays).
      </p>
      <p>
       If individuals are sovereign, they may create a government if they so please (whether a republic or a collectivist utopia). But that government, being subservient to the individuals, couldn't, by very definition, inherit prerogatives that no individual holds, insofar as such power couldn't have been delegated to it. So coercitive taxation, or prosecuting victimless crimes, are typically anti-democratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple analogy: if 5 landowners gather to hire a security guard, he can indeed guard over his employers' property insofar as every one of his employers himself has that (natural) right (and has voluntarily delegated it to the guard). The guard can't however go and confiscate the property of 1 of his employers, even if the other 4 told him to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a republic may still be totalitarian (and it is as long as you rely on Plato's definition of it). Democracy, in the proper sense, means sovereign individuals, hence it equates with liberty.

       America as they foresaw it (if it's as it was taught and I can't believe in that blindly anymore) hasn't been such in a very long time and it's never going back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it'll occur in my lifetime or not but what I foresee is another revolution. This time, however, the states will divide among themselves (I think it'll divide by Northeastern, Southeastern, Midwest, Southwest, and Northwest) and form their own nations. Basically, the USA will be much like Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, I haven't given it much thought.

       It always amuses me that people are still quibbling with the same term in two different languages and fighting over it. Like saying, "It's not 'aqua,' it's 'water'!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, agua
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       water. They're the same thing referred to in two different languages.
      </p>
      <p>
       In ancient Greece, they had
       <em>
        democratia
       </em>
       (which meant "rule by the people"). And then in ancient Rome, they had
       <em>
        res publica
       </em>
       (which meant "rule by the people").

       The people will if his poll numbers keep dropping, he is at like 30% now if it gets significantly lower, especially among republicans, then not enough people would care to actually do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the republicans to remove him his approval rating among republicans would have to drop below 50%, so he is fine for now considerijg among republicans last I checked be was at 90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republicans would only remove him if they think his unpopularity will lead to many of them lossing seats.
