The metadata supports this. I am furious. Try and prove me wrong.</p>

<p>I have now spent ~10 hours answering people. My response to everything is read this link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d9xcm/breaking_ive_found_evidence_that_the_dnc/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d9xcm/breaking_ive_found_evidence_that_the_dnc/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about OP, but I&#39;m curious about the fact that Seth was hit by a car while riding his bike, was a dedicated user of a Reddit bicycling forum, noted every ding, scratch, busy intersection, gave tips on how to use your renters insurance to cover your stolen bike, every single day. But he never mentioned getting run down. And his friend, Jake Brewer, an Obama staffer, was run down and killed on his bike. Again, not a single comment in Seth&#39;s social media archives. Do you want to know what I can find after pouring through it all for months? One comment saying he can no longer eat the &quot;drunken pizza that his roommate keeps tempting him with because surgery made him lactose intolerant.&quot;</p>

<p>So, yeah. There is a lot of weirdness here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he <em>knew</em>, was somewhat complicit and chose to leak the emails. I think he threatened to do so sooner, was hit by a car, shut up for a while, Jake was killed, then he really shut up, then, he spilled to his bartender, the owner of the bar having met with Podesta at the WH two days before and three days after Seth&#39;s murder. </p>

<p>He was roughed up and murdered because pizzagate. </p>

<p>That is my theory. </p>

It could be something, but if he did have a meeting like that with Podesta  why wouldn&#39;t he meet somewhere less conspicuous that didn&#39;t have sign in logs?  Podesta didn&#39;t even work at the WH at the time, so why meet there?</p>

Please understand it takes me a long time to look up that info. When I try to google this stuff, all google returns is results about how the Seth rich conspiracy theory is debunked and bullshit. You are right in that I can&#39;t say it&#39;s DNC for sure. That&#39;s me being angry and making an assumption, which I shouldn&#39;t do. I know I need to be accurate and concise. But I feel confident in that he is the leaker and that that fact gives great reason to murder him. I&#39;m still looking for the link of info about the wikileaks press conference on Seth Richs bday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not evidence but trail of breadcrumbs</p>

<p>1) panda moniker and involvement in panda party</p>

<p>2) multiple independent IT experts have shown that the data was retrieved locally due to the transfer speeds being too high to have been performed in a non-local environment, so the leaker was somebody who worked with the DNC and had access to the files</p>

<p>2b) DWS admitted to using Dropbox with some classified materials back with Clinton email scandal or something, and Seymour Hersh claimed that Dropbox was used to pass the content on to Wikileaks. This is somewhat different from the claim in the upcoming point 3, but it stands that the leaker may have just shared the files over dropbox if that was an option rather than steal and host the data themselves. I&#39;m sure this would create quite the shit-storm around culpability as well... it&#39;s harder to blame someone else it&#39;s the company&#39;s direct account that makes the data available.</p>

<p>3) Kim Dot Com claimed to be involved with handling the data of the leak in some way. Maybe he was the person Seth shared the dropbox with and then passed the data on to Wikileaks to ensure they had a backup, or the dropbox stuff isn&#39;t true and Seth interacted directly with KDC and then KDC worked with wikileaks. KDC is still willing to come to the US to give a sworn statement on the case, but will not do so if his statement cannot be used in court and if he is not given complete immunity from his extradition charges while he is in the US to make the statement. That is a logical request, and there has been no answer from the US gov&#39;t to this point (which is not surprising). Mueller would have to do it.</p>

<p>4) The timing of his death is at the height of tensions. If Seth Rich was indeed the leaker, it made sense to kill him if only for the ability to pin the leak on somebody else. It&#39;s classic politics. I am not even convinced that his &#39;mugging&#39; was supposed to kill him; I think SEIU staff were the ones who killed him at the hospital once he was left to rest. For him to be able to come forward and take credit for the leak was too damaging, and by killing him, the DNC has created the Russia scapegoat that has given them 8+ months of traction instead.</p>

<p>5) All of the little clues - Julian Assange&#39;s strange look/nod at Seth Rich&#39;s mention, KDC&#39;s testimony that Seth was indeed the leaker, the fact that the leaker HAD to be a local user, and all of the buzz that Seth was not only upset with the DNC but starting to plan an upstart political party makes me really interested in placing him into it. I can see the motivations in killing him if he were indeed the leaker, but I think the shooting was a very clever or lucky diversion. 
He was never supposed to die in the streets - they took advantage of a mugging gone wrong and turned a negative into a positive (seth rich testimony turns into a russian hacking narrative).</p>

<p>6) Seth&#39;s brother was originally not down with Bauman or the &#39;official narrative&#39;. He implored people to keep asking questions and even told the DNC PR people to back off before he settled back and shut up. I think that initial reaction is important to factor in. He may have been threatened or his family may have made some sort of a deal. Bauman certainly seemed flippant at times considering the morbid truth of the case he was handling, which rubbed some the wrong way. </p>

<p>I could probably come up with a few more.... Again, none of this is concrete evidence or even partial evidence. I trust the pros on this at the end of the day - when there is a basis for filing a suit, I believe it will happen. With that said, Seth Rich&#39;s murder is unsolved. We have to speculate and test things or we have no chance at helping to find the truth.</p>

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a &quot;top&quot; (one considered active in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a &quot;bottom&quot; (one considered passive in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief).

That, combined with the handkerchief in Podestas emails, Seth&#39;s propensity to dress up as a panda (every chance he got, according to his mom,) and all the weird panda symbolism on JimmyComet Instagram, it makes me seriously wonder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woo wtf. I hope Seth actually just liked Pandas cause that is fucked up. Panda apparently represents kids who got beaten hard, which leads to them having black eyes like a panda.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ Seth we need to figure everything out. I wonder if someone told him what Cumpanda meant, and therefor that is why he went after the Emails.</p>

<p>Cause this doesn&#39;t mean he was gay, it would mean he was into heavily abused kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, check into Judge Jackson. Remember the pizzagate shooter? He pled not guilty. Then, a couple months later, the judge was replaced with Jackson. She happens to be the judge mentioned in the podesta emails as the dnc tap to take Judge Scalia&#39;s seat. She takes over the case, the &quot;shooter&quot; changes his plea to guilty and the case doesn&#39;t make it to trial- so we never got to see any evidence. Another interesting thing about this judge, she worked as second chair on a panel that set new guidelines for minimizing sentencing for pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>8) According to friends in the DNC, Seth was upset about a &#39;bug&#39; or &#39;feature&#39; (depending on how you viewed things) in the official DNC app where there were 2 different address lists for app users. The voters who more obviously favored Bernie Sanders were given one set of addresses, while those who obviously supported Hillary Clinton were given a different set of addresses. You can guess how the address lists were different - the Bernie locations were understaffed and had massive lines, while the Clinton locations were well-staffed and made the whole process a breeze. This apparently pissed Seth off and he was looking for answers from DNC leadership. I will admit this is mostly rumor, but we more or less know from the DNC leaks that they were conspiring against Bernie pretty openly behind closed doors. This doesn&#39;t seem completely impossible in that light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would the app know who you were voting for, and shouldn&#39;t this be easily verifiable?  Were there any reports of these Sanders only voting stations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still less mental gymnastics needed than believing &quot;the Russians literally <em>hacked</em> our election and the only reason Clinton lost is because of how bad-ass those Russian hackers hacked us and now we know that the third cousin of a guy who once stayed in a Trump hotel was literally married to a Russian spy during the cold war who once shook hands with Putin!&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>gang-downvted into the negatives</p></li>
<li><p>not gang-downvoted because gang-downvoting would prove my last sentence right and give those coordinating the constant attack on this subreddit a chance to &quot;totally prove they aren&#39;t doing it&quot;</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>conspiracy is literally t_d 2.0 now!</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I know right, the only time I ever believe circumstantial evidence that requires mental gymnastics is when the MSM presents it to me 24/7.</p>

<p>Because like, those mental gymnastics are me thinking and totally coming up with my own conclusions. Which is why so many of us are coming to the exact same conclusions about how obvious it was when the Russians totally hacked us.</p>

<p>And the reason we all repeat the same exact talking points is because we are all totally so smart. </p>

<p>Those damn Russian hackers got us good this time. But good thing we have the MSM, subs like r-politics, and reddit&#39;s popular page to keep up so well informed and updated bi-hourly on the latest opinion pieces from our favorite and most &quot;well-balanced&quot; journalist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine waking up each day to a Fox News echo chamber?  Every major newspaper is pushing a conservative or neo conservative agenda.  Everything about liberal politics is twisted into a negative with complete falsehoods.  You get online and go to few sites that are balanced.  You get called a racists for visiting the site.  You turn on TV and have no channels really that are balanced and find all but 1 that is not pushing a neo conservative agenda down your throat.  You go to YouTube and FINALLY you find some balanced news.  Then you find out YouTube is collaborating with others on a plan to censor what they call fake news (not fake but conservative).  You research and find a site called Reddit.  However before too long see massive efforts to control the narrative.  You make a comment and get downvoted.  You see 2 word responses that favor the narrative get 89 upvotes.  This activity impacts the experience.  Topics about space become political and toxic.    </p>

<p>That is what it is like for independents and conservatives.  Liberals don&#39;t notice so much and seem to enjoy the effort against those who have additional insight or different opinion from the establishment/MSM talking points.  </p>

<p>Re: point 1: That link seems to pretty much be &quot;the DNC was not hacked but was leaked&quot;. I happen to have a bit of firsthand information regarding this. They really don&#39;t know what they are talking about. The same group (FancyBear) that hacked the DNC (and the RNC as well, btw) also broke into the IAAF: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/39477302">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/39477302</a>. We know this because their fingerprints are all over it, and match those in the DNC hack. Not leak, hack. Also funny how they penetrated the network after the russian doping scandal as well...</p>

<p>I worked at the infosec company that did the IAAF investigation, during the investigation. But hey, believe breitbart all you want. I&#39;ll believe evidence, and knowing the people (and their skills) who actually discovered and investigated the compromise.</p>

<p>Talking of evidence, here is a great writeup of the said evidence from the people who investigated it: <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a></p>

<p>How does the DNC &quot;leakers&quot; having traceable Russian implants, servers and code that match those used in the IAAF hack fit into your narrative?</p>

<p>Am I part of the conspiracy? Are the people I work with? Please tell me, I need to know if my life is a lie!</p>

<p>Maybe they foresaw this exact scenario and were trying to pin it on someone local. It doesn&#39;t matter what the logic behind it could have been. What matters is that it is unreliable. It really bothers me that they exclusively looked at mtime to perform their analysis. Anybody worth their salt should have known how easy that is to manipulate.</p>

<p>To me, for the conspiracy to be true would require a huge concerted effort by a large group of people. Whereas the story as presented by the government and media would only require the action of a single hacker to verify.

<p>Except you could still alter the times after the copy. You could even write a script to alter them in a way to make it look like they were downloaded locally. It wouldn&#39;t take more than probably 10 lines of Bash code. You could even alter the times and change the time format to make it look like everything was done on Windows. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened, I&#39;m saying it could have been done and quite easily.</p>

<p>Why would changing the timestamps change the way the files are stored? All you&#39;re doing is changing metadata, which is a separate thing. Hell, even if you&#39;re right, they could have downloaded the files then done a local copy after changing their system time to fool forensic analysis. </p>

<p>Why is that implausible? They were planning to release the documents to the public. Obfuscation is hacking 101. If someone sees a file you downloaded that you didn&#39;t want them to see, they can use the timestamp to determine your general location which could compromise your security. Honestly, sanitizing the metadata is probably the first thing I would do. It&#39;s also entirely possible that they planned to pin it on someone local from the get-go.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that said hacker doesn&#39;t already have a tool written to obfuscate their files this way. If it was actually someone from a Russian intelligence agency, then why is it unlikely that they used this method? Any state-sponsored group of hackers is bound to have a wide variety of tradecraft tools at their disposal. As I demonstrated, it&#39;s trivially simple to write a script to fake timestamps in any way you want and I don&#39;t even consider myself a hacker. I&#39;m just a software developer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>however, the likelihood a hacker would choose to emulate all of that to pre-empt the chance that someone might analyze relative timestamp differences later as a means of misdirection... when they could just timestomp the lot and &#39;cover their tracks&#39; in seconds... makes the theoretical effort to deceive become highly improbable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Improbable? Maybe. The thing is that these files were released months after the hack and the murder of Seth Rich. That&#39;s plenty of time for the hackers to have come up with this strategy for covering their tracks. In order for the flip side to be true (that the files were downloaded locally), it would require the cooperation in covering the truth by sooooooo many people. Here&#39;s some sources from people that did actual forensic analysis at the DNC:</p>

<p>After reviewing that mountain of evidence and reports from people that know a whole hell of a lot more than I do, how can you possibly think it&#39;s more likely that Seth Rich was actually behind the leak and that all of these people are just making things up?</p>

While I did debunk them on an assumption they made about the VPN service... I still have respect for them and they do deserve credit on their analysis and reporting.  They are good, they present their work excellently and they at least second-guessed themselves (even if not enough, at least they tried to consider alternates). - They also discredited both of Guccifer 2.0&#39;s claims of breaching the DNC, which raises a question in itself - how did Guccifer 2.0 REALLY get the Democratic party&#39;s files? ;)</p>

<p><strong>CrowdStrike</strong> <em>(Includes Time article as it was mostly about them)</em>
They can&#39;t even answer a single question I&#39;ve asked them, they hid away from the intelligence hearings (and have already had their reputations take a beating this year) AND their &#39;report&#39; was really just some malware code and a bunch of out-of-context IOCs rather actual evidence of a hacking incident.</p>

<p>Your last line is a giveaway... you&#39;ve sunk to character attacks and red-scare rhetoric when Forensicator&#39;s analysis can be replicated and has been followed through by intelligence agency veterans. - There are no attempts to mislead and no claims that aren&#39;t supported by observations made when analyzing the data.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a fucking &quot;intelligence agency veteran&quot; to run the same analysis. It&#39;s basic arithmetic.

<p>I&#39;m unconvinced because it&#39;s not convincing. Especially when every single other person who has investigated the incident agrees that it was carried out by Russian agents and the methodology used is flawed on a very basic level.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m referring to the overall theory about a script being used to manipulate timestamps in a manner that would make it appear as though a USB transfer had occurred and that presented interleaving, etc. of files across folders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you mean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mtime differences between files is something that would be easily overlooked due to it&#39;s subtlety so the premise of the hacker putting time and effort into manipulating something most people wouldn&#39;t even think to check - seems impractical and would have been an effort very likely to yield no result, so would have likely seemed pointless to the person gathering the files.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minor logic tweaks. The whole script with full testing and robust features wouldn&#39;t take more than a day or two to write even for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, as I said, we can script it - but it would generally be a waste of time because usually files aren&#39;t analyzed to this degree so hackers generally wouldn&#39;t have an inclination to manipulate the timestamps in this manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would the indication be? If they did it the way I said was possible there would be no indication anywhere.</p>

<li><p>Seth Rich is not the source at all but Wikileaks wants people to think that he is.

<p>I should also point out that Reddit and least of all Reddit users opinions are not a source for either news nor for truth. Accredited media outlets have an enforceable professional standards they have to abide by, so whilst they may omit or only focus on a particular view/stance they can not outright lie in an article without consequences.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the brainwashing comments cuts directly to the center of your issue. You dont want to answer it because it requires you to analyze why you depend on only one source of news.</p>

<p>Its not an insult, many people get brainwashed everyday, doctor oz brainwashes all of his viewers into believing his medical diagnoses is correct. I come to this sub reddit for perspective, I can leverage the facts I have accepted against the various claims and articles available. You wont find media diversity like the one this sub has in many more places. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little brainwashed too, my liberal california town has turned me from republican to democrat. I still like shooting guns, I still dont agree with transgender pronouns and I still debate my opinions with all sides of the political spectrum. If you dont you will corner yourself into an ideology that you have to selectively feed, that is immune to influence from your surroundings, and that is impervious to logic and reason. That is not living.</p>

<p>So for your own good, subject yourself to everything, read things you dont agree with, debate people you disagree with, challenge your perception. You may change your mindset but dont let your mindset change you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very proud of you that you consume lots of sources of news and filter it to fit your opinion. That&#39;s a very grown up thing to do.

    <div class="md"><p>Your right abou the documents they are real. But being a good journalist means more than providing real documents. Thats just the ground floor. When wikileaks released the emails they timed it to be as damaging as possible for clinton. Now Im no clinton fan, and was happy to see her exposed. But it is clear that wiki leaks has a motive, and a narrative to push. The really suprising thing is why they dont release anything about russia, that has been available to everyone else?</p>

<p>Also wikileaks has changed, when assange went missing something happened.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a pretty fundamental bar. If you have one source making often debunked articles with &quot;sources say that&quot; shit, and one source that releases raw documents, why is it ridiculous to trust the latter more than the former? Sure you still can read both, sure the latter source still has biases in what they do and don&#39;t report, but they are by definition more trustworthy than the other source just by the fact that they release raw info.

<p>While I do trust WikiLeaks as an organization, it&#39;s painfully obvious that Assange is biased in his absolute contempt for <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/300890-assange-grudge-against-clinton-shapes-us-election">Hillary Clinton.</a> Watch any interview where her name comes up and you have to be autistic to not see this.

<p>lol.  A FACT, eh?   Acting like it wasn&#39;t hiding in plain sight, or maybe rather perhaps that the fact should carry some odd value or something the aligning logistics of the matter. I mean. So?  RT was one of like 12 syndicates around the world that picked up show, it wasn&#39;t produced by RT.  </p>

<p>You are absolutely right about his contempt for Hillary.  But.. &quot;bias?&quot;  That&#39;s the word you use?  As if he were supposed, or were attempting some kind of even handed notion to give equal play aside from any and all observations or pathological history of events?  It&#39;s rather amazing, and I&#39;m not criticizing you personally as your assessment is better than most, and fair given your information, but the people so willingly to make naive assessments, go on about him, parrot something they read, without ever going on Youtube or wherever and listening to him talk, as he is ALWAYS plainly open about his motives, and along with the as pers in articulating why.  Literally hours and hours worth.  It&#39;s also worth keeping in mind that while we are engaged in our own political sphere, Assange&#39;s concerns with regard same political figures overwhelmingly predominates over issues foreign military and economic stances/actions and any subsequent or supposed effects OUTSIDE the U.S. </p>

<p>Assange on Hillary? </p>

<p>Clipped specific part from youtube. <a href="https://streamable.com/sz3r9">https://streamable.com/sz3r9</a></p>

<p>Or <a href="https://youtu.be/wSqR375pip0?t=260">Youtube</a>. I have it started on his thoughts about her, but I highly recommend giving a listen all the way through, from that point on would work just as well as good for the substance of it. It&#39;s a rather fascinating listen, he talks about the high tech liberalism, silicon valley, TPP, TTIP, TISA among many other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious OP...what&#39;s your take on Sy Hersh backtracking on the things he told Butowsky (on that clearly edited call which Hersh didn&#39;t know was being recorded)? You think he&#39;s under deep state pressure to hush up now, why change his story so thoroughly? Why do you think his story involved Rich asking for payment from WL? That seemed so out of the blue. </p>

<p>Nothing had convinced me 100% that the DNC couldn&#39;t have possibly taken out one of their own. At the same time, allegations made by real people in this case that aren&#39;t backed by facts or evidence end up hurting the credibility of the scenario in my view, and really make the whole thing look like convenient propaganda and deflection from the actual source. This includes Assange&#39;s &quot;hint hints&quot; and the claims of Kimdotcom, Craig Murray. There&#39;s clearly a passion behind alot of people researching this that isn&#39;t just based in partisan vengeance and slander, and I think it makes many very susceptible to being led around by the nose, chasing after red herrings. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a broken record on this front, but trusting WL for the authentic documents they produce on their main site is one thing, but it seems dangerous to fully trust everything Assange otherwise claims based on that previous, evidence-backed trust.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The audio was released because Hersh made the claim he never said those things.  He didn&#39;t backtrack <em>after</em> the audio leaked.</p>

<p>Also, can you please explain why you feel the audio was &quot;clearly&quot; edited?  </p>

<p>If you were right, that it was edited and released bedore the backtrack, why would there be any backtracking at all, why not just say the tape was edited?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it was the way he jumped around from topic to topic, may just be the way he talks though. You are right, there&#39;s no proof it was edited, just my impression really. Still I question why/how it was recorded, who released it anonymously (alongside a recording of an unaccompanied Wheeler leaving a voicemail for a DC detective), and why no one is asking these contextual questions. And why is Hersh pushing back against what he said, casting it as a rumor he can&#39;t confirm that Butowsky ran with as fact, &quot;I live in the real world.&quot; Seems like a case of people propping up one thing someone says and ignoring their further comments on the matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll also question why my assertion that it might be edited is the one facet of my comment you&#39;ve focused on, thoughts on the rest?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lawsuit had quotes from that audio, so his response to NPR would be backtracking after the audio came out, and he also backtracked before he knew there was a recording or a lawsuit back in june. The lawsuit also says that he told butowsky that all of it could be untrue, and the DNC could have been hacked by the russians even if rich had attempted to leak. But the audio at the very least ends very abruptly and never has that part in it, so butowsky could have cut off Hersh&#39;s disclaimer at the end.</p>

It disturbs me that people are so ready to ignore this story because it&#39;s not not acknowledged by MSM. There&#39;s a lot to it. I agree with you that I can&#39;t trust people on this one.

<p>This was a comment you made from a different thread, in response to someone picking apart your argument. You refuse to concede absolutely ANYTHING.

<p>While I do trust WikiLeaks as an organization, it&#39;s painfully obvious that Assange is biased in his absolute contempt for <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/300890-assange-grudge-against-clinton-shapes-us-election">Hillary Clinton.</a> Watch any interview where her name comes up and you have to be autistic to not see this.

    <div class="md"><p>That is <strong>not</strong> evidence. It&#39;s 100% speculation. It seems like evidence to you because you desperately want it to be true. </p>

<p>And will you stop with the Wikileaks &quot;implying&quot;. Again, it&#39;s not evidence. </p>

<p>You&#39;re putting all your non evidence together with your speculation and assumptions to make them into some sort if pseudo proof in your head. </p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve probably invested a lot of your time into this and the more you do, the more difficult it becomes to be objective. Take my recommendations from the other post. It will help you grow. I promise you. But don&#39;t take my word for it. Actually do it. </p>

Now, go and pic one of the hundreds like you who keep posting about this and use an alt to try prove them wrong. Play devils advocate. Watch as they, like you, cycle through every logical fallacy one after the other. You&#39;ll be able to trace your own movements back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, MSM isnt screaming that you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s screaming that there&#39;s no evidence. There&#39;s a big difference. You&#39;re trying to blame the media for you having no evidence because that&#39;s what you want to be the cause of there being no evidence. Cam you really not see that? </p>

<p>As for meta data. I have a SMS message here with meta data showing it&#39;s from you. It says you raped a baby. </p>

<p>Is that evidence?</p>

<p>It seems you don&#39;t appreciate what I&#39;m saying. You&#39;re absolutely not willing to self reflect and see that because you desperately want something to be true, you&#39;re letting yourself down in imagining reasons for it not. And you&#39;re overdosing on every logical fallacy in the book to prove to yourself that what you imagine is real. </p>

<p>Everyone isn&#39;t against you or involved in a cover up. Everyone is pointing out that what you have isn&#39;t evidence. No matter how much you want it to be. </p>

<p>It would appear you&#39;re far too closed minded to understand this so I&#39;m bowing out. For what it&#39;s worth, I used to be like you. It takes a shut tonne of balls to admit you&#39;re wrong. I hope you find the strength some day. I know how addictive it is feeling like you&#39;re on to something everyone else isn&#39;t. I know it&#39;s comfortable in there and you don&#39;t have the strength to come out. </p>

<p>Good luck to you. </p>

<p>&quot;While we can&#39;t speak to the evidence that you now have, we are hopeful that this brings an end to what has been the most emotionally difficult time in our lives and an end to conspiracy theories surrounding our beloved Seth&quot;</p>

<p>This is really the crux of the Seth Rich saga. If this is all real then people are insinuating that Assange is willingly making the whole Rich family targets of &quot;the cabal&quot;....which would be a total piece of shit thing to do to a source and make you question the mans integrity.</p>

<p>Your first question was very sarcastic and you know it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No you sent me to a very edited post on T_D which doesn&#39;t allow dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Your <em>sources</em> show you don&#39;t care much for facts, they show you have a position and will push that position regardless of the facts which makes you very much like the flat Earthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It starts with releasing info:</p>

<ul>
<li>medical report (what hospital? what doctor? what injuries? what treatment? cause of death? infection? blood loss? did he mention anything?)</li>
<li>police body cams (there are 3, did Seth say anything? who shot him? ethnicity? height? gender? someone he knew? stranger? robbery?)</li>
<li>ballistic report (what gun was used? someone may know a person with such gun and report info)</li>
<li>CCTV cameras (there could be 3 or more CCTV with video footage, maybe capture killer on video? maybe someone recognizes item of clothing? etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>That would be round one to try to identify his killer.</p>

<p>Second round would be:
* check his communications, email interactions, any evidence he contacted Wikileaks? any mention about DNC election irregularities? did he really have a loud argument/confrontation with Donna Brazile?</p>

<p>Need to debunk and shoot down any conspiracy that is not true</p>

<ul>
<li>alleged: his brother Aaron Rich not allowing accessing to Seth&#39;s cellphones and laptop</li>
<li>deleting of Seth&#39;s computer/internet activities (twitter, instagram, reddit, emails, if so that is tampering with evidence and obstructing investigations)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, one thing I will criticize about Wikileaks is they should confirm or deny if Seth was their source. the ONLY reason not to leak a name is to protect the source&#39; life. In this case Seth is dead, it wouldn&#39;t make any difference unless it puts Seth&#39;s family&#39;s lives in danger. At the same time it makes people attack Wikileaks accusing them of being Russian tools.</p>

<p>Seth&#39;s death is frustrating because we all want to know what really happened but it seems the way things are, a status quo is being maintained NOT to investigate and to shelve the case as robbery gone wrong with nothing left to see. Is it not a slap in the face to Seth&#39;s parents that the police told him &quot;reassuring/comforting&quot; words that they&#39;d &quot;get the guy&quot; who did this to their son?</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why some people are commenting &quot;Seth Rich was a nobody&quot;. They simply don&#39;t care and have had enough about hearing his name. Can&#39;t blame them. His death is being used as a tool to try to convict Hillary et al at the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it could have been Seth Rich. But if it was, that means Julian Assange lied when he said he would never reveal a source.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bafflingly dumb argument.

<p>Alternatively, let&#39;s say for the sake of argument that Seth really was the leaker and the Russia narrative is bullshit. Should we all just be quiet about it and not reveal the truth because of some vague and assumed threat to the Rich family? I don&#39;t buy the logic here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this will be down voted, and likely by you, but at this point i am &quot;so mad&quot; about how people obsess about this and ignore what lawmakers are doing right now while you focus on one guy&#39;s death to the exclusion of the nightmarish orwellian laws passing left and right, while people spend all their time on this.</p>

<p>do i think his death was a hit, yes. do i think that in the realm of whistleblower hits he ranks up there with gary webb? fuck no. he revealed bullshit gamesmanshit in a primary. bullshit gamesmanshit is politics. and now, apparently, it looks as if his motives were less than pure, if the claims he was shopping the info around looking for the highest bidder are true.</p>

<p>at most he takes down trump since his leaks are the crux of the case. at this point, trump is acting like a crazy person and shows no intention of acting otherwise. the best way to counter this bullshit is to appear presidential and above it. trump appears like flame war between over excited 12 year olds.</p>

<p>also, rich&#39;s &quot;thing&quot; for pandas is really disturbing to me, as is the large overlap btwn pizzagaters and rich fanatics, who pretend to not see it.</p>

<p>grown men into pandas are pedophiles. suicide squad does in your face montage of the joker&#39;s pedophilia, focusing overtly on the boy lover symbol and pandas.</p>

<p>did rich deserve to die for leaking what was essentially vindicatory gossip for sanders voters? no, does the country deserve the shit show that is russiagate based on those emails? no. does trump deserve to be brought down because if them? no (though his idiocracy level behavior makes me less sympathetic by the day). is the the DNC ordering a hit a big deal? yes. should it blind the people who would be most likely to see what is currently going on? no.</p>

<p>several people here were run out of town last summer for trying to sound the alarm that this was a deliberate rabbit hole psyop. as far as i am concerned their prescience deserves gold medals upon gold medals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really wanted to vote for Clinton but I didn&#39;t because all of the news came out about the DNC. What I saw was wrong. I didn&#39;t have evidence of the RNC doing those things. I&#39;m not on the side of whoever is cheating/breaking the law. This election, I saw that from the DNC. Yes, I would want to know about the RNC leak. My belief is they would publish it. That&#39;s their reputation. I accept Wikileaks because they realize real physical documents. You know how credible US news is right now, so I don&#39;t need to defend that one. The brainwashing comment is stupid so I&#39;m not going to respond to that. Read my posts and don&#39;t just make a lazy insult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it could have been Seth Rich. But if it was, that means Julian Assange lied when he said he would never reveal a source. And that means the whole idea that Assange has a 100 percent track record and an impeachable reputation is just garbage. And if it is true, why is he putting Seth Rich&#39;s family in such danger?</p>

<p>So either Seth Rich wasnt the leaker, or Julian Assange is just a liar who breaks his word when it benefits him...and who can trust a guy like that?</p>

<p>But then your tipping the scales only in the direction you like. If wikileaks got an Rnc leak as well dont you want to know? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP literally just said they would want to know that...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you accept wikileaks as your all powerful news outlet? Is it because they mold news to fit your lifestyle or is your lifestyle to follow their news?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, OP just answered this question. It&#39;s because they release raw documents. Even if they decide which ones to reveal and not reveal, the documents are raw and real. None of the &quot;Anonymous sources familiar with the white house says,&quot; bullshit the MSM pulls on a regular basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw. This called being brainwashed, you have given up on critical thinking and chosen wikileaks because its easier to digest news your palate is accustomed to instead of seeking truth regardless if its origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is insulting and complete nonsense. You&#39;ve set up a strawman of what you think OP is doing and thinking by saying that they trust Wikileaks over other sources and knocking that strawman down thinking your some big tough paragon of logic. You didn&#39;t make one coherent point here, and I&#39;m shocked that the upvote/downvote ratio is what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but they also showed that Guccifer 2.0 (allegedly working for the Kremlin!) was operating in Eastern time zone in July and September, long after he should have been out of the DNC (and not in that timezone).</p>

<p>Of course timezones can be manipulated, &#39;timestomped&#39;, etc. however, there&#39;s no indication of timestamps being altered and if they were going to be altered... why not to Romania&#39;s time zone so it remain consistent with the 1st layer of the masquerade?</p>

<p>I agree though, it isn&#39;t proof of the files being initially gathered locally, it&#39;s just that such a premise is now a higher probability than anyone in Russia having hacked and acquired those files.</p>
