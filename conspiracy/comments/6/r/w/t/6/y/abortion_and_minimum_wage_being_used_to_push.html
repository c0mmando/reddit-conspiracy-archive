       What does abortion do? Removes ~1M citizens yearly from joining the work force

       What does MW do? Creates the BS excuse that people won't work for some jobs, and therefore we need immigrant labor to do it?

       Are you insinuating that there is a population arms race that that the United States is falling behind in or that simply put altering the amount of abortions here will have no impact on global population?

      <p>
       if Trump says he wants to limit the movement of labor its all just for show. People who oppose him and people who agree with him believe everything he says but they are being lied to on both sides.

       Yes, I think birth rates in the US are anemic and we'll have real problems in 30 years. Millennials aren't having kids, and based on the trend, my gen won't be much better
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of abortions are for economic reason. ~1.3 M abortions a year. 90% of that yearly would really boost domestic population growth

       Have you seen the birth rates of the Country you were praising somewhere else in this thread (Japan)? That's besides the point. Automation and technology is more than enough to make up for the lack of labor. If anything, it will be more of a social security issue that must be confronted sooner or later. Hopefully sooner. With our current system its going to fail. It needs to adapt to modern society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you wish the president has more power? He is an elected official who is a figurehead and top of the executive branch of Government. He isn't someone who can make changes based on a whim or wave of his hand. There are checks and balances and three branches of Government, not just one president to act as Emperor. For you to even argue in favor of a President having more power is a scary thought. Can you imagine if Clinton had more power, Bush had more power? Or Obama had more power? Unless you mean they only get more power if they are on YOUR side of the isle?

       What's wrong with free movement of labor? Also.. whats wrong with abortion? It shouldn't concern you what other people do within their own bodies, you're not them and you have no idea what kind of life they've had that leads them to having an abortion. Years ago my wife worked as a case manager for pregnant preteens who can't speak English. You wanna see some fucked up situations? Go to a pregnant 13 year old's trailer home whose broken family lives off of welfare and because she got raped and prego will have to drop out of school because she is catholic and cannot have an abortion and cannot afford child care. As for the economic impact of abortion.. we already have enough people on this planet already and for that matter I don't see how making abortion illegal would have any foreseeable impact on anything other than lower income areas. And even that impact would be extremely small by comparison to how many people are already here.

       Have you been to Europe recently? I have and can elaborate on that if you have any questions. I have been to Europe multiple times in the last 10 years. If you do have any questions the countries I visited most recently (which was less than a year ago) were Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Last year I also visited Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal. Don't be deceived by misinformation. The American people are being spoon fed propaganda for a multitude of agendas.

       <li>
        <p>
         Why do you think Europe is a good argument for how multiculturalism doesn't work? I bet your argument is based on isolated instances which get purported as day to day happenings by the US Media.

       <li>
        <p>
         How is there lack of integration and where is this happening at? How long is normal integration supposed to take?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can you point out "successful" countries other than Japan that have a lot of nationalism? Or is the Japanese nationalism enough to make you drop every other option and say that nationalism is the way to go?

       Not OP but as I am in Italy at the moment, and have been to Paris and Moscow recently, I feel I can contribute some.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In Paris especially, there are whole neighborhoods of "migrant camps" in which largely African/Middle Eastern migrants and refugees set up camps and tents and live there in the streets. These places are largely avoided by Parisians and tourists alike, you can read more about them
         <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/05/police-evict-refugees-makeshift-paris-camp-170509083947201.html">
          here
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58988296e4b040613137c640/amp">
          here
         </a>
         I would say that the very existence of these migrant camps is evidence itself that integration is not happening, and multiculturalism is not quite working at an efficient level. In Italy at the moment, there are market shops I walked through today which are only run by foreigners from Middle East and Africa. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this, but it does show a kind of "lack of integration" with Italian markets.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm not sure how long normal integration is supposed to take. What I am sure of, however, is that normal integration does not include creating a dangerous environment for women and tourists, as the migrant camps in Paris do (as you can read in the articles in this comment and research) and in Sweden especially (Cologne New Year's Eve)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Japan is a prime example of a proud nationalist successful country. I would argue that Moscow and Russia is another good example. Russia is a good example of successful integration of East Asian people with Russian language and culture. Most of Siberia speaks Russian, but is ethnically Asian.

       I guess all the homeless camps in the United States is evidence that the  American people can't integrate into western society too? Sob your only b other example of a successful nationalist country is Russia eh? What's your definition of success? If its having your economy collapse and creating hardship living environments for the people than i guess you're v right Russia is a good example.

       No, because those "homeless camps" are made up of American citizens, mostly people who were born here, while the Paris camps are made up of non-citizens and immigrants. Also, big cities like New York and L.A. and Washington D.C. dont actually have homeless camps the nearly the scale of the ones in Paris.

       Dude, Europe is completely different from the US. Over there new people can't assimilate because of the language. Not every European country speaks English. But in the US, we don't have that problem much. European countries have distinct cultures which isn't the case with the US. What we have is a mixture of many stuffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not many will dare to live in Japan because of that same language problem followed by food. But yes, they have tons of South Asians there.

       Traditionally, the people who come to US legally are educated and have lots of money. This is what makes the country different from those in Europe. American immigration is highly expensive. Not many can afford.
      </p>
      <p>
       The educated people are welcomed here because not many in the country are interested in STEM without which we won't have electricity and many other things we depend on! We won't even have stores. Majority of them come from new immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not support illegal immigrants. They are hired in low paying jobs so the businesses can get away with not paying taxes. It also gives them the freedom to violate regulations.

       I live in a county that is mostly agriculture.  The large land owners specifically import Mexicans and Jamaicans to pick the crops even though there are plenty of healthy adult Americans here that would love to do those jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unemployment rate here is high and is one of the poorest counties in the country, yet the rich here would rather import labor because they can control them out of fear of deportation.  It has absolutely nothing to do with finding Americans that are willing to do the job.

       In Australia we rely on "working holidaymakers" to pick our crops. No, despite youth unemployment above 20%, australians don't want to pick fruit.

       As for mimimum wage, plenty of countries get by fine without one- like Norway. You will get paid more flipping burgers in Oslo than you will in Chicago.

       Not OP but as I am in Italy at the moment, and have been to Paris and Moscow recently, I feel I can contribute some.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In Paris especially, there are whole neighborhoods of "migrant camps" in which largely African/Middle Eastern migrants and refugees set up camps and tents and live there in the streets. These places are largely avoided by Parisians and tourists alike, you can read more about them
         <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2017/05/police-evict-refugees-makeshift-paris-camp-170509083947201.html">
          here
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58988296e4b040613137c640/amp">
          here
         </a>
         I would say that the very existence of these migrant camps is evidence itself that integration is not happening, and multiculturalism is not quite working at an efficient level. In Italy at the moment, there are market shops I walked through today which are only run by foreigners from Middle East and Africa. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this, but it does show a kind of "lack of integration" with Italian markets.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm not sure how long normal integration is supposed to take. What I am sure of, however, is that normal integration does not include creating a dangerous environment for women and tourists, as the migrant camps in Paris do (as you can read in the articles in this comment and research) and in Sweden especially (Cologne New Year's Eve)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Japan is a prime example of a proud nationalist successful country. I would argue that Moscow and Russia is another good example. Russia is a good example of successful integration of East Asian people with Russian language and culture. Most of Siberia speaks Russian, but is ethnically Asian.
