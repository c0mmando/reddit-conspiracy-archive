<p>90% of abortions are for economic reason. ~1.3 M abortions a year. 90% of that yearly would really boost domestic population growth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the birth rates of the Country you were praising somewhere else in this thread (Japan)? That&#39;s besides the point. Automation and technology is more than enough to make up for the lack of labor. If anything, it will be more of a social security issue that must be confronted sooner or later. Hopefully sooner. With our current system its going to fail. It needs to adapt to modern society.</p>

<p>Why do you wish the president has more power? He is an elected official who is a figurehead and top of the executive branch of Government. He isn&#39;t someone who can make changes based on a whim or wave of his hand. There are checks and balances and three branches of Government, not just one president to act as Emperor. For you to even argue in favor of a President having more power is a scary thought. Can you imagine if Clinton had more power, Bush had more power? Or Obama had more power? Unless you mean they only get more power if they are on YOUR side of the isle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with free movement of labor? Also.. whats wrong with abortion? It shouldn&#39;t concern you what other people do within their own bodies, you&#39;re not them and you have no idea what kind of life they&#39;ve had that leads them to having an abortion. Years ago my wife worked as a case manager for pregnant preteens who can&#39;t speak English. You wanna see some fucked up situations? Go to a pregnant 13 year old&#39;s trailer home whose broken family lives off of welfare and because she got raped and prego will have to drop out of school because she is catholic and cannot have an abortion and cannot afford child care. As for the economic impact of abortion.. we already have enough people on this planet already and for that matter I don&#39;t see how making abortion illegal would have any foreseeable impact on anything other than lower income areas. And even that impact would be extremely small by comparison to how many people are already here.</p>

<p>No, because those &quot;homeless camps&quot; are made up of American citizens, mostly people who were born here, while the Paris camps are made up of non-citizens and immigrants. Also, big cities like New York and L.A. and Washington D.C. dont actually have homeless camps the nearly the scale of the ones in Paris.</p>
