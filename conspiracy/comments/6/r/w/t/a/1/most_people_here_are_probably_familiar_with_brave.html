        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">368</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Ninjakick666.html">Ninjakick666</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s probably safe to say that a decent number of regular users of this sub have read stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Orwell&#39;s 1984</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Brave New World</a> and enjoyed the subject matter... I&#39;ll suggest a few other similar novels that you might enjoy if you wanna expand a little bit more into those themes. </p>

<p><strong>[We -  Yevgeny Zamyatin - 1921]</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_(novel)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_(novel)</a> - I&#39;d say this should be your first one to check out, though it does cover a lot of the same ideas as both 1984 and BNW... but it did come out first by a longshot... and probably had some influence on the other two. Really good read... really surprised I don&#39;t hear more about this. Kinda like a hipster 1984, all about a totalitarian surveillance state and two &quot;naughty&quot; civilians that dare to fall in love and buck the system. If you only got time for one of these novels... this is the one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am aware of myself. And, of course, the only things that are aware of themselves and conscious of their individuality are irritated eyes, cut fingers, sore teeth. A healthy eye, finger, tooth might as well not even be there. Isn&#39;t it clear that individual consciousness is just sickness?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon">Erewhon - Samuel Butler - 1872</a> - Starts out kinda lame with a standard adventure story, but once they find the hidden civilization things get good quick... extra cool cause it was written so long ago and this society had predicted a &quot;rise of the machines&quot; kinda scenario and already banned most things mechanical, even a pocket watch was contraband. Good world building... physical sickness would get you locked away in jail... but committing crimes would land you a comfy bed and doting friends and family bringing you flowers and soup. Two separate currencies... one for trade and one for religion and some kinda hyper-veganism thats almost Jainist... Story is kinda lame, but the world and the kooky ideas are really interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;“There is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organised machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Two">Walden Two - B.F. Skinner - 1948</a> - Really awesome book... the story is almost non existent as it describes some outsiders being introduced to a small utopian community. A lot of thought provoking ideas of how to improve on society presented back to back through the whole novel pretty much. Might be a bit dry for a lot of folks cause it describe the research and design of the standard Walden Two drinking cup... how the windows are configured... but in with all that is a sort of freeform supply and demand based work credit system... and plenty of other interesting ideas of how America could be slightly different but oh so much more efficient. Again... don&#39;t read it for the story, but read it for a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1164564-walden-two">whole bunch</a> of nerdy stuff to make ya go hmmmmmmm. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Society attacks early, when the individual is helpless. It enslaves him almost before he has tasted freedom. The &#39;ologies&#39; will tell you how its done Theology calls it building a conscience or developing a spirit of selflessness. Psychology calls it the growth of the superego. Considering how long society has been at it, you&#39;d expect a better job. But the campaigns have been badly planned and the victory has never been secured.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_on_Zanzibar">Stand On Zanzibar - John Brunner - 1968</a> - Really cool book, but not an easy read... pretty large pagecount and it hops around kinda like Pulp Fiction. I enjoyed it despite how disjointed it was... plus it had a whole bunch of really cool predictions of the future that were kinda accurate... like <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2013/03/the-weird-1969-new-wave-sci-fi-novel-that-correctly-predicted-the-current-day.html">President Obomi</a> plus a good load of overpopulation and political intrigue... not a casual read. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“It&#39;s natural for a man to defend what&#39;s dear to him: his own life, his home, his family. But in order to make him fight on behalf of his rulers, the rich and powerful who are too cunning to fight their own battles-in short to defend not himself but people whom he&#39;s never met and moreover would not care to be in the same room with him-you have to condition him into loving violence not for the benefits it bestows on him but for its own sake. Result: the society has to defend itself from its defenders, because what&#39;s admirable in wartime is termed psychopathic in peace. It&#39;s easier to wreck a man than to repair him. Ask any psychotherapist. And take a look at the crime figures among veterans.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wanting_Seed">The Wanting Seed - Anthony Burgess - 1962</a> - Written by the guy that did A Clockwork Orange... not really the most badassed story, but the setting is really cool. Rampant overpopulation has pretty much turned control of the world over to homosexuals and cannibalism is on the rise due to food shortages. Not the best work of fiction but and interesting book ya don&#39;t hear much about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We&#39;re a government that believes in everybody having the illusion of free will.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll give honorable mention to The Giver and Anthem... and the short story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron">Harrison Bergeron</a> from Vonnegut. Those are the ones that jump out in my memory as solid dystopia/utopias... any other books like these that you&#39;d suggest? </p>

I am not attacking you whatsoever, but do you see yourself more as an intelligence officer? Or more of a leader?  This matters very much very soon. Either way I do appreciate your posts. </p>

<p>Limbo by Bernard Wolfe from the early 50&#39;s should be cult classic. A situation in which society has decided to disarm men literally, lopping off limbs, women pushing them around in carriages, though the well-off eventually get cybernetic enhancements and things get real interesting. Fucking strange.</p>

<p>Almost anything by Phillip K. Dick. Vonnegut&#39;s Player Piano. The aforementioned We is great. There&#39;s many more I&#39;m forgetting but these are good picks after hitting the classics. </p>

Philip K Dick readers should also read William S. Burroughs.<br/>
&#39;&#39; &quot;I cannot accept Burroughs&#39; view that we have been invaded by an alien virus, an information virus, yet on the other hand I cannot readily dismiss this bizarre theory as mere paranoia on his part. I think he is onto something real and important, and that his statements do more good--far more good--than harm (that is, he states the problem correctly, although perhaps his analysis of the cause is faulty; still, merely to be aware of the problem is to achieve a great deal). Now, I have been able to find accounts in ancient times of what seems to be a thinking or perceptual dysfunction or perhaps the thinking or perceptual dysfunction.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>HI fellow ninja, great list! I&#39;d also like to throw in The Road by Cormac McCarthy and the book Feed by Mathew Tobin anderson. The Road I liked for its bleakness. It&#39;s more of a psychological journey than anything. </p>

<p>As for Feed, although it&#39;s a YA novel, it&#39;s presents a future reality that is based on consumerism and instant comunication. Not a great work of literary majesty, but the premise (the book was written in early 2000s) is scarily accurate. </p>

<p>For the young uns, I think Wall-e is a great place to start!</p>

<p>Yet it&#39;s his least-known novel. Maybe because--unlike &quot;Rosemary&#39;s Baby,&quot; &quot;Boys from Brazil,&quot; &quot;Stepford Wives&quot; and &quot;Sliver&quot;--it&#39;s not been made into a movie. Hmmmmmm...... </p>

Solid post-apocalyptic dystopian fiction with brilliant world-building revolving a concept called &#39;Municipal Darwinism&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>One book I really like is <strong>A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder</strong>, really easy read, about an explorer who finds a society that is backwards in many ways, notably economically.  Janitors are the most highly regarded and CEOs are seen as the lowest of the low.  It&#39;s a funny dynamic that exposes flaws in our own system.</p>

<p>Then there is [Creation Myth](<a href="http://www.creationmyth.net">www.creationmyth.net</a>) a psychedelic-fiction trilogy which has a striking take on modern conspiracies... the best IMO, although I&#39;ve only finished two books, the second is particularly on-the-mark with it&#39;s financial and extreme drug-war conspiracies.  If you are a proponent of psychedelics at all I would make reading this series a priority.  Only found it at a book fair so not sure if its in stores or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry was in a rush so I generalized. I would say it is positive realism compared to a Brave New World and is a great commentary on the impact of imperalism and consumerism in shaping peoples&#39; decisions. Island was most likely a clash between Aldous seeing the British occupation of India from the 1 mile high view being, like you said, derived from a wealthy family, and also being a student of Hinduism and researching the destruction of tribes like those modeled by Pala. </p>
