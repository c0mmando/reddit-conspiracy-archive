       I'm interested in it but don't want to spend a few months on it if it has big problems.  But it's so weird the black cubes around the world and how they worship Saturn.

       It goes so much deeper than that, trust me. IT'S ALL AROUND YOU. Look deeper into it. It will blow your mind. You will begin to see Saturn symbolism everywhere you look. I recommend starting with the numerous logos with Saturn symbolism. Trust me man, it all leads back to Saturn. Your head will spin.

       Ok thanks.  If Saturn is the place to focus on I'll spend a good month or two on that.  It's the one that is bothering me the most.  I mean those big black squares around the World, and the muslims marching around the black box....got to be something to that.
       <br/>
       But how can we ever escape the Saturn matrix, or will we ever?  It seems far powerful than us.

       I think Saturn is a giant super computer that is projecting this reality. Our body is like a computer, and I think Saturn is sending the equivalent of wifi signals to our brains. How do we stop it? Idk but I have a feeling love is the only thing that can, and will, win in the end

       Ok, I need to research more if you guys really are confident on this one.  I'm guessing that would mean Saturn was made to control us by either aliens or fallen angels/demons.

       Lots of conspiracies are fun. But even conspiracy fans will think you're an idiot if you believe the flat earth one. Definitely research it though. It's fun seeing the lengths people stretch their reason to.

       I'm with you on 9/11.  I don't know if it was planned, or if they just allowed them to crash and didn't stop them since they knew that would get us into the middle east in war.

       Thank you.  That's really what I was hoping to hear.  That gives me more confidence since I'm also not a Flat Earther.  I'm glad people are questioning everything but there's a point to where the evidence just isn't there.

       yea, and sometimes I don't understand if someone is being mean or if they think I have wrong intentions.  People seem to understand when I talk about things more.  It's very hard to understand how my mind works even to me with functioning autism (still mute though).  And my nerve disorder makes it where I can't walk up and down steps well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I made a few posts asking if we could have a poll on how many people on /conspiracy believed in each conspiracy and what they thought about it so I could see statistics on how likely each one was to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then 5-6 people got mad at me and thought I was doing something wrong (still don't know what, someone mentioned "stats" and another said I would probably put the results in a blog.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I do is study all day on different topics.  I think I went about it the wrong way by making multiple posts with questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for being nice, I think it was my fault for not being clear in communication though.

       My son is 18 and has autism. You sound very high functioning! You sound more like maybe Aspergers. Although, you mentioned that you don't talk/speak, and that goes more with autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       My son didn't speak until he was almost 4 years old. He talks, but has trouble communicating. But he is like you, meaning he can type/write out his thoughts perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, my son doesn't have any physical conditions limiting, like you do. I'm sorry you have a nerve disorder on top of autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever need anyone to chat with, you can always PM me. I understand most of what you are going through. I'm a kind person and a good listener too.  :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you are much more advance/high functioning than my son.  Even though my son is 18, he would never be interested or be able to comprehend anything we discuss on here.

       Thanks!  Yea, I think I'm mostly Asperger's on the scale but a few things get a bit worse, like speaking; I'm 99% mute and I can't go in public without my mom (and I'm 35).  I'm in an autism group so I've seen the effects of classical autism and I try and say Aspergers or mild autism to make the distinction.  Everything goes on in my mind though it seems and I don't pay much attention to the outside world.  As a baby I couldn't handle clothing or baths (still a shower today is HORRIBLE because of the over-stimulation).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad I understand enough to hopefully help or counsel others with Aspergers and Autism.  I for sure have a heart for it now.
      </p>

       Thank you for being so nice, I needed that :)  Have a great day!

       My son used to have sensory issues with sounds. He has gotten a lot better. Still, there are some sounds that bother him, and he will put his hands over his ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also is very particular about his clothes, meaning they have to be very comfortable and soft. But he has made lots of improvements in this area. He will wear an uncomfortable suit if we have to attend a wedding. Of course, I always give him the option of not going to the wedding. But he wants to try and do normal things.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you with food? My son is extremely picky with food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you take any vitamins or supplements? My son takes Omega 3 Fish Oils. I noticed that they really help him in the "social" area. He is more aware socially and of his surroundings due to taking this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My son is very introverted, like you seem to be. He likes to be alone and on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, he does love amusement parks (he loves roller coasters). We live near a large amusement park and get a season pass every year. So we try and go once a week and take him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he loves water parks (with the water tube slides).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would describe my son as mild autism.

       I used to put my hands over my ears in public places and my mom never understood back then.  It's mostly lights for me now, and being too hot or cold drives me crazy.  I don't like wearing clothing, none of it is comforttaeble on me.  As a baby I screamed whenever people picked me up or put clothes on me.  Same with a shower with 1000's of beads of watter hitting me and my brain trying to comute it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       With food I get obsessions and I'll only eat those things and nothing else for a few months; then get tired of that and switch to another kind.  The doctor put me on protein shakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently got Omega 3 fish oil so hopefully that will help!  I can't look at people in the eye at all, even my parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's great he enjoys the park and you do your best to make him happy :)  I'm trying to find hobbies myself to have something to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I do crave social interaction but I freeze up and become awkward in public then want to escape the situation and a "wall" is built up never to go into that situation again to protect myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably do need counseling.

       How are you one-on-one with people? Since you don't talk, do you just want someone around you? My son is this way sometimes. Sometimes he will want someone in the room with him. But he doesn't want to talk. So I guess it makes him feel safe. But most of the time, he likes to be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I do everything I can to make his life easier and to help him. Since he enjoys roller coasters and water slides, I take him as much as I can. Luckily, we live near a big water park and amusement park. But they are only open from May until September.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you taking a bath? Does that bother you? My son actually prefers baths over showers.

       I'm actually very good with people one on one, but that's only after a trust barrier is gone over.  I would be paralyzed to be one on one with a stranger.  But some people say I seem to act normal when I'm around people I trust.  But even then after an hour I need to be alone for a good hour to decompress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I get separation anxiety when people I trust leave me completely alone.  I like to know my parents are in the house in another room, just often not in the same room.  And it's frustrating because I don't want them to think I don't want to be around them, it's just the anxiety that overwhelms me and I get panic attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have to force taking a bath or a quick shower.  A lot of anxiety builds up before but once I'm in there a bit it's not so bad.  I'm not sure I fully understand why water bothers me like it does.  Maybe we have hard water?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like baths though, you don't have all the droplets hitting your body and it's not so loud and hitting water in my face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am bad on food though with only eating 1 item a few times a day for months!  I'm trying to take supplements to help with what I'm not eating.  I'm blending some vegetables sometimes and chugging that down since I can't stand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, if something causes a panic attack I build up an "ice wall" around that person/s and situation to protect myself (when it's only hurting myself.  weird I know it's hurting me but I still do it).

       My son has separation anxiety too. He gets nervous if I leave the house. Even though his Dad is at home with him, he still doesn't like for me to leave. I think it is because he knows I am his biggest advocate.

       2 sisters.  I never see or talk to them anymore.  Around age 14-15 things got worse and I won't talk to anyone but my mom at all now and even that's rare.  We email back and forth many times during the day though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why I can't look my sisters in the eyes and talk to them.  I feel like I'm a failure (family had high expectations and they just all seem depressed and sad that I'm a "dud).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, my dad doesn't understand 95% of my issues but my mom does understand about that much.  And she helps with a lot of things so there is a lot of fear of her dying.  I would be on my own completely.

       I have a strong fear of my sisters and dad where I can't even email.  It's this very thick ice wall my brain does.  My mom understands 95% but my dad and other people understand maybe 5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to walk around the neighborhood just to get outside and moving.  My diet isn't that bad since I've been making shakes with protein, coconut oil, raw fruits/vegetables, nuts, so I get at least all the nutrients I need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people on the spectrum do well in life and have strong interests, it's just I'm 35 now and I don't have any interests that give me motivation really.  I need something to do.  Maybe there's some way to learn how to do something online if that's the only way I communicate.  I really would love a counselor who understood the spectrum but all the ones near me only work with kids.

       I get confused on Zionist.  It sounds like there are Zionist Jews in Hollywood that are bad and heavily liberal/socialist.

       Don't they want to get the 1 World currency and basically make us all equal but poor.  I think the Internet is going to save us though.  Conservatism is what's cool now.  Very limited government, I can't stand the DEA cannabis is the only thing that helps me but I have to keep suffering most of the time.

       I don't see the need for conflict.  Why bother putting that energy out there.  It's not very efficient.  If the Saturnian lizardtrannies wanna hump our women, breeding half-lizardtrannyhalf-women hybrids, have at 'er!  This is more slack, more energy-efficient, more respectful of free will of all parties, and possibly more entertaining if mainstream sitcom are representative of the truth.

       The chance of alien life form existing outweights the chance that it doesn't by an incredibly large amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who believe aliens are outside the "realm of reality" may be subconsciously self centered. To think that humans are the center of the universe and there is no chance of other life out there.....only humans wete special enough I guess?

       Thinking that your planet has the only acting living inhabitants in an unlimited space is illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh you want me to prove it? How about statistics. If you deny the probability of there not being alien life form then you are simply being impractical.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The probability of a civilization developing on a potentially habitable alien planet would have to be less than one in 10 billion trillion — or one part in 10 to the 22nd power — for humanity to be the first technologically advanced species the cosmos has ever known, according to the study.

       There's no argument. Just you ignoring a probability of greater than 99.99999999% that life exists on other planets.

       Just out of curiousity; Are you religious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people I know that are like, "Aliens? You're kidding me right?" are people that believe a divine entity created
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       us, because we are special.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know religious people that believe that there is no way "god" would only create life on a single planet in an indefinite universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone else I ask usually say, "why not?".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a main discerning factor that some people don't realize when someone says they don't believe in aliens is the fact that some people, like myself,
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to believe aliens come to earth and fuck with shit,
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       I seriously doubt that if an extremely intelligent life form had the capabilites to come here, they would. Humans are an extremely destructive force and we attack anything we don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the fact that aliens can also be non-intelligent. There could be populations of aquatic fish-like aliens on another planet that has livable conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you believe in evolution, there have been many planets that have been discovered that have livable earth-like conditions and atmospheres. If we evolved on this planet, why can't something evolve on another?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wondering. It actually blows my mind when people think that humans are the only living beings in the universe, so if you feel strongly about it, I'd like to know your opinion on why we're the only ones.

       That one is one of my favorites and I'm often 50/50 but lookiong in history of secret society and the symbol they use and spew it all over the media.. (I don't knkow who to trust in even alternative news).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just I think David Icke was the main proponent of Reptilians and without him we might not even be talking about it.  There were other god's people would worship instead of Christ and they are referred to as "demons' or fallen angels, or aliens to others.
      </p>

       I don't see what we can do to unite and fight this.

       I, personally, find the space and moon conspiracies extremely fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was unaware of "holograms disguising the true moon", strange formations on the surface of the moon, strange occurances in space from astronauts, and the
       <strong>
        BIG
       </strong>
       aliens in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in extraterrestrial life; I'm not sure if it's been here before- but when you look into Air Force testimonies and events like Stephenville, TX and Phonenix; it becomes harder to not think that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       is going on.

       That's like me.  I find space things one of the most interesting to me.  I have a few telescopes I need to put a USB camera on to connect and record to my laptop.  I used to watch the moon more than anything else in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those testimonies from people in the airforce and other weird stuff makes me believe something is happening that's serious that we don't have full proof of yet.

       I'm actually very good with people one on one, but that's only after a trust barrier is gone over.  I would be paralyzed to be one on one with a stranger.  But some people say I seem to act normal when I'm around people I trust.  But even then after an hour I need to be alone for a good hour to decompress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I get separation anxiety when people I trust leave me completely alone.  I like to know my parents are in the house in another room, just often not in the same room.  And it's frustrating because I don't want them to think I don't want to be around them, it's just the anxiety that overwhelms me and I get panic attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have to force taking a bath or a quick shower.  A lot of anxiety builds up before but once I'm in there a bit it's not so bad.  I'm not sure I fully understand why water bothers me like it does.  Maybe we have hard water?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like baths though, you don't have all the droplets hitting your body and it's not so loud and hitting water in my face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am bad on food though with only eating 1 item a few times a day for months!  I'm trying to take supplements to help with what I'm not eating.  I'm blending some vegetables sometimes and chugging that down since I can't stand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, if something causes a panic attack I build up an "ice wall" around that person/s and situation to protect myself (when it's only hurting myself.  weird I know it's hurting me but I still do it).
