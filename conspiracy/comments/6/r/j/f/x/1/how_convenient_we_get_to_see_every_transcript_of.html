    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t you parroting &quot;who cares who leaked the emails, it&#39;s the content that matters!&quot; only months ago? </p>

<p>Mexico AND Australia have transcripts. Maybe Obama didn&#39;t have his leaked because of mutual respect? Maybe pissing off the people on the other end of the line and acting like a dick to them <strong>isn&#39;t</strong> a sure fire way for them to respect social norms? </p>

<p>So no, the real question isn&#39;t where those previous presidents transcripts are. The real question is why are Cult45 still obsessed with defending someone who clearly doesn&#39;t give a fuck about them and who clearly tried to pull the wool over their eyes? </p>

<p>The Stockholm Syndrome is absolutely astonishing. </p>

<p>If Australia or anywhere else has folks leaking they could potentially harm relations with the U.S. At any point over Trump&#39;s 2 terms, if the land of Oz comes calling, they&#39;ll be relegated to diplomatic channels and limited communication. This stuff is an own goal. It pushes Trump away from the wider world - making him an even greater nationalist that he was before.</p>

<p>Calling the President of Mexico &quot;Enrique&quot; like they are friends or on familiar terms, rather than &quot;Mr. President&quot; for example?

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that Obama, Bush, and other presidents demanded respect from their staff and earned it from their counterparts in other word leaders? </p>

<p>Were they given loyalty by the people around them, almost as though they were respected?</p>

<p>Funny how Trump doesn&#39;t get that same treatment.... must be the liberal media working against him... couldn&#39;t be that shit leaders attract shit subordinates, right?</p>

<p>Yes it is. That&#39;s the whole point of OP&#39;s post, and my response. No, other president&#39;s didn&#39;t have these kinds of massive leaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by your measure Obama was particularly bad.</p>

<p>He was, but I never said that, so I don&#39;t know where that came from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people in his admin took the 5th again?</p>

<p>OP said that Trump has a lot of leaks, as in, he is being treated unfairly compared to previous presidents. I said that the leaks are due to his poor leadership. What does someone pleading the 5th have to do with this conversation?</p>

<p>I will.</p>

<p>Nevermind whether or not the media is full of shit or actually cares about the truth. No matter what their position, when you throw shit in someone&#39;s face they tend not to like that.</p>

<p>You can run around screaming &quot;fake news&quot; and dismiss everything that you don&#39;t <em>like</em>, but it certainly won&#39;t make journalists ignore you. If anything, publicly rebuking a news organization is probably the quickest way to have some journalists start sniffing around your private life and past activities.</p>

<p>Dont mistake political connections for intellect. She did tons of stupid stuff that would destroy a normal persons career. She just has money and influence to make sure her stupid mistakes dont turn into anything with legal consequences. </p>

<p>As for Trump. He is not levelheaded, and that is by design.

Thats an accomplishment worthy of respect and certainly a testament to the cunning you denounced as unreal. </p>

<p>What should worry most people is that Trump seems to adhere very closely to the 36 stratagems in his actions. I have been watching closely, and events like his tweets before Comeys testimony which turned out to reveal nothing are right in line with them.</p>

<p>What should worry people is what a leader like this is really planning. I think you hit on it when you said he obviously lies (Which all politicians lie, he just makes a very obvious effort to do so). Nobody, can tell what Trumps long term game plan is. And that alone is worth being concerned about. </p>

<p>I think their connections forged over the years (with the Soros and Kissingers of the world, the Saudi monarchs, the bankers, etc.) is part of their cunning. Hillary can be all poised and measured in public, while you know that she is vicious and calculating in private. I do think she IS Kissinger&#39;s protege, so she operates at the top levels of the global power game. Unfortunately, Trump is still just a petty developer from Queens who DOES seem to have impeccable timing for taking advantage of stuff. </p>

<p>Trump is a demagogue opportunist who saw an opening in 2016 because Americans are fed up with the &quot;establishment&quot;. He is a con man salesman (meaning he gives three fucks about lying as long as he books a sale/win), so he knew exactly what sales pitches worked with conservatives by 2016. Add the fact that he co-opted Bernie&#39;s popular populist message AND that his run was made much much easier by going up against Hillary... the stage was set for him to eek out a victory via numbers that were not much better than what Romney/McCain did prior. It&#39;s not that Trump WON, in as much as he didn&#39;t fuck up bad enough to lose to Hillary.  </p>

And that alone is worth being concerned about. Pair that with the aforementioned cunning and I think that is a reason why his presence worries so many at an emotional level. He is no longer playing by the rules, and nobody on either side of the aisle knows what it means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Trump&#39;s plan was to end up being considered &quot;THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER&quot; (aside from enriching himself further) because he can&#39;t go a second without yearning self-adulation. With that said, because his actual policies are SHIT (unpopular with the public) and because he has run his business mostly by bullying/intimidating others... he is turning out to be a shitty &quot;leader&quot; who is constantly REACTING to things (instead of advancing his agenda). He has shot himself in the foot at every step of the Russian investigation, and he can&#39;t contain himself at tweeting whatever reactionary bullshit tickles his fancy. </p>

<p>I think in the end, someone like Steve Bannon DID have a grand master vision and plan for the Trump White House, but Trump was the wrong horse to carry out the plan. He was a BAD bet, because in the end he is incompetent once you strip away the power he inherited from his daddy. </p>

<p>Americans are worried emotionally because not only are his policies so far are regressive corporate power grabs that would actively fuck over millions of Americans, but because we have an erratic con man demagogue wishing he was Putin in America, who is a depraved sexual assaulter of women, and someone who is extremely prone to be bullied around by world leaders who are much smarter than him (Trump is easy to fall for a Honey Trap, for example).</p>

<p>The old corrupt order of the past needs to be purged going forward, but Trump is part of the crooked mess that needs to be fixed still.   </p>

<p>Especially when she destroyed her email server.

    <div class="md"><p>You know honestly, I don&#39;t like trump.  And yes he was rude to foreign leaders on those calls as well as other people in his campaign.  He&#39;s just a shitty person.  But if the content of those calls are, as shitty as he is, it at least seemed like he had American interests in mind.  I&#39;m glad for that.   But to be effective he needs a softer approach because what he is doing now is just counter productive.</p>
