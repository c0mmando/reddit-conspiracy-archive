        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night a friend of mine was telling me about how/when the first dinosaurs were discovered and told me that before the mid 1800&#39;s there was no evidence that dinosaurs ever existed. 
He also mentioned that their existence was hypothesized before any fossil evidence was found, and that coincidentally the first evidence that was found was found by someone looking specifically for it (rather than by chance). 
I&#39;m open minded, but this just seemed a bit too far fetched to me considering people are finding fossils all over the world still to this day. It got me to wondering though. 
Is there any evidence of Dinosaurs anywhere in the world before the 19th century? You&#39;d think that fossils would have been found by native peoples/ancient civilizations many times in Earth&#39;s history before the 1800&#39;s, yet I cannot recall a single incidence of a dinosaur fossil being found in a temple or other ancient archeological site. This seems very strange to me and is something I hadn&#39;t really thought about before..
I imagine that any native peoples who came across a giant tooth, skull, egg bone etc would appreciate the unusual nature of the find and preserve it in some sense (if not physically then via art etc). 
Despite this, I cannot think of a single example of anything related to a dinosaur being found in any human historical/prehistorical sites. Can anyone shed some more light on this idea and perhaps provide some examples of dinosaur evidence in ancient cultures?</p>

Just to be clear, I didn&#39;t say that I don&#39;t believe in Dinosaurs. I just came to the realization that I haven&#39;t ever heard of any dinosaur fossils being discovered within any ancient archeological sites or settlements and thought that was strange. </p>

<p>I thought the discussion was about fossilized evidence of dinosaurs and people not knowing about fossils since before 1800. 
Which was bull shit because I provided the link explaining Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to find a mammoth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought OP didn&#39;t believe in dinosaurs. 
He cleared that up and said he did. </p>

<p>I used that as an example that in 1774 Thomas Jefferson had been fascinated by the fossils of mammoths, and sent Lewis and Clark on an expedition to find some live ones.</p>

<p>OP said he hadn&#39;t seen evidence before 1800&#39;s of people finding dinosaur bones. You say mammoths aren&#39;t dinosaurs which you are right. But fossilized remains are harder to find which is why mammoths are easier to find then say a Jurassic era fossil.  They are typically only found in arctic preserves  or sink holes and mud pits where they are buried fast enough to preserve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what robalole meant was that some of first people to discover a mammoth skull were so confused by the bizarre shape that they created a mythical creature (cyclops) to explain it&#39;s existence. 
If you look at a photo of a mammoth skull (or any modern elephant for that matter) there is a single large hole in the center of the skull which looks like a massive eye socket if you don&#39;t already know what it is (In reality it is actually where the trunk is attached to the skull).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t vouch for the validity of this claim, but the normal answer is that dinosaurs are hard to find. They are found in sedimentary rock, not in dirt. You have to actually go digging through specific kinds of rock to find them.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t normally just stumble upon dinosaurs, although no doubt some people did find some. </p>

<p>I grew up near a streambed that had tiny fossils in it. I used to collect them. Someone of them probably were from dinosaurs, but no one would have thought that since they were tiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Dragon myths likewise are from them occasionally finding the more shallow, intact dinosaur fossils.</p>

<p>I think no dinosaur fossil record existing is simply a consequence of ancient worldviews. There was no formalized intellectual endeavor regarding pre-history aside from mysticism and legend until very recently. To put it simply, it&#39;s kind of a luxury for a civilization to spend time and money looking at this stuff. Most people were (and still are) probably satisfied with an entertaining story like dragons or a flood and didn&#39;t care enough to really question it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it does seem quite plausible that the dragon myths from multiple different cultures around the world could have been inspired by fossil dinos...much in the same way the cyclops myth could have originated from a misidentification of an elephant or mammoth skull. 
I don&#39;t think we really give ancient cultures enough credit when it comes to intellectual endeavors however. It seems like many ancient achievements (i.e. pyramids, other megalithic structures) could not have been realized without substantial intellectual investment in science and mathematics. Many of these structures we still can&#39;t replicate today with modern science and tech. I also believe from my own experience that it&#39;s deeply ingrained in human nature to be drawn to/collect rare or unique objects (regardless of an intellectual understanding of said object) and it&#39;s for this reason alone that I find the lack of these unusual objects in our history surprising. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you. I really do think its hubris to think we&#39;re the pinnacle of humanity here in the modern age. In other words, I dont think that our intellectual pursuits are somehow more vigorous, though they may be fruitful recently. Back then, however, objectivism and the scientific method didn&#39;t exist. Math was the language of the platonic/pythagorean world of ideal forms, not the language of understanding the empirical, material universe. While they may have had the same intellectual hardware and equal vigor, their ends and conclusions were very different. I mean, even Aristotle, one of the first empiricists, thought that mice spontaneously generated in bails of hay. Just imagine living in a world where that seems possible. Or, before him, the Monists, one of whom thought everything in the world was different forms of water.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a major factor too. They probably didn&#39;t notice the gradual rise in sea level but there were probably lots of cases where a single habitat was flooded suddenly as a side effect. When your world is as small as a hunter gatherer tribe, that kind of thing becomes cataclysmic in your culture&#39;s collective memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YW.  There&#39;s this one too:  <a href="http://s8int.com/">http://s8int.com/</a>   </p>

<p>The earth IS billions of years old.  There were animals and plant life that were prehistoric (such as dinosaurs, but like the websites show, there were some human - dinosaur interaction. Some dinosaurs &quot;survived&quot; until fairly recently?  I&#39;m not 100% sure on all that.  BUT Biblically speaking, before humans were created some 6 thousand or so years ago, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A4&amp;amp;version=NKJV">angels inhabited this planet, at least one third of them did live and &quot;work&quot; or do whatever it was on this earth.</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s all a bit of a mystery to most people; the whole &quot;spritual realm&quot; and &quot;Lucifers fall&quot; which obviously didn&#39;t happen &quot;over night&quot; but could have taken millions or billions of years, before Adam and Eve.  In fact, the creation of man and our potential is tied to the rebellion of that one third of sinning angels. </p>

<p>Of course, then the earth was RENEWED in 7 days, after Satan and his angels had destroyed earth. </p>

<p>Genesis 1:1-2 (NKJV)</p>

<p>The History of Creation</p>

<p>1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth <em>&quot;was&quot;</em> (That word is found in italics in most Bibles.  The correct word there should be &quot;BECAME&quot;) without form, and void; and darkness was[a] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</p>

<p>Between verse 1 and 2 of that passage is something billions of years. As God would not have created the earth &quot;without form and void&quot; or &quot;chaotic, waste and empty&quot;. </p>

<p>Psalm 104:30 (NKJV)</p>

<p>30 You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;
And You RENEW the <strong>face of the earth.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, interesting. Thanks for running the search and sharing the archive location! Got some digging to do :)
It makes sense that there are no mentions of the word dinosaria before the term was coined, but the talk of large bones from earlier papers are closer to what I&#39;m looking for. 
I still find the general lack of fossil artifacts in ancient human archeological sites surprising (which is why I asked for any evidence I don&#39;t know about). I would expect that we would find at least some unusual fossils, particularly in burial sites and religious structures, as unique and unusual natural objects seemed to be highly prized by the majority of our ancestors. 
Maybe the fossils were just too difficult to liberate from their rock resting places? 
I&#39;ve read multiple times about fossils being discovered by accident by children who just happen to see or trip over a massive skull etc. Given that fact along with our understanding about how advanced many ancient cultures apparently were in regards to architecture and stone working, I find that explanation a bit weak. 
Just wondering why we don&#39;t seem to find anything like that in these ancient sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pleasure,seemed like an interesting question. </p>

<p>I think back then we slaves had a harder time doing things other than what was aloud by the royal families,so digging for bones would have been a waste of time in the powers eyes when we could be growing food,tending animals &amp; killing each other ;)</p>

<p>I personally believe few of them may have survived the extinction and humans saw/interacted with them - giving birth to dragon stories.</p>
