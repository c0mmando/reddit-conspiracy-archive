       <strong>
        How could both the Egyptians and the Israelites (and almost the entire ancient world) think that the Earth was flat?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       How could they ignore the OBVIOUS clues that we live on a giant spinning
       <del>
        testicle
       </del>
       <em>
        achem
       </em>
       ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       With their ADVANCED knowledge of geometry, language, and overall outlook on science, (some civilizations even created batteries!) how could they overlook the oh so pronounced alleged curvature of the Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this even possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would they not have seen they're ships sailing down the Nile and said to themselves...
      </p>
      <p>
       "wait they disappeared, EARTH MUST BE A BALL!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps they KNEW there was another explanation for such a phenomena.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In early Egyptian and Mesopotamian
        <strong>
         thought, the world was portrayed as a disk
        </strong>
        floating in the ocean. A similar model is found in the Homeric account from the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The Israelites imagined the Earth as a flat disc
        </strong>
        that floated on water; an arched firmament separated the Earth from the heavens. Like most ancient peoples, the Hebrews believed the sky was a solid dome with the Sun, Moon, planets and stars embedded in it. According to The Jewish Encyclopedia:
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Homer and Hesiod described a flat disc cosmography on the Shield of Achilles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several pre-Socratic philosophers believed that the world was flat:
       </p>
       <p>
        The ancient Norse and Germanic peoples believed in a flat Earth cosmography with the Earth surrounded by an ocean.
       </p>
       <p>
        In ancient China, the prevailing belief was that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round.

       I also found this letter on the Chabads website that I found very interesting, about the head Rebbe Schneerson and his outlook on modern science and the Torah.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is in reply to your inquiry on the question of the rotation of the sun and the earth in relation to each other,
        <strong>
         namely, whether the sun revolves around the earth, or the earth around the sun, and which view is to be accepted, etc.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I presume you have in mind the scientific view, i.e., what science has to say on this question, and I will address myself to this aspect.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well known that this was a controversial issue in ancient and medieval science. However, since about half a century ago, with the introduction of the theory of relativity, the latter has been universally accepted as the basis of modern science...
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the conclusions of the theory of relativity is that when there are two systems, or planets, in motion relative to each other-such as the sun and the earth in our case-either view, namely the sun rotating around the earth, or the earth rotating around the sun, has equal validity. Thus, if there are phenomena that cannot be adequately explained on the basis of one of these views, such difficulties have their counterpart also if the opposite view is accepted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the scientific conclusion that both views have equal validity is the result not of any inadequacy of available scientific data, or of technological development (measuring instruments, etc.), in which case it could be expected that further scientific or technological advancement might clear up the matter eventually and decide in favor of one or the other view. On the contrary, the conclusion of contemporary science is that regardless of any future scientific advancement, the question as to which is our planetary center, the sun or the earth, must forever remain unresolved, since both view[s] will always have the same scientific validity, as stated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly,
        <strong>
         it follows that anyone declaring that a person who chooses to accept one of these systems in preference to the other is a fool, while one who accepts the other is a wise man-such a judgment shows that the person making it is ignorant of the conclusions of modern science,
        </strong>
        or that he has not advanced beyond the science of Ptolemy and Copernicus.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Rebbe Schneerson

       <strong>
        Food for thought you foul-mouthed, flat Earth nay-sayers.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sun revolving around the Earth has equal validity as the Earth revolving around the Sun according the the Rebbe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much more of the direct teachings of the Torah he thinks may have equal validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps that...

       Earth is flat?

      <p>
       I know it is.

       In order for the earth to be flat there would need to be a global conspiracy of scientists from a vast majority of the fields of study all propping it up. Not only would this have to occur but it would have to occur generation after generation for centuries with no one involved in the global conspiracy revealing the truth.

       Well the Torah also says sacrificing animals can be a good thing... We arent advocating that also are we?

       There is also zero in the bible about virology, but we still believe that viruses and bacteria cause illness.

       Its also worth noting that people knew the Earth was in motion and  most likely a globe since a few hundred BC, the Greeks didnt believe in a flat Earth,

       It's a complex question. I think simply there is more to reality. And the sphere model limits us. Or the scientific dogma around that model limits us. And i think in limitation there is more ability to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the standpoint of social engineering I think they chose to spread the round earth because it has the least to offer. It's a slow drip of an illusion of progress, and they control the valve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the energy to explain why they hate us and use deception on us ,other than to keep us isolated in our ball here on earth. while beyond that there is a reality more expansive and free and interconnected in ways we aren't being shown. And this belief in the sphere currently is preventing the experience of that reality.

       No need to explain why they hate us. My question already assumes that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I dont understand about flat earth theories is why they would waste their on it. Obviously there is the claim that it is just to help aid in there ability to brain wash, but wouldn't there be just as easy to convince but also more beneficial ideas to spread. For example, they could spread the idea that having more (or less depending on whatever 'their' goals may be) kids would make you happier. Or perhaps they could spread more consumerist propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let my examples distract from my main point, that there could be more effective things to lie about. My examples are being done on some scale; I just not creative enough to think of better ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you seem to support a theory much more complex than a flat earth, which would give motive. Could you explain how a sphere model limits us?

       Because the exploration of space is limiting in how we do it. They want to control it.  But the larger limitation is on human consciousness. There is an underlying knowledge of this world they keep secret. That's why none of remember. It has to do with many things but mainly our origins and what the world really is, has been kept from us, that's the biggest secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, nobody like us knows for certain, in this day and age what is at the north and south poles. Don't you think that knowledge would expand our consciousness of the reality we are in? It could alter everything depending on what's there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another, the idea that the furthest system from us millions of light years away. That idea separates us from creation. Isolates us. Limits us. And the space cgi we do get as a reality is mocking us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the spherical model you get this separation, this distance. When, they(planets and stars) are most likely very close. very close like almost touching the edge of our atmosphere.  And calling them orbiting planets that we will most likely never get to with a spaceship with a rocket on it. Reminder too even these planets and moons are cgi. Artist renderings.  So again, we don't know reality and what is beyond our little bubble of limitations. But, we keep giving away billions towards it. Towards them, to them, they get it. So essentially they do it to steal our money and awareness.

       First, I'm going to explain how the basic properties of light can explain this behavior
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Stars that are very, very distant look bigger than they actually are because of the properties of
       <a href="http://cdn-7.nikon-cdn.com/Images/Learn-Explore/Photography-Techniques/2009/Focal-Length/Media/focal-length-graphic.jpg">
        focal length
       </a>
       , a property of the lens in your eyes or camera. Focal length can be used to make object look bigger or smaller (ie closer or further like the video you linked). Also, focal length can make things look blurry or in focus. Stars that are very distant, i.e. 1000s of light years away, will be near impossible to get in focus. Thus, these light sources of extremely distant stars will seem bigger than they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) The moon appears translucent because the light from the sun in
       <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html">
        diffracted in the atmosphere
       </a>
       , which is between you and the moon. The light that does make if from the moon to your eyes is then combined with this blue diffracted light to make the moon look blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) The clouds appear to be behind the sun because the light that directly hits you from the sun blasts through the some of the less dense clouds with minimal effect. Some of the parts of the clouds are dense enough to block the light, other parts are not. Therefore, sometimes the sun looks like it is in the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm going to predict that you don't believe this science and provide an alternate explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would an all powerful group of people knowingly leave such "obvious clues." If their goal is to repress conciseness, wouldn't it be worth it to use better cgi? Why risk letting enough people learn "the truth?" Perhaps this is the best they have. Then wouldn't it be less resource demanding to simply use propaganda (and brute force if needed) while simply not supplying any cgi at all. If this group truly is powerful enough to use cgi on the entirety of the sky, they surely are powerful enough to prevent and monitor any attempts to fly there. Air traffic is already heavily regulated and monitored and difficult for most people to use.

       The used what they had. Tech slightly ahead of what the masses have. Already NASA is using augmented virtual reality. So instead of believing them I just trust what I see in nature. Now if you blame me then maybe you haven't witnessed the deception of NASA yet yourself or you wouldn't be on that side of the argument.  Once you realize the lies you are taught and shown repeatedly, it is, it's hard to accept anybody who says otherwise.  I'm going with nature, and I'm going with what normal people are discovering. No more government education or sciences for me.

       But I have seen these optical properties with my own eyes. I have access to a lab. I have done the experiments that prove these properties. Obviously I can't prove this to you. Instead, im going to encourage you to find a cheap laser, lens (of different focal points, ie thickness), and prism and try some experiments yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, other than what you showed earlier, how is NASA deceiving us? I'm sure you understand the value of skepticism. Sorry for having so many questions.

       Everything. Literally the world. That is their plan, to make everyone believe every little lie they spew so they can implement a one world order and rule the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       They start with making you question everyday things like... hmmm Earth looks flat.. OH WAIT BUT ITS NOT BECAUSE THE ELITE SAY SO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you'll drink their coca-cola ,which still contains coca leaves to this day. Yeah drink your cocaine people! But of course youll believe the elite when they say they "remove" the cocaine and only use the leaf for its flavor. What a joke. Its sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you'll smoke their tobacco and rat poison. Because doctors endorsed it at one point and made everyone used to it and it became a societal norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you wont question why there is literally industrial waste in your water, a poison called fluoride because you NEED it for tooth health. But is it not already in your toothpaste? Seems unnecessary. Because it fucking is. and then double that with all the canned good, premade everything you buy, because all of those foods use fluoridated water, so most people are getting WAY more fluoride than they think...
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT THE ELITE SAY ITS OK, SO ITS ALL HUNKY DORY IS'NT IT?
      </p>
      <p>
       Suuuuure they gain NOTHING from making you believe a LIE from the get go.

       Letting one lie go makes it easier for another, then another, then another!

       So if the other planets are real? And orbiting the sun. It's only the earth that is flattened?

       Can you explain how gravity works on a non spherical earth if the theory of relativity doesn't hold true to a flat earth ?

       Like op article says. Mayan calendar could work on both flat and round. If the belief was adjusted and it was the stars moving and earth stationary it would make no difference. The only thing being proven is that certain stars are in certain places and there is a predictable pattern. Their cosmology also uses God's. These aren't celestial bodies, or planets as we believe them to be, they are spirits. We still name them after God's. So the origins we are dealing with are on archetypes and spirit. Science came along and said big bang and basically changed all of that.

       Having $25,000 to spend on a plane would make you one of the most wealthy people in the world. The median wealth in India is $608. In Africa its $411. That mid-range plane represents 4 years of income for an average Chinese person. I'd say that enough to put someone in the global elite.

       "It is now understood that Copernicus and Galileo were correct about the earth not being flat—and this is in complete harmony with the Bible. About 2,300 years earlier, the prophet Isaiah was inspired to write, “It is He that sits upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in” (40:22). This verse is expressed more explicitly in the Moffatt translation: “He that sits over the round earth…”

       Because the exploration of space is limiting in how we do it. They want to control it.  But the larger limitation is on human consciousness. There is an underlying knowledge of this world they keep secret. That's why none of remember. It has to do with many things but mainly our origins and what the world really is, has been kept from us, that's the biggest secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, nobody like us knows for certain, in this day and age what is at the north and south poles. Don't you think that knowledge would expand our consciousness of the reality we are in? It could alter everything depending on what's there.

       Another, the idea that the furthest system from us millions of light years away. That idea separates us from creation. Isolates us. Limits us. And the space cgi we do get as a reality is mocking us.

       So in the spherical model you get this separation, this distance. When, they(planets and stars) are most likely very close. very close like almost touching the edge of our atmosphere.  And calling them orbiting planets that we will most likely never get to with a spaceship with a rocket on it. Reminder too even these planets and moons are cgi. Artist renderings.  So again, we don't know reality and what is beyond our little bubble of limitations. But, we keep giving away billions towards it. Towards them, to them, they get it. So essentially they do it to steal our money and awareness.

       Consider the puny dis-info agents that propagate theories intended to discredit critical thinkers when they get too close to exposing corporate collusion in mass murder.  They've already made their choice.
