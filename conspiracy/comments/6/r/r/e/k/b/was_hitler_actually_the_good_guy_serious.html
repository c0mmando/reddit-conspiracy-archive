       I seriously doubt that. He treated France with silk gloves for instance. A few years ago I've even read some new french historic research that came to the conclusion that some french elites even welcomed the invasion to get rid off the increasing influence of the communist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalin would have invaded Middle Europe late 1941 if the German troops hadn't been so successful in the West. The final date for the Russian invasion was set to July 1942 which Hitler wittingly or unwittingly preempted in June 1942.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at this map

       you mostly see military administrated territory which was militarily important. The rest were ran by local national governments as vassals or as allies until they imploded like Italy and its territories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In almost every nation were forces at work during that time which had no real or less regard for human lives. But outside actual war action I can't see the level of mayhem to happen on the level of Mao or Stalin. You don't kill millions of people with just a few thousand death squads in Western Europe after the official war action ended.

       'Silk gloves', they deported the country's jewish population  (with the aid of Vichy of course)

       'June 1942'? By that you mean June 1941 Don't you? Also stalin was shocked that germany attacked and refused to accept that it happened

       Yes, silk gloves. What do you think they could have done to France if they wanted while the France exile government organised the partisan uprising and GB/US ran a massive civil bomb campaign in Germany.

       Hunger plan was meant for after victory. Not during the war.

       Thats not exactly surprising. People tend to care more about history of their own country/geographic area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also china doesn't talk about it because they don't want to discuss the major issues of mao. Technically they are still a communist country (though they aren't in reality of course). Just like you can't access anything about Tiananmen square

       The idea of jews screwing up the economy isn't true. Looking at the wall street crash it wasn't intentional so blaiming the Jews was because of underlying antisemitism
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the stab in the back (where it was believed Jews sold germany out at the end of ww1) is false. If anything the generals running the country completely freaked out and sued for peace  (though the army had seen a collapse in morale)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look at the invasion of the ussr, numerous atrocities  (e.g einsatzgruppen, who killed at least 100,000 jews in cold blood) and their plans upon victory  (hunger plan)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes more died under stalin (though you xan argue that all of the deaths from the war in europe/africa were hitler's fault) but remember how long stalin was jn power compared with Hitler. Especially relevant since until like  '36 Hitler wasn't strong enough within Germany to go that extreme

       Not really. But it's a classic example of a market collapsing because people couldn't see the bigger picture. And it did lead to the nazis gaining power so not exactly  'happy'

       There are many who like to act like the know and are "experts" on the man. However regardless of your view, it is instructive to hear the man's own words, and examine his political career via the lenses of his supporters. This well done but banned video does so. It has been

       Kershaw conveniently skips over virtually all the material covered in the linked to censored video. But you are perfectly free to stick with  Kershaw for the heavily promoted and narrow "wanted to revenge WWI with warfare" narrative.

      </p>
      <p>
       No historian ascribes to that idea of ww2 being just for revenge. There were numerous economic motivations and ideology seperate to versailles. For instance lebens raum, yes it was an idea by the end of ww1 but that was why the nazis  (well one of the major reasons) that they invaded the ussr.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always find it interesting when people try defending a very alternative view of ww2 they deliberately misrepresent the mainstream narrative

       I didn't say they were the "good" guys. There were no "good" guys on any side of this war but they followed a cause&amp;effect logic and weren't some irrational evil bogeyman as they were portrayed.

       Any political movement which needed to motivate its population for future war situations requires a certain "mythological" component.

       The USA's is based on their "exceptionalism" belief, for the jews it's their "chosen by god" and racist belief to keep their group clean, the French had their "Grand Nation" and I don't think we need to discuss the Brits's upper class ideology. The US/GB elites created the eugenics movement which the NS party just adopted.

       I see no real substantial differences here for the beliefs of all these nations during that time period.

       No one tries to claim that what the nazis used was unique, it was copied from numerous other ideas. But the combination and the level of racial hatred that the nazis adopted was unique.

      <p>
       Also I would call their beliefs irrational. At the same timr you had Jews who were subhuman but also taking over the world. Plus the stab in the back was a complete myth

       Ultimately, if God is in control, then He allowed it to happen. Hitler was a tool He used to complete His master plan. Plus, how many good things can a person do that get wiped out by one bad thing? And Mao killed so many more, how Hitler was propaganda of being most evil is crazy. Just remember the Rothchilds financed both sides, Allies and Axis and got all the banks. They are the most evil.

       The Hebrew Israelites were. They were so good the Almighty God of Israel gave them his personal power to use in battle. The power was in the Ark of the Covenant. And only the Hebrew Israelites can use it.

       I agree, but they weren't black.  I surely hope you aren't a black supremacist.

       Yes they were are and black people. The Messiah is a black man too. What's the problem? It's all there in fine print in the Bible. What would me being a black supremacist have anything to do with the truth?

       You sound really suspect to be honest.

       If tomorrow all newspapers printed Bruce Lee as a white man, wouldn't you find that blasphemous? If tomorrow Vladimir Klitschko was portrayed for whatever fucked up reason as a black man with 4 inch Afro, wouldn't you find it slightly odd? Or would you stay quite like a little effeminate bitch?

       Description of the tribe of Judah:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 14:2King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground;
      </p>
      <p>
       See what colour they are? Black
      </p>

       How does the Hebrew Israelite King Solomon describe himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Song of Solomon 1:5-6King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep. He's black too. 99% of the people in the bible are black. So what's the problem?

       That's not true.  You guys are black supremacists and the biggest idiot on the planet.  I know my Bible and read it in Hebrew.  Black people were cursed.  I bet you think Jesus was black too.  And that white people have genetic problems and that blacks used to be kangs.  You guys believe anything that boosts your self esteem for your race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only black people believe that, you can do 23 and me and get a genetic test.  God's people were brown, not black smh... Pulling verses WAY out of context is a very common strategy.

       White people do have a genetic disorder though. It's called "lack of melanin". Which race of people was suncream was invented for? The white race...if putting on a specific sun cream every day in order to survive the everyday beams of the Sun Isn't a genetic disorder...then I don't know what to tell you man.

       Strangely enough, The God of Israel hates Esau, the father of the Edomite nation. Esau' s name means; he whose skin is wasted away. Hence the suntan lotion. Nothing taken out of context because the Almighty God of Israel doesn't lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes they were obviously brown and all shades of brown people in the 12 tribes of Israel. God's chosen people. God's special people. I use the term black because that's how the world ignorantly refers to people of colour. And yes the Messiah is a black man too.

       I know you are right about many things. I have heard all the Esau information before except that you say it means "he whose skin wasted away" and I would like a reference for that. I never heard that before.

       And before you go some rant just please answer the question. I probably know and practice more than your youtube videos could ever teach you in this regard.

       Than after you answer .. rant on..
