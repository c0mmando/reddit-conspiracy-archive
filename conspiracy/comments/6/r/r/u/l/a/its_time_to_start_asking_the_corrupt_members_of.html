        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One man got away with horrific abuse for 50+ years. Jimmy Savile abused young people for years and got away with it. Most of these young people would have reported their abuse to the police. Now, my idea is if we can find out who these poor souls reported the crimes to, we can find out why these officers didn&#39;t take their investigation further or rather who was stopping them from taking it further. We need to start asking these officers why they stopped these investigations and get an explantion on why the investigations were quashed even though everyone in the entertainment industry knew what was happening and there were hundreds of allegations. </p>

<p>I think we could:
1. Find out which officers took the victims statements.
2. Find out who was the investigating officer for each case.
3. Find out why these investigating officers quashed all the investigations. 
4. Find out who gave them the orders to quash the investigations.
5. Find out the real reasons these investigations were quashed by higher raking officers.</p>

<p>We need to ask the &#39;Mental Health specialists&#39; at Broadmoor why they thought Savile was a pedophile and why they then gave him the KEYS to Broadmoor, housing hundreds of vunerable people and ignored their own &#39;professional diagnosis&#39; of the man: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIhrSePimB0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIhrSePimB0</a> </p>

<p>We need to ask Francis Rossi who &#39;warned&#39; him and his entire generation to keep quiet: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLoMW06neBY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLoMW06neBY</a></p>

<p>We need to ask all the celebrities at the BBC who &#39;knew&#39;, why they stayed quiet: Johnny Rotten &#39;banned from BBC for speaking out&#39;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4wNH2tQQog">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4wNH2tQQog</a></p>

<p>The system put in place to protect the most vunerable people in society has failed. The police forces that are meant to protect us have failed. It&#39;s time to forget about the &#39;hush hush&#39; society that existed for all these years and it&#39;s time to start asking the questions and getting to the bottom of things.      </p>

<p>If the bottom layer of corruption starts talking it will open the door to the staircase all the way to the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the people who were abused have stated they reported their crimes but nothing came of it. There are literally hundreds of victims so there will be enough allegations from the past to work with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts wonder why more haven&#39;t come forward.  People come out of the woodwork and make the news when it brings down a politician.</p>

<p>Yet no real victims coming out saying &#39;Xxxx did Yyyyy to me on Zzzz&#39;</p>

<p>That worries me, why not even one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On 19 October 2012 the Metropolitan Police Service launched a formal criminal investigation, Operation Yewtree, into historic allegations of child sexual abuse by Savile and other people, some still living, over four decades. It stated that it was pursuing over 400 lines of inquiry, based on the claims of 200 witnesses, via 14 police forces across the UK. It described the alleged abuse as being &quot;on an unprecedented scale&quot;, and the number of potential victims as &quot;staggering&quot;. By 19 December, eight people had been questioned as part of the investigation. The Metropolitan Police stated that the total number of alleged victims was 589, of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile.   </p>

<p>450 people have already spoke out and if you add in the fact he was good friends with Prince Charles and everybody at the BBC knew what he was up to, it all points to something or someone surely protecting him and he KNEW he was untouchable and just laughed it off everytime he was confronted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ask sociopaths tough questions you will be lied to until you are dizzy.  If you peacefully protest sociopaths you will be ignored and called names.  Power concedes nothing without a threat.  The dogma of peace is a psyop to keep the sheep ineffectual.  When the entire system is corrupt top to bottom (and I would argue that it is) violence or the threat of violence is the only way change will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people implicated in this are the ones who control all the important facets of society; politics, law, news, business, entertainment etc etc. It is that way for a reason. Information is power and if they have puppets installed at every information channel, that information isn&#39;t going to reach the masses. If you go to the police, the police chief is controlled by the mayor, the mayor is controlled by politicians higher up, them politicians are controlled by whoever is bankrolling them.  </p>

<p>Think of the world as channels of power than stream down from the top. Every who isn&#39;t at the very top answers to someone higher up than them. Nobody wants to anger whoever is above them because that is either career suicide or actual &quot;suicide&quot;.</p>
