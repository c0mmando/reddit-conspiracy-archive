    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah! Your timing is perfect:)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a good one- in the 80&#39;s the Houston police department had a real mean reputation for killing civilians and then using &quot;throw down guns&quot; to get away with it. Enter punk band Ak-47, who released a blistering 7&quot; record titled &quot;the badge means you suck&quot; which was a play on HPD&#39;s  PR campaign  &quot;the badge means you care.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oUvm7GfB6zc">Here&#39;s the song...</a> check the top comment:</p>

<p><em>AK47 was a great band. The distinctive element was the two guitar wall of sound.I saw most of their early shows in 78/79.  The lawsuit was a joke. The Houston Police sued all of the band members under their stage names( Raton Pi, Neutron Stu,Jimmy Allstar, Tim Phlegm) But they didn&#39;t stop there.....since the record sleeve said&quot; Mikhail Kalashnikov presents AK-47&quot; the cops prolly figured that the Russian guy must be the band&#39;s promoter so they sued him too. I was one of the attorneys initially approached to defend this case. As an attorney it was a source of lotsa laffs when the subject of exactly how the HPD was going to serve suit papers on somebody in Russia....who designed weapons. BTW the song on the OTHER side of the single is even better...kiss my machine.ï»¿</em></p>

<p><em>young and dumb, truth and justice fantasy/ fresh out of the academy...</em></p>

<p>Pantera did a good cover of that song too. Sounds exactly the same. </p>

<p>Pig Champion was underrated as a guitar player. Fatty could shred! RIP</p>

<p>I saw them too. My favorite album by them was their &quot;Ian Mckaye&quot; album. Especially the song &quot;getting the fear&quot; with all the Manson family quotes. Good times:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. I&#39;ve lost some people too. You have every reason to hate it! </p>

<p>Of course we all make our own decisions in life but I&#39;m a bit... <em>peeved</em> knowing the CIA pushes this stuff on us to fund their black ops. You mentioned fentanyl... now they&#39;re mixing in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carfentanil">Carfentanil</a> with heroin. It like 100x stronger than Fentanyl. I&#39;m not saying it done for motives other than profit, but poisoning heroin has been suggested to the government before by one of their academics.

<p>They already poisoned weed with paraquat and killed thousands poisoning alcohol during prohibition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m jealous--would have loved to have seen Fear, Subhumans &amp; Reagan Youth...I saw the Butthole Surfers--the only thing I remember is reaching over the bar counter at Metro (Chicago) and stealing a bottle of vodka on my way out by stuffing it in my Chicago cop coat which my friend. bought at a thrift market for $20 (he owed me money)...Saw Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, Suicidal Tendencies, Naked Raygun, Dead Milkmen, Meat Beat Manifesto there, too.  I grew up 2 blocks from Wax Trax--so I was definitely onto a lot of the Industrial.</p>

<p>I tried to keep the list to strictly 80&#39;s albums...I&#39;ve heard of Crass (but never checked them out).  There was also a band named MDC--Millions od Dead Cops (but I think they changed the meaning of MDC from album to album).  MDC had lots of anti-corporate and police brutality in their lyrics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha awesome. Ballsy of you to steal a bottle from the bar:) </p>

<p>I always thought punk was a logical choice for conspiracy minded folk.i bet DeadKennedy were great! They were about the first punk Brandi ever listened to. How can you not check them out, with a name like that?</p>

<p>On second thought I&#39;ve also seen Circle Jerks and maaaaaaybe Naked Raygun. Hazy memories! I&#39;ve definitely seen MDC. Check out thi little known later-period song where they mix Spanish guitar an hardcore. I love it.<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_ADDaVRsONk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_ADDaVRsONk</a></p>

<p>Have you seen the documentary American Hardcore? If you haven&#39;t you should! Very thorough and entertaining. It&#39;s online and I can promise you you&#39;ll like it:)</p>
