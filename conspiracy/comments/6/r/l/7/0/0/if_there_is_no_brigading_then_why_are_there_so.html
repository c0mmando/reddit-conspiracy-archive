       They're just shills. They are just going to try to make you feel bad for posting things that they have been paid to suppress. If they are saying something bad about you, then you know that you are discussing truths that they would rather you not discuss. Wear it like a badge of honor!

       Or it's just people thinking you're ludicrous and easy to bait so they troll you thinking they are shills. Then they laugh at you when you think they are in fact shills thus "proving your point" that you were "right" and they laugh some more. But ofc I could be wrong

       There's a rumor that shills get paid by the amount of replies they get. If that's true, you can starve them of a wage by ignoring them.

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j5ybwes0&amp;amp;sh=746186d7">
        shills exist and there are a huge number of entities that hire them.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Link ONE shill comment. Just one

      <p>
       See, failure to provide this doesn't prove anything. The argument is going to be "but you can't prove those people are shills." That is the very reason shills exist. It's actually really difficult to leave evidence behind proving that you are a shill, so even the sloppy ones usually don't leave proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are left with the corporations that have been caught doing it, news reports on government shills that don't name specific usernames,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=izz0ga8r&amp;amp;sh=43621acd">
        former shills that have admitted to it
       </a>
       (a portion of which could be making it up, or they are blocked from revealing too much because of NDA's), and the select few times some account was outright caught shilling. I'm aware of 4 or 5 of those, including some hot sauce company that always used the same accounts to defend the owner and a few CTR accounts, but the threads with proof are always deleted by the user or removed. That is some really bad luck. In short, you won't get any accounts specifically named and proven to be shills because of 1) bad luck I guess (or paid off, etc) and 2) you'd have to be absurdly sloppy to leave proof behind. Most people will always give the benefit of the doubt, so the practice of shilling really is the perfect PR professional's wet dream. It's easy and very low risk. We know shilling is widespread by the first link I cited, but narrowing it down to specific accounts is usually not going to happen.

       So you obviously didn't have enough time to read my comment. Maybe try reading it and then commenting next time? I don't go around accusing people of being shills like some kind of paranoid dick. My user history speaks for itself.

       Well, she probably could, and I could also link to people who are suspiciously shill-like. It doesn't prove anything because they are very unlikely to send you a screenshot of their paychecks. That is the beauty of paid trolling. You look exactly like an unpaid one and you'd have to be an absolute idiot to leave evidence behind.

       That's just how people speak. Either English is not your first language (which is fine if true), or you are reading way too much into my comments and interpreting them whichever way you want. Maybe you are used to being called a shill, so you are paranoid that everyone is calling you a shill? Or is it something else?

       It's about context, not semantics. You are reading each sentence individually instead of reading the whole comment. Try it again, but this time with context:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Maybe give people the benefit of the doubt next time instead of assuming everyone is calling you a shill, which ironically is not much different from assuming somebody a shill.

       I deleted a previous account during a rage about being threatened with a ban for pointing out shills (without even using the word) sp others could downvote and move on. I was blinded with rage at the fact that I was being called out an those clearly being paid for "their opinion" were allowed to roam freely. I blame chantix for my behavior during that time but that is another thread topic.

       Oh come now, shills are an integral part of every conspiracy theory. I'd be suspicious of brigading if people WEREN'T being implied to be shills. Rule 10 is there for the reason that conspiracy theorists are (rightly) very suspicious of shills, which can unfortunately result in innocent accounts being caught in the cross-fire.

       There's no brigading.

       When discussion is focused on the biggest conspiracies (medicine, science and history etc.) the cognitive dissonance is so high, that people inevitably start insulting each other.

       Yeah but when people are insulting others on the basis of believing a conspiracy theory something is fucky. When people are facing abuse for NOT taking the TPTB &amp; MSM at face value it's a good sign that perhaps a brigade from elsewhere is underway.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       The hate for contest mode is from the shills!  Who else would care but the people desperate to drown out the conversation here? Contest mode is unbiased.  If we don't have any other option I would rather see every post in contest mode.  The top level comments in some of these threads is getting ridiculous.

       If you only notice 'shills' when you disagree with them, your perceptions may not be as apt as you believe them to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have certainly been groups brigading and botting on reddit and imgur for over a year now, and people have been more than patient through the tsunami of mental static.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people are now tired of the echo chamber these brigades have brought, and are no longer so patient and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope people will soon be able to better perceive the reality that is occurring around them, or else it's going to be a rough ride of delusion and paranoia.

       I know, right? These people only seem to comment on Russia and Pgate threads. Their comments always somehow boil down to saying this sub is stupid and often a complete lack of critical thought. Why are they even here?

      <p>
       You can always tell the people who regularly participate in this sub because they ask thought provoking questions even in the face of some more polarizing topics like flat earth. They understand that a person can entertain an idea without accepting it, and use thought and reasoning to defend their position instead of insults and mindless dismissals.

       I think it would be hilarious and horribly disruptive to the majority of astroturfing techniques. You can't create false consensus. You can't slide comments through vote brigades. You can't (effectively) cheerlead.
      </p>

       A bonus is people who care will actually read the comments and open discussions that interest them. I can't see a downside really...

       Since contested mode seems to be the only method to combat vote manipulation I say we implement it as much as possible.

       Brigading and vote manipulation has made Reddit into a censured mess.

       Contested mode is not even remotely a censure tool by the way, it will only make it harder for shills to dominate a comment section.

       All you'd need to do is pepper the thread with low effort replies. Every comment is weighted equally. If shills wanted to they could essentially spam. If mods ban they could make multiple accounts and post just one or twice per.

       No, it does not discourage well-made comments. Those posting a lot of low effort shitposts at the top-level would be easily identified as shills and could be dealt with accordingly.

       No, we see plenty of brigading here and the very system used by Reddit does not in any way facilitate fair and equal discussions. You should know this since it has been pointed out often.

       Trolls and shills will go where the traffic is. If that sub gets bigger, it will suffer the same fate. You have to ask yourself how you would run a shilling organization. Regular people have easy access to keyword alert services. Shills will certainly use this, along with some kind of queue that ranks the targeted posts by how much traffic is there at that moment. This can either be automated or done manually. Say there are 2 posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       that have to deal with shady business practices of Corporation X. Corporation X's shill  team will get alerts for these two posts (along with many others), but those two will be first in the queue. Once they are done there, the next most popular post that mentions X will be invaded and so on and so forth until they have exhausted their 8 or 10 hour shift. If your sub mentions X and there are no more posts above it in the queue during the shift, the thread will be invaded.

       I'm going to disagree to some extent.  It's unlikely that a banned shill account can be prevented from vote-brigading, but if the mods were to ban a shill account, at least the shill account would be prevented from forum-sliding, calling us "conspiracy theorist nutjobs" and the like, which may have saved this sub had it been carried out at an earlier time.  You've got to admit, having a rule against calling out shills while simultaneously allowing derogatory "conspiracy theorist nutjob" accusations is a highly questionable practice.

       Shills try very hard to fit into communities, so for the most part, you will not be able to tell who is the shill and who is not. Subtle manipulation and misdirection is key. You will end up in a state of paranoia where you ban everyone with a dissenting opinion or who occasionally goes off on a tangent accidentally. This will cause a lot of division within the community, which is the very thing shills want. It's better to play it safe and have somewhat specific rules that are easily enforced.

      <p>
       Shills will also use this rule  against the users. They might fabricate evidence that you are a shill, which happened to me. They can follow you around and call you a shill, call you an anti vaxer, anti GMO nut, etc (also happened to me). It's a good rule, but it obviously has to be enforced properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen a lot of comments removed if they are making fun of users in this sub. It probably (heavily) depends on how many reports a comment is getting. This is a huge sub and the task of micro-moderating the comments in every thread must be a ton of work. Even just the top 5 can be a lot of work because you have to keep checking back to each thread over the course of its life to see any new comments that break rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mod a small 20,000 subscriber sub and the mod queue can get backed up pretty bad depending on how much time I get each day. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, so if you have a bunch of trolls who are flooding the mods with removal requests, those are the comments that will get removed. If you see rule violations, send the mods a modmail with a link, or just report it. You have to ask them if they regularly check the reports or not, which doesn't give notifications, but modmail will always give them a notification.

       Here's the thing man, I was saying that exact same thing 3 years ago when this subreddit started going to shit and people were talking about migrating to somewhere like voat. But it hasn't gotten any better since then, if anything, it's gotten worse. 
I think it's time to cut our losses trying to make this sub the free thinking, informative place that it once was, because it's not happening. We need to make a new conspiracy community. It's time.

       Any talk about migrating to a new place is pointless if it is based on the same system as Reddit. Going to another subreddit is just stupid.

       What would be needed is a system that is built from the start to combat astroturfing and shilling.

       Steemit has one idea using real money as a base for the voting system, but I'm not entirely convinced it will work. Other than that I am not aware of anything that is big enough to be relevant yet.

       Nothing would change moving to a new subreddit. Once it reached critical mass in regards to subscribers or exposure it would immediately be under attack by astroturfers and brigades. Maybe even before that, depending on what would be discussed.

       One astroturfing tactic is to split communities into smaller groups to dillute the effect discussion in them has to influence and spread opinion.

       I'm gonna go ahead and start migrating.  The discussion here has already been allowed to be diluted too much.  I've checked out 2 other subs today that were recommended to me and the atmosphere at both is much more friendly to conspiracy theory discussion.  The atmosphere here now is just to hostile to what the sub used to be.

       So true. Sooooo true. Good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been explaining some of the shilling tactics to my father in an attempt to have him understand why Trump and Clinton are in the news cycles so often and why it seems like both are under attack 24/7. Baby boomers don't go on forums like the under 50 crowd does. They are spoonfed their news.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not. We seek it out. And now our way of discussing news and sharing information is being poisoned by CTR/SB and Cambridge. It's making it so toxic that nobody even wants to share information now. This whole subreddit has become extremely toxic like a MOBA game. There is little discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as you said, for our children this is the WORST possible outcome of the internet. This is exactly opposite what the internet was for us. I don't know about you, but I did not even know what an atheist was until I started reading on the net when I was 8 and my dad got 33.3 dialup for his job. It opened a whole new world, as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say all this as someone who tends to believe that Trump had contacts with Russia, and that CA is doing a number on this sub. But so is CTR. So is the FBI/NSA/DoD/CIA/whatever. They're all doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like you said, it's killed discussions in so many ways. I suppose that is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poison the fucking well. I would welcome contest mode on all posts over 100 comments. At least this would FORCE people to confront opinions and posts they don't like, and would foster much more discussion than what we get on this sub.
      </p>

       Honestly, I enjoy it in relatively small doses (although it has been excessive lately). It forces us to refine arguments and hone debating skills. If you can't push back on shill arguments, then you don't really know your facts. I welcome the shills as a chance to see what I know. This is the world we live in now; engage or succumb.

       I disagree. His list is basically a bunch of right-wing talking points, non-sequitors, and strawmen. Each one could be it's own Fox News chyron.

       It's easy to argue. If it's "gish gallup" then it should be even easier. People seem to be more concerned about posting innocuous comments for upvotes than actually posting their beliefs for debate purposes. At least he has the balls to possibly be wrong and subject himself to criticism.

       Conversations that never had any intention of moving anywhere probably won't move anywhere, you're right. You should probably know that ahead of time for next time so you can decide how you want a conversation to advance rather than complaining about someone doing the same exact thing you're doing.

       In all fairness, while the evidence is only circumstantial thus far, there is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       convincing circumstantial evidence that you enjoy abusing children. It's not overwhelming evidence yet,
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       certainly wouldn't accuse you of being a pedophile and I want to make clear that I am NOT accusation you of being a pedo, but at this point it's worth launching a deeper investigation, given the kind of sick way your mind seems to work when it comes to children.

       Probably has to do with some of the insane conspiracy theories Alex Jones has put out there.  Could have to do with this sub being completely taken over by right-wing donald users who have a clear agenda to attack liberals with whatever lies they can think of that moment.   All the while blindly following Trump.  A conspiracy theorist is just a skeptical person.  Be skeptical of what is right in front of you..

       Because

       I think this is sort of what OP's getting at, that we all become lumped into one group regardless of belief in one or many conspiracy theories, and that in itself is the insult.

      <p>
       "Oh you browse
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ? I'm not even going to reply to your comment because you probably think the earth is flat or we didn't land on the moon, trolololololool stupid conspiracy theorists."
      </p>
      <p>
       By lumping us into one belief and one group is a means to discredit us. Because now, they no longer have to wait for a "stupid" conspiracy to emerge to make fun of conspiracy theorists, they just have to make up their own stupid conspiracy, and peddle around that every conspiracy theorist believes this, and so now anything, that someone who believes in a conspiracy, says is invalidated and most likely false in the eyes of a shallow mind.

       He might've been talking about this sub, but I took it as any sub in general, because I see a lot of it in other subs. Though, I do not believe there is a group of people that have banded together to upvote insults of conspiracy theorists, but more a general outcome to how we get lumped into a group and perceived.

       It's one of the last places on Reddit where you can go and have a good old-fashioned disagreement.

       The discord is good, ideas should be challenged and defended - shills or not, it doesn't really matter, if they aren't willing to go to the mat for their theories they might as well fuck-off to some hug-box circlejerk sub and let their brains melt away...

       That's a good one. I was told earlier how Google suggestions just displays the most searched results, such as "George Soros is awesome". We should keep a note of some of these gems and whack them in a summary thread for amusement.

       Also, give me your facts as to why the only time in history a skyscraper was utterly demolished because of "fire" was on that day.  Why have larger, hotter fires burned for longer periods of time than on 9/11 with little to no structural failure, let alone complete collapse.

       Reddit has always had dissenting views highly upvoted in comment threads. It's one of the reasons I started hanging out here 6-7 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       A highly upvoted post with an alarmist title would often have a top comment debunking the title or adding important context to the article. It was one of the things that made me think, "Wow, people on reddit actually think for themselves." There was a common joke about how people always checked the comments first to make sure the post wasn't BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was back when Ron Paul, privacy, and tech news were the most popular topics on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sort of thing has gone away on large subs where memes/jokes/puns are now the most upvoted comments.

       Here's an honest assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, there's an enormous conspiracy/scandal going on in U.S. politics. Whether you think it's all fake or not doesn't matter--it's big enough to frequently dominate the media and millions of Americans are interested in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of those people use Reddit. And now that a conspiracy is front-and-center, a lot of those people are going to be curious about what the main conspiracy hub is saying about it. Imagine the users of
       <a href="/r/linkinpark">
        /r/linkinpark
       </a>
       complaining about brigaders the day Chester Bennington died.

       So, yes, you have an influx of liberal visitors to your sub. I'm one of them. Nobody is paying me, I'm just interested in the Russia scandal and I'm interested to see what this sub's take is on it.

       ...? Are you serious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, how long have you been on this sub? This sub's past-time has always been insulting other users. It's just the nature of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       People come here and present theories and information that is EXTREMELY controversial. Oftentimes it's not vetted. Unsubstantiated. Not saying it's a bad thing, it's a freaking conspiracy sub. If it were vetted and meticulously substantiated, it would be a pretty shitty conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as it always goes, whenever anyone presents material like that, some people are going to balk, others are going to laugh, others are going to poke holes and shoot it down. That is the nature of conspiracy talk and exchange of these types of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, on the internet of all places, people don't take too kindly to being ridiculed, laughed at or challenged. So the go to thing? Insult back. "Shill" accusations have been on this sub since I was fresh on Reddit and stumbled into this sub. Back then, it was JIDF shills and corporate shills from Monsanto and such. That was the go-to accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's Trump shills. Clinton shills (why she would need them, idek) and DNC/Shareblue shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then butthurt parties ALWAYS blasted self-posts about "how this sub is changing" "how we've been compromised" and how "we're all being duped" by these unseen forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is.... it's usually just a case of massive butthurt because a lot of people who are into conspiracies are also very sensitive, snowflake type people who don't know how to handle rejection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that as an insult. Just the truth. Insults to this sub and its users are old as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Oh, and you also have the conspiratard types that like to agitate and ridicule as a past-time. Now it's TMOR and politics people who like to come in and tap on the glass. And, honestly, it IS kind of funny how the sub that loves conspiracies so much is doing
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       much to stifle and derail conversation about, arguably, one of the biggest scandals in recent history. It's especially interesting to see the sub that hated government and loved whistleblowers now rally to the side of the fucking federal government like it can do no wrong and it's just a victim. The love affair stinks to high heaven and it's amazing people here kinda just look the other way as people are getting banned left and right for stepping out of line and only posts critical of him and the right wing narrative get tagged and put into that ridiculous contest mode. I don't hate the feature, but it should just be default on for ALL posts and people should be given the option to switch to the other modes as well.

       your account is new. You don't even have a 3 year club badge, to prove that you visited once before the election. ( wait, you dont even have a 1 year club badge. ) so im really unsure how you can talk about the history of this sub.

      <p>
       long before my reddit avatar was born, upvotes and downvotes used to be visibly linked to users. Maybe an OGP can chime in here, I've been on sites before that did this. You can literally see how the vote tally breaks down and who voted which way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be much better than contest mode imo. I want to see the shilling, I want to unbury the buried comment and see what I've long suspected right in my fucking face. This, imo, is the only way to wake people up, the let the proof come to bear. I dunno, maybe I'm jaded.

       Because we agree? Because many of us are frustrated about the apparent direction of the sub? Because some of us have gone through 20 user names over 10 years to remain anonymous but always come back to r/conspiracy and since the election (or really Ellen Pao) our beloved passtime has been ruined? Maybe?

       It usually goes like, 'how dare you question this stuff I made up because I read it somewhere else, your motives are suspicious' and then the insults start. No debate on the actual content takes place, just passive aggressive BS.

       Nope. I can make a list of random pseduo-arguments with a heavy dose of personal opinion too.

       Doesn't mean that list is an actual cohesive and logical argument so much as rambling.

       I deleted a previous account during a rage about being threatened with a ban for pointing out shills (without even using the word) sp others could downvote and move on. I was blinded with rage at the fact that I was being called out an those clearly being paid for "their opinion" were allowed to roam freely. I blame chantix for my behavior during that time but that is another thread topic.

       I worry that if every thread were in contest mode the shills would find a way to work around it. Only posts which are heavily brigaded should be set into contest mode so shills can't plan for it

       All you'd need to do is pepper the thread with low effort replies. Every comment is weighted equally. If shills wanted to they could essentially spam. If mods ban they could make multiple accounts and post just one or twice per.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest mode disincentives thoughtful posts, or those that require research
