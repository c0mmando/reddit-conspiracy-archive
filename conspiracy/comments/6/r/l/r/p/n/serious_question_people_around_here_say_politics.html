       Its the narrative from the MSM. Fact is most all Presidents generally are near the 50/50 approval rate. The polls can be fixed easily. Trump won electoral but lost popular. But it was close. So say 48% love him. 52% hate him. That wont change much either direction. Im a pro Trumper and im all in. Unless he outlaws guns .. im not sure much else he could do to lose my support.

       Your posts on the_donald are so much more high energy. 
Current polls say that he has a 33% approval rating in the us, so the entire planet is a bit of an overreach.

       I think that the deep state views Trump as an amazing smoke screen. While he is hiring and firing communications people and twitter and social media heaves with apparent dissent, the real work of war and drug-running that the deep state really cares about goes on uncommented upon.

       It is an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern version of programs like Operation Mockingbird are still in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US citizens have allowed the rise of a number of three letter agencies that are professional infiltrators. The logical conclusion of spending billions on infiltrators with local PD, the DEA, the CIA, the DIA, the FBI, every military branch, etc... means that everything is infiltrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions, environmental groups, drug cartels, gangs, political groups, news organizations... they even infiltrate each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, whichever faction has done the infiltrating, all factions agree on selling the population one thing... authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is no different in that respect. "Othering" is a tactic the Open Society Foundation discusses in their leaked emails. Basically, "diversity is a tactic, not a value."
      </p>
      <p>
       The media being infiltrated and used as a tool of policy change means that they are creating the illusion that the whole planet is against Trump because saturation, repetition and making it seem like everyone hates is very successfully getting people to hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody anticipated how much people hated the Clintons, though. While they tried to cover it up with their fake polls, the Uranium One scandal was a scandal too far and the Podesta emails brought some interesting revelations to light about how the media colludes with the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the Clinton Foundation is a CIA front (they call them proprietaries) that takes money and redistributes it across an array of other NGO proprietaries to keep favored politicians in power. Another example is JT Packing, where, on Bizapedia, you can go see that it has the same exact Board of Directors as the Clinton Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence community runs a parallel government that specializes in forensic interruption. This ensures that they ensnare corrupt politicians and have the blackmail power to bend them to their will. But not just politicians. Anyone who is useful. Celebrities. Scientists. CEOs. Remember, we pay them billions and allow them full access to everyone's lives. This is the job US citizens pay them to do.

       is a good place to start to understand how bad the Internet shilling really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Mockingbird
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Earnest Voice
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA Instructions to Media Assets
      </p>
      <p>
       These are good places to start if you want to go down the rabbit hole of how bad the problem really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Systems Psychodynamics" is the framework in which they manipulate the population. It is based on Wilfred Bion's "basic assumption" theories which was based on Freud's "object relation" theories, but it has gone way beyond that as a system of messing with people's basic assumptions as a political tool to quash dissent and push agendas.

       Propaganda works best when repeated and then you repeat it again.  Imaginary wolves create fear so the sheep stay close to the shepherd who leads them to the slaughterhous.

       There has been a non-stop, coordinated attack on Trump since he took the lead in the primaries. Meanwhile Michelle Obama was portrayed as the most glamorous first lady in history.

       I don't like anything he does, but I love how angry he makes the right people. I have some seriously conflicted views on the man himself, but I think the regular people that backed him are the most well meaning out of the groups backing anyone else.

       In that way I believe he was kind of "willed" into office. The people who voted against him had no love for their own candidate, no emotion at all really, just intense hatred for Trump. While Trump's voters genuinely loved him and prayed together for his victory. His victory came from thousands of people online sharing memes (pro-Trump, anti-Clinton, anti-media, etc) and joining together in a collective desire to see his victory, which, thanks to modern social media, was not seen before. This collective desire was too much for the people who rigged the election for HRC but still lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing how hated he is/was by all the fuckers like the media was only a massive plus for his voters and the endless negative polls and stories on backfired something fierce.

       In America, looking smart is more important than being smart and doing the right thing.  Meanwhile, the rest of the world knows the Republic was overthrown after the Civil War and are just waiting for us to wake up...so they know Trump is a fraud.  This has been done on purpose, though, and could lead to the most amazing time to be alive in centuries!  Keep your head up, folks.

       Choice may be an illusion, but you still gotta pay for making the wrong one. Same with USA/Trump, UK/Brexit, Venezuela/Maduro, Greece/Tsipras etc...

       All got rammed by the neoliberal cabal pretty hard in order to dissuade people from making the wrong choice in the future.

       No one is against Trump, and there is absolutely no reason to be, the man hasn't done anything bad.  Anyone who questions him is clearly working for Shillary, or CTR, or Sharia Blue, or (((Soros))), or Obama's (((deep state))).

       I mean the man won the popular vote, had the highest electoral college victory ever, the largest crowd ever, and any poll that says otherwise is just liberal media lies.
