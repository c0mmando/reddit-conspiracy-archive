      <p>
       The events of September 11, 2001 evoke the entire range of human emotion. To say that 9/11 is a divisive topic would be quite the understatement, and this couldn't be more evident than when assessing the 9/11 Truth community itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infighting has created an environment where discussing the pros and cons of each theory generally arouses the ire of some faction of the alternative research community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Memes aside, the official jet fuel/pancake theory is generally considered to be nonsense by 9/11 "truthers".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the nearly 16 years since the event, the 9/11 truth movement has evolved into four main camps with regards to the mechanism of the murder weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Broadly speaking, these camps can be qualified as follows: a) Standard controlled demolition; b) So-called "nano-thermite"; c) Mini-nukes or other unconventional nuclear weaponry; d) Exotic or "Directed Energy" weaponry.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why the debate is so heated, for not only was 9/11 a horrific crime, but establishing the mechanism of the murder weapon is a huge clue. The question of "who did it" is inextricably linked to the questions of "what happened?" and "how was it done?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Can the various hypotheses of the mechanisms of their collapse be harmonized? Were the same parties involved in the use of these mechanisms? Or do different mechanisms signal the involvement of different groups, perhaps in conflict?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stepping back for a moment, it's important to consider the many striking parallels between 9/11 and the Kennedy assassination:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They were both used to remake American foreign and domestic policy, especially the normalization of war
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They involved clear examples of "security stripping" (which on 9/11 extended to the entire country)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both events were analyzed by independent investigators who uncovered a vast architecture of conspiracy involving many factional interests, each with the means, motive and opportunity
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both have indications of successful coup d'Ã©tats
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Suspicious financial activity surrounded them, especially on 9/11, indicating prior knowledge
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They each involve ominous connections to a sort of nebulous post-war "Fascist International"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The events are surrounded with occult symbolic content, suggesting they were rituals and vast social engineering works
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Not only is the MO of the perpetrators essentially the same, the organizational structures behind both are the same, indicating that the "latter event was the logical end of the former."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the more prevalent theory that was being formulated was the "let it happen on purpose" (LIHOP) hypothesis. The idea was that the US government knew of the operation in advance, then used it to project military power into the Middle East and enact draconian legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, increasing evidence led to the rise of another theory, the "made it happen on purpose" (MIHOP) hypothesis. This theory held that at the
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       level of the op were the terrorists, who were simply patsies used by a
       <em>
        second
       </em>
       level, which could potentially involve rogue elements within the American military and intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, numerous military drills were taking place on 9/11 that involved hijacked airliners being used for attacks on American targets. To say this unfortunate timing led to increased confusion on that day is a vast understatement, and proponents of the MIHOP hypothesis note that the probability that the terrorists planned it that way was vanishingly small without
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       connection to a rogue network in the American national security structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many contenders have been suggested for this rogue network, notably the Project for a New American Century, which had determined that a "new Pearl Harbor" (a term later used by George W. Bush) would be needed to galvanize public opinion for a prolonged presence in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Late Michael Ruppert viewed 9/11 as "the most significant event in human history: the end of the age of oil", and many researchers agree that oil was a significant geopolitical motivation behind the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Author Laurent Guyenot takes it further by suggesting that 9/11 was about more than just oil and terrorism, it was a pretext for the American militarization of the planet. David Ray Griffin notes the dramatic change in Presidential rhetoric after the attack: it had become a metaphysical conflict that was "a monumental struggle of Good versus Evil."
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter Levenda argues that 9/11 functions as the sanctioning event for state sponsored paranoia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The citizens are not allowed to become paranoid unless it is at government direction and sanction. Individual cases of paranoia are frowned upon. The state tells us that if we are not paranoid the way it is paranoid--and about the same things--it's because we don't have all the facts...the logical conclusion of all this paranoia is suspicion of the state apparatus itself.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For Levenda and other researchers like S.K. Bain, 9/11 was
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21roh5/911_aleister_crowley_and_nefarious_numerology_was/">
        a ceremonial magical ritual sacrifice of massive scale
       </a>
       , and can be viewed as a grimoire for magical operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In between the extremes of these interpretations--9/11 for oil and 9/11 as ritual magical cosmological struggle of good vs. evil--the attack was also was a financial crime of high order. E.P. Heidner suggests that 9/11 was meant to cover up a vast fraudulent financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       When taken at face value, these theories imply 9/11 was more than a terrorist false-flag op. It was a
       <em>
        multi-layered
       </em>
       op which accomplished several objectives at once by those with detailed inside financial, political and occult knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Third Level
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Webster Griffin Tarpely was among the first to suggest that a possible
       <em>
        third
       </em>
       layer was involved that day, beyond the "rogue element" of the LIHOP and MIHOP scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Tarpley, the MIHOP hypothesis "represents the analytical point of view which sees the events of 9/11 as a deliberate provocation manufactured by an outlaw network of high officials infesting the military and security apparatus of the US and Great Britain, a network ultimately dominated by Wall Street and City of London financiers."
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a natural development of the 9/11 Truth movement, after a few years the LIHOP hypothesis became increasingly at war with masses of evidence, as it simply couldn't address the absence of air defense for one hour and forty-five minutes, nor the incredible destruction of the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the Bush-Cheney MIHOP position is mostly untenable, as although they may have had limited knowledge or even a planning role, they likely weren't involved at the top of even level two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tarpley and others believe 9/11 was a coup d'Ã©tat, a false flag event of state-sponsored synthetic terror designed to unleash the clash of civilizations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The goal was to shock the entire US political system and the public in general out of their inertia of normal everyday life into a kind of war psychosis and paranoid obsession with phantom threats agreeable to the outlook of the neocon faction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Joseph P. Farrell speculates that this third layer is entirely fascist, and international in scope. The well-documented connection of various intelligence agencies (ie the CIA, KGB, GRU) to international criminal undergrounds and their trafficking networks allows agencies a significant source of income free from oversight for covert ops and black projects, and it also provides them with a means of monitoring those criminal organizations and in turn providing them with an independent internationally-extensive source of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       IOW, post-WII, the Fascist and Nazi elites were connected with these underground criminal organizations, and liaised with the similarly-minded rogue elements within various nations' deep states. This certainly included the American financial and business interests that shared the same basic Fascist ideology.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For both parties, this was a post-war marriage of convenience, and from that point of view, 9/11 may have been the announcement of a divorce.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The detailed planning of 9/11 had to have come at some point from within the American national security and military structure (level 2). Tarpley highlights the significant number of wargaming exercises and drills occurring that day and how the cover of these drills provided confusion in the command and control structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global Guardian was one such drill that involved all of America's strategic nuclear and thermonuclear arsenal: ICBMs, SLBMs, nuclear bombers, and the "Doomsday/Night Watch/Looking Glass flying command posts."
      </p>
      <p>
       It also involved airbases that house hydrogen bombs, including Barksdale in Louisiana and Offut in Omaha, Nebraska. As it happens, President Bush flew to
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       bases on 9/11 after leaving Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tarpley notes that on 9/11 at Offut were some interesting characters, including Warren Buffet and General Brent Scowcroft...a potential "Committee of Public Safety". This group converged at the command HQ of US strategic nuclear forces as a potential element of a coup-d'Ã©tat, necessitating that Bush be personally present to reassert control over America's nuclear forces:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thus, on the morning of 9/11, before a single hijacking had been reported, the US had assumed a strategic nuclear posture comparable to that observed during the Cuban missile crisis: B-1 and B-52 bombers were in the air; ballistic missile submarines were at their launch points, presumably near Russia and possibly China, and land-based ICBMs were ready for launch.
       </p>
       <p>
        The air defenses of North America were also on high alert, both in terms of interceptor aircraft and space assets. Everything, in short, was ready for a nuclear first strike like the neocons have talked so much about in recent years. All of this was observed in real time from Moscow by General Leonid Ivashov and his colleagues of the Russian General Staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is highly significant that Bush's 9/11 flight itinerary included both Barksdale and Offut, two US nuclear command centers which were part of Global Guardian. Global Guardian was a massive exercise in nuclear blackmail.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But how does this constitute a coup d'Ã©tat? And why would Bush need to have reasserted control over the nuclear command structure by his personal presence at Barksdale and Offut?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tarpley also describes how the Global Guardian Computer Network Attack exercise that occurred on 9/11 was designed to simulate a cyber attack on STRATCOM's computer network command control structure by using denial of service attacks and other means.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A bad insider could easily have flipped the drill to "live" status by being a plant or mole for "some other organization" and thus missiles might actually have been launched. Here was the invisible government's back door to worldwide thermonuclear escalation, if that had been necessary, on 9/11.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This suggests a three-tiered op, with the deepest layer penetrating the second, and threatening it with blackmail by compromising the command and control structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Tarpley, 9/11 was a coup d'Ã©tat with Global Guardian as its effective instrument of cover, a surrender of the Bush White House to the coup planners that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...owed much to the fear that the coup faction were extremists capable of unleashing nuclear war. Here is a portal through which the rogue network could have launched nuclear missiles without the help of Bush. The targets for such missiles could have been Arab or Islamic capitals, if Bush had refused to initiate the war of civilizations in conventional form by attacking Afghanistan. The target could also have been China or Russia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must never lose sight of the Bush-Putin telephone call on 9/11, which was the central diplomatic and strategic event of the day, even though most 9/11 books do not even mention it. In that telephone call, Bush in effect delivered an ultimatum that the US was determined to seize Afghanistan...plus bases in former Soviet central Asia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Tarpley thinks Putin agreed, partly because he knew the US would fail in Afghanistan, and that such a large effort would ultimately sap America's strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush's own statements, as well as statements from his staff, further suggested a coup attempt by level three against level two on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 12 and 13, Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, indicated that the Secret Service had received credible threats on 9/11 from the attackers, and indicated that the White House and Air Force One were also targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York Times reported them as credible because they had been accompanied by the use of transmission and identification codes unique to the presidency itself. According to researcher Thierry Meyssan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The attackers also had the codes of the DEA, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Air Force Intelligence (AFI), Army Intelligence (AI), Naval Intelligence (NI), the Marine Corps Intelligence (MCI) and the intelligence services of the State Department and the Department of Energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of those codes is known by only a very small group of officials. No one is authorized to possess several of them. Also, to accept that the attackers were in possession of them supposes either that there exists a method of cracking the codes, or that moles have infiltrated each of these intelligence bodies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Technically, it appears to be possible to reconstitute the codes of the American agencies by means of the software, PROMIS, that served to create them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Farrell expands on this narrative:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is crucial to note (and to remember) that some of the codes the attackers allegedly knew were those of the super-secret National Reconnaissance Office, the center coordinating all of America's spy satellites, and the center coordinating their reconnaissance data.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To Meyssan, the use of the codes to establish the attacker's credibility and capability meant that the American state, and more importantly, the highest and deepest levels of its national security and military establishment, was penetrated by traitors and moles.
      </p>
      <p>
       By calling the White House they were blackmailing the US government, and access to those codes could help them usurp the authority of the POTUS, and conceivably flip the Global Guardian drill to live status.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The only means allowing Bush to retain control of the military was to
        <em>
         physically
        </em>
        hold the HQ of the US Strategic Command, at Offut, and to personally issue orders and counter-orders from there.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After reading My Pet Goat in Sarasota, Florida, Bush made this statement: "This is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks...two airplanes have crashed into the WTC in an apparent terrorist attack on our country."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tarpley observes that the crucial remark is the reference to an "apparent" terrorist attack. Also of note is that Bush explicitly stated he would be returning to Washington after his remarks. At some point after this statement, the threat became clearer and he was diverted to Barksdale and then Offut. The Secret Service learned of a threat against Air Force One after leaving the school, suggesting the use of classified presidential codes to convey this threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, at around 9:42 AM, ABC broadcast "live images of a fire that had broken out in the White House annex, the Old Executive Office Building, home to a number of key offices of the executive, including that of the VP."
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Meyssan, "no information has ever leaked out concerning the origin of the blaze, or its exact scale" as ABC had merely showed "a fixed shot of plumes of black smoke escaping the building."
      </p>
      <p>
       Approximately 15 minutes later, Cheney was taken by the Secret Service and escorted to the White House situation room, while sharpshooters "armed with rocket launchers" were deployed around the now evacuated White House complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Meyssan, these troops were "capable of repelling an assault by airborne troops. In short, they were facing a threat of a very different nature to that later described by Vice President Cheney."
      </p>
      <p>
       Farrell extrapolates further: "At that moment, the threat was not terrorism; it was something else entirely."
      </p>
      <p>
       When Air Force One landed at Barksdale, Bush made another statement before proceeding to Offut. In addition to attempting to reassure the American people, Bush notably stated:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government...The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake: we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meyssan, Tarpley and Farrell all agree that it's very notable that "there is not a single mention of terrorism in this speech, but only of a "test," and Bush's words could therefore just as easily refer to an internal revolt, coup, or military conflict, as to terrorism. Similarly, a terror threat, no matter how big or dire, is unlikely to provoke the statement that indicates Continuity of Government operations were begun."
      </p>
      <p>
       Meyssan continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In such a context, one can interpret in two different ways the activation of the Continuity of Government (CoG) procedure. The simplest explanation is to consider the need to protect the President and other political leaders from the actions of traitors capable of starting a fire in the Old Executive Building and stealing the secret codes of both the Presidency and the intelligence agencies. One might also consider whether, on the contrary, the CoG plan was put into effect not to protect political leaders from traitors, but was initiated by the traitors themselves to isolate those leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The account given by Vice President Dick Cheney is truly strange. He claims that men from the Secret Service seized him in his office and bundled him into the White House bunker without receiving his consent. He appeared to suggest that the same was true for the principal members of the government and Congress. And what else is an operation where the secret services take elected officials and put them in bunkers "for their own security", if not a coup d'Ã©tat, or at least a palace coup?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Farrell speculates that the government in Washington had been seized by the coup, placing its key members under "protection," leaving the President to attempt to reassert control over the strategic command structure of the military by his personal presence at its headquarters, forestalling a potential nuclear conflict, by surrendering to the demands of the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the scenario where Bush and Cheney and other elements of the government knew about 9/11, and even helped plan aspects of it, the third level now starts to reveal itself, for "Bush and the federal government are then reacting to an operation they know has gone wrong, and that has been penetrated or coopted by someone else."
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months later, Bush possibly alluded to these others "players" in his famous "axis of evil" State of the Union address. The fascist connotations of that phrase should not be overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example of this rhetoric, noted by researcher Daniel Hopsicker, was when British PM Tony Blair referred to Al Qaeda as a "terrorist organization with ties to a global network."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That made sense. The idea that Mohamed Atta and his henchmen needed help from an international organization while they were in the US was easy to understand. But what
        <em>
         kind
        </em>
        of global network. Blair didn't say. Blair's "global network" remained elusive, unnamed, shadowy, and undefined. Several weeks later the FBI denied that this global network existed, and proposed instead a "lone Cadre Theory" which became the operative assumption in their investigation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Farrell, who has extensively researched the "Fascist International" and the assimilation of the post-war Nazi and Fascist ideologies into the Western intelligence apparatus, and who also believes that some form of exotic energy was used to destroy the towers, wrote the following in a 2008 letter to researcher Richard Hoagland:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So we are left with some version of the Nazi International extra-territorial state with an all but proven track record of the postwar investigation of precisely the technologies to bring down the Towers. This rationalizes the rather odd signs of "panic" that "our" elite has shown since 9/11, for consider the almost frenzied rush into Afghanistan and Iraq (whose ultimate purpose involved much more than oil).
       </p>
       <p>
        Realizing that they were faced with an extra-territorial state with possession of extraordinarily sophisticated "scalar-torsion" technology that had been successfully weaponized, they launched a 'war on terror' with radical Islam as the fall guy, when in fact, the real target is something completely different and much more frightening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The behavior of the financial elite during the bailout crisis is another signal that someone has the gun to their heads; they acted like people being blackmailed by some hidden "protection racket" by insisting on "no oversight" back in 2008. The only people in the historical record that wielded such financial and technological clout that I can think of were the postwar Nazis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Farrell highlights the strange similarities between this perceived reality and the James Bond film "You Only Live Twice," which shouldn't be dismissed entirely as fiction as it's a fairly prevalent theory that Ian Fleming was "leaking" information under the guise of fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that film, we find:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         An international conspiracy that is extra-territorial, called SPECTRE
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A network with a secret space program which it uses to interfere with Russian and American space launches and to bring the two nations to the brink of war
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A society with a heavy presence of Japanese criminal underground
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The society is headed by an obviously German fellow (played by an actor who Farrell notes is "almost Martin Bormann-esque in appearance")
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Farrell continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So my "op within an op within an op" scenario is basically that someone, with probably access to hidden space technologies, and with all but certain access to weaponized versions of "scalar-torsion technologies," brought the Twin Towers down.
       </p>
       <p>
        That "someone" is some sort of rogue extra-territorial organization, with deep and historical connections to the radical Islamic underworld. The message was sent: "we know your game...we can literally turn your centers and instrumentalities of power to dust before your very eyes. We are deeply penetrated into your own covert agencies and plans, and the game is now afoot."
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider also the Masonic symbolism of what was struck in that way: the Twin Towers, the twin Masonic pillars of Jachin and Boaz, sitting in the heart of the Anglo-American elite's financial district...The Muslims do not have access to such technologies, whereas the Nazis were investigating them with a vengeance since at least 1933!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This Fascist International had deep post-war ties with rogue elements of the similarly fascist mindset in the American financial and intelligence Deep State, a group initially represented by Allen and John Foster Dulles, John McCloy, and others of the "Sullivan and Cromwell crowd."
      </p>
      <p>
       Although many 9/11 researchers tend to dismiss or at least avoid these possibilities and discussions, others have no hesitation in describing Tony Blair's "global network" as a Fascist network, centered in London and New York.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is therefore not a great leap of the imagination to state that this network also has centers in Frankfurt, and that some of its historical and technological roots lie in Nazism. This third layer exposes itself in a variety of clues, not the least of which are those clues which suggest exotic modalities of the Twin Towers' destruction, be that "nano-thermite," "mini-nukes," or exotic "energy weapons."
       </p>
       <p>
        Viewed in this way, such an approach to 9/11 is an attempt to view the event from the perspective of Richard Dolan's idea of a "breakaway civilization" that secretly emerged over the decades since WWII, a civilization that emerged because of its decades' long access to secret funds, a great deal of which came from the exploitation of Axis loot, and that emerged because of its use of that vast war chest to fund the secret development of various exotic technologies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such an approach is not meant to delegitimize the efforts of those 9/11 researchers who stick to "nuts and bolts" and who do not consciously attempt to integrate their speculations about the architecture of the conspiracy into such a wide historical and interpretive context.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is perhaps time to reconsider these clues within a much larger technological and historical context, for that context leads us to UFOs, to the black projects world, to the national security structure and Mr. Dolan's breakaway civilization hypothesis, and to that post-war extra-territorial Nazi organization, with its own deep ties to the criminal underworld, drug trafficking, and, of course, to Islamic radicalism and terrorism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like all Mafias, it has its factions, and like all Mafias, its alliances are always and only of convenience. It can does go to war with itself.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Farrell and others have consistently argued that the goals of this post-war Fascist International was to destabilize Anglo-American petroleum interests in the Middle East, and that the war on terror might be a convenient front for a war against this Fascist International, "connected as it was and is to Islamic terrorist groups."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time for the interpretive net to be cast much wider, as the Fascist devil is in the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the high financial weirdness surrounding 9/11, PROMIS, and the mechanism of the murder weapon itself, stay tuned...

       No need to connect the dots between the Eastern European Zionists who infiltrated the highest levels of US military intelligence after the fall of the Iron Curtain, Rothschild sponsorship of Communism, and the treason of 9/11!  Just say they were "ultimately controlled" by "London financiers," instead!  The goy will never figure it out!

       Bonus points for the "secret fascists" narrative as well, comrade!  Hitler is probably still alive, hiding in some "axis of evil" country!  Which one will we go after, next?  Many mitzvahs for you today!  Next year, in Jerusalem!

       This is just an overview...elements of the Mossad almost certainly were involved, but to claim that Israel alone is at the top of Level 3 is simply not feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fascist International most definitely contains a powerful Zionist contingent, but to dismiss this analysis outright because there's no mention of Israel is foolish at best.

       It's fascinating to think what might have brought down the towers, but that doesn't really matter to me. We should be interrogating the people who know more than they're telling us.

       Dick Cheney has some answers. He is answer guy #1. Had his hands in all kinds of funny business over the years you might not realize:

       But when will our police/politicians yank his ass outta bed and force a confession, whatever that may be? Never.
      </p>
      <p>
       These "post-war Nazis" and mafia you speak of...sounds like the Khazarian Mafia. Some say Rothschilds have ties to the Khazarians. Legend has it that they love making America and Russia fight against each other. That seems to be happening right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also interesting that Hitler thought the Jews had a conspiracy to control the world and they would stab his country in the back. This conspiracy is similar what you're alleging with the third tier.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to pin it down based on what I know:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Khazarian Mafia made it happen, these guys are tied to Rothschild and Israel / Mossad (see disclosure by Gordon Duff)
       </li>
       <li>
        Pentagon (co-opted by Mossad and enamored by PNAC) let it happen
       </li>
       <li>
        Neocons covered it up and ran lucrative ventures in the middle east with assistance from Israel / Mossad (Halliburton, Genie Energy, both tied to Dick Cheney)
       </li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Khazarian king was given a choice between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The Khazarian king chose Judaism, and promised to stay within the requirements laid out by the surrounding confederacy of nations led by the Russian czar. Despite his agreement and promise, the Khazarian king and his inner circle of oligarchs kept practicing ancient Babylonian black-magic, also known as Secret Satanism. This Secret Satanism involved occult ceremonies featuring child sacrifice, after âbleeding them outâ, drinking their blood and eating their hearts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds mythical doesn't it? Remember when that Twitter user 0Hour found tons of underage nude boys from the middle east on Twitter? Not mythical. Or the Hillary Clinton email leaks saying she owes "penance" to Rothschild. Not payment, not dinner, not favors, but penance. And another email referring to sacrificing a chicken to Moloch... Moloch is the Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice, as explained above in relation to the Khazarians. The Khazarians were known as masters of disguise, where they would kill their victim and assume their identity. A metaphor for that would be shape shifting reptilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look into Oppenheimer (nuclear bomb physicist) you'll note his parents were Ashkenazi Jews. These people were located near the Rhine River in Germany. Now if you look into Amschel Rothschild, he too was from this same region near Frankfurt Germany. There is an unproven/debunked theory that Ashkenazi lineage can be traced to Khazaria. I thought the connections between WWII, Hitler, the atomic bomb, Rothschild, Khazarians and Ashkenazi Jews was interesting, but I'm losing focus on where to go with this research so I'll stop here for now.

       Yep.  I agree with most of that.  The child sacrifice thing is primarily about killing the first born.  There's a direct philosophical connection to Communism and to the black nobility, who got their start when the Egyptian mystery schools were absorbed into Roman society.

       May I ask you, why do you believe any of this? Do you have sources which you deem reputable or trustworthy? Did you see a documentary somewhere that convinced you of these things? You seem

       If you're asking me where the source is, then yes, there was a documentary (of sorts) created on that subject.

       But once you 1) know how to think, 2) have a basis in political economy and 3) understand the purpose of religion, the world is not that difficult to figure out.  Most people never make it past step one.

       I get why sources are important but doing research and being able to grasp the big picture is very important. After passionately following politics for years I got to the point where I could sniff out political bologna in a heartbeat. It took a long time but no "source" is gonna tell you the secrets and underworkings of the world.

       Great post, but without the why some parts leave me thinking the analysis is incomplete. In my analysis if you substitute the fascist group OP speaks of with rothschild bankers, then you have a legit why.

       Well, it's all self fulfilling prophecies in the making - basically making happen what's been "foretold" in their books and the end game is setting up a satanic Messiah on the world throne. That's where this centuries long game is going. The worst thing is that they truly believe in what they're doing. "For they do not know what they are doing". I don't think though that there's can be any forgiveness.

       But all that's happened has already happened. The timing, co-incidences, and numerical patterns throughout all of these major conspiratorial events---9/11, JFK, Lincoln, Moon Landing, Boston Bombing, and so on---are too perfect for this conspiracy (or whatever it is) to be a linear conspiracy.

       I've just come to this conclusion after a lot of reading--Peter Levenda's "Sinister Forces"; Michael Hoffman's books; the Bible and other religious works; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things fall into place too neatly. The numbers and dates seem designed, again and again. Time is pretty obviously a construct, one that traps material beings like us, but there are dimensions beyond it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't put a finger on it, nor grab it with my hands. But it all fits too neatly, right down the predictions of how this is all going to end. So it's all a grand experiment, "good" vs. "evil," and we are the test subjects, in a way. Yet it's not exactly that, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever read Alan Moore's "Watchmen," one of the chapters almost touches on it, too. There's a pattern, a "clockwork," and we're all part of it, waiting for the final alarm to go off.

       Other dimensions or a simulation, something outside our grasp is at work, all of us know this, as in all humans, most just choose to ignore it, because it can lead to terror and panic when you get too deep in trying to wrap your head around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I did DMT for the first time I spent a few days freaking out about how disconnected I felt from this reality. There are other planes of consciousness all around us we can't access.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in some type of planned experiment, perhaps our own experiment if you believe the one consciousness theory that fractures itself to experience itself. Or perhaps we are in a simulation, things might change constantly (updates) and we would never really know, even though we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less likely is God and a Devil or Good and Evil playing out some type of chess game, that is too simplistic and the concept of good and evil are meaningless when time and space and dimensions are infinite and nothing can be created or destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something more complex is at work, what that is, we will never know while in this consciousness, perhaps all is revealed when we walk through the next door, or perhaps we go through infinite doors and never truly understand where or why we are.

       My best guess would be David Mayer de Rothschild then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rothschild? Check. Kept his name clean? Check. People love him? Check. All about peace and love? Check. Loves "mother nature"? Check. Charity? Check. Down to earth hippie type? Check. Looks like freaking graven image "Jesus"? Check.

       He also fits a lot of the descriptions of the "Maitreya" as told by Benjamin Creme - which is no doubt what people will call the false messiah when he comes on the scene.

       He grew up in London. His main purposes lately have been in environmentalism and climate science.

       Oh yeah? why's that? do you think that testifying under oath stops people from lying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Two options for getting the truth out of someone like that:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They choose to to tell you
       </li>
       <li>
        Torture it out of them
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Option one is the only reliable one, even torture won't get the truth a lot of the time, and the smartest people and psychopaths will just tell you something to make you think you got what you wanted, and can be a complete fabrication to protect the truth.

       The argumentative tone of your comment is indicative of why the 9/11 truth movement is so fragmented. Everyone is jaded and everyone wants to be right.

       No, obviously they wouldn't tell the truth even under oath. But I'd enjoy watching them fucking squirm in that chair on cable tv, and it would bring to public attention the fact that they never testified in the first place.

        Dr. Hubertus Strughold, who played an important role in space medicine by developing space suits and other life-support systems. In June 1948, he put a rhesus monkey named Albert in the pressurized nosecone of a V-2 rocket in a pressurized nose cone, the first step in the effort to send humans to space.

       <p>
        General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Nazi intelligence operations against the Soviets, was hired by the US Army and later by the CIA to operate 600 ex-Nazi agents in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany. In 1948, CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter assumed control of the so-called Gehlen Organization.

       <p>
        German biologist Dr. Kurt Blome was hired to develop offensive and defensive capabilities to counter Soviet biological warfare activities.

       There is always an outward given and inward given reason for many historical movements. Some may have seen it as genocide in pursuit of raising the Aryans up, others saw it as a way to bridge the gap between man and God and create the superhuman being. You can't look at stuff like this through the lenses of mainstream history, mainstream history is rife with errors of omission.

       This isn't about socialism, never has been. This is about bringing about the holy babylonian/pagan trinity but making man into God. Making man immortal. Merging man and machine. It's coming...

       ok.. there is no such thing as a metaphorical nazi..  that's why calling trump supporters nazis made no sense...Is trump a Fascists like hitler?  If he is, is he more of a fascist than Hillary is/was?   I don't think so..
      </p>
      <p>
       So what makes OPs  shadowy international group 'nazis' and not 'fascists' or 'communists'?   Couldn't one make the argument that international group OP Referenced is more acturatly described as 'communists'??  Like the Russian communist revolution of the 'Bolsheviks', it's more likely that the 'communists' took over America than the Nazi's.  I know connections to both can be made (Bushs) but calling the shadow government 'nazis instead of 'fascists' seems like a 'communist' trick to me.

       It is indeed a rhetorical device or trick, albeit used without intent to do so, the word Nazi simply doesn't stand for what it once did, but I see your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would point out though that these shadowy types are no more Nazi's than they are Communists or Jews or Christians or Satanists. They are human beings (for now) working on the ultimate human being, speaking strictly for the scientific militaristic side of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       We probably should drop the labels, discard the semantics and call a spade a spade. Aside from all the brilliant technological breakthroughs, the aims have long been to merge man and machine and to attempt to make man immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than Republican or Democrat, Communists or National Socialists, it's about bringing about a Technocracy but truly in reality the modern world lives in a Kakistocracy.

       not nazi scientists. which to me is a difference.

       OP have you read any Peter Dale Scott? The American Deep State: Big Money, Big Oil, and the Struggle for U.S. Democracy? Or his books on 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't read the works you cited, but a few sections of your analysis you might change, the coup you speak of was the continuance of government plan going into action, many nefarious mechanisms that put power into dark closed circles started when that plan was implement. I like the idea of a second coup going on also; if that was the case i think rothschild banker satanists would be the ones doing it, the fascist group title is misleading, the rothschilds no doubt have connections to those post WWII elements though but they have more sinister motivations than fascism.

       That was an interesting wiki read. So basically it was legislature that finally, for once, looked after comman man. Quit taxing and working us to death while repealing our healthcare and benefits. The good aliens wanted it to help us and the reptilians are trying to keep us enslaved. Is that the gist of it? The wiki page went into some pretty out there theories.

       You claim some invisible hand as a 3rd layer in the 11/9 conspiracy forced the hands of the USA to go to Afghanistan and Iraq but what difference does this make as both were planned long before 11/9  by the US government.

       Who are the first, the 2nd layer here in your picture and what different motivation should they have had to execute it?

       Why should a global group show their invisible hand if their motives aligned with the US government itself under Bush/Cheney/Israel/GB to invade the middle east + Afghanistan?

       The difference is that the American public would have been loath to support such a disastrous venture without some sort of galvanizing catastrophe.

       Here's a fairly gross oversimplification of the identities of these layers:
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 1: Islamic fundamentalist patsies
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 2: Rogue elements of the American military/intelligence agencies
      </p>
      <p>
       Level 3: ? Breakaway civilization/Deep State/international fascists
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if their motives aligned with the US government
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's possible that their motives began part ways, as "9/11 was the announcement of a divorce" between these factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are outgrowing their need for the US government/military industrial complex, and 9/11 was essentially a debut of a high technology that was meant cause shock and awe in anyone who was paying attention.

       Thank you for this write up, definitely some stuff to chew on.  Some of my thoughts lean towards conspiracy fan-fic, but they're just thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       -This theory would help make sense of how flimsy (imo) the Al-Queda bogeyman was.  See James Corbett's "9/11: A Conspiracy Theory" where he completely shreds the official narrative.) Maybe the coup
       <em>
        ers
       </em>
       needed a cover story for the coup, they forced the coup
       <em>
        ees
       </em>
       to put one out through their media apparatus, and the rush to blame radical Islam left a lot of loose ends. 
-Could explain what Bush and Cheney testify about, and the manner in which they do. If we wanted to view them as sympathetic patsies (we don't, but as a thought experiment) they could be two actual patriots surrounded by wolves. Here they are, a beautiful Tuesday morning overseeing (or probably not even aware of) a run-of-the-mill preparedness drill, and all of a sudden the drill goes live and they have a nazi-NWO coup-de-tat on their hands. George's head was for sure spinning, and those staff photographer pictures of Cheney in the situation room could be viewed differently through this prism
-the coup was probably successful. Maybe more trauma was planned for the day. GWB was checkmated and surrendered. Could look into stuff about the plans to close down the bridges to NYC, Gotham Shield plans or whatever they called it then, the actual reasons(?) for the Shanksville fuckery, the fire in the White House (that was new to me from this OP), and other weird red herrings from that day to start tugging on that thread. Or maybe they "had" "the nukes".

       )would be proud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: This theory can explain nagging questions re: 9/11. GWB/Cheney may have been blindsided "patriots".

       While I appreciate the thought experiment, Cheney had ties to Halliburton prior to becoming VP. He is just another person that went through the revolving door between the military industrial complex and politics.

       Zionists, neocons, fascist corrupt government officials. No aliens, no savant Muslim pilots, no magic passport ..just the most disgusting and traitorous act that most of us will ever see, hopefully.  Blaming aliens is only going to make things worse.

       Here's the general concept:
      </p>
      <p>
       Layer 1 - The public NWO type freaks we all know well of and all their henchmen. This layer follows the orders and profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Layer 2 - The Deep State and various secret cults and factions. We know a little about these dudes. This layers gives the orders and manages the agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Layer 3 - The Breakaway Civilization. This layer was completely unknown to layer 1 and almost completely unknown to layer 2 except for like the family and faction heads. This layer has enough tech to travel and colonize some space. They also deal in off world commerce and shit with aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "why" is difficult to address, but layer 3 used 9/11 to sort of announce their existence to the other layers.

       you say they have Nazi connections.

       I spent considerable more time gathering this information than editing it to make it readable, so your observations are definitely warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to make too many excuses or anything, but it does come down to time...with real life stuff I barely can fit in my moderating duties these days, so researching and writing original content is largely a pipe dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could use a lot of editing work, but tbh I just wanted to get it all out there and start a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be different if this was my job...but it's just a hobby (although one I'm very passionate about).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, hopefully you can look beyond the excess verbosity and pontificating and get inspired by the meat of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers :)

       How about....they made it happen and it was planned decades ago.  They made it happen in such a way that it WOULD be exposed at a future date to show the full extent of the corruption so as to cause a revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about WTC7...its so blatent.  Jist deny it for 20 years and call out people who can see / not blinded / awake - but these ex-sheep spread the truth, even occasionally they would put some of these theories in documentaries and debunk it in such a way that only a few sheep will see.

       I believe we are close to the time of 9/11 truth with Donald Trump (part of the same game BTW, "leader" of the opposition) and the west are due to be told some big things.

       Great post. I hope we learn the truth someday. It's like when you lose your keys and after giving up you just need to know where they were, not necessarily because you want your keys back but you just want to know how close you were to finding them.

       Didn't read the OP, just came to say that it's crazy that so many people can be red pilled on the US and Saudi involvement in 9/11 (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4t3ppx/declassified_911_pages_show_ties_to_former_saudi/">

       ) but in every reddit thread be completely hostile towards those who believe in the conspiracy that the US was clearly involved. Especially when the attack justified the US government to infringe on citizens rights and to start an unjust war that profiteers have been making insane money on ever since.

       I like this post. I don't get a whole lot of new data, but it's a good packaging of what we do know, down here in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that 9-11 simply does not make sense without what I would call a "meta-frame". I think this post attempts to give a meta-frame to the story, and as I said, it's pretty good. People have complained it is long-winded, but I can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an alternative (not necessarily incompatible) meta-frame I want to pose as an initial alternative to the one the op gives us, what he calls a "third level breakaway civilization".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another 9-11 meta-frame that I have pondered is the one that concentrated on the crucial fact that Japanese soldiers systematically looted a vast amount of wealth from China and southeast Asia, which unsurprisingly was never returned to its owners. Supposedly it was buried in the Philippines, where it was found by the intelligence agencies of the US Pacific armed forces, who saw the potential for a cosmic-level slush fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chinese billions, which had to be laundered carefully through banks such as BCCI and perhaps in strange "bearer bonds", would eventually "buy out" the economically destabilized USSR from under Yeltsin, collapsing the tottering superpower in on itself. People called it "the end of history" - remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the kicker came when all that money had to be cleared: so 9-11 melts the vaults under the WTC towers that were full of paperwork and bullion - and that's the main goal; wars of aggression in the middle east are just side-effects. The whole thing is a dirty fortune reconciliation transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's a meta-frame that basically relies on believable history (Japanese treasure and the eventual fall of communism) combined with a believable motive (American patriotism according to Skull &amp; Bones, plus greed, plus power).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another meta-frame has already been given us, as the top reply to the post: that the "Khazarian mafia" which is a precious way of saying the international Jewish financial cabal, gave us 9-11 as a complex, long-duration, multi-phase solution to Israel's precarious existence surrounded by muslim populations who do not like them much. I will not review this one, except to say I don't find it convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So back to the "third level breakaway civilization". (I had to write down the most convincing alternative meta-story I have encountered so far, in order to compare it to the information in the post we have here.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing so far accounts for the physics of the destruction on 9-11. It seems certain to me that out of all the thousands of bona fide scientists and engineers who have tried, they still don't have a believable smoking gun as to what went off. I'm ready to believe science fiction alien level capacities, and that quickly leads to the notion that the destruction was some kind of warning shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now let's consider what elements make up a good warning shot. First, you have to have two parties, a warner and a warnee. They need to be in some kind of tentative stand-off. There needs to be witnesses, so the warnee can't just deny the warning happened. The warner needs some reason to not just wipe out the warnee. To be really clear, the warner needs to tell the warnee "in advance" what the warner is going to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's compare this to a well-known case: Truman's dropping two atom bombs on Japan as a warning to Soviet Russia, which was at that time taking over Manchuria and Korea. He did not want to just use the bomb to militarily attack the USSR, he didn't have enough bombs and he was politically stuck. He wanted the USSR, and the rest of the world, to understand who was in charge. I don't know if Stalin was warned about the "demonstration" strikes. But those attacks certainly did the job, and anything less would have carried much less weight. In this view, Japan was unlucky, not criminally victimized. At the time there was the chance of an immediate war over Japan itself against the Red Army, which was delayed by Truman's warning shot. In some sense, the Japanese benefited (from the capitalist point of view of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are dealing with a warning in the case of 9-11, what can we assume?  The warner in this case possesses destructive abilities not yet well known to the warnee. There were countless witnesses to the warning, but most are asleep and the rest of us still perplexed as to the meaning, much less the method. But the meaning could not have been lost to the warnees, or else it wasn't an effective warning. If we accept the warning hypothesis, we must insist that the warnee is capable of receiving the warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current post postulates a "third level" consisting of a "breakaway civilization" to explain who the warning was from, and who it was aimed at. The warning was from the third level (space fascists) and addressed to the second level (neo-cons). It has been referenced ad nauseum that the PNAC crowd actually craved such an excuse to flex US military muscle in the middle east sector. Did they collude to mount a fairly straight airplane-into-building attack - one that they did not imagine would result in total vaporization of the buildings? Did they get a huge surprise when disintegration happened, and then have to quickly re-align their planning to take into account that some greater armed entity had hijacked their hijacking as the perfect time to fire a warning shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an intriguing starting point. I am not convinced of the outline provided of a secret Nazi off-planet base where directed energy weapons are commonplace. The evidence for an existent space force is tenuous, and if it exists, it probably is under the control of a top secret branch of the US Air Force, and actively coordinating with the UN to reduce the risk of an inter-human space war, as is done with international space missions like the ISS, as well as in Antartica. This would be the obvious pattern for current earth politics to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only return to the very far-out suggestion that 9-11 may have been a calculated warning shot by an alien race, the details of which we may not know to any reliable extent, meant to inform the leaders of earth that whatever games the neo-conservatives of the USA, or neo-communists of China, or the neo-czarists of Russia try to play, they will be effectively over-ruled and disintegrated by a more advanced military power, if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under such an assumption, we would guess that whatever the US neo-cons planned for 9-11 to accomplish, they were put on notice that their freedom was limited. If they proceeded with their plan for military intervention in the middle east (2001-2017), and it is apparent that they did, that fact must imply they either ignored the warning, or the warner did not prohibit that particular part of the plan to go forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this warning/warnee dynamic is indeed the case, we might attempt to expand our "search radius" for events of great impact that could be similar warnings of a different nature. Some incidents that could have similar connections to a sort of "Big Daddy" alien entity making some point: Chenobyl, Fukushima, Earthquakes and floods in China, the great Tsunami, and various climatic disturbances might fit the warning scenario imagined herein. We can imagine many more possibilities (Crop Circles, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the most difficult stage of unraveling the warner/warnee model might be identifying who exactly is being warned? Clearly the vast majority of the human population has no chance to participate realistically in such a chess-move situation. If humanity found out, they would only react, most likely in an emotional rather than a rational mode. Yet it seems highly unlikely that a "cabal" of top level powerful personages, such as the proposed "second level" MIC members, or like the mythical MJ-12, who knew with some certainty what the warnings mean, would be able to keep that knowledge secret from intelligent public inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in conclusion, I think the proposed solution for the 9-11 anomaly considered in this post is unlikely, flawed, or still too difficult to interpret to be accepted on face value. Additional subtle thinking still needed.

       actually happened on 9/11 seems to come from Dimitri Khalezov. Talks about what hit the towers, pentagon, and most importantly how the towers and building 7 fell in his nearly 1000 page pdf. Feel free to ask me any questions if you want the tl:dr. As with any of these conspiracies it's impossible to be 100% sure, but this has hit closest to home for me.

       just a few thoughts (if i repeat any of your points, i apologize, i got half way through, but i didn't want to lose my train of thought).
      </p>
      <p>
       i've never understood the explanation that 9/11 was about justifying eternal war. i'm 45, i have never lived at a time when we were not at war or proxy war. vietnam ended the year i was born, but violent interventionism didn't end. we invaded panama and grenada ffs. things like iran-contra weren't scandalist because we were "assissting," but because of how we were funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       before vietnam was the forgotten war, korea, before WW1 was the spanish american war, before that was the war with mexico, before that was the civil war, before that was the revolutionary war, and before and during all wars until the 1890s was the 400 year long war with native americans...and the american populace either cheered or shrugged, but regardless, it always denigrated and ruined those who are against the wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       we had been killing iraqis since the late 1980s. sanctions don't seem like war, but other than preserving the architecture they are just as lethal. nobody cared about what we were doing to iraq in the 1990s, certainly not st. bernard. all that would have been needed to send in troos was to announce that saddam was back at it and we had to return, which is exactly what we did. as for afghanistan, they could have done that without even bothering to inform the public--we've been fucking around in afghanistan since russia invaded it. nobody batted an eye. it's just like with syria and libia, all they have to do is make somes shit up, it doesn't even have to have anything to do with us, nobody cares...unless you challenge it.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 wasn't needed. it would only have been needed if they had planned to reinstitute the draft and officially declare war, and that was never going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       almost everything this country does is to help some rich person or other. we even entered WW1 because j p morgan insisted on it due to the outrageous war debt owed him by britain and france.

       the towers had been an albatross for the port authority since the 1990s. it wanted them gone. along comes silverstein who buys them, even though they are basically worthless, despite their prime location. two months latter they collapse, along with his 3rd building, wtc7. he collects $4.55 billion for his poor investment decision. the only buildings that collapse are his.
      </p>
      <p>
       as my insurance law prof said when i was a 2L, discussing a case just a few days after 9/11 in one of those odd innocent coincidences--"when someone takes out on an insurance policy on monday, a fire burns down the house on tuesday, and the claim is submitted on wednesday, they need god as a witness to collect." given his since of humor, if he'd been asked, "what about if they had 3 houses on one street and all 3 of their houses burned down on the same day, but no others on the street did?"his answer would probably have been, "then not even god can help them."
      </p>
      <p>
       our govt almost certainly played a part, at least a portion of it, because silverstein couldn't pull it off without the planes, which in insurance lingo qualified as "acts of god." he probably went through isreali back channels, if he didn't have a direct contact. opportunities for "terrorism" are never passed up by our govt. never have been, never will be, unless we throw off the yoke of representative republican "democracy" go to direct democracy.

       i always thought that the cheney-rumsfeld-wolfolwitz goal was AMUF and putting the imperial presidency that had begun under wilson on steroids. i now think it was all based on getting back on track with their original insane obession that we could win a first strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       NATO was moribund and obsolete by 9/11, but 9/11 was used as motivation and justification to bring it back to full strength based on terrorism. NATO only existed as a nuclear death pact to ring and destroy the USSR. it is wholly unsuited to dealing with a bunch of fanatical box cutter wielding assholes on 747s. now NATO is back with a vengence and has returned its eye of sauron back on its old adversary, russia...except russia is a capitalist country...so...
      </p>
      <p>
       this also explains rice--she wasn't a ME expert, she was a russia expert. rabid cold warriors always played the long game.
      </p>
      <p>
       regarding the idea for the "planes into towers," i think it was inspired by the lone gunmen episode, rather than the episode being predictive programming. as a general principal, when something appears to predict something else, more often than not, the thing "predicted" was really "inspired by." they watch all the same shows we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think bush knew anything about it befor it happened. i think cheney had shuttled him off to FL keep him from mucking it up, not as cover. i think the port authority likely had some idea silverstein was somehow going to miracuously solve the tower conundrum but their cognitive dissonance and suppressed guilt convinced them it was just a horrible coincidence. i think guiliani knew the buildings were going to be hit, but not brought down. i think the delay in the collapse of the 1st one was to allow those in the know with some shred of a conscience to convince themselves they'd given people plenty of time to evacuate.
      </p>
      <p>
       soon hundreds of everyday new yorkers and new jersians are going to stsrt coming down with emphysema and mesothelioma every year. many are going to be millenials. that this is from the asbestos from the towers is going to be clear. unlike with the 1st responders, who can't escape the "too bad so sad, what are you going to do, it was terrorists," civikian class action lawsuits against the port authority and silverstein for not having removed the asbestos are going to flood NY state courts and the fed court for the southern district of NY. when this happens 9/11 will cease to be about terrorists and become about asbestos. when that happens, truthers may finally be vindicated, but not if they focus on occultism etc. youbget silverstein, you likely get the demo contracter, who was either with our govt or isreal's. you may never get proof of govt lihop/mihop, but at least it will be exposed as a fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw, i assumed it was a false flag (technically perfidy) as soon as it happened and before i knew anything about it other than it had happened because the date was too cute by half, and something only an american would get: 9-1-1. even my mom thought it was fishy because of the date.

       any discussion of 9-11 without israel is a psyop by israel
      </p>
      <p>
       pretty sure you can just get 20 grand to write a 911 history if it doesn't mention israel, even if you say it was perpetrated by sesame street characters
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the mossad controls saudi arabia and egypt, and allied with cheney/neocons to commit 911 with varying degrees of complicity and foreknowledge, but still sleight by comparison, by actual traitorous americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       it appears to me that during the course of the mornings operations, something freaked them out though and made them make mistakes.

       This definitely gets one thinking in regards to the existence of a 'Breakaway Civilization.' What I always found strange is that John Podesta assisted with an FOIA request in 2002 regarding the 1965 UFO crash in Kecksburg.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       âI worked with her and filed an FOIA case on it,â Podesta said, adding, âThe files had disappeared but it was clear thereâd been some investigation by the Air Force.â Podesta claimed that he helped Clinton file a FOIA request for documents related to a possible UFO incident. (article in 2016)

      </p>
      <p>
       The chief of staff of Bill Clinton, Podesta, with all the political clout and power he wields, is unable to get this information. Records were missing after years working on the FOIA request. When looking at the Wikileaks emails released in 2016 he mentions UFOs as well as zero-point energy.

Some say that what is now referred to the EPA and FEMA (part of the executive branch of the president for some reason), recovered the remnants of the crash. Hence, my username, Mount Weather. "The facility is a major relocation site for the highest level of civilian and military officials in case of national disaster, playing a major role in continuity of government (per the U.S. Continuity of Operations Plan)."

       Something I never see anyone mention when talking about 9/11 is the military logistics company
       <strong>
        SAIC
       </strong>
       (Science Applications International Corporation) They had their paws all over 9/11. They worked with national security to prevent terrorism, they were the first to investigate the scene of 9/11, and they stood to profit from the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a great article about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quotes from that page:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        With regard to 9/11, SAICâs impact cannot be overstated as the company:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          Created the national databases that tracked and identified terrorists
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Supplied U.S. airports with terrorism screening equipment
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Predicted and investigated terrorist attacks against U.S. infrastructure including national defense networks and the World Trade Center (WTC)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Helped create the official account for what happened at the WTC both in 1993 and after 9/11
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Was a leader in research on thermitic materials like those found in the WTC dust[2]
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Employed the leader of the robotics team that scoured the pile at Ground Zero, using equipment capable of eliminating explosives
Provided the information to capture the alleged mastermind of the attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM)
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        It turns out that SAIC was one of the first organizations to show up at Ground Zero. The company claimed in its 2004 shareholder report that â âFollowing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, we responded rapidly to assist a number of customers near ground zero in New York City and in Washington, D.C.â
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They were also the very company that provided the supposed "evidence" that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction instigating the war in Iraq, which they profited from.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and that war was the only way to get rid of them.â[28] The company helped supply the faulty intelligence that said Saddam had WMDs and then profited from the invasion by generating Iraq contracts worth billions of dollars.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I also know someone that worked for them on 9/11 that was directed to stay at work after hours
       <strong>

       E-mails with certain keywords. I don't remember what he told me, I'd have to ask again, but some were: bomb, missile, clinton, bush.

       Does anybody think the mechanism that brought down the 2 towers was the same that brought down WTC7? They almost look like two different types of demos.. Like layer 3 did the two towers but layer 2 thought they were doing all the work?

       Full disclaimer: This entire post was an attempt at paraphrasing the prose and rhetoric of the authors listed, especially Joseph Farrell (who is known for his verbosity).

       I spent considerable more time gathering this information than editing it to make it readable, so your observations are definitely warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to make too many excuses or anything, but it does come down to time...with real life stuff I barely can fit in my moderating duties these days, so researching and writing original content is largely a pipe dream.

      <p>
       This could use a lot of editing work, but tbh I just wanted to get it all out there and start a conversation.

       It would be different if this was my job...but it's just a hobby (although one I'm very passionate about).

       The argumentative tone of your comment is indicative of why the 9/11 truth movement is so fragmented. Everyone is jaded and everyone wants to be right.

       No, obviously they wouldn't tell the truth even under oath. But I'd enjoy watching them fucking squirm in that chair on cable tv, and it would bring to public attention the fact that they never testified in the first place.
