    <div class="md"><p>That depends on the person.  For example, my neighbors are Amish. They have 12 kids. They have never received any benefits. They grow and raise their own food. They take not one iota of resources for my family; if anything, I&#39;ve learned how to better use resources and replenish some I was unaware could be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there are some who have more children than they should have (1 is too many for some) but it&#39;s not anyone&#39;s place to decide as such.  Just don&#39;t ever let it get into your head that EVERYONE with a herd of children has too many because the truth is that those over breeders are the minority, not the majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is the possibility that Global cooperation is necessary now to set the precedent when the rising oceans displace Americans in a time when we aren&#39;t in charge. </p>

<p>Also flooding immigration along w global warming because we need more human beings to tax their carbon output and fill our privatized prisons.</p>

<p>The slowdown in immigration and rebuilding is good to fix process as long as its fixed, the trade off is missing 4 to 8 years of procreation which we will miss if we do not have enough workers to prop up the crumbling skeleton of Medicaid and Social Security.</p>

<p>Maybe you know the system is broken and only unchecked immigration can overload it to the point of breaking.</p>

<p>My 2 cents and Tin Foil says</p>

<p>In our lifetimes, we will have a National Voter ID, tiered insurance through the VA, Privatized Insurance and Medicine for those without National Voter ID cards and doctor visits will be done in home using a doctor examining you using your phone as a camera and your meds will be delivered within the hour via amazon drone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, perhaps in the future when our energy production and transportation is all green and we&#39;re making plastics from bio-engineered algae strong enough to supplant most metal production and we have lab-grown meat and fish, we&#39;ll be able to support a much higher  population density on the planet.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s suffering from a shortage of sharing resources.</p>

<p>We have so many stockpiles resources and a lot of it is funneled to rich, the powerful, and &quot;first&quot; world countries.</p>

<p>We have more than enough food right now to feed everyone. We have more than enough supplies and know how to prevent homelessness. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been documented time and time again that people exposed to poverty have more children. If we take care of the poor and the destitute, we would be far better off as a species. </p>

<p>The amount of money you have doesn&#39;t change the fact that you are a human just like me. We should all be able to eat and live in a home, and we are more than capable of making that happen with the technology we have and continue to advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first impact of sharing resources would be a dramatic increase in the rate of resource consumption as the billions of people living in poverty have their living standards raised towards that of first world countries.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that education, access to opportunity, female empowerment and access to birth control are incredibly powerful tools to reduce the birth rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then we should stop focusing on the &quot;issue&quot; of overpopulation and get to the core of the problem. Poverty, and the other issues you mentioned. </p>

<p>I just feel like something has to give. If we don&#39;t address the issue with poverty, and the result of that kind of life style, we will only continue to over populate. This is why something like a basic universal income could be helpful. But I&#39;m no expert, I just want us all to at least have access to food and water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s absolutely an issue. We simply don&#39;t have the resources to lift the majority of humanity out of poverty.

<p>Yes, we do. Poverty is an artificial social class, a human abstraction. If it wasn&#39;t for domination and the imperial notion of private property, the currant population could pretty easily support itself with little new infrastructure. It&#39;s the parasites running the show, intentionally wasting resources in their dragon-hoards and wars that prevent us from solving this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The failed experiment in China is a great example. So many female babies were systematically killed and then a massive unbalanced population of men without female numbers. </p>

<p>Japan is on the rapid steroid slide as well. An aging population and incredibly low birth rates.</p>

<p>European (white) birthrates are so low that yes, a minority will result here in America sooner than you might guess.</p>

<p>In South Africa there is a <em>Purge</em> ongoing that few understand and the remainder do not want to discuss.</p>

<p>Population Explosion Hoax and Global Warming Hoax scare mongering tactics worked wonderfully. Thanks to eugenics. Fuck Bill Gates and Zuckerberg! </p>

<p>We have sufficient tech and resources to feed a world population almost twice the number of people alive today, it&#39;s just that elites  don&#39;t want to share the world with the plebes.</p>

<p>Besides, there&#39;s a lot of money to be made from spraying roundup and using chemferts to produce more food, then throwing half of it away to drive prices up for the other half, and then collect a nice phat cancer-meds check from the poor fucks eating the roundup ridden produce.</p>
