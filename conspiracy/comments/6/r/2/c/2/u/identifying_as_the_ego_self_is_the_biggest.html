    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course. Its much better without the sense of being a finite self. Then you can use the body but wont feel locked in it and separated from the rest.  And the uncomfortable bodily manifestations of the sense of separation can be released and the body finally relaxes.  </p>

<p>So this freedom is both from the bodymind as well as for the bodymind. The bodymind benefits from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are body sensations but they are in your being, you are not in the body sensations. The root of the problem is the boundless I is mixed in with the body sensations.</p>

<p>If you become conscious of your being it will in time automatically entangle the knots and constrictions on the level of the body. The best way to get the experience of our true nature is to do self enquiry to realise the essential nature of I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not often talked about because the ego, I believe, is often targeted in advertising and social media. If more people are actually aware of their ego, they might possibly begin to un-identify with it, which is NOT good for the media mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you are aware of your ego, you are already better off than most - you are actually more awakened and in tune with yourself. You want to be your superego - the best example of yourself and your consciousness - you are literally functioning on a higher level of consciousness. Breaking down one&#39;s ego allows for the introduction of wisdom and prosperity because one begins to understand the superficial and finite existence of the ego.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: How does the ego play a role? Take snapchat for example. The idea of selfies is pushed as an innocent and fun game, but in reality, you and I both know that this media creates or  catalyzes a sense of narcissism in the individual using it. I cannot count the number of times I have witnessed people staring into their phones, taking picture on picture of themselves, twirling their hair, changing their position, all while soaking in the pleasure of appearing attractive, sexy, or beautiful in this little camera. That&#39;s exactly what the creators want. This caters to the ID (subconscious desires and wants) and allows for that material to become conscious (attributed to the ego) and THAT is when people begin to identify with it. This is why your superego is your highest self and who you should strive to be like the most, because ultimately, it is your highest form of being &quot;awake,&quot; in my opinion. :)</p>

<p>so there&#39;s no other point of view on this matter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over thousand of years of history, there have been lots of documented points of view on matters of human behavior,  morality,  deviant psychology,  etc.  some of them religious and some of them not.    And in the history of religions,  all over the word,  some have been institutionalized, as in eclesiastical,  with a priestly class,  and some have not.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the identification,  disidentification polarity misses the point about &quot;biggest problem&quot;.</p>

<p>I just wish that the conversation could evolve a little,  have a little more context in light of what can be studied and learned if people wanted to.    </p>

<p>If people wanted to.....   hey,  maybe its what people want,   even when they want to kill the ego.    Trying to get a leg up on things all the time.    There used to be some sages around that noticed this kind of thing and didn&#39;t make a religion out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, this is an issue that stems from our programing. As an occultist this is a fairly common idea that is shared and discussed though. As a high level summarry of this, on one side you have the right hand path in which one&#39;s goal is to grow the ego self by doing acts against your fellow man to prove that you are separate from the heard. In doing so some believe that one gains power from becoming more of an individual in this reality. On the other side some occultist follow the left hand path in which one gains power through diminishing the idea of self and recognising ones connection to everything. Both are flawed in my opinion as people that follow the right hand path tend to develop sociopathic tendencies and those that follow the left hand path tend to not appreciate or celebrate individualism. As with many things in life the key is balance. </p>

<p>Yes, the sense of lack that the ego always feels drives it to do and seek all sorts of things from money to power to fame in order to fulfill its sense of lack. It never gets satisfied though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just my ego that wants a girlfriend and kids, no point in dating.</p>

<p>The feeling of being a someone is the ego. Its an addition, so what is left after it is seen to be an illusion is just what is, life/existence happening. Only the sense of being a separate finite I dissolves. Without the sense of separate self there is just what is and its whole and complete, there is no sense of lack.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ego is the sense that its you doing that, its not the functioning of the bodymind organism. The sense of the one who has an ego IS the ego.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ego is essential to living a good life and forming good societies, even if it can be overindulged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By what I mean by ego is an artificial sense of separation where you feel yourself as a something separate from the rest. The bodymind functioning or thoughts arent it, its the sense that those are happening to you and that you are thinking them. </p>

<p>Not at all. Its just that the creator is not a separate entity, its beyond the minds ability to understand or conceptualise. It creates out of itself,  its creation never becoming other than itself or separate from itself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thats not it. There are no real self contained units, there is only unified existence.</p>

<p>Its not a who. The source is the same as what the word I really refers to if its not capture by the bodymind matrix. The infinite I of the creator is the only I there is, Gods infinite being is all there is.</p>
