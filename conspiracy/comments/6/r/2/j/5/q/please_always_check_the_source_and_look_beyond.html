<p>Either Hersh is right and then Rich might have been the leaker but wasn&#39;t murdered by the DNC or it&#39;s all bullshit and we don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mightily confused. The only fact that Hersh is confirming in this tape is that Seth Rich was in contact with wikileaks and had a drop box set up to give them files.
He is stating his opinion when he says &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot; he was murdered because of that. And I can&#39;t imagine a highly reputed journalist would conclude or state Seth Rich was killed in a conspiracy without the proof</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. He says &quot;I don&#39;t think he was murdered because of what he knew&quot;. This could be Hersh covering his ass or he could genuinely believe he was killed in a botched robbery.

<p>What we can confirm from this audio tape? That Seth Rich was leaking DNC files to wikileaks.  And I say we can confirm that now because Assange and Kim Dot Com have been alluding to this for a year</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said Julian Assange and Kim Dot Com have been alluding to Seth Rich being the source of the DNC leaks pretty much since his murder. Now a year later we have a pulitzer prize winning journalist corroborating that story based on his FBI source. </p>

<p>The truth (Seth giving DNC files to wikileaks) is out there for everyone to see now. Why are you so intent on denying this</p>

<p>He was just shilling his shitty techno music. How anyone can take that narcissist idiot seriously is beyond me. </p>

<p>Since Seth Rich is dead there is absolutely no reason for Assange to not disclose his name if he really was the leaker.</p>

<p>But we already know by now that Assange is a Russian stooge so what would it matter what he says? He&#39;s compromised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He might be wrong about botched robbery</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A serial killer is likely behind the murder of North Carolina Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, according to forensic-psychology students and instructors, who spent three months investigating the homicide. </p>

<p>The report states that Rich’s July 2016 “death does not appear to be a random homicide” or “a robbery gone bad,” as police had suggested. Instead, the report says, the “death was more likely committed by a hired killer or serial murderer,”</p>
