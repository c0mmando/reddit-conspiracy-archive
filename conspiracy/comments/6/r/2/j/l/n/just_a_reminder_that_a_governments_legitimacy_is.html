    <div class="md"><p>I guess Venezuela&#39;s President Maduro may have the right idea.  Maybe we need to form and elect a &quot;Consituent Assembly&quot; here in the U.S.A. too.  The U.S. Congress no longer represents the American People; the Congress doesn&#39;t care what&#39;s in the best interests of Americans.  Senators and Congressman are totally owned by the war-mongering &quot;Defense&quot; companies and their enforcers, the CIA.  </p>

<p>According to this MediaRoots article, the &quot;current constitution of Venezuela makes it possible to [activate] the Constituent Assembly when necessary. All candidates are independent and not nominated by political parties.&quot;  Wow, did you get that!  The candidates to be elected to the Constituent Assembly are NOT members of political parties; they&#39;re independent and NOT nominated by political parties.  There are some 6,000 candidates in Venezuela for the Constituent Assembly; about 500 (or 10 perecent) will be elected (or I guess have already been elected as of Monday, despite the U.S. State Department&#39;s threat not to hold elections for the Constituent Assembly).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the article:</p>

<p>and this:</p>

<p>President Eisenhower warned about the military industries (the companies within the military-industrial complex).  The founding fathers, George Washington and James Madison, also warned about the grave dangers &quot;standing armies&quot; pose to democracies.  Our country&#39;s founders believed large military forces should only be formed in times of emergency.  They didn&#39;t believe in maintaining a huge military force all the time. The force should be disbanded or wittled down to a very small force once the emergency is over.  </p>

<p>Just like Eisenhower, President George Washington warned about the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; in Washington&#39;s own farewell address.  Here&#39;s a quote from Washington&#39;s farewell address over 200 years ago:</p>

<p>&quot;Hence, likewise, [we] will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Overgrown military establishments,&quot; spake George Washington.</p>

<p>Presidents Washington and Eisenhower were on the same page.</p>

<p>The &quot;Defense&quot; companies and Oil companies have taken over our democracy in a coup, the coup of 1963, and really even before that: in 1947 when the war-loving CIA was created.</p>

<p>Founding Father and later President James Madison wrote: </p>

<p>&quot;Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded...War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few...and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals, engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a [domestic] revolt was [anticipated]. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;....excite a war...&quot;  Seems Madison knew about false flag operations too.  9/11 was perpetrated by minions of the &quot;Defense&quot; companies and CIA to &quot;excite&quot; our wars in the Middle East: Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya.  Next targets appear to be Lebanon and Iran.  </p>

<p>Win or lose the wars, the &quot;Defense&quot; companies and Darth Cheney&#39;s Halliburton have been making a fortune since 9/11, thus plunging America&#39;s tax payers into deep debt to make their fortunes and skyrocketing profits.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to Madison&#39;s quotes:</p>
