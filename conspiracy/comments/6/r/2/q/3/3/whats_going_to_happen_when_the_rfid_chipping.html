       Seriously, you know it's going to become a thing. Why did the company in Wisconsin make a party out of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory? They're going to start popping up in social spheres, not work spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to be pushed on a social acceptance platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have nothing to hide why don't you want to be chipped?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to be chipped....it's obvious you can't be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chippies are in...non chippies are out...non chippies must be shunned. They can't be trusted. They shouldn't be allowed to vote. There's lots of things non chippies shouldn't be allowed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know what they're hiding...they're probably pedophiles or something even worse. We shouldn't let them be around children.

       Right there with you. This technology will not be used with noble intentions.

       Quite the opposite. In every way, shape and form that they can come up with, it will be used to control and exploit.

       That comment will be recorded on your chip now. No taksie backsies.

       This is how I see it going. They will throw parties with a stage...like a graduation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except..on the stage will be a large projection screen. And when you walk up on the stage past the "scanner"...you're personal identification info will be shown on the screen..
      </p>
      <p>
       Your likes and hobbies can even be listed. Yay! Now you're one of us...you've graduated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing you know...those screens will start popping up everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everytime you pass a scanner you're info will be posted on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Been arrested lately? Up on the screen. Whatever they want to add...up on the screen.

       That's absolutely horrifying, but completely within the realms of possibility. Sounds like the perfect system for TPTB to keep us all
       <em>
        safe
       </em>
       from criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people will think it's a great idea though? I imagine they'll be sold on the many, many benefits. No more ID, money, bank cards, travel passes. Think of the pros and sshh about the cons. Only guilty people will refuse. They'll be easily identified as non-chippers and punished accordingly.

       First they will make it mandatory for military and police, then healthcare workers, then government and school employees, then certain private businesses will adopt it, then eventually cash will be phased out. Physical passports and drivers licenses will be phased out. You wont be able to leave the country or drive without a chip. Then you wont be able to have any job or any mny without the chip. The only people who refuse the chip will be loony christian "cultists" living off the grid.

       Seeing people talking into Bluetooth headsets has become so normalized...I can imagine that a discreet earpiece, much like a hearing aid, could become the next phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the same lines, I think glasses like Google Glass will eventually become actual contact lenses. Can you imagine everyone constantly being seen through the filter they chose for themselves? People are so obsessed with Snapchat and Instagram filters; what if you could choose a filter for yourself and everyone who looked at you saw you the way you want to be seen? Strange times...

       Your bank account is a digitized ledger. This can already be done to you. When people are under serious crimimal investigation, their accounts are frozen. If there's reason to believe the money was ill gotten, it is seized and we discuss here often how lax "asset forefeiture" is becoming where one needn't even be a suspect to have money stolen from them. The IRS can and will seize accounts, they can even freeze yours by accident and you have no recourse. Or check out the recent Wells Fargo scandals where they were signing customers up for services and never telling them, ruining their credit.  This theoretical nonexistent chip would not be different,  just possibly less secure. And if you've ever used paypal, google or apple pay or similar digital payment system, you've already joined the chippies.

       No...I'm pretty fuckin sure about the whole thing. I mean..I have a skin condition..my skin gets agitated very easily. Especially by authoritari- i mean, plastic...yeah, I have a severe allergy to plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is unfortunate..because if I didn't you would be able to look it up on my chip and see that I have an allergy to plastic.

      <p>
       But I don't..so you can't..which is unfortunate. But life throws us all curve balls...challenges we must overcome..things that might make us different from others.
      </p>

       My great cross to bear is that I cant get chipped because of an allergy. I suppose someday I will be able to accept it...live with it.

       I honestly thought they would start with prisoners and parolees. Instead of the ankle bracelets you get a chip

       We should absolutely be vigilant in ensuring this never happens. But I don't see this happening, at least in our lifetime. Medical autonomy laws are still reasonably strong. The whole "can't board a plane or buy stuff without it" is not feasible because of foreigners engaging in travel/commerce with no such chipping laws. This is, thankfully, the main reason we still have paper-based passports rather than digital ones. So until there is world governance I don't see a chip being pushed as a requirement for that which is global (commerce). I don't see chips required for voting either, because cynically, it's harder to fudge results.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we do get chipped it'll be covertly through nanotechnology and we'll be none the wiser. That, however, is far off enough that I have hope some laws can be implemented that regulate these types of shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this not to discredit the idea, but rather to allay that thudding sensation one gets in the pit of their stomach when worrying about what might be to come.

        digital biometric identification technology

       and decreasing costs have
       <strong>
        created the opportunity for low- and middle-income countries to expand and strengthen their national identification systems
       </strong>
       . Biometrics is emerging as the core of national identification systems. And there are also risks attendant to relying on biometrics (unlike other forms of digital credentialing, once biometric credentials are compromised, they are compromised forever whereas passwords and other means of authentication can be replaced). All else being equal, we might expect the use of biometric technology to become more prevalent as income increases, but some countries had well-established legacy registration systems before the widespread use of this technology. We might therefore
       <strong>
        expect to see a technology leapfrog effect, much like the rapid expansion of cellular phone systems in poorer countries

       with inadequate fixed-line systems."

      <p>
       Privacy concerns concerning biometric data like facial prints, fingerprints and DNA are mentioned. Kind of like how we're always being told that credit card skimmers on ATMs and at the checkout lanes of grocery stores can steal our credit card information, resulting in "identity theft". It seems
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       plausible that we will "leapfrog" to microchip technology, especially considering the fact that the device is the size of a grain of rice and the prices will continue to fall over the course of the next decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just yesterday, (Donald Trump said](
       <a href="https://youtu.be/D6eU8NlUyEc">
        https://youtu.be/D6eU8NlUyEc
       </a>
       ) proposed a merit-based immigration system, and
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ACgXA1cMv_c">
        he previously said
       </a>
       that he wants to "finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it truly so far-fetched to expect that, within the next 13 years, foreigners who wish to travel to the United States will be expected to become microchipped in order to be tracked to ensure the "safety and security" of American citizens? Is it truly far-fetched to think that, in our lifetimes, all people will have their medical records, bank accounts, passports, driver's licenses, etc. linked to a rice-sized RFID chip embedded in the webbing between their thumb and index finger? This is indeed right around the corner, and it is, frankly, absurd to try to brush it off as something we will not see in our lifetimes.

       If any kind of chipping becomes a widespread thing, RFID will be ancient history.  Law of the land has always been you're innocent until proven guilty.  We're nowhere near the time where we can afford to place chip readers around every corner.  Even if there was some sort of conspiracy to pull off some shit like this, it would fail just as hard as Verizon attempting to force users to buy all apps from their own app store at the dawn of the smartphone era.

       The real thing won't be chipping, but stamping something like a barcode on the forehead or the right palm/wrist. This uses the already existing infrastructure in place to scan barcoded goods. This will be the actual Mark of the Beast. Everything we're seeing right now is just a preparatory phase for when the real thing comes into existence.

       Why would they ever even need to chip you? Smartphones are in every pocket and GPS means everyone is easily tracked. Even if you turn that off, text messages, calls, and internet use can be used to triangulate your location anyways. Your shopping habits, internet history, and emails create a profile of you to bring targeted ads and services. That's all right now -what more useful information could anyone get from RFID chips?

       I started following WI local news channels after I heard about this. From what I've seen, it's getting intense backlash  from the local community, according to their comment sections. Lots of people claiming it to be the mark of the beast, others just flat out saying you'd have to be stupid to agree to this. Most seem to agree that no amount social convenience is worth the risk of being chipped, especially when you realize what they could potentially do with the information the chips are collecting.

       And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. (Revelation 13:16-18 KJV)

       Seeing people talking into Bluetooth headsets has become so normalized...I can imagine that a discreet earpiece, much like a hearing aid, could become the next phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the same lines, I think glasses like Google Glass will eventually become actual contact lenses. Can you imagine everyone constantly being seen through the filter they chose for themselves? People are so obsessed with Snapchat and Instagram filters; what if you could choose a filter for yourself and everyone who looked at you saw you the way you want to be seen? Strange times...
