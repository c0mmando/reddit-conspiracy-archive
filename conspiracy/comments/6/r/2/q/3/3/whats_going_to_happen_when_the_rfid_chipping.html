<p>My theory? They&#39;re going to start popping up in social spheres, not work spheres.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be pushed on a social acceptance platform.</p>

<p>If you have nothing to hide why don&#39;t you want to be chipped?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to be chipped....it&#39;s obvious you can&#39;t be trusted.</p>

<p>Chippies are in...non chippies are out...non chippies must be shunned. They can&#39;t be trusted. They shouldn&#39;t be allowed to vote. There&#39;s lots of things non chippies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to do.</p>

<p>How do we know what they&#39;re hiding...they&#39;re probably pedophiles or something even worse. We shouldn&#39;t let them be around children.</p>

<p>And on and on and on.</p>

<p>This is how I see it going. They will throw parties with a stage...like a graduation.</p>

<p>Except..on the stage will be a large projection screen. And when you walk up on the stage past the &quot;scanner&quot;...you&#39;re personal identification info will be shown on the screen..</p>

<p>Your likes and hobbies can even be listed. Yay! Now you&#39;re one of us...you&#39;ve graduated.</p>

<p>Next thing you know...those screens will start popping up everywhere.</p>

<p>Everytime you pass a scanner you&#39;re info will be posted on the screen.</p>

<p>Been arrested lately? Up on the screen. Whatever they want to add...up on the screen.</p>

<p>How many people will think it&#39;s a great idea though? I imagine they&#39;ll be sold on the many, many benefits. No more ID, money, bank cards, travel passes. Think of the pros and sshh about the cons. Only guilty people will refuse. They&#39;ll be easily identified as non-chippers and punished accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing people talking into Bluetooth headsets has become so normalized...I can imagine that a discreet earpiece, much like a hearing aid, could become the next phone.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, I think glasses like Google Glass will eventually become actual contact lenses. Can you imagine everyone constantly being seen through the filter they chose for themselves? People are so obsessed with Snapchat and Instagram filters; what if you could choose a filter for yourself and everyone who looked at you saw you the way you want to be seen? Strange times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your bank account is a digitized ledger. This can already be done to you. When people are under serious crimimal investigation, their accounts are frozen. If there&#39;s reason to believe the money was ill gotten, it is seized and we discuss here often how lax &quot;asset forefeiture&quot; is becoming where one needn&#39;t even be a suspect to have money stolen from them. The IRS can and will seize accounts, they can even freeze yours by accident and you have no recourse. Or check out the recent Wells Fargo scandals where they were signing customers up for services and never telling them, ruining their credit.  This theoretical nonexistent chip would not be different,  just possibly less secure. And if you&#39;ve ever used paypal, google or apple pay or similar digital payment system, you&#39;ve already joined the chippies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No...I&#39;m pretty fuckin sure about the whole thing. I mean..I have a skin condition..my skin gets agitated very easily. Especially by authoritari- i mean, plastic...yeah, I have a severe allergy to plastic.</p>

<p>Which is unfortunate..because if I didn&#39;t you would be able to look it up on my chip and see that I have an allergy to plastic.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t..so you can&#39;t..which is unfortunate. But life throws us all curve balls...challenges we must overcome..things that might make us different from others.</p>

<p>My great cross to bear is that I cant get chipped because of an allergy. I suppose someday I will be able to accept it...live with it.</p>

<p>The heartache right now is still very fresh. It&#39;s hard to talk about.

<p>If we do get chipped it&#39;ll be covertly through nanotechnology and we&#39;ll be none the wiser. That, however, is far off enough that I have hope some laws can be implemented that regulate these types of shenanigans. </p>

<p><a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16">Goal 16.9</a> of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) says:</p>

<p>“By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration”.</p>

<p>The World Bank’s <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/id4d">Identification for Development Program</a> (ID4D) says:</p>

<p>&quot;An estimated 1.1 billion people in the world are unable to prove their identity. That is 1 in every 6 individuals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The World Bank Group’s Identification for Development (ID4D) initiative plays an essential role in helping countries move forward to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and <strong>leave no one behind</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Under the section &quot;New Technologies creating New Opportunities for all&quot;, it says:</p>

<p>&quot;With the transformational potential of modern solutions—the <strong>advances in identification technology (both digital and biometric)</strong> and the dramatically falling costs of technology and implementation—there is <strong>an opportunity to leapfrog traditional paper-based approaches and build strong and efficient identification systems at a scale not previously achievable.</strong> Mobile devices also offer promising solutions to enroll and authenticate individuals with a unique identification, particularly in remote and rural areas.&quot;</p>

<p>On page 11 of the document <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/179901454620206363/Jan-2016-ID4D-Strategic-Roadmap.pdf#page=12">Identification for
Development: Strategic Framework</a>, it says:</p>

<p>&quot;Recent advances in <strong>digital biometric identification technology</strong> and decreasing costs have <strong>created the opportunity for low- and middle-income countries to expand and strengthen their national identification systems</strong>. Biometrics is emerging as the core of national identification systems. And there are also risks attendant to relying on biometrics (unlike other forms of digital credentialing, once biometric credentials are compromised, they are compromised forever whereas passwords and other means of authentication can be replaced). All else being equal, we might expect the use of biometric technology to become more prevalent as income increases, but some countries had well-established legacy registration systems before the widespread use of this technology. We might therefore <strong>expect to see a technology leapfrog effect, much like the rapid expansion of cellular phone systems in poorer countries</strong> with inadequate fixed-line systems.&quot;</p>

<p>Privacy concerns concerning biometric data like facial prints, fingerprints and DNA are mentioned. Kind of like how we&#39;re always being told that credit card skimmers on ATMs and at the checkout lanes of grocery stores can steal our credit card information, resulting in &quot;identity theft&quot;. It seems <em>very</em> plausible that we will &quot;leapfrog&quot; to microchip technology, especially considering the fact that the device is the size of a grain of rice and the prices will continue to fall over the course of the next decade.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, (Donald Trump said](<a href="https://youtu.be/D6eU8NlUyEc">https://youtu.be/D6eU8NlUyEc</a>) proposed a merit-based immigration system, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ACgXA1cMv_c">he previously said</a> that he wants to &quot;finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system&quot;. </p>

<p>Is it truly so far-fetched to expect that, within the next 13 years, foreigners who wish to travel to the United States will be expected to become microchipped in order to be tracked to ensure the &quot;safety and security&quot; of American citizens? Is it truly far-fetched to think that, in our lifetimes, all people will have their medical records, bank accounts, passports, driver&#39;s licenses, etc. linked to a rice-sized RFID chip embedded in the webbing between their thumb and index finger? This is indeed right around the corner, and it is, frankly, absurd to try to brush it off as something we will not see in our lifetimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Technology: The strategy to deploy technology needs to consider a range of dimensions, including cost, capacity, interoperability, usage, security, and long-term viability. A digital identity includes the following technology-based solutions which could be considered: biometrics; electronic database; electronic credentials; mobile, online and offline applications. <strong>As technology continues to advance, other options will likely become available.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the same page, under the section &quot;Implementation&quot;, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>The World Bank Group has a range of financial instruments</strong> (IDA/IBRD, donor-funded ASA, and RAS) <strong>to support governments in the implementation of an identification system.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same technology needed to scan a physical ID card holding all of your biometric data, or to scan your phone or to scan your face or irises/retinas could be used to scan an RFID chip in your hand, and TPTB want everyone to have a digital ID by 2030.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started following WI local news channels after I heard about this. From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s getting intense backlash  from the local community, according to their comment sections. Lots of people claiming it to be the mark of the beast, others just flat out saying you&#39;d have to be stupid to agree to this. Most seem to agree that no amount social convenience is worth the risk of being chipped, especially when you realize what they could potentially do with the information the chips are collecting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. (Revelation 13:16-18 KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing people talking into Bluetooth headsets has become so normalized...I can imagine that a discreet earpiece, much like a hearing aid, could become the next phone.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, I think glasses like Google Glass will eventually become actual contact lenses. Can you imagine everyone constantly being seen through the filter they chose for themselves? People are so obsessed with Snapchat and Instagram filters; what if you could choose a filter for yourself and everyone who looked at you saw you the way you want to be seen? Strange times...</p>
