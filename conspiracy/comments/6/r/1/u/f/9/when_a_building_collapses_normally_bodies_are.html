<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8QCQudNEtY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8QCQudNEtY</a></p>

<p>Some stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>2,749 victims in the rubble</li>
<li>&lt;300 whole bodies</li>
<li>20,000 body parts</li>
<li>200 of the found parts belonged to a single person</li>
<li>1,630 victims were identified (meaning 1,119 victims could not be unidentified)</li>
<li>800 of those victims were identified by DNA only</li>
</ul>

<p>There has never been another building collapse that had a body toll like this. The more you look, the more obvious it becomes that something about the story we&#39;ve been told isn&#39;t right. </p>

<p>The under 3000 dead line is one of the mainstay falsehoods of the entire conspiracy, <a href="http://cnparm.home.texas.net/911/911/911b.htm">2:48 PM September 11, 2001</a> estimates of 50,000 dead in New York were bandied about .. NIST Engineer Sunder said, &quot;on 911 there were between 8,500 and 9,000 occupants in each building.&quot;</p>

<p>ABC News Anchor Peter Jennings while the drama was still unfolding said, &quot;the normal total of workers at the WTC Towers was around eighty thousand,&quot; Sunder&#39;s total of between seventeen and eighteen thousand in the Towers, makes some sixty two thousand or so absent using Peter Jennings figures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/Missing_Jews.htm">Evidence of Mossad Treachery at the WTC, by Ed Toner</a> .. Nearly 500 foreign nationals from over 80 different nations were killed in the World Trade Center, as a center of world trade and finance this is not surprising, it is known many Israelis work in the field of international trade and finance.</p>

<p>The laws of probability dictate there should have been a considerable number of Israeli dead, Alon Pinkas Israelâ€™s Consul General in New York confirmed one Israeli dead in each of the planes that crashed into the towers, and one more who had been at the WTC on business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110210.PDF">Lt Richard Smiouskas FDNY, November 27, 2001</a> .. after the North Tower air strike &quot;an engineer got me onto the roof of WTC 2, I saw people in the windows they weren&#39;t jumping they were being forced out.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?6-The-Most-Shameful-Act-on-a-Day-of-Shame!">The NYPD refused to attempt helicopter rescues</a> for those trapped in the burning towers, while the official death toll of some under three thousand is to fit the four hundred dead Jews on the official list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who were the ones who stayed and threw others from windows according to Smiouskas testimony, who were sold out when NYPD choppers never showed up.</p>
