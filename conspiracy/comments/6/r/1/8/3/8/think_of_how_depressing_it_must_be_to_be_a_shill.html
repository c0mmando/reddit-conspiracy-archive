       Being a government employed controlled opposition plant, or a "shill" as we call them, is a very unfulfilling and depressing life to lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, they rationalize it with a benefits package, vacation time, and decent hours. All they have to do is be creative and try to stifle online discussion right? They are trained and taught how to operate on these subs, it's relatively easy work. And it puts food on the table for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they DON'T realize (or likely do realize, but have learned to cope with this depressing inevitability), is that they are the LOWEST people on the totem pole in regard to the system. You may think you got this job by being creative and intelligent, perhaps a supervisor saw some talent in you in your ability to manipulate others. But once the jig is up, the same system that employs you, will dispose of you like a fucking dirty que tip, because you were just being
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They vampirized your labor and your time, just like they do to us, to forward their agenda, and you will be left on the street to starve like the rest of us. Not only will you likely have criminal charges to deal with once we awaken the masses to what is happening, but you will have to live with the guilt of selling out your species for the rest of your life. Godspeed on the shill path losers!
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone else, keep giving these fuckers as hard of a time as you can. They are dirt to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Yourr average shill is not some "clocking in 9-5" type guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left vs right shills? It's all fake. They want us all bickering with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were talking about a person, who's career is to play "pretend conspiracy theorist" at night time, and lead you all astray and control the narrative.
       <strong>
        The operation is much smaller and more "covert" than you would think.

       No no no, last week u/TrumpRusConspiracy professed how much he truly loved and cared for this sub and its integrity... Hence the username and all the trump comments... Then I had to remind him that free thinking individuals could give 10 fucks about trump or choosing bullshit partisan sides.. That focusing ones time and energy on 1 person in the universe was the most closed minded a person can get.. I don't think Op responded after that.. Poor dude

       You ever dropped acid? I love how mushrooms unlocked my inner being but holy fuck does acid really unlocks the universe. You should give it a shot some time. Maybe then you will understand that no matter how much the info war is fought, the war has been over for a lonnnngg time. The cat is out the bag.. Once awoken, there is no going back to sleep..

       Not going to answer that because it's just going to be used as something to attack me with. That's why I don't try to debunk other conspiracies or attack others for believing in them. To each their own.

       I think I did it the other day.  I responded as if I were telling a story.    I would reply to a bot and different bots would reply. Eventually I got someone who was a real person.   Their operation is out of Germany I believe.

       That's been my thesis for a while. I think the flat earth thing was / is a training program for that system. It's odd / unique enough that it's fairly easy to track around the web -- both in terms of where those conversations are and how effective the program is at swaying opinion.

       There are no shills, just bots. You would have to be fucking stupid to hire an army of real people when it's more expensive, less effective, and much riskier. Al it would take is one guy to come clean and it would be a PR nightmare. And the fact that no one has come clean yet only further exacerbates my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean really. Does OP actually believe that there is an army of people getting full benefits to post on reddit all day? It's downright delusional.

        Correct the Record’s staff (18 and counting) is crammed into a newsroom-style bullpen in the back corner of the offices of American Bridge 21st Century, Brock’s Super-PAC. “They’re always there; they’re always working around the clock,” former Clinton White House adviser Paul Begala says of the crew. “I always tease David that he finds all of these nerd virgins and locks them away in a vault where they never see sunlight or have a drink or get laid.

       I guess. You're right, I was wrong: looks like the funding was closer to $10 million. If it was just 18 shills, they were each paid quite a bit of money.

       Yep, the super PAC whose stated purpose was to affect online conversation got ~$10 million in funding but only had 18 people posting online to whom they sent daily "CtR Roundup" emails throughout the entire campaign with articles to push. That makes sense.

       If they can only hire 18 people to post online with ~$10 million in funding when that's literally the stated purpose of the entire SuperPAC, then the Democrats should never be given any sort of budgetary authority ever again.

       What do you think my point was? Originally I was responding to somebody who claimed there were no shills, only votebots (apologies, I thought you were the same person until I just checked now). So I proved them incorrect. You responded with this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lol, so at best we have evidence of 18 paid shills, and we're supposed to believe people like you and OP when you claim that there are shills lurking around every corner?

      <p>
       And my point is that the budget increased ten-fold since the quote off of which you're basing your entire argument, and that CtR is not the only game in town. Astroturfing is a very effective form of propaganda, and Reddit is teeming with it.

       They're knowingly complicit, organize using symbols that demonstrate as much, and are simply interested in 'climbing the ladder' by doing service to the organization.  They may or may not know what's actually going on; from their behavior they don't seem to much care.  They think they're getting ahead.

       The shills Aren't 9-5 train riding normal folk. They are soldiers in the military or intelligence agents for several nation states. And it's possible but I really doubt they spend much time around here the seeds were planted awhile ago, the autistic the donald people do the work for them now.

       I don't think there's too many trump shills, there's just people like myself who bend over backwards to defend him. Ya know I can tell you there's so many Jew connection sites in his family it's insane, but idk why, I just think the dude is doing what's right. And any news negative to him, I am conditioned to try to do some mental gymnastics to defend him, because I agree with him on most stuff
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit this. Most people don't. I don't think one can call me a shill though. I don't get paid for this. Most people aren't shills, they just are conditioned for this division. Divide and conquer. That's their plan

       Truth is not reached by arriving at a conclusion you feel to be true and then searching for the means to support it. Our brains are good at recognizing patterns, taking shortcuts, overlooking obvious counter-evidence, selectively confirming our own perceptions despite contradictions, inconsistencies, and logic caps. And some people are good at taking advantage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point you have to decide whether you give a shit about the truth, or you just want to live in a reality that just feels familiar and comfortable (Jew overlords are controlling society, liberals have no morals, Trump is a patriot, Seth Rich was murdered by Team Clinton, and I'm a shill just because I think that's all horseshit).

       There's no question the trump shills massively out number the anti trump shills,  It just so happens an overwhelming majority of people despise trump.  You may be one of only a few true trump supporters, breaking your back to twist all his lies/faults/shortcomings/general ineffectiveness to be palatable for the rest of the actual pede-files, or you're just parroting the spins C.A. are pushing. The difference is, you're not being paid, and you're not a bot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't twist yourself up too much, even if his astonishing incompetence leads to something decent, you're still on the wrong side of history here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is you seemingly a smart/decent enough person to admit you blindly defend him. So you'll learn something from this situation regardless of the outcome, and hopefully you'll be better for it. Just dont push it too far, the dude could end up being exonerated completely of the russia thing and still go down as the worst thing to ever happen to our country. He's making America great again by making it worse for the poor, minorities, and dialing back progress as a civilization to "glory days" that never actually existed for the majority of people.
       <br/>
       You may agree with what he says, but how many times will it take with him showing you not even he believes in what he says before you're done with him? 
Dont let the words of a conman convince you your values don't matter, because so far, thats all it seems like hes done to anyone who supported him from the start.  And thats not a good thing for anyone, and especially not good for our country.

       You seem to not realize us trump fans are far more fanatical in defense of him than many anti trump folks. That in addition to the fact that I can't say anything in real life because I'd prolly get fired, makes us more active on the Internet.

       I know nothing i could say is going to change your mind, so ill try to keep my comment short as to not waste either of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think trump is going to change a system that helped keep him wealthy despite all of his failures as a businessman? That made all of his friends and family rich, you really think he would change the tax laws in a way that would benefit the american people over his corporate cronies and closest companions? The stock market may be raising, but ask yourself why that could be despite him doing literally nothing financially for this country yet.  Do you think its because companies are looking forward to losing money to make america great again, or do you think theres some ulterior motive there? Or maybe obama just built an impressive, sustainable growth system for our country after the shit show that resulted because of our last republican lead government caused the worst economy since the great depression?
      </p>
      <p>
       And donald trump is definitely racist, I wont go into explaining how him buying real estate, evicting and denying section8 or government aided people from the places is racist.  But thats not even the only example, you know how to use google though, so its not like anything id tell you you wouldnt come up with something refuting it.  Or how he was given an naacp lifetime achievment award, but you and I both know he only like black people when having one vouch for him benefits him in some way. Do you really think the whole birther thing was about him being concerned a foreigner might have became president?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every number he has ever came up with on any issue has been summarily dismissed and proven to be made up, he's called on it quite frequently.  But either way, I appreciate that you care about your country.   I just seriously hope you realize Trump doesn't sometime soon.

       Yes, look at his tax proposal with Bannon change, guys all the exemptions that allow the rich to pay effective tax rates of 2% whole the upper middle class and middle class pay the 35%-40% business tax. Same with gutting personal exenptions

       He's cut 800 regulations and cause consumer confidence to skyrocket. More importantly, manufacturers and small businesses confidence are even higher. Have you seen how many mining construction and manufacturing jobs have been added.

       Companies don't have to lose money to MAGA. They need to bring in their overseas profits and make capital investments in plant equipment etc, an area with which Obama cause investment in to sink to multi decade lows, and cause the rust belt to feel forgotten by the Democrats.
      </p>

       You call trump a rascist but can't prove it. Nice one. Birther movement was started by HRC in 2007 and his own brother Malik has tweeted so much out that shows he was s born there. I'm sorry his bro has sent out pictures that prove otherwise. What does saying a half black half white person being not a natural born citizen have to do with rascism. Trump called Ted Cruz Canadian born

       Not the person you were asking, but yes.  I do believe he will.  I love how much cognitive dissonance this argument requires.  Progressives are constantly harping about how their leaders (Usually millionaires, working in the public sector for life) are somehow bastions of social clarity, pushing for the betterment of all man while they assume Trump can't also strive for the betterment of the country.  I mean, can you see how hypocritical that is?

       It is also fantastically racist to automatically connect welfare and section 8 recipients with race, but hey, when progressives are racist they don't even realize it.  I am sure black people are too dumb to get ID to vote too, right?  Jesus fucking christ...

       TIL asking for sources, evidence, and proof of the ever-ambiguous "Russian collusion" and how such a thing would be fundamentally bad even if true = shilling for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there is plenty of evidence the DNC was rigged, Clinton deleted evidence in a criminal investigation, and as we are seeing now, Seth Rich was the person who leaked the DNC emails and the "russian hacking" narrative is nothing more than a disinformation campaign.

       If he's a crook, why don't they take him down? After CIA/NSA revelations, we know they see and have everything - whether it is legal or not. Do you feel like the deep state is sitting on information that could be used to impeach or indict Trump and are refusing to use it? and if not, then how is Trump anything more than a valid president who is doing pretty much exactly what every other president before him has done? The US government is not run by one man - it's ridiculous.

       He is literally being investigated by a team of 10+ top prosecutors, FBI agents, etc. as we speak. People with strong and established reputations for rooting out corruption and scandal.

       Obama promised 'hope and change' and delivered 'I didn't get shot'. nothing has changed. Trump hasn't really even done anything as president - he needs both branches of government to join him to do anything.

       and Trump hasn't done certain things that past presidents did either. You're measuring stick has no basis in logic or reason. You are just like a small child having a tantrum about how unfair their mother is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of those three things actually mattered or were of any importance, it would be acted upon. Here's why they dont matter:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Is he legally required to fire somebody for some botched paperwork? What was the aftermath of this mistake, and how was the country threatened?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Actually your buddy Comey went to great lengths to say that Trump didn't disrupt anything, but he seemed to expect that power. Comey didn't back down, and Trump didn't do anything to make him back down. Comey was fired for perfectly good reasons - he overstepped his bounds in letting criminals off the hook, and had to be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) If the media is going to make up 'sources' and rely on leaks from a very angry and upset establishment, then they are going to get called out for being 'fake news'. Do you really think CNN isn't fake news? Do you really think the paid-stream media is giving you truth? That's a load of shit. I can't believe you eat that up.

       Part 2: we will undoubtedly see what Mueller has to say about Kushner. Theoretically, false/ommitted information on the SF-86 is a threat because the literal purpose of the form is to determine whether or not someone can be trusted enough by the American people with American secrets and intelligence. Kushner fails that test pretty soundly with his "mistake".

       How did you get "CNN" from "literally every news source that reports somewhat negatively on you or your administration".
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not talking about 1-2 major outlets, we're talking about the entirety of the free press being under attack when they criticize the president.Right-leaning, left-leaning, foreign, domestic, neutral, biased, you name it. If you publish FACTS that don't shine a favorable light on the president, you are "fake news" according to the man himself.

       It took two years from the beginning of the watergate scandal and the investigation for it to be completed, time is not a measure of success, these people are professionals and will want to cross their 'T's and dot their 'I's. Additionally with dumbass and his family's constant admitting to things on twitter after denying them and these things being more information for the investigation the scope keeps widening almost every week.

       They are currently in the process of building the case to impeach/indict him, that's what that ever expanding cast of investigators is doing right now.  Just because you can't fathom an investigation not concluding instantly doesn't take away from whats happening.

       Or that it isn't continuously expanding?

       They used to be even more obvious because they would post at the same time using an alt to post here. Then they learned to wait an hour or so before crossposting. Now the lazy ones will add or subtract one word from the_donald's headline and the even lazier will still copy and paste the entire post title (unecessary capslock, hyperbole, typos, and all).

       I deleted my first account because it included my name and my second because it included too many personal details in comments. I deleted another because I was getting harrassing messages from T_D posters. I have a few that are just joke accounts and this one. I'll probably delete this one soon.

       It's even more depressing when you become a targeted individual &amp; realize people you've known for years participate in organized gang stalking (typically due to serving in the military or their family is police/military/etc).  Definitely makes you lose faith in humanity when someone you know starts acting like a retard around you in public to try &amp; spook you.

       This is happening the change is coming, we just have to be patience and stop lying to yourself, we can change it just a matter of wanting it and sadly this shill like people like to call them, are sad beings but they have to take notice, I just hope they do it on time before it's to late for them...

       I want to point out that most people on the web do not know about the shills that are employed and how extensive and well hidden they operate. I have a friend who is relatively aware of conspiracies and even this friend had no idea at all. This person actually thought it was real support and was very demoralized that the "shill public" was so well organized and active on line. I think it is important to make sure to counteract lies with the truth sometimes. I know most don't agree on this board, but I am relatively knew to the conspiracy world and I know a year ago I had no idea how organized and tactical TPTB really were. Plus these shills need to know the real truth. They too are told they are spreading the truth. That we are the ones who are spreading the lies. The truth in the end sets you free.

       Meh, you can say the same thing about 99% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is their primary goal? To slave away for pieces of paper whilst trying to save up, buy a house and live life.....only so they can continue slaving away for the rest of their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       How funny is that,
       <em>
        living life just so you can continue slaving away like a good little slave
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't make me laugh. We're all the same. We're all shills working our way up the ladder, trying to score more digits in our bank accounts and selling our bodies and minds so we can continue to slave away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can write as many edgelord posts putting down some "evil other" to make yourself feel better about your own shit life but deep down you know we're all pointless little shills, that have no other purpose than to slave for the rest of our lives and give a leg and an arm just to live in relative comfort. All so we can continue slaving away more "efficiently" and effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if you're a shill or a fucking programmer working a 9-5 in a cubicle, the underlying point never changes, and that is that you will always be a replaceable, nameless, slave whose only real purpose in life is to fuck, pop out some babies, buy a house, slave away and then finally die as a feeble, old fuck.

       I know, the truth is tough to take.

       They gotta be sharp against the best. They don't just drag any loser off the street to shill. A Dumbass with an ego could expose their whole plan on the web.

       They are smarter than that, guys. Shills either have dirt on them or are involved in the alphabet agencies (CIA, NSA, ECT)

       It took two years from the beginning of the watergate scandal and the investigation for it to be completed, time is not a measure of success, these people are professionals and will want to cross their 'T's and dot their 'I's. Additionally with dumbass and his family's constant admitting to things on twitter after denying them and these things being more information for the investigation the scope keeps widening almost every week.

       They used to be even more obvious because they would post at the same time using an alt to post here. Then they learned to wait an hour or so before crossposting. Now the lazy ones will add or subtract one word from the_donald's headline and the even lazier will still copy and paste the entire post title (unecessary capslock, hyperbole, typos, and all).

       Yep, the super PAC whose stated purpose was to affect online conversation got ~$10 million in funding but only had 18 people posting online to whom they sent daily "CtR Roundup" emails throughout the entire campaign with articles to push. That makes sense.
