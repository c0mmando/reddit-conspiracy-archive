       Woah, an admission that DNC probably did it, I assume an admission that he was a leaker.  So we have an actual crime, and lies which were utilized to justify foreign policy decisions, wasted how much tax money for bullshit investigations, shows that the Clinton's are corrupt, but Trump has 'connections'.  How ominous sounding.

       Would not surprise me that Trump laundered/invested money from Russian mob. Think a lot of Wall Street and banks have done so and will continue to do so despite sanctions (use subsidiary banks in other countries and all the other tax avoidance schemes that are created for the rich and multinationals cocompanies).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't surprise me Trump also laundered/invested money from the American Sicilian Mafia early on in his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse I have no doubt Trump laundered/invested money from CIA tools/assets Adnan Khashoggi and Imelda Marcos. No doubt some of these two person's money would be U.S. citizens tax money and probable reason little coverage about Trump laundering Russian mob money  been given as investigations of Trump's past business dealings. This is because any investigation will lead to questions about his connections to these people, their income streams, and their connection to CIA guilt and culpability.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of these credible, easily evidence-aquired through public records, and concerning facts about Trump being investigated, we have MSM going on about the circumstantial evidence of the Russian hack of United States election. I'm tired off media presenters spinning the allegations of anonymous sources (amounts to hearsay and gossip), top secret dossiers that only politicians can look at (Iraq WMDs style), an unverified private company's report from crowdstrike (while the DNC withholds its servers from the FBI), and stupid gossip dossiers as being solid verifiable evidence and proof of Russian interference in U.S.election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because Trump accepted Russian Mob money in selling his real estate does not prove that Russia meddled in the election. It's a bow, but a long one and a dangerous one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and USA are countries that can burn the world by themselves, and a confrontation between the two would double the chance of this outcome. I do not want my world burnt on unsubstantiated allegations that turn out no be no more then another Iraq WMDs lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Seth Rich no one knows the truth as no one has been arrested and convicted for his murder yet. So saying the DNC hadn't any involvement is speculation as much as anyone saying the DNC is involved. Legitimate and registered companies like the DNC have been known to have been involved in murders before, either unwittingly or wittingly (as paying thugs to beat striking workers) and so such an occurrence is not unknown.

       I'll be very interested in the evidence when and if it is ever presented. Sincerely. The only person who has been willing to embrace that theory in public is James Comey. The only public evidence is the letter that Trump's kid leaked on himself. All of the other endless articles have been anonymously sourced by spooks. The very first mention of it came from material provided by an mi6 alumnus and was exposed to the world by Guccifer 2.0, who had physical access to DNC computers. All of that is true and now WikiLeaks has inched even closer to naming Seth Rich as a source by bringing attention to something that Sy Hersh said.

       They are spooks. They tell lies. It is the thing that they do best. The lying has now become a threat to Free Speech, The Free Press, and Fair Elections so we are going to have a public reckoning. Fairly routine civic maintenance that we have put off for too long.

       Sure, you may believe as you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if we're going by what the intelligence communities say, even if Seth Rich leaked the emails and there was no DNC hack by Russia, it still doesn't account for the thousands of other hacks done by the GRU.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm glad that people are trying to find out who killed Seth Rich. But, those who push it just because they think it debunks the Russian conspiracy, are in for a rough time no matter what happens.

       I don't know what kind of fake news do you read but the version I've heard of the story, they said there was hack attempts, none of them was successful.

       From your article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The broader political context makes Russia a viable suspect. Russia has been engaged in active military interventions in Ukraine since former president Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power in 2014. That has included the annexation of Crimea and the active movement of troops and equipment in the eastern region of the country, but also a number of more subtle activities. Ukraine’s power grid came under cyberattack in December 2015, an attack many interpreted as part of a hybrid attack by Russia against the country’s infrastructure. That hybrid-warfare theory extends to more conventional guerrilla attacks: the same day that Petya ripped through online infrastructure, Ukrainian colonel Maksim Shapoval was killed by a car bomb attack in Kiev.

       Look donald trump is not clean.
       <br/>
       But he is still a better pick as hillary.
       <br/>
       If only to rampage through the white house like a baboon.
       <br/>
       Or for the public to make a FUCK U statement.
       <br/>
       Its still better as hillary (till he launches nuke,s then fuck him)

       Surely you see the difference between a man who was clearly murdered for doing something that at the time was viewed as potentially fatal to a presidential campaign and a ratings-fueled quest for revenge on a guy who humiliated the media to the point where I haven't even bothered to turn the tv on in months

       Since when did these fucks start giving a flying Fuck about a Dnc staffer? Like, are they trying to obviously deflect from the Russia investigation or what? LOL hilarious that they think they're so smart. I'm literally giggling.

       They are spooks. They tell lies. It is the thing that they do best. The lying has now become a threat to Free Speech, The Free Press, and Fair Elections so we are going to have a public reckoning. Fairly routine civic maintenance that we have put off for too long.

       How can Hersh confirm this? Was he there? Has he found the missing body cam or cctv footage? Or located the killer?

       Stop with the misleading cherry picked tidbits of information.
