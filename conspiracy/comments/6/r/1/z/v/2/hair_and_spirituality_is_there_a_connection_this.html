        Hair and Spirituality?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have lived amongst the Navajo reservation for 10 years (or a little more), and one thing that has always stood out to me is the fact that cutting your hair, especially for women, is advised against. The women here have some of the most beautiful, strong, luxurious hair I have ever seen, and many do not cut it, no matter how long it gets. Instead, they wear it in a bun (or in braids), which I think makes it more manageable. Of course, not every Navajo women does this, but it is extremely interesting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this article, the author notes that
       <em>
        hair is memory.
       </em>
       She writes,
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúI have often heard that, for Navajo people, hair is our memory. Before my traditional Navajo wedding, my long hair (it went down to my waist) was washed with yucca root. It foams up quickly. Afterward, my hair was brushed with a bundle of stiff grass called a be‚Äôezo. I still have that bundle and I occasionally brush my children‚Äôs hair with it. The act of caring for the hair, one relative to another, like my grandmother and family did for me, is an expression of love to me. Sharing it with my children feels natural. In fact, I cannot imagine not doing it. I can still hear my mother, my shi m√° making comments in Navajo as she brushed my hair.‚Äù

      <p>
       The other day, I was browsing youtube, and I happened to come across an ad from Dove. In the ad, the women cuts her hair, and she transforms herself. Something did not settle right with me, and I‚Äôd like to discuss why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the ad by the way:
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y42U9YocVR0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there something more to this? Why are so many women encouraged to cut their hair short, especially in the past few decades? The purpose of this post is to explore this topic, and maybe, make some connections between hair and spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Women and Hair
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate doing this to men, but I really cannot relate to their perspective. I do apologize. Earlier I received a message from a good Reddit friend, and she told me she was thinking about hair. She explained (
       <a href="/u/natasha2827">
        /u/natasha2827
       </a>
       ) or pointed out that when she went through a pretty bad time in her life, she cut off a huge chunk of her hair, and she later regretted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For women, hair is kind of a big deal, and I know that almost every woman I have ever met
       <em>
        hates
       </em>
       her natural hairstyle. It is no surprise that many black women experience bias against their natural hair:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/02/06/new-study-confirms-bias-toward-black-womens-natural-hair/">
        https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/02/06/new-study-confirms-bias-toward-black-womens-natural-hair/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for white women, girls with straight hair want their hair curly, and girls with curly hair want their hair straight. As a white girl with naturally blonde curly hair, I always hated it. I was told it looked better straight, and that I needed to control it. I am sure most women have a story about how they were told their hair sucked. In other words, their hair needed to be controlled.
Interestingly enough, after I received the message from Natasha, I went to work to set up my classroom, and I had my hair as natural as could be. It has been extremely humid here, so it was curlier than usual. A little girl I came across said she loved my hair. It made me smile, and I kept thinking more about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I worked, I just kept thinking about hair, and I started to realize their might be a larger conspiracy here. I guess I am the type who thinks there is a conspiracy to everything üòä
I realized at that point that most women have issues with their hair, and more and more seem to be cutting their hair short. Is it just an act of defiance, or is there something deeper there?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hair and Spirituality
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon doing some further research, I do think there is a link between hair and spirituality. Of course, these sources may not be the best I have ever found, but it is fascinating!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have learned a lot about Navajo boarding schools, and one of the first things they did was cut off their students‚Äô hair.
Again, I cannot claim this is the best source in the world, but is interesting nonetheless:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúLong ago people in many cultures didn‚Äôt cut their hair, because it was a part of who they were. There were no salons. Often, when people were conquered or enslaved, their hair was cut as a recognized sign of slavery. It was also understood that this would serve as punishment and decrease the power of those enslaved.
The bones in the forehead are porous and function to transmit light to the pineal gland, which affects brain activity, as well as thyroid and sexual hormones. Cutting bangs which cover the forehead impedes this process.
When Genghis Khan conquered China, he considered the Chinese to be a very wise, intelligent people who would not allow themselves to be subjugated. He therefore required all women in the country to cut their hair and wear bangs, because he knew this would serve to keep them timid and more easily controlled.
As whole tribes or societies were conquered, cut hair became so prevalent that the importance of hair was lost after a few generations, and hairstyles and fashion grew to be the focus.
The science of hair was one of the first technologies given by Yogi Bhajan when he came to America.
‚ÄúWhen the hair on your head is allowed to attain its full, mature length, then phosphorous, calcium, and vitamin D are all produced, and enter the lymphatic fluid, and eventually the spinal fluid through the two ducts on the top of the brain. This ionic change creates more efficient memory and leads to greater physical energy, improved stamina, and patience.‚Äù
Yogi Bhajan explained that if you choose to cut your hair, you not only lose this extra energy and nourishment, but your body must then provide a great amount of vital energy and nutrients to continually re-grow the missing hair.
In addition, hairs are the antennas that gather and channel the sun energy or prana to the frontal lobes, the part of the brain you use for meditation and visualization. These antennas act as conduits to bring you greater quantities of subtle, cosmic energy. It takes approximately three years from the last time your hair was cut for new antennas to form at the tips of the hair.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.quantumbalancing.com/spiritualhair.htm">
        https://www.quantumbalancing.com/spiritualhair.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don‚Äôt believe this source, hair seems to represent some type of spiritual power. Whenever we think of hippies, we think of people with long, flowing hair. Or even think of depictions of spiritual leaders, like Jesus, with long hair. Could there be any truth to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scientific Evidence
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hair really is an extension of our nervous system. This is a pretty good study on it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120111103354.htm">
        https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120111103354.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, though, when I researched why we even have hair, especially huge amounts of hair on our heads, there seems to be scientific mysteries behind it, and unanswered questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this article (
       <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-why-do-we-have-body-hair">
        https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-why-do-we-have-body-hair
       </a>
       ),
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúAnd our hair still plays a very important role in regulating our body temperature. When it's cold outside, tiny muscles surrounding the hair follicle cause the hairs to stand up, to trap more heat near the body. This is what happens when you get goosebumps.
So those tiny hairs all over our bodies make sense. As do nostril hairs and eyelashes, which keep dirt out of our bodies. But what about things like chest hair, pubic hair, and eyebrows? Why do they grow so much longer than the hair on our arms, and what's the point of them?
Scientists still aren't entirely sure, and we'll let you watch the episode above to find out why. But one thing's for sure, our hair definitely isn't useless.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, there is no doubt that hair is associated with power, which is why many bald people struggle, and bald men often have a difficult time:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/discrimination-bald-men_n_3748896.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/discrimination-bald-men_n_3748896.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at least psychologically, our hair holds some type of value. Many older women must dye their hair. Psychology Today explains,
      </p>
      <p>
       "In other words, society says that older women have to disguise and keep in check their naturally graying hair.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201505/what-your-hair-really-says-about-you">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201505/what-your-hair-really-says-about-you
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is not really surprising that many open up to their hair dressers, in a sort of a therapy session. Do people feel more vulnerable when they are getting their hair done? Here‚Äôs an interesting article about the psychology of hair salons:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201207/the-psychology-hair-salons-stylists-therapy-free">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201207/the-psychology-hair-salons-stylists-therapy-free
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if I cannot conclusively prove that hair has some type of spiritual element, there is no doubt that our hair does hold power both scientifically and psychologically.

       But this seems to be a common theme among celebrities and their mk ultra breakdowns.

      <p>
       If you watched the creepy ‚Äúpsychology session‚Äù with Katy and her handler, she explains that she wanted to cut her hair to get away from her Katy Perry persona, perhaps to return to an altered state:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôm sure there are so many more. The point is that you can claim that these things do not matter, but the media surely wants you to think they matter!
      </p>
      <p>
       These hair cuts seem to have both psychological and symbolic meanings. Many of these celebrities, like Britney Spears, wanted to be ‚Äúfreed‚Äù from their hair, though I am not sure if there is a deeper meaning to this all.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my research, blonde, long hair on women seems to be part of "sex kitten programming." Feel free to type in a google search on that. Perhaps when they (women celebs) cut their hair, they feel they break from that programming?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why Does This Matter?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be the dumbest post you read all day, or it could get your mind thinking. I definitely feel there is something more to hair, and I do think there is a conspiracy behind it.
I am not against women (or men) cutting or styling their hair, and each person has a right do decide what they do with their hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do believe is hair holds some type of power. Perhaps it is as simple as beautiful hair being associated with beauty itself.
Or it could be deeper than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps our hair does have spiritual significance. Why do men generally have their hair short, for example? This is a great article about why women have longer hair, and why men have shorter hair (generally of course):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://time.com/4348252/history-long-hair/">
        http://time.com/4348252/history-long-hair/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of sums it up here:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúHair is highly communicative, says Stenn, allowing individuals to send "messages of health, sexuality, religiosity, power" on first glance. It can be an expression of individual and group identity, and the the more attention a person (often a woman) is expected to devote to it, the more it can say. The scholar Deborah Pergament has written that hair's cultural and historic implications can be legally significant. "Inferences and judgments about a person's morality, sexual orientation, political persuasion, religious sentiments and, in some cultures, socio-economic status," she notes, "can sometimes be surmised by seeing a particular hairstyle."
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of power behind hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Conspiracy
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think women should cut their hair short, or dye it, or change it. I think if
       <em>
        feminists

       really care about women, they would advocate for their real hair. Of course, they will say it‚Äôs a women‚Äôs choice, and I agree (to an extent).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that women are hiding themselves with their hair, perhaps their inner selves. When I straighten hair, I am really denying a part of myself. When women color their hair, they are not truly being honest about what they look like. When older women dye their hair, they are trying to hide their age. In other words, whatever we seem to do ‚Äúdo‚Äù with our hair seems to be a deceptive practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am NOT AGAINST women doing anything with their hair. All I wonder is if there is a reason we feel compelled to. What part of ourselves are we hiding?
      </p>
      <p>
       When we deny our hair, are we denying an aspect of our spiritual selves? Grey hair says we are spiritually wise perhaps. Our natural hair color gives clues to our ethnicity and culture. Our hair style (curly, straight, whatever) gives clues to our genes.
Perhaps long hair makes us more sensitive, as women perhaps should be. When we cut our hair short, are we denying that sensitive part of ourselves?
      </p>

       This is conjecture of course, but I would love to hear your comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a fun conspiracy, and I hope we can have a fun discussion about it.

       . Anyways, there is something spiritual about long hair. I'm a man, and people call me Jesus (long hair and a beard). My hair is long, and I refuse to cut it.. It's like it's a part of me. Wound or scar, but a remembrance. I don't look at it as a style, but more as a part of my being. This can be dated back to ancient times. Personally, I think women who cut their hair short want to be dudes, in modern society and I'm turned off. Women are strong, but you do not need a haircut to prove it. That's like a jock getting a tattoo to prove "he's hard". No, you're a pussy, and self conscious...

       100% agreed. I equate it to that movie Avatar. Your hair is a spiritual connection to the world around you. My brother calls me "Chubby Jesus" because I'm a lil chubby, long hair, beard ... just like you Putes, only not as tall.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW; the worst period of my life happened when I had short hair. Not only did I feel off center, but my world literally caved in around me.

       I don't think this story was mentioned yet but the story of Samson from the Bible also would resonate this theme.

       Traditionally we really do not. The Natives held male hair in high respect. This can be seen from Native Americans to Pagans of the East in Europe (Slavs are one group). Cutting hair is more of a British thing (go back further to Rome)... Jesus had long hair and a beard, but a gentleman should not... It's a recently new thing, and I think there is something behind that... Women now think having short hair will give them authority of some sorts, no... They are playing into the same game men were forced into. Why do you think military men get shaved bald? Conformity. There is a case of the Navajo soldiers during WWII getting thrown off, because the military forced them to cut their hair...

       Women and men compliment each other. I will be honest, I like a woman who shaves but has long hair. It's weird, I suppose.. But, women love my long hair, they are actually jealous of it it (I'm jealous of their absolute beauty)... It's a [meta] topic, but yea... Yin/Yang... TPTB are trying to pervert this, imo...

       If you bothered to read all the articles you posted you would understand that civilization actually held long hair in high regards. You can find this prevalent in all societies (almost).
      </p>
      <p>
       Short hair became a trend because of lots of enslavement (cutting hair is a sign of defeat) also because of training men to be "soldiers" as opposed to "warriors".

       Soldiers are robots fresh off the assembly line and warriors are developed through internal and external struggles.

       Moelah was being a jerk, he literally restated what you said as if he was correcting you and added a very small additional example, and he started it all off with a pretty douchey sentence. Sorry for unnecessary comment but you've made a really great post here and I don't like seeing other commentors being so uppity about themselves and rude to the OP for no reason.

       On a side note, I shave my head after something bad happens in my life. I grow it out when things are good.

       I enjoyed your post, but it leaves me scratching my bald head wondering - So, what about us who shave or who are unable to grow hair? I actually enjoy my baldness.

       As a fellow baldy I'd like to propose the counter argument that many different types of monasteries would have their monks shave their hair for various spiritual reasons (Buddhist monks, medieval monks etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       If hair is a variable in spirituality then we are either the most spiritual or the least spiritual.

       Thanks! Yes I think the whole theory can be debunked because it's like saying somebody who does not have hair cannot be spiritual and I don't agree.

       Balding is a modern phenomenon that comes as the result of your body being polluted with environmental toxins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you saw a dog missing hair when it was walking down the street, you'd presume it was sick. Call it genetics if you like, some people are more prone to cancer. They're still sick. If your dad smoked and drank and his dad smoked and drank and his dad smoked and drank and your mom bless her soul was just the same, turns out you might not have won the genetic lottery. Oh wait that's like millions of people? Fuck.

       The military figured out many of the truths OP is telling long ago, which is why they suggest crew cuts and shorter hair styles, removal of facial hair etc. it makes them more compliant.

       nice post!

      <p>
       your hair is like spiritual antenna. the vril society were all over this. they kept their hair long af, claiming it helped them communicate with spirits or other dimensional entities or w/e you wanna call em. there's also the story about native american trackers who lost their nearly supernatural intuition and tracking abilities after being recruited into the army and cutting their hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       your hair is definitely a part of who you are, and cutting it can literally transform you into a different person overnight if you want it to.

       Your post is long so I might have missed it. But do you think that the relatively recent trend of shaved heads on men could be a way of controlling them by detachment from their past / spirit? Saying that cutting a man's hair makes it more suggestible to indoctrination. When you go into boot camp that's the first thing they do is shave your head. and the whole point of boot camp is reprogramming.

       Also, what is the relationship between religious tonsure and this hair-spirit theory? How about spirit-caps like Yarmulkes? Do they amplify the hair's nervous signals? Orthodox Jews don't shave‚Äîmaybe another connection?

       ive had this idea ever since i noticed longer hair on people after their first psych experiences
      </p>
      <p>
       i grew my hair long for a year, my friends got bushier or grew fancy beards after their first times too, so ive always contemplated what longer hair meant (other than being lazy unkempt stoners like stereotypes would have us believe)
      </p>
      <p>
       and older dudes with long hair are always so chill or goofy, i rarely ever met a crotchety grumpy old man with long hair, the grumps are always balding

       Hahaha, lol. Obvs statement is to general. I think we also have to consider that chill goofy old people are more likely to not listen to societal norms that tell men to have short hair. It becomes a bit of a chicken or egg kind of thing. When it comes to spirituality I don't believe in linear time, so perhaps it was both chicken (long hair) and egg (spiritual/anti normative attitude) first. I still can't figure out what the hair argument means for monks that shave. One idea is that different energies are received by different things, the Buddhists are very much focussed on full transcendence, they're aiming for infinity, perhaps the cosmic energy that is associated with that is better absorbed through the skin of the head, but psychic/extra sensory and spiritual vibes (which are more the focus of first nations and old civilizations) is better perceived through long hair. Just a thought

       Here is what has worked well for me:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Quit using shampoo. Run a search for "no poo" for a huge variety of options on how to go about doing this. Everyone is different and it might take some trial and error to figure out what is the best no shampoo method for you. Personally I wash my hair with a very mild castille soap diluted with water as needed. I do it about once a week, and even less during the winter when the air is dry. When I wash I focus only on my scalp and pretty much just give it a gentle massage with my fingertips, never using my nails.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Switch to a natural bristle hair brush. I use a wooden one and that change alone had a HUGE effect. I don't know how or why it worked, but it seriously reduced the grease and dandruff that builds up. I found I could wash my hair even
         <em>
          less
         </em>
         after I switched to a wooden brush. I only brush my hair when it is dry. I NEVER brush after a shower. I always let my hair air dry first. Any time I brush I brush my whole scalp in a methodical way. I go front to back, back to front, and side to side. While I do this I hold the intention of releasing any negativity and tension within me that is prepared to release. I've found this to be a very liberating way to brush my hair. It makes me feel calm, yet at the same time pleasantly energized. It has become a daily pleasure to mindfully brush my hair.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Raw apple cider vinegar. I have found that the ACV has to be raw for it to have any positive affect. What I do is I'll get a spray bottle of 50% vinegar and 50% water and spray my hair and scalp with it after I wash my hair, or any time I feel like I need it. I let it sit in my hair for a few minutes and then rinse it out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nettles! Nettles make a great hair tonic. I'll take a jar full of fresh or dried nettles and then pour boiling water over it and let it rest for a few hours, or over night. Then I strain it out and pour it over my hair when I'm in the shower. I also love to make nettle vinegar. I'll steep nettles in some raw apple cider vinegar for three days, and then use it like I explained above with the plain ACV. Nettle vinegar is also delicious and is great in salad dressings. I also drink a little bit every day, which I think has been good for my hair as well.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I don't ever use any dyes, hair dryers, spray, or products of any kind other than what I just wrote about. I've been no shampoo for 7 years and I thought that was great. But just in the last three months I have switched to the wooden brush and started using nettles...and my hair has never been healthier or more lush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, everyone is different and it'll be up to you to figure out what will work for you hair. My hair is slightly wavy, brown, and thin and this works great for me. If you have thick, black, and/or curly hair you might need to do something completely different! A lot of people use coconut or olive oil in their hair with extraordinary results.

       You are correct about hair products. I never use hairspray, mousse, gel etc. I only actually wash my hair with shampoo once every 3-4 days. Stripping your hair of it's natural oils everyday is not good for the health of your hair. I rinse it and comb it everyday, and I apply tea tree oil to my hair/scalp once a day, but I only use shampoo if my hair is legitimately dirty.
      </p>

       I believe diet plays a role, as well. My hair was fairly frizzy, and generally broken when I ate like shit. When I changed my diet over to non GMO, organic, and local, as well as cutting out most sugar, I discovered my hair because more full, silkier, and a little wavier.

       Yes, hair is linked to the soul. That is why people go grey as they get older, their connection from their soul to the physical world and their body is waning, so the power of the soul to be able to regulate the body's normal functions is decreasing hence their hair turns grey (unable to produce regular hormones). What actually happens is the soul gets further away from the body because we avoid our connection to this world. The more we avoid the further we are, makes sense right? That is why old people rarely do much, not because they are old, but they are old because they are 'less invested' in this planet. Some people are the exception, and they usually have more energy as a result (energy is basically the soul, or comes from it, the soul is an unlimited energy source it's just our bad choices take us away from it).
      </p>
      <p>
       The hair being cut is simply an attempt for, say, britney spears to take away her femininity. This is because her image is strongly linked to what attracts people and attention to her. She cut her hair to defy that, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, remember how when goku goes Super Saiyan his hair changes? ;) I think that's because it's a symbol of how our closer attachment to our soul can bring about blonder hair, but I'm not sure. The soul is sort've a gold blonde, so perhaps that is the symbol, when you cry and tap into your soul purely maybe it can manifest in physical changes like that.

       Very interesting read. Ancient Spartans wore their hair long. Before the final battle the ritual including cleansing yourself and applying aromas and oils to your hair to face death with dignity and glory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Demaratus told him that the Spartans will defend the place to the death and it was custom to wash and dress their hair with special care when they intended to put their lives in great danger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hairstyles ‚Äì Spartan men were known for their long, dreadlocked hair, which they believed, made a man look taller, more dignified and more terrifying.  It was said that long hair makes a handsome man even better looking and an ugly man more terrifying.  The beard was also worn long and braided with the upper lip shaved (no moustache similar to America‚Äôs own 16th President Abraham Lincoln).  When asked once why he wore his hair and beard long in the old fashioned style a Spartan replied, ‚ÄúSo I can see my grey hairs and never do anything unworthy of them.‚Äù
       </p>

       I think Samson lost his power when Delilah cut off his hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Native American Indians were slated to be used as trackers in Vietnam - they couldn't perform as soon as their hair was chopped off. So of course they took those poor souls in for a study and boom! They were not lying - they flat out couldn't track or perceive
       <em>
        danger
       </em>
       and lost their spiritual aura, this was
       <em>
        filmed
       </em>
       in one of the studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at least some men have spiritual connections to their head hair!

Touching a nerve: How every hair in skin feels touch and how it all gets to the brain

Neuroscientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have discovered how the sense of touch is wired in the skin and nervous system. The new findings, published Dec. 22 in Cell, open new doors for understanding how the brain collects and processes information from hairy skin.
"You can deflect a single hair on your arm and feel it, but how can you tell the difference between a raindrop, a light breeze or a poke of a stick?" says David Ginty, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. "Touch is not yes or no; it's very rich, and now we're starting to understand how all those inputs are processed."
Ginty and his colleagues study how the nervous system develops and is wired. In trying to understand how touch-responsive nerve cells develop, they set out to build new tools that enable them to look at individual nerve cells. According to Ginty, there are more than 20 broad classes of so-called mechanosensory nerve cells in the skin -- of which only six account for light touch -- that sense everything from temperature to pain. But until now, the only way to tell one cell from another was to take electrical recordings as each type of cell generates a different current based on what it senses.
The team first genetically engineered mice to make a fluorescent protein in one type of nerve cell -- called the C-type low-threshold mechanosensory receptor or C-LTMR. C-LTMR cells stretch from the spinal cord to the skin, and those cells containing fluorescent protein could be seen in their entirety under a microscope. The team found that each C-LTMR cell branched to send projections to as many as 30 different hair follicles.
Mice have three different types of hair: a thick, long guard hair that accounts for only about 1 percent of total hairs on the body; a shorter hair called the awl/auchene that constitutes about 23 percent of body hair; and a fine hair called the zigzag that makes up 76 percent of body hair. The team found that most of the C-LTMR cell endings -- about 80 percent -- associate with zigzag hair follicles, the rest with the awl/auchene and none with the guard hair follicles.
The researchers then similarly marked two other types of touch nerve cells and found that each hair type has a different and specific set of nerve endings associated with it. "This makes every hair a unique mechanosensory organ," says Ginty. Moreover, with their new marking tools, they found that each hair type is evenly spaced and patterned throughout the skin.
The team then wondered how all the input from these individual hairs is collected and sent to the brain. Using a different dying technique, the researchers were able to stain the other end of the cell, in the spinal cord. They found that the nerves connecting each patch of skin containing one guard hair and other associated smaller hairs line up in columns in the spinal cord -- neighboring columns correspond to neighboring patches of skin. They estimate that there are about 3,000 to 5,000 columns in the spinal cord, with each column accounting for 100 to 150 hair follicles.
So how does the brain interpret what each hair follicle experiences? "How this happens is remarkable and we're fairly clueless about it," says Ginty. But he suspects that the organization of the columns is key to how all the various inputs are processed before a message goes to the brain. And while people are not as hairy as mice, Ginty believes that many of the same structures are shared. This study and the new cell-marking tools they developed, he says, open a lot of doors for new research in understanding touch and other senses.
This study was funded by the National institutes of Health, the Johns Hopkins NINDS core imaging facility and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

       It would be very interesting to see if anybody has ever done a FOIA on the
       <em>

       - so yes, we can say that until then, this story will remain as a

       Men and women (sans a blessing of copious

       Yeah, male patterned baldness is a sucky thing and I think it is passed on by the mother - so blame us! LoL
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is when most men want to
       <em>
        walk stealth
       </em>
       they can and do. I think men in general have this ability over women but I can't prove it...I raised two boys, two girls (so only anecdotal) but women/female are louder in their
       <em>
        movements and energies
       </em>
       . Even my roommate, at 90% wheel chair bound walks crazy quiet!
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, we were created and designed this way with purpose!

       lol I've noticed this too, interesting that you noticed it as a women. Might be that men needed to be able to walk quietly for hunting but for women it wasn't biologically or evolutionally significant enough.

       Neat post. I also think it's a method of control, at the least, and my heart of hearts think there's something to the idea of it being a spiritual antenna. Like I love my longish hair, and I don't ever feel more spiritual, but I totally like being able to work in my field and get away with it without seeming dirty, or hippyish, or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of the old (I think Navajo, actually) stories that a person's hunting sense, which is like super intuition, came from their hair, and when they lost it, they lost the sense along with it? I don't have anything more to go on than that.. lol There are doctors today who don't cut their hair because of it, and I first heard of it from this cool ass dentist I used to work for who swore by it and told me the stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note, why do all dentists become bow hunters? Is it just in Texas? Doesn't make sense.

       I do think for women in particular our hair is receptive. I could be wrong though. I've had my hair long my entire life, so maybe that has made me as crazy as I am ;)

       Also another thing I want to point out... You're very focused on the man vs woman dichotomy. It's not really a dichotomy and the powers that be have programmed your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong and I'm sorry if I am but I've seen so many instances in this thread where I just get the feeling that you think men are out to get women.

       No at all. If you checked my post history it's the elite that are out to get men and women and mess with gender roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we should be careful of our biases. You're probably assuming things about me because I'm a woman...like I hate men or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I definitely am actually totally against the current men vs. Women status in our society, and I write about it all of the time.

      <p>
       I also do see some value in gender roles though.

       Very good point. The legend of the Rainbow Warriors also speaks of those with long hair as being the reformers that bring humanity into a new earth.

       Nice post. I have long hair and often toy with the idea of a pixie cut, but it's a huge deal for women. Crazy how altering something that replenishes itself can evoke strong anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of religions where men and women don't cut their hair.

       I'm surprised no one has pointed out what law of one had to say on the subject of hair.
       <br/>
       I think it was something about not being able to maintain a good communication channel with aliens/E.Ts/angels/demons/higher dimensional compound intelligences/the notorious G.O.D. if your hair isn't a certain length.

       Interesting.  I always had a full head of hair &amp; ended up growing it out a 4 or 5 years ago for some time.  However after 2 years of gang stalking, my hair on the top of my head starting thinning out which I assume was from the extreme levels of stress I was dealing with on a daily basis for an extended period of time.  Now that it's all said &amp; done, I've gone back to shaving my head which I did for most of my teen years.

       Great topic! I wish I had time to read all that right now OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've researched this topic before. I'm always reminded of the senses provided to animals through their whiskers. And there were some interesting things about the origins of military haircuts.

       This made me think of a study that was done during the vietnam war. There was a government program using native trackers. They were finding that when these young native men had their hair cut off, they seemed to lose their abilities to perform, as though they had lost their "sixth sense".
Here's a link to one article. A quick google search has more on this subject.

       The It should also be noted that probably the most well known and respected tracker in North America is Tom Brown Jr., and I've never seen a picture of him with long hair, or mention of the subject in his books, and he was trained by an old native guy, an Apache I think.

       its symbolism/superstition. Its reflected in many different religions and cultures. If you really believe long hair gives you some sort of supernatural ability, well that might just give you a boost in your confidence and this will make you feel different. Its like the placebo effect.

       I think the absence of hair might also be deeply symbolic, almost in the same way, by virtue of its absence‚Äîbuddhists, monks, and tonsure practices. (But that might be wishful thinking from a baldo.)

       Most dudes will say they keep their hair short for, essentially, security purposes.  Long hair is all fun and games until another dude grabs it in a fight.

       Here's my novel (or maybe a little insane) hair management practice. I raise sheep. While they grow their wool long and get a few dreads through the fall and winter, i let mine grow and do the same. When they get sheared in the spring, mine comes off too in solidarity (though not shorn right to the skin) ..haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure there's any deep spiritual meaning to this but it's practical for me as it is for them.

       After thinking about this a little bit, I feel I should point out the actual conspiracy. That advertisers and marketers go out of their way to trigger our insecurities to get us to buy crap we don't need. Think about how manipulative tobacco advertising was, the health and beauty industry is just as bad if not worse.

       Most of your readers here are going to be men. When you are writing your story, I strongly caution against any male bashing. For example, "no offense but men I never understood you." That's not a good way to reach out to your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only person who continues reading after being insulted is one who haven't yet learned to defend themselves. Or someone who can easily look over insults to try to get to the meat of the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective, instead of taking the time to read your long well thought out article. I'm taking to time to tell you I am offended and I'd rather not have to read an article that prefaces with an insult to my entire sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck to your endeavors on Reddit.

       Usually it's just to show that I don't want to speak for men.

       Na man, me personally, if I had something that epic to say, I'd try to reach out to as many people as possible. Especially because your not speaking on an inherently sexist subject to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, it's male bashing to say: as a sex you make no sense. Are you to think to get that? Like, as a sex, you all are raging rag bleeders. A generalization across the board can typically be taken as offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's better to not make haters than to say "haters gonna hate."

       It seems odd you have a ten page post then say you out no effort into it.

       Honestly I'd be trying to reach as large of an audience as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't worry, about ten white knight are about to come to your rescue telling you that they don't understand men either and that I am over reacting. Nevertheless, I personally would refrain from making large scale generalizations that can effectively turn off over 70% of your audience.

      <p>
       I wasn't male bashing.
      </p>

       If you even look at my post history it's pretty clear of my views and I think a lot of people know that.

      <p>
       I simply do not understand men as well and they can chime in from their point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is ridiculous and stupid. It sounds like you have some insecurities you need to address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the comments I go this is the only time I have ever been accused of male bashing in my history here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus. I'm over it. If you think women are out to get you, you might want to evaluate what you are actually feeling insecure about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of my post was just because I don't understand doesn't mean I think male are stupid. I'm just better at coming at my perspective as a woman.

       Hello I hope this reaches you‚òÜ I read this thread a while back but I am a permalurker, generally, but after reading this I went about my day until something hit me
I think you're onto something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some special kind of interaction or energy forms when your physically or iconally represent the beautiful flowerspiral of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe when your hair is at is full length it most closely resembles the perfect bloom of the universe.
Flowers do it, as do pinecones and shells and fruits and trees
Perhaps our hair is something for us like what leaves are for plants. Grass is for the earth. Who knowwss~~
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why baldness is also used in spiritual practice It represents a powerful moment in consciousness as well!
The flower of life blooms outward and inward.
Has anyone tried both to compare :D?

       Interesting stuff, but the main point that makes me keep my hair short is that long hair is a pain in the ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if long hair did indeed boost spiritual power, wouldn't the Asian monastic traditions adopt the practice instead of going the opposite route and shaving their heads?

       Well I just wrote this and got down voted haha but maybe hair makes us extra sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am wondering if that extra sensitivity would interfere with eliminating the ego, as many spiritual people try to do.

       Also it could just be practicality and maintenance related.

       Some of the things that influenced me (white male) to grow my hair out and have a bit of facial hair was Jesus  (who I believe was an ET/enlightened soul incarnating on earth to help) and many other spiritual figures has the long hair, like you said the first nations practiced growing the hair out, and I have almost never heard of an encounter or description of a "positive" alien that could grow hair and didn't have it super long. All of the Pleiadian space brother type contacts were with long haired beautiful men and women. There is also the testimony of Corey Goode who says he was present at a meeting of multiple inner earth civilizations who all had looked similar to humans (except for variations on skin colour and eye size) with long hair or no hair except for a group of short haired ones who were all male, and seemed fairly hostile and uncooperative at the meetings. 
Very circumstantial stuff, but I haven't heard of any nice aliens or higher civilizations with short hair so far.

       Yes, hair is linked to the soul. That is why people go grey as they get older, their connection from their soul to the physical world and their body is waning, so the power of the soul to be able to regulate the body's normal functions is decreasing hence their hair turns grey (unable to produce regular hormones). What actually happens is the soul gets further away from the body because we avoid our connection to this world.

       Excellent post! I've been thinking a lot about this lately and have to say that I 100% agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used to keep my hair short, shoulder length or shorter. I've since grown it out. TBH, it feels like energetic baggage now. When it was short I was more resilient, I could bounce back quicker. Now, not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why- when she was very young-I didn't want my daughters hair to be cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hair is powerful. There's a reason it's always used in magick, etc...it's your essence. Or "memory" as you put it.

       Yes I've been growing mine out super long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder to though if for men cutting the hair is valuable so they do not become "too emotional"

       Hope I'm making sense.

       That same thought crossed my mind. Perhaps it's purely coincidence that all of the men I've known with long hair or the artistic and "dreamy" type?

       You're making perfect sense, I'm right there with you.  There might be something to this

       Fair enough, I just think there's more important things going on than needing to dissect 20 year-old TV shows or talk about hair ... especially when these are two things that pretty much are irrelevant to much of the developed world.

       To you. I disagree. Spirituality is mental masturbation. It exists only for those with food in their stomachs and a roof over their heads. Things are serious right now, which requires focus and resolve to overcome.  Playing a violin while a city burns has historically not been the best plan of action.

       There are people in the world who have little to nothing ans face tragedy everyday, and have their spritual happiness that keeps them alive. So I disagree.

       I think I replied to you on accident. I was agreeing with you and saying I disagree with the notion the other commenter said about spirituality not being important right now.

       I was dealing with some heavy ptsd and was taking lsd as a "short cut" through therapy, and then kind of stated to a deity I have affinity to that I "just wanted to feel like a different person and really get past this" (the emotions).. and then I lost all my hair! alopecia universalis.. it was long to my waist before, almost at my hips. It worked in a satisfying way. But I wish it would grow back more than just little baby hairs.
