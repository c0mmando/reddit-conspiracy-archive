       Funny how when bad news comes out about Trump a couple posts come up about it on this sub (probably more than necessary, admittedly) and suddenly there is an influx of posts about "reject the left/right paradigm" and "Both sides are the same" and "(X) is the real enemy!" It's a noticeable pattern....until the marching orders from T_D come along, and suddenly that narrative gets picked up here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/9HkHOBs">
        This is the front page from a few minutes ago
       </a>
       ; see how the first post that's against the right-wing narrative is still there (with the most upvotes, to this subs credit) and all the others come after , just a few hours to get the links from T_D and repost them, not always changing the headline (and in-between some shill accusations to stall for time).  Suddenly, all the gatekeeping posts disappear and everyone is enjoying their time rolling around in the slop. Come tomorrow, when the high wears off and no one but Alex Jones is pursuing it, this sub will go back to normal, with some of that 9/11 Truther/Bigfoot/JFK conspiracy goodness....until the President sticks his foot in his mouth again and the cycle begins anew.
      </p>

       So much "I'm not a Trump Supporter, but" bullshit; if you're going to act and post like a Trump Supporter, then just be sincere about it. I'm a progressive Liberal (that voted for Bernie in the primaries but still voted for Hillary in the general), and if you want to shit on me for that go ahead, but at least I admit it. How about you?

       Well if you do not like nazis, then maybe you should control yourself and not call everybody you disagree with nazis. The problem with progressives is they abuse words so much that they lose their meaning. It is because progressives run primarily on sentimentality and psychological tricks of manipulation to get their way.

       No. You got me there. I just do not like to hear people getting called nazis when they obviously are not nazis. Kind of like the fascist stuff. The low level at which people are fascist makes almost every capitalist a fascist these days.

       So they censor everything that goes against the narrative?

       As far as I know, and thats not much, they have only directly censored CNN, but allow archive posts of CNN.  The banning of CNN isnt to prevent CNN information from getting on the sub, its to prevent ad revenue and clicks from benefiting CNN financially.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can archive a CNN story and post it there no problem. I think this sub does the same thing, but cant remember.

       progressives utilize peer pressure, shame, and other forms of manipulation in order to stifle dissent. What else would you expect from progressives? They utilize words as tools of power, because all they care about is the struggle for dominance. They have turned humanity into a social experiment. This is why progressives are losing, because they are realizing that they never had the moral high ground, and in fact are sanctimonious shallow minded libertines.

       There's the old hats who have been here a good while. Then there's the 2016 election crowd. Then there's the motherfucking spambots. Then there's the lowest of the low, the real shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a mixing pot of these groups. Less old hats around now. Lots of disinformation and distractions. Pretty interesting to see what goes up and down on here, see the different comment sections, see what gets pushed and what isn't broached at all. Definitely a lot of manipulation going on from a lot of different parties on reddit in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I have a theory that groups like cambridge analytica et al scumsucking social manipulators probably show off their handiwork from reddit at trade meetings)

       Where do you think Cambridge Analytica learned the tricks of their trade? The social sciences are notoriously left wing fields, and have been used by the neolibs/neocons for a long time. Cambridge Analytica is one of only a few types of groups you can target because the rest of them work for left wing progressive groups! You guys just do not like seeing your own sneaky tricks used against you. I hate them as well, so I say progressives should play fair and not utilize this shit either.

       Progressives have taken over the fields of the social sciences. Cambridge Analytica utilizes these fields and others to do what they do. The neoliberals and neocons have been utilizing these tools for a long time. When progressives see their tools being used against them, it makes them mad. And rightfully so! These methods are underhanded and evil. Playing games with the minds of men and women.  I was assuming you were a progressive. That is why I said "you people".

       Anyone can post anything. It's why I hate people saying 'this sub' or 'our sub' when literally anyone can join in at any time. It is actually what makes this place great, and hardly a uniform community, which is also great.

       I tend to just let both sides scream past me. European politics might be more centrist anyway, but I like not always having to sit in the crossfire of political extremes, at least in daily life. I kinda love / hate this place for doing exactly that though: putting you in the uncensored crossfire.

       Any post calling this sub alt right territory is going to be instantly down voted. Instead of doing that you should challenge their narratives and comments in a reasonable way. There is a massive game of tug'o'war going on in this sub but calling people out on it directly is a bad idea. Dont let them drive you away. Even if you're the minority here, for the time being, don't give up. You have to realize this isnt us versus them.. This is truth versus misinformation and propaganda. There is no left versus right and the sooner people stop seeing the world like this the better. I fucking swear too many people are giving into this new reality of hate..

       Think about it this way... how often do you hear the term "right wing conspiracy theory" compared to "left wing conspiracy theory"? A conspiracy sub is naturally gonna lean towards the side sporting the biggest, bestest. mostest conspiracy theories... and there are more "right wing" conspiracy theories by far.

       Good idea! Support measures that end First Past the Post voting (not unlike the Ranked Choice voting that was passed by voters in Maine) and take power away from the two-party system.

       Maine doesn't facilitate sales yet. Silly but some places will give you a free gift with donations, much the same her in DC. Was told pot shops by next summer. Love Maine, just got home from their. Their goods were mostly homegrown, but it was different, so that was nice. Not as potent but did the job.

       I'm a dorsal fin too, I like the direction the renewed or reinvented Republican party young people are going in... like the new right not the old Neocons or anything. It seems closer to center right actually and nationalist. All plusses for me.

And while more lean toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party, Young Outsiders express unfavorable opinions of both major parties. They are skeptical of activist government; a substantial majority views government as wasteful and inefficient. Yet they diverge from the two conservative typology groups – Steadfast Conservatives and Business Conservatives – in their strong support for the environment and many liberal social policies."

       Not only good but natural, and "Nationalist" is the
       <em>
        least racist one can be
       </em>
       ! To me if you are a citizen, you are my natural peer. I don't see race, that is the thing of the left. I see person, then after that quality of character and principle.  I can't conceive of not being nationalist and am shocked it is even a thing at all! Its a given!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not naturally nationalist, your focus then is on what divides and on what serves you, if you are naturally nationalist, your focus is on what unites and what you can serve and proudly be part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me even the question not to be nationalist by default, for any party is insane and implies treason and loyalty to "other" things:likely  a dark, unjust, dictatorial globalist idea and a threat to our sovereignty, our history and sacrifices. it is sheer
       <em>
        madness
       </em>
       in my mind to not be nationalist without even requiring saying it. If you're not, then what the hell are you, and why would I trust you in my schools, near my kids, on our roads?...

       I feel there are certain traditions, IDEALS and VALUES that make it unique and in some ways better and inherently much stronger in certain unique ways because they distinguish and fuel its unique energy.  First and foremost; liberty and rights based on the individual, not the race, group, identity, penis, pussyhat or schlong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second its unique deeply rooted tradition of Resistance to tyranny. Like no other anywhere ever on earth. Most of the freedoms the world knows since out foundation are direct results of us doing the right thing and ripple effects.
WE ended global Slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE ended the monarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We above all things resist tyranny as our founding mission and we are unique for it. Which we are once again under yet another attempt to bring us and the world low... listen to how these liberal traitors just here on Reddit, or on news or even daily life presume authority over our minds, our speech, our  thoughts, and assume authority over us all to define, and harass everything by their standards ONLY. They act like they own us! I can;t even say I am a nationalist without instantly being insulted by one, attacked and then told about I must refine my thoughts and words "correctly" according to their overwatch. LITERALLY! Its madness! It is insane tyranny to levels we have not seen since the inquisitions and the monarchy was overthrown.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to distinguish between Patriotism and Nationalism because they are euphamisms for Individual rights and collectivism. Perhaps a cowardly way to vouch for globalist overthrow (cucking out)  and control while pretending to have a loyalists spine. "I'm really a "patriot" while George Soros  ass rapes us into  a communist new world Order one world dictatorship, I LOVE what used to be the United States! Really I DOOOOO! Believe me I do guyz!"

       It's worth mentioning that you
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       edited your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are describing is a type of extremism to me - on so many fronts.  And sadly, I don't think you have any idea of the difference between patriotism and nationalism and, if I thought it would do any good, I'd highly recommend you do some serious reading on the subjects.  But I'm afraid you are too far down the "
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       are evil" rabbit hole to ever catch a breath of fresh air.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, in the event you're ever bored and want to expand your mind and step out of the narrative you've been taught - I suggest you start with a simple "patriotism vs. nationalism" google search.  Because after reading your edit, I'm positive that I am everything you love to reject and hate, yet you are so, so wrong to do so.

       Edits? Yes I do that, I'll type and see how I feel it came out, spelling, whatever, then edit, to refine what I am trying to say. I tend to run on then go back and shorten it all down to the most relevant points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odd that you would note edits as if to suggest in veiled fashion there is something wrong with refining ones own words to communicate better. You seem to think everything that happens does so at your approval. As if simply speaking with you is a hostile encounter, where you are looking for reasons to attack. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I resent you judging me as you are very deeply, my family dates literally back to a noteworthy colonel with my same last name in the revolution who literally wrote the first history of the American Revolution by an Infantryman Soldier, Benjamin Franklin, his friend and patron printed it.

       I grew up with this as a framework and daily influence.  I do not need a primer or your condescension, pre approval to feel and arrogance concerning the difference between nationalism and patriotism because I am both by default and naturally.

      <p>
       I did not ask you to judge me, or assume to define what I am allowed to  think or feel. You have no right to assume what I know and do not. What I feel and how I should feel it. How dare you. You should not be preaching to me. Who the hell are you to assume to define me? You literally act as if you think you have some ownership over me and my very existence and range of acceptable thought is by your grant of license! Your attitude and arrogance is exactly why we had the 1st revolution and who we fought! You and those like you have become the tyrannical control freaks!
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked how i feel, and I was honest in my sentiments. Nothing in what I feel or said has any malice toward anyone, unlike yourself. You treat me like an enemy and I am not your enemy! How did you get like this and why? What is wrong with you? Who made you this insane?

       Whoa buddy, you're throwing a lot of accusations and should calm down.  The problem with editing is that it alters the discussion after the fact.  Editing grammar is one thing, editing content (which is what you've done at least TWICE) is altogether different, especially in a discussion forum.  But whatever - you do you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never asked you how you felt.  I asked if you thought nationalism was a good thing.  Your
       <em>
        original
       </em>
       response sounded more like patriotism than nationalism, so I pointed it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who is sitting in judgement of whom?  You went on some rant about liberal traitors, ass rapers, tyrannical control freaks and cucks.  So give me a fucking break with your claims of persecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand by my (unaltered) statement and, after this discussion, double down on the dangers of nationalism.  Because your kind of "love of country" looks a little crazy, friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since your "family dates literally back to a noteworthy colonel with the same last name in the revolution who literally wrote the first history of the American Revolution" yada fucking yada... I'm sure you are already aware of the following quote by our very first President of the United States about the dangers of nationalism, but I'll leave it here just for a refresher:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.”

       Your first question was the very validity of positive consideration toward both pat and nat! (Is that a good thing?) You're right, the original "sounded" more positive toward both because it is and was! I just felt in the original draft I ran on too long about it unnecessarily and so shortened it. How can one

       This is the liberal line that makes me furious  in its blatant deciet! First off there are no dangers of nationalism and the idea is seeking to imply nazism which is a socialist idea not a nationalist idea, trying to cast the two as one idea is a globalist attempt to slander. Globalism is the nazi fascism by definition, no nationalist declared a
       <em>
        world order
       </em>
       , HITLER DID.

       Second your attack on what is natural loyalty for anyone born in any country anywhere by calling it crazy is in itself Marxist crazy!

       <strong>
        The quote at the end you left is directly from Horkheimers the Frankfurt school of Marxism and an example of critical theory, which is ideological subversive warfare and attempt to subvert or overthrow society by appealing and reinforcing leftist ego (your "refresher" comment is ego reinforcement/condescension) while trying to overwhelm others by using constant accusatory defamation (baseless slander, false witness and accusations)

       And here is the crux of our problem.  It is absolutely possible to be "too patriotic or too nationalistic" - did you learn nothing from Nazi Germany?  Or are you one of the ones who believe it never happened?  What about North Korea?  I'd say their nationalism has gone

       Nazi fascism is liberal socialism and Hitler was a socialist. There is nothing whatsoever in simple nationalism that has to do with nazi fascism. It is only a false accusation for ideological warfare.

       North Korea is communist (like YOU), not nationalist!

       "we are becoming a global world" is a slogan meaning nothing just like Obamas "yes we can".
      </p>
      <p>
       All your arguments seek to do the same thing, elevate external cultures over our own and destroy our own values and ideals for a one world globalism by constantly criticizing in a disingenuous accusatory light our own! You want to destroy, demoralize, subvert and weaken your own host country and you think it is virtuous not seditious to DO IT!  PERIOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       If North Koreas veil is falling apart for the young people there under its COMMUNIST SOCIALISM it is because OUR WESTERN CULTURE and REPUBLICAN IDEALS based on the rights of the INDIVIDUAL not COLLECTIVE LIBERALISM are penetrating and bringing it down the same way the nearly identical SOVIET UNION fell while Reagan was in office!
      </p>
      <p>
       If North Korea falls it is not  due to anything liberalism helped with, in fact it would have fallen long ago if liberals haven't been undermining us since before WWII!

       I'd like to believe you are, in reality, a smart guy who gets off on being a provocateur.  But more likely you are either incredibly ignorant or a mouthpiece for some far right wing agenda.  Either way, I'm done.  Not only are you wrong, you are full of arrogance AND have zero ability to debate rationally.  Which makes you an absolute waste of time.  Good day.

       That's why a variety of sources is important. If their ideological opposite agrees on most of it, then you know that part is true. If they report one part as different, then you can isolate where the spin is. But it requires a broad variety of new sources to do this truth-finding properly

       To what end?  If your theory rang true, and there was "shilling", but it was for your "side", then you'd have never made this thread to begin with.  That's the pinnacle of dishonest to assert otherwise.

       Good idea! Support measures that end First Past the Post voting (not unlike the Ranked Choice voting that was passed by voters in Maine) and take power away from the two-party system.

       I'm a dorsal fin too, I like the direction the renewed or reinvented Republican party young people are going in... like the new right not the old Neocons or anything. It seems closer to center right actually and nationalist. All plusses for me.

        "This overwhelmingly Republican group holds very conservative attitudes across most issues, including social policy and the size and scope of government. However, they generally are critical of business and Wall Street. Overall, Steadfast Conservatives also express highly negative attitudes toward immigrants and take a skeptical view of U.S. global involvement."

       But you said "everything Fox News said about Seth Rich is fake news" implying that the opposite of what they said is true, and that they never reported

        any
       </em>
       true things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good lie is 9 parts truth per 1 part lie. So while it was fake news, not EVERYTHING they said about it was fake news, or else it wouldn't be a good lie
