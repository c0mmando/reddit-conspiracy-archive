       Are you serious about this? If so, how old are you? You should know I have basically no money, and I'm going to be working in childcare for two months with a charity and then will start the Ciclo Básico Común at the University of Buenos Aires in March. Part of the reason I'm leaving America is that I can't afford college or medical bills, which are brutal here. My parents are a safety net, but all of the money they give me will be transferred to Argentine currency and saved in case the (Petro)dollar is devalued. I will be living off my savings. If you move to Argentina all I can give you is a place to sleep, some delicious but cheap vegetarian food, and to translate for you and help you learn Spanish if you don't already know. I have literally nothing in the USA and life will go hard for me here even if the system doesn't collapse, so U don't intend to return.

       This is so true, the perfect amount is just enough to live comfortably. The key to happiness is to do something you love. Don't listen to the people who tell you that you have to spend half your life in a cubicle doing something that drains your soul just to have more money.

       Well, I think that America is a target. Russia, the Middle East, North Korea, and all the many countries the US government has fucked over have it out for us. There will be no sympathy for us when the petrodollar collapses. No one really has it out for Argentina or Uruguay. If shit
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       hits the fan, Patagonia is beautiful and Ushuaia would be a great place to live in seclusion. Far away from America as any country, to get away from the nuclear fall out, if it comes to that.

       We've been to south America twice thinking to retire there but ultimately decided against it for ourselves, but I do think south America holds a lot of promise in the upcoming shitstorm. In many ways it's a removed and self contained place, and there is still plenty of room newcomers.

       I recently read that of the top 10 countries in SA for expats, Argentina is #2, neighboring Chile #1.

       I wish you the best of luck.

       I'm a young lady :) but thank you. I chose Argentina because I have a few friends there, because even if nothing hits the fan, it's a beautiful place to live and their health/post-secondary education system is much more egalitarian than ours. If shit hits the fan to the point where shit hits the fan in Argentina, there is a vast, sparsely populated wilderness in the South which provides the best chance of safety. Also, Argentines aren't hateful of Americans (Dustin Luke, for example) like Italians seem to be (Amanda Knox). Italy was my first choice because my grandmother was Italian.

       I did give it to you straight. I think there is a mass awakening happening around the world. People are waking up to the truth. Evil will soon be defeated. We are entering into a new earth age - The Age of Aquarius.

       Isn't the Age of Aquarius the age we are in now? Of corruption and sin in the name of "liberation" and "free love"? I thought you were alluding to some kind of personal mission, that you were a person of importance.

       Huh. I didn't mean to insult you by the way. Aside from my brother, parents, and grandparents, I'm important to no one. 
But seriously you seem like a nice person and even if you think the age of Aquarius will happen, don't disregard the signs when something big hits the fan.

       "Ruin my life" 
I don't see how moving to Argentina would ruin my life. In America I have one father, one mother, and one brother. My grandparents are in their 80's and will sadly die soon. My parents plan to move abroad to retire, and my brother routinely calls me a "cunt" and a "whore" (It's not his fault, he has Asperger's) I have no money, no health insurance, no friends... nothing except a few thousand dollars in my teen checking account. I have weighed my options carefully, since I was 12. If I stay in the US, I will have to go to community college and get into debt, IF I'm lucky enough not to suffer any health complications, which is likely because I have a pre-existing heart condition. How is that better than going to Argentina where I could become a doctor or a lawyer in a few years if I just work hard enough? I already speak the language. I already have friends there. You don't know me, and you don't know what's best for me. I've had to figure that out by myself.

       Haha, okay....and why is that? I have spoken Spanish since I was five, and I have enough money. I have a place to stay and work for two months starting in December. I already have multiple friends in Argentina, some of which I have known for years. 
If I can't survive there, I don't think I can survive here, so I might as well kill myself?

       Just based on that attitude, it's clear you wouldn't make it.

       You've never worked for anything, and you think you can just magically move to a 3rd world country to become a doctor or lawyer lol.   If you cant survive here, you won't survive there.

       I've never worked for anything? I've been working for the last 3 years and I already have a job set up. Also, Argentina isn't a third world country...there are nice parts and there are shitty parts just like everywhere else (But I suppose you haven't seen any of the shitty parts of the US, have you?) Also, did I ever mention bumming off of anyone? I have my own money and time to find a part-time job, and my own family can help me out a bit as well. I mentioned that I had friends to demonstrate that I have connections to the country, not potential cash cows. I also never said that I could magically become a doctor or lawyer...I'm just saying it would be a hell of a lot easier there because I wouldnt have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars each year until I'm in my mid-twenties just for the title. 
I intend to work when I get there, not just be a parasite to the system, just like I would be working here. Also, plenty of American students go abroad to study (Many US students are enrolling in Canadian universities, another country with socialized medicine) and many foreign students come here to study, so why am I some kind of naive parasite when I do it? Just because one of my many reasons is that I fear the United States may become unstable in the near future? Because I don't want to become hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt or wait until I'm older to even enroll? I just don't see it that way.

       Also what do you mean by there's no danger. It seems like you are the one being naive. If I go to Argentina, I can always...move back. Did you see how North Korea just tested out a nuclear bomb that almost hit Japan? Yeah, that had the capacity to reach Chicago, maybe even DC. A few months ago, I remember hearing that North Korea didn't have any nukes with that capacity. So either the North Koreans have been hiding their best weapons and are getting ready to initiate a war, or they have improved them significantly in a short period of time. Don't be a lemming, my friend. My dad is the same way, he acknowledges how scary things are and then just tells me not to worry about the things I can't control. Even in the event that nothing happens, my life would be better in Argentina simply due to the fact that I would be able to get an education and treat myself without becoming a debt slave.

       I think the irony will be is that most of us have lived in complete comfort our entire lives. There are very few I know who suffer as greatly as we hear about countries in the news.

       And it's so easy for everyone to ignore.

       I'm about to show my age, but lets just say I've been around for several decades.  I also grew up in a family of preppers.  Gotta wait in line for gas, or get gas on certain days?  THE END IS NEAR!  Carter is president?  THE END IS NEAR!  Reagan is President?  Gaddafi is coming for us?  Clinton is president?  THE END IS NEAR!  Y2K happened, 9/11 happened, Iraq happened, 2012 happened?  THE END IS NEAR!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been preparing for the end for so long, and through so many anti-christs - it truly is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prepping and conspiracies are in my blood, which is why I am here
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       preparing and paying close attention.  But ultimately, I have stopped thinking the sky is falling.  I don't believe it's ever going to fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the thing - even if it
       <strong>
        does
       </strong>
       , I'm good.  I live where I am happy.  I love the people I surround myself with.  I have a job I enjoy, and I contribute to society.  My family is still burrowing in their bunkers freaking out at every news story.  Me?  I'm living large.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever you do, where ever you go - don't worry so much about the sky falling and focus instead on finding happiness in the moment.  Because truth is - you could be wiped out tomorrow from a falling piano in the sky.  And
       <em>
        alllllll
       </em>
       that worrying about "the end" would have been for nought.

       "Ruin my life" 
I don't see how moving to Argentina would ruin my life. In America I have one father, one mother, and one brother. My grandparents are in their 80's and will sadly die soon. My parents plan to move abroad to retire, and my brother routinely calls me a "cunt" and a "whore" (It's not his fault, he has Asperger's) I have no money, no health insurance, no friends... nothing except a few thousand dollars in my teen checking account. I have weighed my options carefully, since I was 12. If I stay in the US, I will have to go to community college and get into debt, IF I'm lucky enough not to suffer any health complications, which is likely because I have a pre-existing heart condition. How is that better than going to Argentina where I could become a doctor or a lawyer in a few years if I just work hard enough? I already speak the language. I already have friends there. You don't know me, and you don't know what's best for me. I've had to figure that out by myself.
