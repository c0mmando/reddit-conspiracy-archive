You see we expect the cheating lying money grubbing business man to cheat. We do not expect the poor mans advocate: the democrats to be cheating, lying, money grubbing in the face of a huge  humanitarian disaster. The democrats are just like the republicans they are just more hypocritical. They will both rob you blind, but Clinton will do it for humanitarian reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually there was no Haitian government many were actually dead from the earthquake. The government that the NGOs were dealing with were the crime gangs that were controlling everything. Instead of the clintons requesting military presence and getting the country out of the hands of the criminals they simply bribed them and kept the money. How do I know because I worked for an NGO. I have friends who died in the rubble. There were many NGOs that were forced to wait in airports with aid rotting on the runways. Haitians hate clintons for good reason.

Trump&#39;s &quot;charity&quot; is not a public charity which means it doesn&#39;t have to meet strict standards of transparency and we only know if he has been using that money for himself if someone investigates and discovers this fact.  Someone has investigated and in Trump has been using the money he collected for charity for his own benefit which is why he was making these accusations about Clinton.  They were actually a confession about himself.  In fact there is evidence he is so cheap and grasping he literally used funds collected for his charity to pay for his kid&#39;s scout&#39;s fees one year -
 who the hell steals $7.00 from their own charity?</p>

<p>His son&#39;s cancer &quot;charity&quot; also looks rather dodgy by the way.</p>

<p>The question is: what is the best tax policy and why?</p>

<p>Completely throw out all of the other words: Republican, Democrat, conservative, progressive, they&#39;re all designed to put you back into the 2 camps thinking. Things like &quot;I&#39;m conservative, but not a Republican&quot; are a little bit useful, but it&#39;s still ideology.</p>

<p>Much better if you simply look at each issue in isolation: when should abortion be legal and why? How should we raise revenue to fund the government? How many people should we let into the country, and from what countries?</p>

<p>There is nothing in your response to any of these questions that should control your response to the other questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I totally agree.  But I often see sentiment in this sub that the media or government is splitting us into these two camps.  I think it&#39;s the opposite - we ourselves have done this (tribalism or whatever) and the media and politicians are using this to their own advantage.  Just look at the shit show that is our current media - it&#39;s all targeted to a specific audience.  But it isn&#39;t because the MSM is forcing us into these camps, rather we are doing that naturally and they are profiting off it, and of course fanning the fires in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today&#39;s liberals are all about labeling some speech ok, while disallowing other types of speech.  That is a demonstrable fact.  Any way you slice it, that is not being about free speech.  Being in favor of free speech is being in favor of a person&#39;s right to express themself, even if you happen to find it offensive.  The term hate speech is made up, and largely misapplied.</p>

<p>Only if they are delusional, because the 1st amendment protects the right to free speech, but that won&#39;t stop them from trying to marginalize speech they disagree with.</p>

<p>i wrote the 24 questions and submitted them to a hostile audience for peer review. you have at your fingertips the collective wisdom of dozens of individuals, and yet between all of them, they can&#39;t debunk the OP</p>

<p>want to know why they can&#39;t debunk the OP?</p>

<p>because its 24 questions, not 24 statements of fact. </p>

<p>if you believe the questions themselves are wrong, i encourage you to honor that hard-earned diploma of yours by paraphrasing them in your own words. </p>

<p>i have made this challenge to many people, and only one person took me up on it. he wrote a blog somewhere. it was pretty good, but at the end of the day he still believes that men walked on the moon, which makes him a loser. i hope he still thinks about it. the thoughts were burned into his mind when he read the material closely enough to comprehend and paraphrase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from somebody who was a pretty hardcore Lefty during the Bush years, there is an entire world of difference between the liberals of now and the liberals back then.  The Bush-era liberals had actual principles and were closer to libertarian ideology and thought, and had a perfectly healthy skeptical view of the government in any circumstance.  The current gen of Obama-raised lefties are pro-government, pro-MSM, myopic cultural Marxists without a shred of self-awareness of their own hypocrisy, almost completely centered on American politics without regard to how America functions on the larger World stage as an <em>empire</em> and oppressive force, and are more concerned with gender and identity politics and censoring alternating viewpoints that they don&#39;t like rather than weighing in on actual important issues concerning the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah its pretty upsetting to see. </p>

<p>to summarize the gist, from what i gather, is that in the &quot;cum panda&quot; niche of CP, the object is a child with overly blackened eyes, either from a &quot;black eye&quot; (shiner, evidence of physical abuse), or by very heavy black make-up around the eyes... hence &quot;panda&quot;</p>

<p>it makes me sick even thinking about it. and to think, the owner of Comet Ping Pong is so in-to this niche of CP that he got involved in publishing a magazine that promotes this niche?</p>

<p>so the normies obviously don&#39;t want to see this stuff. they don&#39;t want to know. they don&#39;t want nightmares...</p>

<p>but then they go on to insist that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; this guy is a paedosadist. </p>

<p>This issue is compounded by the assumption that if you support one conclusion on one issue, you must have bought in <em>whole-cloth</em> to <em>every</em> piece of dogma loosely associated with that group. It&#39;s convenient short-hand when you interact briefly with a large number of people every day and need a strawman in order to virtue-signal for an audience and feel better about social recognition in the form of upvotes or karma or likes or just attention.</p>

<p>WBC protests funerals and claim to be religious? Clearly all religious people are intolerant cultish nutbags who hate homosexuals.</p>

<p>College-aged crybabies advocate for segregating schools based on race and shut down speeches from ideological opponents? Clearly all progressives are racist antifa protofascists incapable of dealing with dissent.</p>

<p>Person in the rust belt votes Trump as a protest against the establishment? Clearly everyone not living on a coast is an inbred hillbilly retard who believes Adam and Eve rode dinosaurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think it&#39;s more an artifact of two-party systems. Where I live. we have proportional representation by party, so we have several parties on the left arguing with other parties on the left as well as arguing between parties on the right. Nobody gets a simple majority so there&#39;s always coalitions and compromises made which tend to even out over time.</p>

<p>It makes for a more lively political debate capable of showing more nuance than simple us-them tribalism.</p>

<p>The decision simply reaffirms what&#39;s been true since the Bill of Rights was originally penned....so no really just recently when you think about it.  Liberals in this country have tried to attack free speech, but they have failed massively.  In fact, their attacks on free speech contributed to Trump&#39;s success.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other politicians have suggested otherwise</p>

<p>Who cares?  The SCOTUS is the final authority on the law vs the Constitution.  as such, what liberals who wish to restrict speech think is meaningless, especially considering the court will lean conservative for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>You have free speech, but you can be fired because the private company you work for doesn&#39;t like what you said.  The 1st amendment doesn&#39;t protect you from any legal backlash, but it does protect your right to express yourself regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not trying to refute anything, just clarifying the first amendment and what it protects.  Employment protections in America are very weak in general, and you can be fired for practically any reason, or no reason at all.  The 1st amendment wasn&#39;t designed to protect your job.  It was designed t protect your right to criticize the government, and unfortunate as it may sound, just because you lose your job doesn&#39;t mean you cannot go outside and protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay thats true, but like Carlin said &quot;Never undersestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.&quot; And it&#39;s honestly one of the flaws of democracy, and other countries have already lost free speech, so I think that even though it&#39;s remote there is always a possibility of losing any of our rights and the last thing we should do is underestimate those who want to take away our freedom.</p>

<p>The solution is distributed power so that people have an option which community they want to belong to like Europe. One of the trends Ive seen lately is that libs are super against state&#39;s rights and the cite BS like some states being mean to trans people but that is flawed logic because look what just happened with Trump and the supposed military ban, so that is a good way to refute that argument. My theory is that teachers and shills are influencing libs so that they will reject giving small groups decentralized power. When I was in school my teacher was actually telling us about the benefits of california and the PNW spltting from the union and the cali exit thing was popular for a while, but now I think there is a trend to push for centralized power as much as possible. </p>

<p>Makes me warm and fuzzy that we are a Constitutional Republic...at least on paper.  Had that not been the case, we&#39;d have easily lost the 1st amendment by now imho.</p>

<p>The states gave that up in favor of a Constitution they felt would restrict the federal government in a sufficient manner so as to ensure it would not become tyrannical.  Unfortunately through things like the commerce clause the fedgov has slowly over time increased its rights at the expense of ours.</p>

<p>Go study international tax policy and the interplay of taxes between countries. If you read Alexander Hamilton&#39;s writing on this, he was much more concerned about how we tax than whether we &quot;tax the rich&quot; or not.</p>

<p>For example, a high tariff &quot;taxes the rich&quot; but it also drives up the wages of your workers, because it created incentives to invest in capital in your country (capital investments increase productivity, which allows workers to negotiate higher wages).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the US income tax is currently driving down wages because it creates a disincentive to invest in the US (35% income tax if you make it in America, vs. ~10% if you make it another country with an Irish/Dutch tax avoidance scheme).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minarchism may be left-conservative. Socialist policy needs some form of government to make it happen, and simple socialism like universal healthcare, basic income, while eliminating corporate welfare, the prison and military industrial complexes, that sort of thing, would be vastly (vastly) cheaper and more effective than what we have today. Life would be so much better for almost everyone, and the government would be much, much smaller. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t just eliminate the prison and military complexes. Some people need to be in jail and we need to be able to defend ourselves. Basic income is a horrible idea, as it will just lead to inflation and small businesses will be heavily impacted. Unconditional Universal healthcare is expensive as fuck, and comes with a lot of problems like shortages of doctors and long wait times. Just look at anywhere it is deployed. Not to mention all the other things the government pays for, like roads and and schools. And by eliminating corporate welfare do you mean ALL welfare as well? Like social security or Medicaid? Or just eliminating tax incentives for private businesses? Basic income + no corporate welfare = no small businesses and large corporations will dominate. It most certainly would not be cheaper. Anywhere socialism exists, it does not work. Socialism will never ever mesh with capitalism. That&#39;s why our current system does not work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a really conservative friend who is really into politics, he said to me the number one problem in the US is the pendulum effect. He said that as they swing from side to side both groups are getting more extreme, especially the core supporters and only a few swings before the US either gets a communist leader or a Nazi. He later stated after the election that he fears where it ends up next more than trump ever will. He hated trump and wanted Ted Cruz or anyone else to win over trump.</p>

here&#39;s how it works: First, announce your political affiliation then let people know youre just like the, an everyman, then renounce your affiliation and try to get others to do the same (through brigading) It then appears to the average reader that people agree with you and that Trump is losing steam. There is a mutiny afoot and the tides are turning against him.Trump has been to pervert island with Epstein, and he&#39;s the fucking president, once you come back from that island youre a made man. He aint going anywhere.  Truth is you better buckle up because just like GWB and Obama, this ride isnt ending for another 7 years. He&#39;s the globalist puppet just like the one that came before him, you bought into the politics and got conned, welcome to the club, its called the &quot;Hey at least its not Hillary&quot; club and I&#39;m the president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because the &quot;left-right&quot; spectrum is bullshit completely designed to divide and conquer, so that the political class can ignore changes popular with the people, but their corporate owners despise. How else do you explain the overlap between the &quot;far left&quot; and &quot;far right&quot; in terms of being anti-war, pro-infrastructure spending, anti-TPPA/NAFTA etc? </p>

<p>In Washington both establishment democrats and republicans are doing their damn best to avoid and scupper those policies at every opportunity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why you got Bernie and (at least campaign mode) Trump, both outsiders considered be outside the donor sphere of influence. By examining the policies they agreed on you can get a pretty complete list of policies with overwhelming bipartisan PUBLIC support. </p>

<p>But instead the media and establishment politicians utilise the FALSE left-right paradigm to maintain the corrupt status quo by focussing SOLELY on policies where the populace is divided. </p>

<p>The media is entirely complicit, using propaganda to cynically manipulate people into perpetuating that very system. Here&#39;s an anecdote: I saw MANY of my democrat friends flip OVERNIGHT in their opposition of the TPPA. Literally as soon as Trump nixed it the media started their little game and a policy that previously would have inspired unity was being used to divide people. And when I would point it out they would get flustered and confused and try to rationalise it. Those are the same symptoms you get in people with stockholm syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fractionalization, and ultimate polarization, has disgusted me for quite a while. It&#39;s increasingly vital to steer clear of generalizations our would-be controllers use on us and attempt to use through us.</p>

<p>As example, a person who may have conservative/liberal opinions on some matters seldom falls into the old Left/Right categories. IMO, if they do, they are likely void of independent thought and opinion, and fall victim to the (false) division game that&#39;s forced upon our hearts and minds.</p>

<p>Those genuinely yearning to better themselves and the world around them in search of knowledge and truth must guard themselves from such narrow-mindedness, and rise above the bitter mediocrity certain powers need us to uphold. A dumb, divided population is exactly what they desire. Don&#39;t fall for their game. </p>

<p>Clinton Foundation wasn&#39;t the only NGO in Haiti at the time. </p>

<p>All reconstruction ran through the Haitian government, so if anyone is to blame, it&#39;s them. </p>

<p>Haitians didn&#39;t want a full scale response. They were worried about sovereignty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the context it was used in, yes, yes it sounds very much like that. Obviously not to the hyperbolic level in which you took it to, but the certainly the beginning steps of the scenario you described. Do you see what they are doing in Germany right now?</p>

<p>And yea, you have every right to say that. It&#39;s hurtful and disruptive to any form of productive conversation, and also a little uncalled for, but you 100% have the freedom to do so. </p>

<p>Those questions have already been debunked in the comments of the thread,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>by &quot;debunked&quot; you mean, &quot;some people made some criticisms?&quot;</p>

<p>by that measure, everything you believe has been &quot;debunked&quot; because someone made some criticisms of your belief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so why should I do it again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>for the same reason that you had to do your own homework in school, in spite of the fact that the teacher had the answer key. the assignment is to help develop your critical thinking skills, not to hide behind someone else&#39;s weak reasoning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sound like a broken record, but you have absolutely no idea of physics and for you to tell me I&#39;m the one who doesn&#39;t understand it is laughable.</p>

<p>i wrote the 24 questions and submitted them to a hostile audience for peer review. you have at your fingertips the collective wisdom of dozens of individuals, and yet between all of them, they can&#39;t debunk the OP</p>

<p>want to know why they can&#39;t debunk the OP?</p>

<p>because its 24 questions, not 24 statements of fact. </p>

<p>if you believe the questions themselves are wrong, i encourage you to honor that hard-earned diploma of yours by paraphrasing them in your own words. </p>

<p>i have made this challenge to many people, and only one person took me up on it. he wrote a blog somewhere. it was pretty good, but at the end of the day he still believes that men walked on the moon, which makes him a loser. i hope he still thinks about it. the thoughts were burned into his mind when he read the material closely enough to comprehend and paraphrase. </p>
