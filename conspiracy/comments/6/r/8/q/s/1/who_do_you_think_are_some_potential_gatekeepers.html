       <strong>
        Mark Dice
       </strong>
       -people say Mark Dice is a potential shill, but I like to think he seems genuine. His channel is being censored and unlike WWE star Alex jones, he isn't super financially well off and is self funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        David Icke
       </strong>
       - says some decent things and described the "matrix" we live in well, and he also criticizes each president equally which I like, however the reptilian thing really discredits a lot of what he says to the general public, and he contributes to the stigma of theorists being "crazy"
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Alex Jones
       </strong>
       - Likely the most obvious of the potential gatekeepers. Preached that the two party system was a hoax for years, then shills for trump and the conservative side of the spectrum. Acts outlandish to also contribute to the stigma of conspiracy theorists being wackjobs and ultimately gives the culture a bad name, and leaves the public with a bad taste in their mouth regarding the legitimacy conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Michael Savage
       </strong>
       - seems to be legitimate however he has an obvious bias regarding Jewish control of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts or input on others? What to look out for? How we can come to a consensus on who to trust?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think these demagogues can be left in the past once you "gain your bearings". We don't need these kind of people anymore. We can expose the masses on our own, we have that skill and that knowledge ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Cenk and TheYoungTurks
       </strong>
       - If Alex And Infowars are the conservative wing of alternative media, the Young Turks are certainly the Liberal "softer" wing of this bird of controlled opposition.

       Sean Hannity; Wikileaks and Julian Assange.  Guy rubs off on me as net positive for the world though, though this opinion is baseless, factless and based purely on intuition.

       I heard Jimmy Dore last night condemn Israel for it's policies towards the Palestinians. Criticism of Israel separates the gatekeeper/shills like Alex Jones and Cenk Uygur from people who have not yet been "bought off".  Dore seems to be the real deal.

       Not true, hence Noam Chomsky. Dore is either a) a shill or b) a utter moron. Probably a mixture of both, imo.

       I feel like the trick is that they will mix in some legit or generally agreeable stuff to get you on their side, and then sprinkle in some propaganda for a cause- look at the movie Zeitgeist- first one brings up good points on 9-11 and religion, the subsequent ones are a lot of agenda 2030 propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezra Levant - The rebel media - anyone he hires always pushes being pro Israel even when it isn't really relevant to what is being discussed, all of the reporters he has working for him do this, a lot of material may be handed down or prodded certain ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones - Most of the others on Infowars seem legit personally, but again I think some of the things they report on are handed down from the top- Making North Korea sound like a bigger threat than they are, blind Trump support, etc.

       Many people here and within the conspiracy culture are determined there is a powerful Jewish lobby that helps run the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to some sources I've seen, it appears as if they DO largely own the media...

       And many of our federal reserve banking chairmen (including the sitting chairwoman, Janet Yellen), are of Jewish descent/practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well as several Hollywood actors and directors and producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see their influence over our culture and our finances and how some people would think they are an "all powerful ruling entity".

       You're not wrong, but keep in mind: There was a time nobody wanted to be a banker. There was a time nobody wanted to be a producer, or an actor. Jews are nomadic, so they take the jobs people don't want.

       The fact that you underestimate the Roman church means (to me) they are in charge. You can warrior keyboard the shit out of Jews... but you can only say So much about the Vatican without being silenced.

       Usury intuitively refers to lending with interest, all lending is done with interest today but in the pass this is what it referred to. There is no financial epicenter in Rome-it's insignificant in terms of the finance industry. Look at New York, Chicago, London, Singapore, Hong Kong those are places 'the money' centers around, not Rome.

       Jews could not hold land in Italy, so they entered the great trading piazzas and halls of Lombardy, alongside local traders, and set up their benches to trade in crops. They had one great advantage over the locals. Christians were strictly forbidden the sin of usury, defined as lending at interest (Islam makes similar condemnations of usury). The Jewish newcomers, on the other hand, could lend to farmers against crops in the field, a high-risk loan at what would have been considered usurious rates by the Church; but the Jews were not subject to the Church's dictates.

       Okay so we're on the same page on the ursury thing but the Vatican is small time bro. The Vatican has no money today in the grand scheme of things, large investment banks and hedge funds likely have more assets than all of those in the Vatican. There is really nothing to suggest that 'money leads to rome' when we can visibly see a lot of the money and its in not in Roma.

       I get great satisfaction in the fact that we're able to agree on something, anonymously over the internet when it comes to something to volatile.

       Assuming Jesus existed, Rome ruled the Middle East around that time. Rome edited the Bible (i.e. Threw out scripture) as late as 1200 C.E.  That's power.

       There's no central bank in Rome, but that doesn't mean they aren't involved or running it.  Church's are tax exempt... priests will drive away in expensive cars while they ask their poor followers to donate.

       Rome Is supposedly involved in the sinking of the titanic, which made is possible for the federal reserve to begin in the first place.

       Ezra Levant - the Rebel media always mixes something about being pro Israel into reports for example, even when it isn't really relevant to the story. It's like the classic salesman tactic of get them saying yes to other things first then ask them to buy. A lot of reporters are probably guided certain ways.

       You're not wrong, but keep in mind: There was a time nobody wanted to be a banker. There was a time nobody wanted to be a producer, or an actor. Jews are nomadic, so they take the jobs people don't want.
