       Sure, maybe. But why? What motive would they have to kill him? If anything they would want him to keep leaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC and Deep State on the other hand had motive. The CIA kills people all the time. Podesta said he was in favor of making an example out of the leaker.

       He was shopping them purportedly? So I assume WL could not accept them via payment. They needed a clearing house, and Russia gains huge leverage in the exchange from all parties. Then they clean up lose ends. Again.

       But why clean up loose ends? Seth Rich was no threat to them, and why wouldn't they just do it over again? If he was working for them then he was an asset, not a liability.

       He was a whistle blower and he provided information to take down the criminals at the DNC. The only reason Russia would want to off him is if they did not want the DNC exposed. That's totally plausible, since they are pretty cozy with Clinton.

       Why would SR leak anything on behalf of Russia? His friends and family knew him to be a true American patriot,  leaking on behalf of Russia makes no sense to me.

       Theory: Seth Rich was a Mossad agent (we know he received combat training in Israel and he is Jewish) that really wanted Sanders to win because of his background.  Seeing the Clinton campaign cheat him, he went rogue and leaked to Wikileaks.   The new Mossad was pissed and whacked him through Pakistani intelligence.  Now the old Mossad (George Webb) is on the case.

       Theory: Seth Rich was a Mossad agent (we know he received combat training in Israel and he is Jewish) that really wanted Sanders to win because of his background.  Seeing the Clinton campaign cheat him, he went rogue and leaked to Wikileaks.   The new Mossad was pissed and whacked him through Pakistani intelligence.  Now the old Mossad (George Webb) is on the case.

       This theory gets torn apart when you consider that the DNC wouldn't let the FBI look at the server that got hacked.

       Both sides kill.  Russia did not kill Seth Rich.  Russia does know who did it.  They would not be pushing this if they did not know who did killed Seth Rich.  They want them to admit that they killed him.  This intelligence war going on is the most passive aggressive war I have ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia does more than kill.  My question has been throughout watching all of this, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?  I cannot tell the difference a lot of the time and that is really frightening.  The only places I trust right now is Finland.  I wish more countries were like Finland.   Awesome people and awesome policies.

       Here's a place to start - has the Russian Foreign Minister ever gone on TV and said that it was "worth it" to starve 500,000 children to death for no real reason?  Because our Secretary of State did.

       Or how about their Intelligence Chief saying that we should start covertly murdering innocent soldiers in a country they were in illegally, not for any reason, but just to "teach'em a lesson."
