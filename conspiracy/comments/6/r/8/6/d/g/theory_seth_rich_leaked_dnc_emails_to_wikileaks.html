<p>The DNC and Deep State on the other hand had motive. The CIA kills people all the time. Podesta said he was in favor of making an example out of the leaker.</p>

<p>He was a whistle blower and he provided information to take down the criminals at the DNC. The only reason Russia would want to off him is if they did not want the DNC exposed. That&#39;s totally plausible, since they are pretty cozy with Clinton.</p>

<p>Russia does more than kill.  My question has been throughout watching all of this, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?  I cannot tell the difference a lot of the time and that is really frightening.  The only places I trust right now is Finland.  I wish more countries were like Finland.
