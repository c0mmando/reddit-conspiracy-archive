       Black Sea Cable and RUE: Paul Manafort's Criminal Activities in Ukraine
      </h1>
      <h3>
       Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
       One of the most important, if not the most important figure for the Russian investigation will be Paul Manafort. Paul Manafort has extensive and deep ties to Russian and pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs directly leading up to the time that he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, to which he resigned in spectacular fashion. Please note that Manafort was not paid at all during his time as campaign manager, which should raise several red flags and will tie into a big reveal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Note: other than mentioning Manafort's status of Trump's campaign manager and Trump corraborating Manafort allies efforts to change part positions on arming Ukraine, this post is supposed to be focused on Paul Manafort. This post is not aimed to be about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Hopefully we can truly dig into Manafort's criminal past and have a meaningul discussion on the relevations.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>
       Party of Regions
      </h3>
      <p>
       Manafort's first contact in Ukraine was a wealthy Party of Regions backer named Rinat Akhmentov. Akhmentov was the richest oligarch in Ukraine at the time, using his connections to Loenid Kuchma(President of Ukraine, 1994-2004) to obtain massive wealth buying state owned metallurgy resources in sweetheart deals, which Kuchma set up specifically to support his corrupt regime. Rinat Akhmetov brought Manafort onto his investment firm, Systems Capital Management as a consultant, but ultimately used him as an unofficial political consultant of Viktor Yanukovych. As time moved on, Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates(another Trump campaign official) gained influence within the party, enough for Manafort to be named Viktor's campaign manager during his 2010 election as President of Ukraine. Manafort's main job within the Party of Regions was to reform the party as a haven for mobsters and Ukrainian organized crime into a formidable political force in national elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       During two of the several years Manafort worked for the party, he disclosed payments for over $17 million, which is more than the entire budget for the party during that period. The Party of Regions is largely backed by pro-Russian oligarchs and operated through these several oligarchs' holding companies and mining/oil subsidiaries. Although it is not clear how the famous ledger payments were put into several Manafort Cyprus bank accounts, the infamous $12 million ledger payments made to Manafort were partly confirmed through a laundering scheme discovered through electronics purchases made through a Belize off-shore company that coincided exact amounts and dates written in the ledger.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Orange Revolution, the Party of Region lost significant amount of influence. Instead of Yanukovych rising to power, Viktor Yushchenko became president and Yulia Tymoshenko became prime minister. Corruption did not end with Yuschenko coming into power. Instead of Kuchma alligned oligarchs looting state assets, a different set of corrupt millionaires rose to billionaires and favored the new president, Yuschenko. One of these notable Yuschenko aligned allies was a man named, Petro Poroshenko, who is now the President of Ukraine, and has corruption issues of his own.

      <h3>
       Dmytro Firtash and RUE
      </h3>
      <p>
       Dmytro Firtash is a key figure in Paul Manafort's world and a central figure in Ukraine-Russia relations. Dmytro Fyrtash rose to power in a post-Soviet world, where he initially started trading food commodities for oil and natural gas products. Firtash was not initially a rich man and did not come from wealth, as many post-Soviet era oligarchs do. There is often a pattern in which these oligarchs gain there riches, where the oligarch enlists local mafia forces for protection in a resource war, or for partnering in business entirely, as Firtash can be seen in his rise to riches. Over this section, you will see how Firtash rose to power from meager starts, gained a foothold in the Russian-Ukrainian gas industry, became a front man for one of the most powerful Russian mob bosses to ever exist, and headed efforts to jail political opponents that started strangling his corrupt businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firtash first gained wealth and got the Russian mafia's attention through his trading company, KMIL. KMIL traded food for gas contracts initially, before being absorbed by a holding company named Highrock Holding, where Firtash became a director in 2001. The president of Highrock Holding was a man named Igor Fisherman, who was named president of a stock index called YBM Magnex. YBM Magnex was part of a complex stock fraud case ran through Canadian stock exchanges and resulted in a massive criminal fraud case ran out of the Southern District of New York. YBM Magnex was a project that came from the mind of the boss of all Russian mob bosses, Semyon Mogilevich. Mogilevich initially came from Ukraine and had a heavy hand in the Ukrainian gas trade as well. He is described as an extremely intelligent man, with a vast knowledge of money laundering and other financial crimes. Mogilevich's ties to Firtash ran deeper. 34% of Highrock Holding was owned by a firm called Agatheas Trading Ltd. Agatheas was under the control of Mogilevich's ex-wife. It is through Highrock, that the initial partnership of Mogilevich and Firtash can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Semyon Mogilevich and Dmytro Firtash's first real foray into Russian-Ukrainian gas trade was not until the establishment of a middle-man company named Eural Trans Gas, which was partly owned by a Highrock subsidiary named Highrock Properties. Eural Trans Gas(ETG) is described as a middle man company because it existed as a facilitator of transfers of natural gas from Turkmenistan and Russian gas companies to the Ukrainian state owned gas company, Naftogaz. The way that ETG operated allowed for the flow of billions of dollars into Firtash and Mogilevich's pockets by purchasing gas from these supplier companies at prices much lower than normal(and would only be available to ETG), then selling the gas to the state owned company for a much higher price. ETG was later investigated by the Ukrainian version of the FBI for corruption and looting of state-owned money through these corrupt deals. The company was later disbanded and a new middle man company was established, RusUkrEnergo(RUE).
      </p>
      <p>
       Firtash and middle man gas supply to Ukraine never disbanded, as RUE became another Firtash controlled company. RUE was 50% owned by the initial supplier, Gazprom(Russian state owned), 45% by Dmytro Firtash, and 5% by a Firtash business partner Ivan Fursin. Soon after the establishment of RUE, Firtash controlled holding companies (Group DF, Ostchem) began receiving lines of credit to the tune of billions dollars from state controlled Russian banks like Gazprombank(not affiliated with Gazprom). Firtash then used this money, as well as money made from RUE to purchase several fertilizer plants, other large resource plants that required natural gas to operate, and seperate Ukranian gas companies. Firtash ultimately controlled tens of billions worth of Ukrainian wealth and resources, which he used to finance the Party of Regions and put in place corrupt politicians that would further his interests in Ukraine, as well as cozy up to Russian interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone in Ukraine was pleased with the use of middle men gas companies. Once a former owner of an intermediary gas company in the 90's, Yulia Tymoshenko was extremely critical of RUE and it's hold on the Ukrainian economy and its influence in the country. After leaving the post of prime minister for the first time, she became prime minister again in 2007, until Yanukovych became president in 2010. Her platform was based on cutting the company out of the deals made between Gazprom and Naftogaz, and ultimately reached a deal with the Russian state owned natural gas supplier in 2009 without RUE. The deal was never fully saw through implementation as soon after, in 2010, the Party of Regions rose in power, electing their leader Viktor Yanukovych to president and ushering in several corrupt politicians with business ties to Firtash and Akhmetov. Soon after the election, the Party of Regions began looking for ways to jail Tymoshenko. The new prosecutor general began charging Tymoshenko for different crimes, each time bringing a new charge against her. Charges were brought against her in 2010, but she was not found to be guilty. While these charges were brought against Tymoshenko, several other cabinent members from her previous parliment had charges brought against them as well. More charges were brought against Tymoshenko in 2011, but were never successfully prosecuted. A third attempt was made to jail Tymoshenko, but was not successfull. Again in 2011, new charges were brought against her, where she was ultimately found guilty and was put in jail until her 2014 release following the Maidan revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Tymoshenko's jailing, there was severe pressure from Western government to Yanukovych to release her, as jailing political opponents was not something the West wanted in potential economic partners. In order to apply this pressure, the EU wanted a condition of a new economic pact with Ukraine to include the release of Tymoshenko. Yanukovych refused the terms, kept Tymoshenko in jail, and instead signed an economic deal with Russia, triggering the Maidan revolution that saw his collapse. Before the revolution and in the period of the deal negotiations, Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates were heavily involved in lobbying US congress to ease off of Yanukovych for jailing Tynoshenko and to ignore the case when dealing with the country. As part of these efforts, and as a vehicle of payment, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine was setup as an NGO to lobby the US government. This NGO consisted of several Party of Regions members on the board and heavily relied upon Manafort and Gates connections to US lobbying corporations and knowledge of the FARA to conceal the true identity behind the NGO's efforts. Manafort and Gates wired $2.2 million from 2012-2014 to Podesta Group and Mercury LLC to do this lobbying on behalf of the Party of Region's NGO. This caused severe issues for Podesta Group as it was not declared as a foreign agent under FARA and had to work to reclassify the group's status. The Podesta Group believed that Gates and Manafort did not work for the Party of Regions at the time when they were paid, which was an obvious lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a 2014 lawsuit brought against Dmytro Firtash, Paul Manafort was heavily involved in the organization behind the legal effort driven to initially jail Tymoshenko. Paul Manafort helped control the flow of money affiliated to a venture capital firm tied to Firtash through potential NY real estate deals, back into Ukraine. According to the lawsuit, these deals were made to funnel money back to corrupt Party of Regions officials and even the prosecution behind her. The venture capital firm in question was named CMZ Ventures, which was jointly controlled by Brad Zackson, Arthur Cohen, and Paul Manafort (Z + M + C = CMZ). The entire purpose of the formation of CMZ was to pursuit real estate deals in NY using funds provided by Group DF(D + F = Dmytro Firtash). The main goal of the CMZ investment group was to fund the purchase of the Drake Hotel in NYC and to ultimately construct a completely new tower in it's place, as well as other real estate deals. Group DF was planning on injecting $100+ million into the Drake hotel deal, with an initial funding of $25 million. CMZ Ventures was to be paid $1.5 million initially for the purchasing efforts. Other than the controlling interests of CMZ and some close friends, many employees of the groups controlled by CMZ were not paid, not given health insurance, or were severely underpaid. This resulted in a workplace fraud complaint filed in NY state court to pursue monetary compensation for those involved. The deals that CMZ pursued were never fulfilled and the money that CMZ controlled from Group DF was never found.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the investigation of Tymoshenko, the General Prosecutor's office in Ukraine partnered with a specific law firm in their efforts against the former PM. The law firm Skadden Arpse was hired by the prosecutor's office for $12,000, the minimum requirement for government contract payments to be made without requiring to formally report transaction with proper documentation. After the investigation into Tymonshenko was complete, the firm was paid $1 million for it's efforts. During the investigation, Manafort was emailed by a partner at Skadden(Gregory Craig) informing him of his legal efforts to seek information to hinder the legal team of Tymoshenko during the prosecution. In the Tymoshenko lawsuit, the funds allegedly used by CMZ Ventures to launder money from NY real estate ventures back into Ukraine to bribe prosecutors and Party of Regions officials was never found, so the lawsuit was not followed through as a proper RICO case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allthough that case was never implemented into a full blown RICO case, there is another legal avenue for prosecution against Dmytro Firtash. Firtash has been fighting extradition to the US since 2014 after he was arrested for a mining racketeering and bribery operation he conducted to gain access to mining resources in India. After he was arrested, Firtash posted a record bail of $125 million. The Firtash money used to bribe Indian government officials flowed through NY banks, which was used in a report made by the FBI to Austrian officials during Firtash's arrest. In early 2017, extradition was granted to the FBI and Firtash is now awaiting extradition. There is one legal holdup as Firtash is also wanted in Spain for a similar case involving bribery. Austrian officials are sorting out the matter before sending Firtash to trail in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the Trump campaign, Manafort was $10 million in debt to Lucicle Consultants (Cyprus company), which has ties to Party of regions member Ivan Fursin. If you remember, Fursin is part of the RUE corporate structure, owning a %5 share in the company and acted as RUE's legal arm for Firtash. This debt came in a form of a loan, which was issued to a Delaware company controlled by Manafort named Jesand L.L.C.. That loan was used to purchase NY real estate, where Manafort commonly launders Cyprus originated money.

      <h3>
       Oleg Deripaska and Black Sea Cable
      </h3>
      <p>
       Oleg Deripaska is another key figure in Manafort's world. Similar to Firtash, Deripaska started on meager terms, but rose in ranks in the aluminum world with protection and partnership with the Russian mafia. Over time, Deripaska came to control th world's largest aluminum mining company and became one of Russia's richest oligarchs. There were different periods of oligarchy in Russia. The first era of Russian oligarchy was pre-Putin, where it was considered a Wild-West(Wild-East) situation where there was little respect for the leaders of the country or political pressure and many of the oligarchs plotted against ruling politicians. Russians that had connections to the Yelstin government became billionares overnight. After Putin rose to power and successfully put pressure on oligarchs such as Mikhail Khodorkohvsky, through shows of force in courts, oligarchs either left the country or became pawns of Putin's government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deripaska rose to power during the Boris Yeltsin years of Russia, where state run companies were being privatized and Russia's vast natural resources were being auctioned off for pennies on the dollar. Those that were able to get their hands on these resources could become extremely wealthy. Due to the lack of proper oversight, the resulting years of obtaining these mining resources were extremely violent. This time period, especially in the aluminum mines, were known as 'The Aluminum Wars'. Potential oligarchs sought partnerships with Russian mafia organizations and paid those organizations hundreds of millions of dollars for protection and to eliminate the other potential oligarchs and mining officials. It is said that during this time period, around 100 people involved in the trade and obtaining these resources were murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the aluminum wars, Deripaska had to partner with members of the Russian mafia for protection. This protection was paid for with stakes in early aluminum companies that Deripaska controlled and ultimately amalgamated into his partnership with another Russian aluminum oligarch, Roman Abramovich. Deripaska partnered with a known mafia organization through an intermediary named Michael Cherney(or Chernoy, Chernoi). Cherney had many connections to the Yeltsin administration and was heavily affiliated with a high ranking member of the Izmailovsky crime gang, Anton Malevsky. Malevsky later died during a parachuting accident in South Africa in 2001. Cherney controlled a very powerful aluminum company(Trans World Group) in the 90's that was accused being part of a criminal group that stole more than $100 million from the Russian government and used a portion of the theft as startup funds for the mining company. Cherney's connections to criminal groups became very apparent when witnesses that testified against Trans World were found abducted and murdered.  Throughout the 90's and into the early 00's Deripaska made a series of large payments and sold shares he controlled of Siberian aluminum companies as payment for protection during these wars to Cherney and Malevsky. These payments through the sale of shares in companies, totaled over $400 million during that period. These shares late came up in a lengthy lawsuit filed in 2006, where Cherney sued Deripaska for billions over their previous dealings during the aluminum wars.  Years after the Aluminum Wars ended and Deripaska became the aluminum king in Russia with his controlling interest in RUSAL(partnership with Abramovich), Deripaska applied for a US visa to explore business opportunities. His visa was denied explicitly because of his close affiliation to Malevsky and organized crime during the aluminum wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort's first work for Deripaska was his work as an undeclared Russian agent working to further the interest of Putin in the US. As part of the contract, Manafort was paid $10 million per year from 2006-2009, during the time period he worked as a political consultant for the Party of Regions and was the campaign manager for Viktor Yanukovych.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Manafort helped Oleg Deripaska navigate Ukrainian business deals during the period of Yanukovych rule. Deripaska controlled an investment firm that held around $100 million of his own money, called Surf Horizon Limited. Using Surf, Deripaska hired Manafort to purchase Ukranian media organizations with the $100 million in order to obtain his own media empire in Ukraine. The company charged to manage Deripaska's funds and buy Ukrainian media companies was a LLC called Pericles Emerging Investment Partners.  There were not many comapanies purchased with the funds, except for one specific company, Black Sea Cable(or Chorne More in Ukranian), which was a internet and media company stationed in Odessa, Ukraine. As part of Manafort's efforts during the purchase  were to receive $7.5 million in compensation. Black Sea Cable was to be purchased for $19 million. The money alloted from Surf to purchase the media company dissapeared and Deripaska filed a lawsuit in the Cayman Islands in 2014, hoping to recover the money that Manafort allegedly stole from him. The money stole from Surf was pursued in court up until a key moment, in late 2015/early 2016 (depending on which source you look at), Deripaska's efforts to recover this money from Paul Manafort stopped. There was no record of any payments made to Deripaska from Manafort. This coincided with the time that Manafort began his tenure at the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than the $19 million owed to Deripaska, Manafort was also in debt to companies controlled by Deripaska to the tune of $8 million while he was Trump's campaign chair. The debt was owed to Oguster Management Limited, controlled by Deripaska.

      <h3>
       NY Real Estate Efforts to Launder Money
      </h3>
      <p>
       Paul Manafort has been shown to have followed a pattern with his real estate purchases within NY Real Estate that follow patterns of typical money laundering. Considering the sources of his money, Manafort had clear motive to clean his funds. During the period of Manafort's work for these oligarchs and during the campaign, Manafort consistently purchased NY real estate using cash registered to LLC's in his name, or with loans personally guaranteed by people closely affiliated to Manafort's time in Ukraine.  Investigators have looked into deposits made to Manafort owned Cyprus accounts and saw that the accounts would immediately transfer and wire deposits out almost right after receiving the amounts reported. Almost immediately after purchasing these properties from money originating from LLC's using money wired from Cyprus linked accounts, Manafort would get loans on the properties he purchased with money he made from his time in Ukraine, effectively cleaning the money he made during this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several very suspicious loans were made to Manafort properties immediately after the 2016 campaign was over. These loans came from a small investment bank called Federal Savings Bank, controlled by Steve Calk, who is a Trump campaign financier and an economic adviser. The bank issued several loans to Manafort over several months after the campaign, totaling $16 million. Reviewing the banks assets, Manafort's loans in particular are odd, due to the bank typically issuing small loans to veterans and first-time home buyers. Manafort also has appeared to use several of the loans secured from homes he purchased from his Ukrainian activities to salvage investments he has made in an alleged ponzi scheme involving his son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai. The lawyer representing his son-in-law in the alleged ponzi scheme case, Bruce Baldinger, is the same lawyer that is representing Manafort in cases involving Manafort's real estate purchases.

       Changing Campaign Policies on Arming Ukrainian Revolution
      </h3>
      <p>
       One particular point of interest in Manafort's activities in Ukraine came during the 2016 campaign at the RNC convention. The only particular platform issue that had input from the Trump campaign was that of arming the official army of the nation of Ukraine. Official delegates at the RNC were poised to position the party to aim to arm the Ukrainian army, but the Trump campaign interjected at the last moment in an effort to rid the party platform of this position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Manafort and his Ukrainian associates were involved in this process. During his time as campaign manager, Manafort met twice with a business associate that ran Manafort's operations in Kiev when Manafort was absent. The invididual is Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik is a self admitted former GRU officer who was well known to US intelligence as to be 'former' Russian intelligence. Kilimnik was included in Manafort's deals to purchase Black Sea Cable for Deripaska, as well as Manafort's continuous work for the Party of Regions and the Opposition Bloc that rose from the Party of Regions' ashes. Kilimnik was on record discussing money owed to Manafort and himself during this time period and the 'perception of the presidential campaign in Ukraine'. A person close to Manafort on the campaign and close to Kilimnik also suggested in other reports that Kilimnik was involved in the platform change, but not entirely through Manafort. Manafort was not the only person on the campaign that Kilimnik had strong ties to. Another Trump campaign official that was heavily involved in Manafort's activities in Ukraine was a man named Rick Gates. Rick Gates was at the GOP convention and was used as the campaign's fall guy after Melania Trump's speech was found to be plagiarized. Gates and Kilimnik were both involved in the Black Sea Cable dealings and other Manafort activities. Manafort and Kilimnik met once in May 2016 and once in August 2016, before the convention occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two non-Trump delegates confirmed the intervention from campaign officials. Rachel Hoff and Diana Denman are on record accusing the campaign of intervening. Diana Denman was the original author of the platform proposal to arm the Ukraine army. When first questioned by reporters, the Trump campaign and Manafort specifically repeatedly denied being involved in the platform change. After a campaign official, JD Gordon, admitted to being the delegate that changed the platform regarding Ukraine in support of the Trump campaign, Trump later admitted in an interview that he was not personally involved in the platform changed, but his people were. Trump acknowledged that campaign officials softened language in the platform regarding Ukraine.

       TLDR
      </h1>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Manafort worked for two different oligarchs in Ukraine that funded Party of Regions operations and looted state assets
       </li>
       <li>
        One of those oligarchs(Firtash) got his start in the Russian Ukrainian gas trade through Semyon Mogilevich
       </li>
       <li>
        Manafort organized several different efforts on behalf of Firtash to jail politicians that objected to Firtash's corrupt trading company
       </li>
       <li>
        Manafort worked for Oleg Deripaska, who was heavily involved in the Russian Aluminum Wars that saw close to 100 people murdered during the 90's
       </li>
       <li>
        Manafort owed tens of millions of dollars to Firtash partners and Deripaska during the campaign
       </li>
       <li>
        Deripaska tried to sue Manafort for stolen money owed to him, stopped pursuing lawsuit as Manafort came onto Trump campaign
       </li>
       <li>
        Manafort has several documented cases of laundering payments from Ukraine through loans issued against homes paid with Ukraine cash
       </li>
       <li>
        Manafort Ukrainian business partners involved in RNC Ukraine platform change
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
       Conclusion
      </h1>
      <p>
       Out of everyone involved in the Russia investigation, Manafort should be of great concern to everyone.  His various efforts to hide the sources of his money as well as launder payments made from Ukraine will be a key area of interest for financial investigators.
In this post, I laid out two main oligarchs that Manafort worked for in Ukraine and abroad and how Firtash and Deripaska have extremely close ties to Russian organized crime. Whether the GOP's official platform was changed because of Manafort's tens of millions of debt owed to mafia connected oligarchs is yet to be seen, but there is clear involvement from the allies of Manafort to change the party's official stance on Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always been my own personal opinion that the Russian investigation should look at financial crimes instead of collusion, as there can be grey areas of contacts that can be muddied through media reports and conflicting statements. When reporting on money transactions and actions that followed transactions of money, it is a lot harder to dilute investigative waters. No one can honorably claim that you received tens of millions of dollars in loans from mafia figures while not receiving a dime of campaign salary because of opposition research.
      </p>

       In closing.

       Awesome work, thanks for this.

      <p>
       I just skimmed it but I'm going to read this later tonight. I think that the financials are going to be the most interesting part of this, not just Manafort but also Kusnher's corporate interests and of course Trump's business dealings. Just the surface level things I've read on Trump's dealings with Russian nationals including the Bayrock group and the Florida mansion are very, very interesting.

       I was kindof upset that this didn't get any responses or anything really. I think posting this during the shit storm this week on

       was a bad idea and it got entirely lost in people arguing over Seth Rich and Fox News, regardless of which side you believe.

       I think that's part of their strategy of burying the sub in garbage, it's to suppress quality informative posts such as this...... This is exactly the kind of post that they fear.

       Ehh, that might be part of the reason, but I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that Clinton nor Trump is mentioned in the post title.

       This was awesome. I'll check out the other thread as well....... This is the type of relevant, fact checked and sourced information that's really lacking.
      </p>

       It appears as though Manafort is most likely in a position where he had no defence.
Do you think he'll turn for immunity?

       I don't know if Meuller will give Manafort immunity. Especially since Firtash is probably going to be extradicted to the US, Meuller can bring him in to flip on Manafort. Firtash is already fucked on his Indian bribery case, and he is deeply connected to Mogilevich, so I doubt anyone would give Firtash immunity to get dirt on Manafort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort may try, but his web of shit is so deep. Most of my Trump supporting friends do not even want to defend Manafort.
