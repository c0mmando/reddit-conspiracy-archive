    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You don&#39;t wanna be a... <em>gatekeeper</em> now, would you? That means everyone will hate you and is totally not recently invented digital/online peer pressure into letting just about anyone invade a space or hobby and start shit...&quot;</p>

<p>Gatekeeping is a bullshit term used to invade the safe spaces of other groups, and coming from the same people who started talking about &quot;needing online safe spaces&quot;. It&#39;s a buzzword to use peer pressure etc. so any group that isn&#39;t open to a takeover can be accused of it.</p>

<p>It was astroturfed into a popular thing on reddit last year and just a way to use the &quot;you&#39;re a racist/sexist if you disagree&quot; for communities that don&#39;t talk about race or sex. They can&#39;t call every group something-phobics or something-isms/ists, so they came up with something else. Gatekeeping means fucking diddly squat, it&#39;s barely even a thing. Just a natural part of a community. There&#39;s always a little resistance, gatekeeping is not a big enough thing to make a deal out of.</p>

<p>Think about it for a second. You&#39;re more afraid of being labeled a &quot;omg gatekeeper!&quot; and attacked/brigaged in masse than actually agreeing or thinking about how needless that whole term even is.</p>

<p>Thanks for misquoting me, and out of context. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t addressed the other user forum sliding/trolling. Probably because you followed his user profile to this link I&#39;d imagine. </p>

<p>You choose to criticize my language instead of the subject of my comment. Is that an ad-hominem? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It looks like a lot of comments of yours have been removed under rule 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only two actually. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, you asked me what my intention is. I answered. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to control my language, and using ad-hominem&#39;s to do it. </p>

<p>Got it, loud and clear &quot;sir&quot;.  </p>

<p>There was some saying about how you could limit people&#39;s thinking by allowing vigorous debate... but only within narrow limits.</p>

<p>So we get this, as a backhanded way of defining which conspiracy theories are acceptable (those of little/no consequence) and those which aren&#39;t.</p>
