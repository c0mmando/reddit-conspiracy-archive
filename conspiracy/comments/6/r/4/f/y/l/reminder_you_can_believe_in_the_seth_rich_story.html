    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re hijacking the top sentiment of not letting &quot;divide and conquer&quot; to create wiggle room for BOTH narratives to exist when in fact, they really can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The premise of Russia collusion originated with the belief that they hacked the DNC and the DCCC. When these came out in... what, August?... members of Clinton&#39;s campaign immediately went on record claiming it was the Russians interfering with the election.</p>

<p>This leaves the following dichotomy: either Seth Rich leaked those docs, OR it was Russia. It was the DNC members themselves who set that up.</p>

<p>There are also serious logical problems if one wants to believe Rich leaked the docs, but Donald Trump STILL colluded with Russia. This is because one then has to believe that the DNC/intelligence community was <em>not</em> being truthful about Russia hacking the election through leaks, but <em>are</em> being truthful about the Russians colluding with Trump. The same entities claiming they&#39;re behind the &quot;hack&quot; (which is really a leak) are ALSO the ones claiming Russia is colluding with Trump, setting this up as an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; thing. </p>

<p>Now: I don&#39;t hate anyone who believes the Trump collusion storyline. I respect their views, but I will absolutely point out inconsistencies as I see them. In this case, I cannot see how the Seth Rich story can exist alongside the Russian narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are pretty simple ways to reconcile the two. For example, off the top of my head: Say Rich was either a Russian plant or an unwitting agent they coaxed into leaking <em>or</em> possibly making systems more susceptible to hacking from the inside (e.g. clicking a phishing link at the most basic). Then they offed him to cover their tracks. All of the &quot;inconsistencies&quot; you pointed out jive perfectly well with this.</p>

<p>edit: It&#39;s even possible (and IMO somewhat likely) that Wikileaks is either an arm of Russian intelligence or exists under its good graces (e.g. someone in Russia has blackmail info on Assange to keep him compliant). The evidence is in the spread of Wikileaks high profile disclosures, almost all of which exclusively target the US and NATO, while Russia and her allies Iran and China are untouched despite massive corruption, secrecy, and repression in all three, precisely the kinds of things Assange claims to want to fight. The only major leak related to Russia that I recall (please correct me) was one pertaining to Putin&#39;s political opponents several years ago.</p>

<p>Did you read my post, like really read it? I specifically said it was off the top of my head, as a way to point out that your contention that they&#39;re fundamentally incompatible/contradictory/inconsistent is simply wrong, all it takes is an <em>ounce</em> of imagination, something a conspiracy sub should be good at.</p>

<p>I&#39;d remind you also that there&#39;s also zero evidence that anyone from the DNC killed Rich, it&#39;s entirely speculation and a few bits of circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot; that again require a ton of mental glue and filler to be any more convincing than some tea-leaf reading.</p>

<p>How do you know they haven&#39;t?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The FBI doesn&#39;t publish daily updates of ongoing investigations. The couple times they opened their mouth over the past year have been met with such controversy they&#39;ve obviously pulled back publicizing <em>even casual remarks</em> about ongoing investigations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty incredible to be shouted down in this subreddit for speculating an entirely new (by <em>your</em> admission) conspiracy theory, because it doesn&#39;t match your political agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really believe that. Logically, the alleged hack of the DNC is a small piece of the total evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s supporters like to think that if they can discredit the DNC hack all of the other evidence becomes irrelevant, but logically that doesn&#39;t make sense when there are multiple other pieces of evidence that are in no way connected to the alleged hack. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just pretend the hack/leak didn&#39;t happen. What about the meeting between the Russian operative and Manafort, Kushner and Junior where they were promised damaging information originating from the Russian government? What about all of the denials from the Trump administration? Why did Trump dictate Junior&#39;s public statement? Why did they talk about &quot;adoptions&quot; at the meeting?</p>

<p>What about Trump firing Comey for investigating? Is that something an innocent person would do? What would have happened if Obama had fired Comey when he was investigating Hillary, and then admitted it was because he wanted to derail the investigation?</p>

<p>What about Flynn resigning? What about Flynn&#39;s lawyer offering evidence for immunity? </p>

<p>And there&#39;s a lot more than this, and none of it is connected to the alleged hack on the DNC. The DNC hack provided Wikileaks with ammunition to use against Hillary, and that&#39;s about it. But it&#39;s far, far far from being the only alleged assistance being provided from Russia.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that exactly where Hersh claimed to get his info on Rich that everyone said proved everything last night?  So I hope you&#39;re not claiming that that counts as actual evidence.</p>

<p>Also, do the anonymous sources really matter when the WH confirms everything the next day anyway?  It was an anonymous source that said Trump helped with Jr&#39;s statement and then it was confirmed the next day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh they&#39;ve used every bullet they have already since he&#39;s been in the media for 30 years now... With the Seth Rich story, we have a man shot in the back twice, stabilized in hospital, died in mysterious circumstance overnight, and zero leads on who did it, for what motive (as nothing was stolen and there were no eye-witnesses), or even what Seth Rich might have said as far as who he thought did it to him. There are a lot of unanswered questions.</p>

<p>With the Trump-Russia BS, there seems to be more exploration than actual questions to answer. It&#39;s like they are looking for the question rather than trying to find an answer for it, and I don&#39;t think that is an honest approach. We have no reason to be at odds with Russia - war with them only benefits us, we are now sacrificing our relationships in order to spite them (&amp; Trump), and instead we could be working together and making the world (and the country) a better place to live in. Instead, we have re-hashed cold war thinking being forced down our throats. It&#39;s disappointing.</p>

<p>The lawyer had no connection to the Russian government, and was allowed into the Country by the DOJ under the democrats as a favor. She was more connected to the DNC leadership than she was to Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And just yesterday we found out the president himself took a direct role in lying to the public about the meeting.</p>

<p>Do you have proof they were lying? How is preparing a statement &#39;lying&#39;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the idea the Trump campaign met with Russians to get dirt on Clinton has not only not fallen apart, but has actually been proven and acknowledged as true by the White House.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except there was no dirt to be had - the whole thing was a honeypot to try to tie Trump to the Russian government. If the Russian lawyer had actually presented anything of substance, you may have a point (although they were just 2 private citizens having a meeting), but there wasn&#39;t. Nothing happened at the meeting. All of these &#39;fears&#39; are not based in reality.</p>

<p>All of it. If any of it could stand up they would use it in court against him. Why are they sitting on their hands if you are correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that the heat is on the attorney claims she didn&#39;t represent the Russian government, but on the email that Don Jr. responded to it clearly states that she did. That the DOJ on a different occasion let her into the country not as a favor but because her client was scheduled to testify is irrelevant. It wasn&#39;t a meeting of two citizens, it was a meeting of 8 people, several of which were non-citizens and several of which were running Trump&#39;s presidential campaign. Trump directed his son to lie on his statement by saying it was primarily about adoptions and had nothing to do with the campaign, as confirmed by the White House itself.</p>

<p>I have no idea why you think it&#39;s impossible to lie on a written statement.</p>

<p>The investigation hasn&#39;t pressed charges yet because it hasn&#39;t concluded. Btw we know as a fact that Trump is at least guilty of obstruction of justice as he flat-out admitted he fired the FBI director to end the Russian investigation.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying the email is more important than what she says when the camera is actually on her? what about the Kremlin saying they do not even know who she is? or her law offices not actually existing or having a valid phone line?</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t admit that at all - you are putting words in his mouth and you are conflating circumstance. You are not honest.</p>

<p>what should I have to name? Nothing has stuck. Nothing has substance. All of these people who were put through extensive vetting by the deep state came out clean. Mueller hasn&#39;t said anything, and if you think they are just going to lollygag around while an unfit president runs the country, you&#39;re not being realistic. If they had a reason to remove Trump, he&#39;d be gone, but they don&#39;t. That&#39;s why &#39;all of it&#39; is valid. 8 months of witch hunting and you can&#39;t give me a single shred of evidence that would actually mean something in court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes what participants in potentially criminal acts told each other at the time is more reliable than what they say defending themselves to the public later.</p>

<p>And these emails would certainly hold up in court. So would the records of Manaford receiving tons of money. So would the disclaimer form Kushner signed that failed to mention his multiple meetings with the Russians. So would Sessions lying under oath about it. So would Trump&#39;s statement that he fired Comey because of &quot;the Russian thing&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump hasn&#39;t been impeached yet not because of a lack of evidence but because both houses are controlled by Republicans and their base is much like you - show them emails directly showing collusion and they turn around and say &quot;see the whole case has collapsed!&quot; </p>

<p>No one thing has stuck to Trump because he has like 20 embarrassing fuck ups a week. It&#39;s impossible to dwell on any of them. If Obama had given that speech to the Boy Scouts, Fox News would have talked about it for months, but with Trump at least five bigger scandals have happened since then at that was just like 3 days ago or something.</p>

<p>But hey, at least we agree one place. It really was stupid for Trump to tell his son to lie about the Russian meeting.</p>

<p>No he doesn&#39;t, unless you deliberately restrict your imagination to an extremely narrow idea of what role he could have filled. Seth Rich could have provided the documents to the Russians, who then passed them along to Wikileaks. There&#39;s also the possibility that Wikileaks is itself an arm of Russian intelligence. </p>

<p>The utter lack of imagination conspiracy theorists have had around Seth Rich has been extremely disappointing. 99% of this community just took the Crooked Murderous Hillary narrative from T_D (<em>and</em> the right wing MSM) and stopped thinking entirely. </p>

<p>But that didn&#39;t happen and it&#39;s all people who donated to Clinton.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say they get rid of Mueller.  Are you going to be against anybody that had donated to anybody in the GOP?  And anybody joining the new team that had donated to the GOP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh they&#39;ve used every bullet they have already since he&#39;s been in the media for 30 years now... With the Seth Rich story, we have a man shot in the back twice, stabilized in hospital, died in mysterious circumstance overnight, and zero leads on who did it, for what motive (as nothing was stolen and there were no eye-witnesses), or even what Seth Rich might have said as far as who he thought did it to him. There are a lot of unanswered questions.</p>

<p>With the Trump-Russia BS, there seems to be more exploration than actual questions to answer. It&#39;s like they are looking for the question rather than trying to find an answer for it, and I don&#39;t think that is an honest approach. We have no reason to be at odds with Russia - war with them only benefits us, we are now sacrificing our relationships in order to spite them (&amp; Trump), and instead we could be working together and making the world (and the country) a better place to live in. Instead, we have re-hashed cold war thinking being forced down our throats. It&#39;s disappointing.</p>
