       Many aren't aware that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Moon">
        there isn't solid scientific consensus
       </a>
       on the origin of the moon, although the "giant-impact hypothesis" is currently the most popular mainstream theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov
       <a href="https://redice.tv/news/the-moon-an-unexplained-phenomenon">
        said it
       </a>
       best:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We cannot help but come to the conclusion that the Moon by rights ought not to be there. The fact that it is, is one of the strokes of luck almost too good to accept.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ever wonder why the sun and moon fit so well together during an eclipse?
       <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/who-parked-moon-in-perfect-circular.html">
        Asimov did too
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Moon">
        Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar theories have been offered for the origin of Mars' strange moon Phobos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn's moon
       <a href="http://enterprisemission.com/moon1.htm">
        Iapetus
       </a>
       (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculation.
      </p>

       Feel free to share your thoughts about these solar system anomalies...believers and skeptics are all welcome.

       The only ABSURD explanation here is that Trump probably believes in astrology . He is hiding from a solar eclipse. August 21st, 2017Ð±. Now exactly 17 days before the eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astrologers predict his death. Politicians too.

       Trump can even imitate the disappearance a week before the eclipse.

        Whilst the eclipse conjoins his Ascendant/Mars conjunction, Saturn at 21.11 Sagittarius is exactly on his Moon at 21.12 Sagittarius. This eclipse, which so exactly replicates Trumpâs chart, and which casts a shadow over the whole of the USA was a clear, unequivocal indication that he would win the 2016 election, but I donât think any astrologer spotted it at the time. But now that the eclipse darkens his chart, and the USA, will this be good or bad?

       Yeah it's because that's the side that gets heated by the sun. If you heat up a large spherical rock and leave it in the sun it will have the same heat map.

       So I've thought about this some and I have an admittedly probably stupid idea.  Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universe
my madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing.  The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases.  It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.

       I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.

       He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.

       that the massive and mysterious "equatorial ridge" around Iapetus has yet to be fully explained or understood, not to mention the abundance of seemingly organized geometric shapes on its surface.

        the Wikipedia page
       </a>
       for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.

       The ring "Chicken Little" theory
       <a href="https://gizadeathstar.com/2014/04/can-relax-now-mysterious-equatorial-ridge-iapetus-finally-explained/">
        was suggested by
       </a>
       <em>
        Discover
       </em>
       Magazine:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The
        <em>
         Discover
        </em>
        article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's actually
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?
       </p>
       <p>
        Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies...
       </p>
       <p>
        ...on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....

       Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either.

       But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve?

       Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).

       How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable.

       I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position.

       But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does the fact that solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo".

       Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own special neuroses

       Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake.

       Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth.  All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist.  It's pretty mind blowing.

       Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.

       Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.

       I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore.

       I do understand evolution.  Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon.  Improbable but not impossible.

       People like you and the ((not fully)hollow) Moon/Earth deniers are like chimpanzees from 2001: A Space Odyssey that see the black monolith and don't react at all. A monkey that continues their primitive fight or flight stare racking the monolith up to a mere natural stone that was crafted by some mathematically and environmentally impossible circumstances that aren't compatible with known laws of physics but at the same time the monkey believes that numbers are god and believes the chaotic odds alone will create testable and visible perfection with only ruin all around it.

       You appeal to the immensity of the known universe saying that shear probability will make anomalous geological features and intelligently designed structures be build up out of the dirt against the forces of nature by the forces of nature? That doesn't make sense. Evolution is based off of improbable but logical assumptions based on understood science that even though life is rare it is abundant across a sample size as big as the know universe. Where the solar and lunar eclipses are like a spit in the eyes of science almost saying that non-thinking astral bodies of immense proportion will seemingly make visually appealing phenomena and for us to witness even though they were allegedly thrown there by chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is an amalgamation of amino acids and microscopic life that grow, multiply and spread everywhere because of abundant chemicals that are found across the cosmos where these are are lone, one of a kind monuments left standing in barren cosmic landscapes that have nothing else like it even on a massive scale. We all appreciate pagans for erecting the massive Stonehenge that mark astronomical features but you don't think it's strange that entire planets have geographical tattoos and are placed in such a way that just Humans can understand and see them in a purposefully artistic and scientific fashion?

       The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle.  The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%.  The moon isn't like that.  Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that.  The convenient eclipse size is just fun though.  It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets.  And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth.  I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.

       I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.

       I'd love to see the footage but without it I'd have to agree that in this specific instance it's likely noise, and I'm saying this as someone that's experienced things that could be called a 'glitch in the matrix' multiple times, usually with other people seeing the glitch as well.

       Here's a real explanation for your question: It means the scanlines (see VSync in PC and console games), or image/video 'screen tearing'. The weird lines that go up and down your screen sometimes if the game or movie animates faster than your TV, monitor or screen is able to keep up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Googling "VSync" will be the easiest to get it if this explanation still doesn't help. Just look at the image and video examples etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what they're saying is the moon wave thing looks like a video projection with screen tearing. "The refresh rate of the screen is not in sync with the video projection itself".

       It doesn't do that through a telescope.  I've tried many times.  I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon.  I know that for sure.  It's real and round 100%.  I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes.

       I think the people who capture the supposed waves are monitoring the moon for hours every night to catch one. I'm not saying they are anything, but whatever they are, they seem to occur pretty rarely.

       I need to get a USB camera.  Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen.  I'll definitely record hours of footage.  I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites.  On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's.

       Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing.

       There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.

       But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?

       I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons.  I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started.  I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask.  It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).

       I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo".
      </p>
      <p>
       I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to.  The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring.

       Sweet!  I do that too!  I just need a better camera to mount on my lens.  Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids.  It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop.

       Also- does it only happen in digital recordings or is it ever seen with the naked eye or recorded with on film by a camera without an electronic lens?
I'm leaning toward it being a digital artifact. The camera refocusing is not evidence of anything.

       Tbh I think its most likely an artifact of digital recording. It would constantly be refreshing the contrast between the white and the black- i.e, the edge.  Does anyone have footage of this shot with a non-digital film camera? Have these things been seen with the human night or is it just something that happens if you aim a digital camera at the moon long enough ?

       if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned.  If you look at the video

       he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.

       It

        doesn't

       follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's gone. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.

       Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's  lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool.

       It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads.

       That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public.

       Well while I don't believe in flat earth, hiding God, if God really existed , is a great reason for elites who worship themselves as God's, hiding land, hiding the fact that we are trapped here with no way out which would certainly raise a lot of questions/panic.

       This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.

       Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other.

       consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off.

       Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too

       That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles.

       The moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness having to do with the moon is so far reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.

       I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want.

       I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".

       Try thinking.  Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago.  Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.

       I'm late to reply, but if it's the video I think he's talking about it not only stops spinning but stops gaining altitude as well. I would have to watch it again, though. All this stuff is very interesting, for sure.

       The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme

       Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it

       I think you're talking that a good ways out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors.

       way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation.

       If the equipment causes the phenomenon, why does the 'wave' go out of shot in one video that pans out of frame, then reappear in the frame without having changed speed or angle?

        He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescope

        You are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.

       I'm unconvinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.
       </li>
       <li>
        The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.
       </li>
       <li>
        The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.
       </li>
      </ol>

       This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.

       It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.

       I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives.

       sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon.

       That's not an explination.  I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&amp;amp;app=desktop">
        this video
       </a>
       about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric.

       The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.

       Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness.  The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that the entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality.  Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.

       It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy.  The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams.  we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.

       Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement.

       Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example,

        here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku

       , an amazing site in Bolivia.

       tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).

       After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".

       Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there.

       Is it possible that because of the sheer size of everything, that there is a "zone" in which the moon could reside to give us the same eclipse effect?  I've heard astronomers describe it like if the moon were 100 miles nearer or further it wouldn't give the same effect.

       No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.

       The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth.  Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.

       This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun.  An

        annular eclipse

       is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit.  This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).

      <p>
       The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moisture.  Not because the moon is hollow.

       Dude, I am not a physicist.  I got that from Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density.  Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't make it hollow.  Makes it less dense.  I'm not arguing the moon is hollow.  I'm just sharing information about the theory.

       I second this.  I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness.  I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.

       yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated

        After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density. Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.

       There is a good quora article about it, but keep in mind that primary sources are far better, but less accessible:

        Doesn't make it hollow. Makes it less dense. I'm not arguing the moon is hollow. I'm just sharing information about the theory.

       Fair enough, but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow.

       Thought we were discussing "theories" here?   In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory.  Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.

       I know what the moon is made of.  I can Google scientific papers all day long.  That's not what I want to do.  I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.

       A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view.  It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...

       I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.

        Tom Van Flandern

       and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book
       <em>
        The Cosmic War
       </em>
       ) offer a
       <em>
        technological
       </em>
       explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was
       <em>
        deliberately
       </em>
       destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."
      </p>
      <p>
       In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading
       <em>
        Dark Matter, Missing Planets &amp; New Comets
       </em>
       by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.

       Now that's a possibility mainstream science really doesn't entertain, yet would be fascinating if true. And the possibility is certainly there to keep something like that hidden, since the 'powers' in charge now have been in charge since the advent of rockets.

       This is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).

       I find this CIA experiment with Ingo Swann to be interesting and relevant:
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

        https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars):

       It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did right an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.

        Holy moly.  It's  not literally dark, dude.  It's tidally locked &amp; we only ever see one side.  The moon has days and nights, just like us.

       Well, that's probably pretty unlikely.  It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's  pretty close to a vacuum.  There  is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I  think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.   And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.   The moon is a trippy place.

       <strong>
        But do I think the other side has air and vegetation?  No.
       </strong>

       I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side.  Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't  judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories.

       Yes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part.  I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case.  I just always took the name at face value I guess.  It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.

       Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.

       But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"

       Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel Press

       Neither of these are in print.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment base on what can be found about the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.

       Isn't it established that a planet
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.
       </p>

       The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted
       <em>
        natural
       </em>
       explanation for a hollow planetoid.

       hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:
      </p>
      <p>
       The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one.

       . A Moon either being brought here or built here (by an advance Creator(s)) could explain the Great Deluge and the numerous underground dwellings and cities, among the other anomalies of the moon (ie size ratio to Earth, and the pefectness of all proportions - not to far, not to close - just right distance to the sun, etc etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).

       <a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/190000/velka/moon-in-a-blue-sky.jpg">
        see the blue sky through the Moon
       </a>
       . Almost as if it's semi-transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'
      </p>
      <p>
       As it's a coincidence both the Sun, and Moon appear the same size during an eclipse despite the Sun being 400x larger, and 400x farther away.

       Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.
      </p>

       Having said that, it is interesting that the moon ans sun appear almost the same size in the sky.

       you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.

       The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be?  Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.

       Well since Nasa mostly exists to deceive, I think we should really be discussing what the moon and sun really are if they are not what we have always grown up believing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the same subject, where do the rockets we launch really go and what are they really studying? No rocket launch has ever benefit the public in any fashion whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the sun only a few hundred miles up? That is certainly in range of these rockets - maybe that's what they are headed to study? Same with the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you go forward and live life knowing you might never be able to know some of these things?
      </p>
      <p>
       The easy answer is to just blindly accept what we've been told, but there are way too many oddities. Nasa doesn't do science, they just do press releases and "tell" us what they've "found" or what they are doing. 99% of their pictures, including every picture of earth's curvature, all the pictures of saturn and other planets etc, looks like a photoshop job. We know CGI can fake anything now, just look at the movie Gravity. Everybody believes the earth is a sphere, yet no one has ever seen it unless you trust those in the hands of the guys that control everything. On that subject, what does SpaceX know?

       One of the most interesting conspiracies by far is that the earth is not the rotating, floating globe we have always been taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       What on earth is it then? Where do we really live, if not this endless black void of space? It is unfortunately very tough to find good information on this subject, and deniers are ridiculed, hallmarks of any real conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If earth not a globe, all the alien crap can go out the window (just look at the articles all over the media today about NASA looking for an alien defense person), and it explains why there has been no true venture into space ever. Star Wars, Star Trek, most science fiction is barking down the wrong tree if earth not a globe.

       There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://joedubs.com/squaring-the-circle/">
        http://joedubs.com/squaring-the-circle/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of piâ11/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.

       Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always, and is the PERFECT distance and size from the earth to eclipse the sun, it seems like the moon is the most likely candidate for an artificial satellite.

       That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematically elegance

       The dimensions of the Giza pyramid correspond dimensions of our planet at a scale of 1 to 432,000. The sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet
      </p>
      <p>
       481.3949 feet * 432,000 = 207,962,596.8 feet = 3,938.685 miles
      </p>
      <p>
       3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)
      </p>
      <p>
       approximate diameter of the sun = 864,000 miles
432 * 2 = 864
      </p>
      <p>
       approximate diameter of moon = 2,160 miles
432 / 2 = 216
      </p>
      <p>
       With all this in mind, I suspect that they understood exactly how big the earth, the sun, and the moon were.

       A) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree and
B) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate.  According to wikipedia it was 480.6 ft.

       They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks, passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has unified units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.

       the distance of 1 KM is still the same amount of distance if measured in Miles, but the numbers are different because each unit of measurement is in comparison to a control. Every measurement is just measuring the variance from the original control object.

      <p>
       Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well.

       This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7 â 3.1428...

       Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.

       I love this subject! There is a whole bunch of anomalies with the moon from its density, its size, its position, its gravity. The moon isn't naturally occurring as far as I'm convinced and is a construct. I suggest people read 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight if you want a more in depth elaboration :)

       One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.)  What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down.  That would explain why our clock is off.  But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?

       Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system?  i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?

       Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock.

       I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;).

       I love moon mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude.  Aliens upon aliens!
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since?

       The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species.

       We are developing plans for catching asteroids and placing them into orbit around destination planets/moons for use of a depot station and middle ground in expeditions and resource harvesting.

       When I read this the moon made sense.  It's designed.  Perfect distance and rotational speed: always one side facing us.

       The topic of moon landing validity falls at the feet of the video proof.

       My grandfather was a mathematician for NASA and worked on the mission.  We definitely went there.

       My theory: the video is the original fake news.  What we discovered about or on the moon, it was decided, did not fit the narrative.

       The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed.

       Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how practical "landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be.

       I too am interested in the purpose, other than completely undermining everyone's reality. IMO globe-earth shows how easy it is to convince people of whatever you want, just stick a globe in every classroom of every child and they will always grow up thinking they live on a rotating ball in space without wondering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they don't want people thinking this land here is all we've got? Who knows, but I'd welcome answers as well. Who benefits from lying about the true nature of earth, and for what purpose? There's money in it for space agencies, but that's just a drop in the bucket. Must be something far deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       If true, the concealment of what and where we really live is probably one of the most interesting conspiracies out there. Any thoughts welcome.

       I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.

       And the logo consists of a snake's tongue (which they try to pass off as a "wing").... the serpent that deceived Eve? Strange stuff for sure. All the proofs for a round earth involve trusting others you'll never meet or doing things you can never do yourself. Other proofs rely on believing the current mainstream model of the universe. Meanwhile most everything can be explained on a still and flat earth, just with a different model. It's enough to make one wonder in this age of mass deception.

       That's true, a spherical earth eliminates the concepts of up and down, heaven and hell. It also opens the way for evolution, big bang, and everything else that comes with the current model we are all taught. Mainstream science certainly does lead people away from God, as it basically says in the beginning nothing exploded, creating everything, which then evolved into us. No creator necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I don't know if leading people away from God would be the main reason for 'global' deception.

       So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat.  So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members?  Clearly all of this is created either way.  Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's.  I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat.  There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space.  I don't think any of it has to do with religion.  The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.

       That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

       We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves.  No one is guarding the entire edgle.  It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up.  We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites.  I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it.  I think they walked on the moon.

       A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape.  This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere.  The firmament is in Genesis.

       The is really no photographic evidence of earth from space. Go ahead google earth from space. Be warned, you will encounter tons of logos or obviously fake images, a few that look like they could be real, and some from nasa itself that don't even have the continents at the right scale. Photographic evidence in the case of earth from space can not be trusted whatsoever as it comes from the opposition, but even if you do trust it you can clearly tell most of it is fake. There is simply too much variation for it to be photos of the same thing.

       The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.

       it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular.

       if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives  they don't like.

       Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. 
All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it?

       oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes.

       What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust.

       We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to.

       Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.

       that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for the fact mars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think.

       Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun? I personally am agnostic due to the insane amount of coincidences like this but I'd like to know this, because space is a very real and fact (math)-based science.

       Regarding this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.

       not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. the fact that it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris.

       I certainly don't think it's coincidence that the Moon is, visually, pretty much the exact same size as the sun in the sky despite them being completely different sizes and distances; so much so that the Moon can almost perfectly eclipse the Sun.
       <br/>
       It appears to have been put in place to reflect sunlight to the dark side of the planet, or block sunlight to combat global heating.
       <br/>
       However, it was, at some point, knocked out of intended alignment/orbit and therefore no longer serves its intended purpose.

       Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.

       Mainstream academia mouthpieces (assuming you have some reason to believe them) claim that the Moon is moving away at an extremely slow rate; about 4cm per year.
       <br/>
       And even they don't claim to know how long that's been going on for or whether or not it will continue, or even reverse.
       <br/>
       And I'm not on board with your '
       <em>
        strange and rare things happen
       </em>
       ' view when it comes to the Moon.
       <br/>
       That's enough for me to consider the possibility that it's coincidence but it's not enough for me to think that it's
       <em>
        probably
       </em>
       a coincidence.
       <br/>
       I think that it's far more likely that the moon (which is exactly 400x smaller than the sun and positioned exactly where it needs to be in order to have the same shape &amp; size as the sun from our POV) was put there intentionally.

       Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit

       Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago:
      </p>
      <p>
       The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the âWTC7 collapsingâ footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes from the documentary âA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moonâ but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-Aa">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-Aa
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty convincing right? Lets look at more footage of âEarth at a distanceâ:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4x">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4x
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Zooming in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3Ae">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3Ae
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2">
        http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, how exactly does this happen?
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, isnât the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out.
      </p>

      <p>
       But wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hold on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Is that aâ¦ work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait a minute, whats going on?
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       Ready to have your mind completely shattered? Look:

      </p>
      <p>
       So wait, what? Yeah, that âEarth at a distanceâ was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little âEarth ballâ at a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like âLow Earth Orbitâ close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Orâ¦ I donât know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me set the record straight once and for all:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you personally subscribe to any âFlat Earthâ or âalternate Earth modelsâ?â NO
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions?â YES
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon?â YES, because the unmanned soviet
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme">
        Lunokhod
       </a>
       program left retroreflectors there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etcâ¦?â I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are you trying to prove then?â I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous âEarthâ. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know this is real NASA footage?â Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I donât know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of fact,
       <a href="http://www.clavius.org/bibsibrel.html">
        here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage
       </a>
       , scroll to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is their explanation:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast.
       <strong>
        Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings
       </strong>
       . Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       And finally, here is
       <a href="https://youtu.be/xciCJfbTvE4?t=32m20s">
        the TIMESTAMPED section of âA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moonâ
       </a>
       if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of âcontextâ could possibly explain it.

       perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again

       The Moon has 100% been a part of (or in the vicinity of Earth) since the formation of Earth. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together.
      </p>

       This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.

       Why thank you. And to add, I do believe the moon landings happened and that the Moon and Earth were once one body but you never know! There is definitely a lot of fishy stuff about the Apollo missions but that doesn't translate into them being staged.

       Other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in others in our galaxy but none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in relation to the size of the Earth itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big in as they are as our own does and most likely shouldn't have been able to in light of that.

       Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like ancient one for the Sun being called "Sol". The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people who worshipped "Diana" was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and was worshipped by dancing under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies and rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and whole lot of people are utterly fascinated... almost to the point of being under a spell by it, wouldn't you say?

       You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other.

       The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space
       <em>
        between them
       </em>
       that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their combined orbit around the Sun as they wheel around together is also highly unusual and bringing them even closer to the Sun than Neptune through parts of it.

       Pluto isn't a planet anymore, but it is an example of a big moon relative to the primary body.

       I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of years from now, the Moon will be further away from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets about 4cm further from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observations

       I've seen this several times. If by "millions" you mean 10 million, or less, then at the rate of 4 cm/yr, the distance (thereby the moonly occlusion in an eclipse), will be in the neighborhood of 0.1%, no?

       Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

       ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason.

       i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars

       now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?

       I follow suit with the ship hypothesis with a way out their notion. I think it is the key to reincarnation. Our consciousness is nothing more than the sun providing the energy to the moon. The farther(sun) provides the seed to the womb of the mother(moon), giving birth to the holy ghost(earth)

       The Moon is your yin self. It is ever-changing from full to transparent. It is equal in size to the Sun, your yang self. That Moon and that Sun are yours alone. Both are conceptual manifestations of you. Neither entirely exists physically. They are right above you, inside the dome, you are inside your very own plane-ette of experience. The Sun appears as your corona, where a single point of intention to exist meets infinite non-existent potential erupting in bright heated light. The Moon is infinite manifest non-existence, manifest as existence. You are in between your Sun and your Moon on a plane-ette of experience, where all you see or know is self overlain on infinite individualities. All you see or know is your self externalized onto infinity from within a time-space conceptualization that is designed to keep you individual and sane within an infinite non existent conception.

       The moon has an equal chance of or being a flat somewhat translucent disc. There is documented stars being seen through the unlit portion of the moon. We also know it is much smaller due to the shadow size being approx 70miles  in the upcoming eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting stuff, more interesting is that mainstreamed science won't touch this possibility. Likely to continue to cover up the moon landing hoax.

       I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it.

       there are lots of movies, songs and shows lately that speak about the end. it's well past 2012 so i don't think it has anything to do with that. i think something really is coming. kanye tried to tell people the truth recently and he got taken off to the hospital by handcuffs....bieber has been going to bible study and he cancelled his tour. idk. things just seem weird. i just heard harry styles song "sign of the times" and i can't get it out of my head. i know this is kind of off topic but predictive programming is 100% real and we need to talk more about it.

       well there's good 'evidence' of underground cavern systems on the moon but i like the idea it's a huge hollowed out space ship. Easy to test I guess with usa, china, russia, and everyone wanting to go there to exploit/ experiment/ prove concept.

       I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA. You had this absolutely batshit crazy paranoia about communists and you want me to believe that we were just going give away information about out advanced space vehicles, lunar modules, first photos of the moon to the "commies" .

        Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculation
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm
       <sup>
        3)
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.

       Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries
       <a href="http://www.astropy.org/">
        used by professionals
       </a>
       - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets.
       <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03031">
        This paper
       </a>
       is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.

       all 4 rocky planets (mercury, venus and mars) could have
once hosted life. the secret is melting the core. 
you can do that by simply moving the planet closer to the sun
and wait. once you melt the core you get a magnetic field.
not only that, planets may be growing in size(look for the growing
earth theory) if this is true. mercury may become the next venus.
venus may become the next earth. and as we all know earth 
will be the next mars. 
the only planet we have left is mars. if we want to make it life 
supportive we need alien advance technology to move it where
mercury is now. the it will spin faster than it should (einstein solve this)
and it may gain back its liquid core, magnetic field, grow a little
cover itself in hot magma, and the cicle continues. thats my theory.

       Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.

      <p>
       Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.

       Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.

       I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons.  I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started.  I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask.  It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).

       oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes.

       not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. the fact that it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris.

       39321.8181818 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 35372 miles or an error of about 90%) you'll probably have to add some crap about ratios or factors in there.

      <p>
       You might as well use the real numbers

       Shower thought..
      </p>
      <p>
       Moon is artificial
      </p>
      <p>
       Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse
      </p>
      <p>
       When did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer this and we know how old the moon is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was a perfect eclipse necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about

      <p>
       Not that rare.  100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.
