        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/totally6667.html">totally6667</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Check their comments too. </p>

<p>If its usually deconstructive bullshit that doesn&#39;t contribute to the general &quot;vibe&quot; of the sub, and they resort to name calling and ad hominem attacks (yet still massively up voted comments), it is likely to be a paid provocateur or a shill. </p>

<p>I click on most shills history and notice their last post is usually over 100 days ago, in a completely unrelated non-political-social-conspiratorial themed sub, and all previous comments have been deleted. This usually indicates that they bought and reactivated an old account from someone who ditched reddit. <strong>This is how they blend in</strong>.</p>

<p>Be wary of users who delete their comments too. </p>

<p>Also, just so you know, there are a few variety of shills. <strong>Long term and short term.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Long term shills have been here since the start of this sub.</strong> They likely started out by building a decent reputation, playing ball within the &quot;conspiracy arena&quot;, and then slowly after they got the communities trust, they subtly &quot;nudge&quot; the users that trust them away from ideas detrimental to the power structure they secretly serve. These guys are pretty smart, but not smart enough. </p>

<p><strong>They could be users you even respect</strong>. They are very sly about shaming certain topics that they want to community to not look into. They also can craft and change their stance on certain topics to lead you astray. They often play &quot;devils advocate&quot; and are highly up voted. I cannot name any names, but I think most of you are aware of which &quot;group&quot; who I&#39;m referring too...</p>

<p>Short term shills are on call. Someone posts about Pizzagate related Tamera Luzzato&#39;s creepy fetish kid site, masquarading as a family friendly blog? On call shills get a notification, and they flock to the posts. They coordinate quickly, and down vote and push their narrative to &quot;debunk&quot; or shame the post. </p>

<p>These people have several accounts. They don&#39;t let just ANYONE be a fucking shill, or you could blab and rat out the whole operation on youtube. The whole notion on manipulating online forum discussion is sinister as hell and they do NOT want that getting out to the public. If it did, it would show how desperate they really are and would <strong>underscore everything the conspiracy culture has pointed out about them.</strong></p>

<p>The alphabet agencies are likely employing these people. CIA, Stratfor, Government employees who vow to secrecy on the matter, family friends, employees with extra time on their hands. Higher ups, intelligent people who know the conspiracy well enough to know it&#39;s weaknesses and to be able to debate it with people like us. </p>

<p>Be aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea its much smaller than you think. It&#39;s a very covert operation they have going.</p>

<p>Honestly we have pretty much uncovered how they operate, what to look out for, ect. They have <em>very</em> little influence over the people who browse this sub because, lets face it, you can&#39;t bullshit a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>The shills are turning their wheels and wasting money...Not that their overlords can&#39;t just print more anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of things:</p>

<p>First: Your definition of &quot;long term&quot; shill is complete bullshit. It&#39;s entirely possible that someone joined the community a long time ago, felt at home, participated regularly, and then suddenly the sub takes a drastic turn in a direction that they cannot intellectually follow.</p>

<p>Huh, you know what&#39;s odd? There&#39;s constantly posts on this sub numerous times a day about how this sub has changed, or someone is tired of the politics, hearing about Clinton, Trump, or Russia. It&#39;s almost as if what I mentioned in the previous paragraph is exactly what&#39;s going on. Bottom line, long term users that suddenly seem at odds with the &quot;accepted narrative&quot; aren&#39;t shills. They&#39;re people with a difference of opinion. Although, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll just disagree with me, and call me....a shill.</p>

<p>Second: Playing devil&#39;s advocate is not indicative of being a shill. Playing devil&#39;s advocate is an effective way to help someone see something from a different perspective. If the purpose of this sub is to get people discussing things honestly in search of truth, and not yelling in unison like they&#39;re in an echo chamber, then I would say we need more devil&#39;s advocates around here.</p>

<p>Being able to play devil&#39;s advocate is an effective, and vital, skill to have when working through complex problems. It allows a person to see the issue from multiple angles, and prevents a &quot;tunnel vision&quot; approach to problem solving. Unfortunately, not everyone can do it effectively, so it helps to have those that can so that those can&#39;t to see all angles of a situation.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your post, I&#39;m not gonna agree or disagree because I feel as if the shill talk around here is like beating a dead horse at this point. Yes, we know they exist. Yes, we know many of them are organized. Yes, we know they are likely being paid. But not everyone that disagrees with someone is a shill.</p>
