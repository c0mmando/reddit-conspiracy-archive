        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not stupid, but I&#39;m not a rocket scientist.</p>

<p>I work 14 hours a day farming cattle. Most nights I have a beer and a joint to unwind.</p>

<p>I try to keep up with events, but time zones often mean I can&#39;t get an accurate picture of how events unfold.</p>

<p>I support Trump, but not blindly. His policies on weed are medieval, and escalating tensions with NK is a terrible idea. And I think he&#39;s 10-20 years past being able to clearly articulate policy.</p>

<p>I follow all MSM fairly closely, yes Fox and CNN, while knowing that both (all) are full of bullshit.</p>

<p>Realistically, none of this has an impact on my life. I want peace and prosperity for all.</p>

<p>ELI5, what the fuck is happening? This is chaos like I have never seen (born 1990). I thought to myself during the election that Trump could be the worst, or best, President since WW2. He appears loose and incompetent, yet his message is one I believe in (citizens first, no war). </p>

<p>As much as I try to be objective and on top of events, I struggle. Does anybody else feel like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe we&#39;re in a soft civil war being fought between the four Estates: Government vs media, the people vs the media, and a collapse of the church. At the center of it all is the explosion of information brought about by the introduction of the internet. This is why things seem so chaotic. No one is really articulating this point of view but it feels accurate.<br/>
My advice is to learn the Trivium and quadrivium, read the great books of the western world, and be tolerant of different people&#39;s points of view. Don&#39;t let yourself get polarized or desensitized, it just feeds the chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump promised chaos. It is all a distraction so he can get things done. His accomplishments to date are astounding, especially considering the entire government is against him.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Campaign Promise 18: Pushing NATO allies to pay their fair share or face the reality of the US possibly leaving</p>

<p>Campaign Promise 23: The repeal and replacement of Obamacare. The recent GOP fallout of AHCA Plan was no fault of Trump&#39;s. The blame solely belongs to Speaker Ryan. He created a shit bill and couldn&#39;t even capitalize to get enough votes. Obamacare will crash in 2017 when individual mandates kick in and Democrats will be to blame.

</code></pre>

<p>Campaign Promise 28 (Scroll down to see &quot;School Choice and Education Act&quot;): To fix our country&#39;s incredibly broken education system</p>

<pre><code>Trump has signed an Executive Order giving the power of our country&#39;s education back to state and local authorities
</code></pre>

<p>ACTIONS NOT PROMISED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BUT HAVE BEEN PUT IN EFFECT:</p>

<pre><code>(Even though it was Mike Pence) The defunding of clinics that perform abortions. Because no matter whether you are pro-choice/pro-life, the government should not be funding abortions. (Also, if people bring up the Hyde Amendment which is supposed to not let any federal funding go towards abortions, LET THEM KNOW that US taxpayers pay for about 24% of abortions despite of that &quot;amendment&quot;)

Huge spikes in the NASDAQ average index and the DOW average index starting November 8th. (This will count for Obama unfortunately, but we know where the real credit belongs.)

He has placed sanctions on Iran after they tested ballistic missiles

He has met with/talked to over 68 foreign leaders

He negotiated down the Price of the new Air Force One one billion dollars in a meeting that lasted just one hour

He issued major cuts to the costs of the F-35 saving billions

He has opened the eyes of the American public to just how unbelievably corrupt (pretty believable to most) the Obama Administration was.

After spending 3 years in a prison in Egypt, and absolutely no help from President Obama, humanitarian and US citizen Aya Hijazi has safely returned home and has given all credit to President Trump

    <div class="md"><p>There is a great amount of unrest, sure, but I also think the unrest is played up both here and in the media and most average Americans, like your self, are tired of it. </p>

<p>Remember, its easier to control what people <em>think</em> that &quot;everyone else&quot; thinks, than it is to control people&#39;s actual thinking. So the media creates this narrative of <strong>EVERYONE</strong> thinks that Trump is awful and racist and Russia this and Russia that, and you don&#39;t want to be different than everyone else do you? </p>

<p>While in reality I think your average person DOES agree with Trumps overall message, probably has some issues with the way he delivers it all, but overall does NOT think he is the antichrist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crony capitalism run amok.</p>

<p>The lives of normal people should be just fine, but corporate vampires infiltrate every aspect of our lives to suck up money from every crevice.  This is why you see an entire system of massive debt and stagnant wages.  There is something to be said for pure capitalism, but that is not the system we have and the crony capitalism we do have has invaded every hallowed institution of humanity, such as health, education, justice, behavior correction, etc..., perverting all of these into vampiric money-sucking programs designed to swindle the masses of wealth and dignity.</p>

<p>Trump and Clinton are two sides of the same coin and neither one has your interests at heart.  Talk to your neighbors and treat them with respect.  Left and right need to meet at the center and abandon the Democratic and Republican parties.  Start voting third party and running for office.  Start challenging every bought and sold incumbent.  Start pushing progressive policies to undo the corporate juggernaut that is crushing us all under it&#39;s bloated obesity.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get caught up in the CNN and FOX News hype.  It&#39;s mostly disinformation and the real solutions lie in working together as the 99%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my opinion: Trump is against the Washington DC elite and the corruption and waste they bring, but that doesn&#39;t mean Trump won&#39;t try to make money with his position. But I think he wants more for the people, and he&#39;s working towards that. But Democrats and RINOS are preventing him from moving forward too much. </p>

<p>His first steps were to address his 100 day promises, and he did. He tried to do everything on that list, but not everything got done, due to RINO and librul interference. The DC Elite don&#39;t want to lose their stream of money from corporations and foreign countries, so they will stay corrupt, but not if the Dept of Justice gets straightened out. </p>

<p>There also seems to be a lot of pedophilia in the DC area and the FBI has been trying to nail them for years but Obama put the stop to that. The FBI really hated Comey.</p>

<p>So Trump has been trying to replace crooked people in the FBI and DOJ, but has had little success as he keeps giving people positions, and then finds out either the new person is 1) corrupt as other elite DC people or 2) not competent. </p>

<p>There are still a few decent people at leadership levels in the FBI, but the CIA is mostly pro-NWO, so the CIA is a lost cause.</p>

<p>But the whole NWO was predicated on these things: </p>

<ol>
<li>Dumb down children so they can&#39;t think for themselves. </li>
<li>Create a generation or more of adult children who can neither take care of themselves, or have high levels of depression and anxiety, so they become weak and feeble and not fight back, and will believe any fake news that is told to them. This step has been highly successful. </li>
<li>Keep creating fake news that gullible people will believe, since they can&#39;t think for themselves. </li>
<li>Poison the food and water to further weaken people. Some poisons affect the brain, and this is part of the plan. 
This is my area of research.</li>
</ol>
