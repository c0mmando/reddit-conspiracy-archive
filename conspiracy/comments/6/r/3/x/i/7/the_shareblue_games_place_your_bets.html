       I am only commenting in support of the fact this comment was made and referenced on r/topmindsofreddit as having been self-approved by a mod in supposed violation of rule 1. Fuck topmindfags, and why do they choose to have nothing better to do than shit on other people? This is exactly what r/conspiracy is not about, shitting on people because of the ideas they hold and want to discuss.

       Okay...  Keep saying it til your blue in the face, please.  Posting in a sub on Reddit does not define who you are as a person.  There is no test to posting there, you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that right?  Literally anyone can create an account and post there.  You don't have to sign a bloodoath for them to allow you to post.

       You're right. Where you post does not define who you are as a person. Your actions and words do. The actions and words of those who regularly post in
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       tend to say that they are willing to ignore Trump's sleaziness, they are willing to overlook any underhanded actions by the government on his orders, and they are willing to push blame for the actions of those in power to someone else.

       Yeah, it's the fucking rules in the sidebar of that sub.  You clearly know the purpose of the sub.  Are you salty that you can't post about your transgender friends being upset about the military ban in T_D or something?  That isn't what it's for.  They even made an entirely different sub for whiny losers who can't handle the fact that T_D is devoted to supporters.

       It's the only place on Reddit where people like you wont attack someone for supporting the President, but of course that somehow damages your sensitive little fee fees so you have to go around, in every discussion on every sub you visit and talk shit about people for posting there.

       I don't get triggered.  I literally do not care one iota what you think.  I don't believe you capable of having any enlightening discourse, nor are you capable of teaching me anything.  Your mind is shut like a steel trap, slowly pressurizing the propaganda you have been spoon fed into a white hot coal of impotent rage.  I imagine you flapping your feminine hands that dangle from the ends of your feeble wrists at your keyboard with that spark of hatred for all that is good burning behind your beady little eyes while you struggle with the notion that you will never sway an opinion in your life.

       Take another sip of that big gulp, have another serving of cheetohs (Healthy At Every Size!) and push through it.  SOMEDAY maybe, in a future where you practice introspection, you
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       make a cogent and salient point in an online discussion.  All you have left is that hope.

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       Many people who use td view and comment elsewhere.  You assume that they never have their views challenged or somehow try to avoid it but
       <strong>
        they come to reddit
       </strong>
       which is almost entirely an anti Trump circle jerk.  Td is the only place where their views are not harangued or downvoted into obscurity. Yet they still come to reddit.  I think you are misrepresenting those people to a surprising degree.

       Ok let's do a thought experiment. Imagine people that are used to talking to others that constantly agree with you. No one tries to disagree with the consensus because it will end up being ignored and censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that person exits that, let's call it safe space, and tries to communicate with people that do not agree with them. What will happen? They think that given there are hundreds of people in their safe space that agree with them those that disagree must be fake or shills because it's impossible that people disagree with your opinion since you have been constantly reaffirmed that your opinion must be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you might understand why I think it's hard to discuss with people that live in those safe spaces, given that everything they don't agree with must be absolutely wrong.

       absolutely!  gonna post in response to you just because.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a r/conspiracy user long before a The_Donald user.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had my account listed, RESed, harassed, vote manipulated, Pmed, banned from multiple subs:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned from r/ama for trying to get an AMA with the person who exposed Hillary's server guy asking reddit for help.
      </p>
      <p>
       From r/videos for posting a video explaining Pepe isn't racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just an r/conspiracy user that believe's the PTB want rampant globalism and hope for a better way. Meanwhile, there is $40 m fresh dollars for CTR, now named Shareblue.
      </p>
      <p>
       They distort all news with prefab talking points, they vote empty articles to #1 on r/all, they keep negative Trump articles at the top and truthful ones find no airing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was that the State Department staff "resigned as a protest to Trump", #1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The articles actually telling the truth, that Trump had told them they were out, it doesn't show up anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Hillary's team birddogs Bernie supporters into attacking Trump supporters, the Trump supporters happen to always be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Headline (Bernie Supporters): It wasn't us, it was Hillary's people!
      </p>
      <p>
       But it was them, they just allowed themselves to get incited by Hillary's people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was the thing that got me onto The_Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can post all the statistics you want, but the truth is, what your one-sided analysis failed to account for was how many r/conspiracy users became T_D users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Near zero became r/hillaryclinton users.

       I'm so glad you've decided to raise this in a thread where you can see EXACTLY what happens. Sensitive people whine about the fact that a person is from T_D whenever they dare participate in any other sub.

       You believe that people use T_D as a safe space, but vilify them for not staying in there. Seems like you're the one in need of a safe space.

      <p>
       You'll probably find there are MANY people in MANY subs who use a T_D alt because they can't be bothered with the ridiculous conversation shutdown attempts.

       You're letting your very obvious hatred and bias for people who support Donald Trump cloud all of your judgement and reason.  Plenty of people post in different subreddits for plenty of different reasons, you don't even have to be a hardcore supporter of Donald Trump to post in TD.  Plenty of good people also like Donald Trump and that has nothing to do with who they are as a person.  Why does that fucking obvious point escape you?

       Was Barack Obama or Bush as obvious of con men to you?  Because they are significantly worse on many fronts, backed up by the historical record.  Those people are actual war criminals with thousands of bodies at their feet, who committed provable acts of treason and high crimes and misdemeanors.  Trump hasn't done any of that, at least not yet.

       He did sell weapons to SA even though he said he wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm pretty sure under Trump the attacks in Syria have increased there was even that one attack which all advisers were against because of high civilian casualties and Obama never agreed to it, and he did. So in that way Trump is definitely worse.

       I certainly don't agree with his Saudi arms deal, but to be fair the deal was already in place and agreed upon when Obama was President.  Not to mention there has been regime change behind the scenes in Saudi Arabia to the more moderate members of the House of Saud, the extent of which we have yet to discover fully.  There's always more than meets the eye to what Trump does, taking everything he does at face value without acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes means you're only getting half the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has only personally intervened in Syria once, and that was the missile strike that was essentially a show of force that amounted to nothing other than pleasing the neocons in his administration and getting the media to actually get behind him for once because they fucking love war.  I'm not letting Trump off the hook at all for continuing to push military industrial complex agendas, but to say that he's worse than Barack Obama - a guy literally nicknamed the Drone King who even
       <em>
        ran out of bombs
       </em>
       because he dropped so many on Syria - is not backed up by reality.  Obama has tens of thousands of dead civilians and collateral damage with his name on it from prosecuting what, 7 different wars?  Trump is actively scaling down much of these conflicts and openly calling for pulling out of Afghanistan, and he's already defunded the CIA and their support for ISIS.

       They were "accused" of being a T_D poster.  They're "guilty" of posting there.  That's what they meant by accusation, and that's how it's used often in conversation.  It doesn't strictly mean fault of crime. 
 You're trying to twist it into an attack that it isn't.

       I think with so many people into conspiracies if that were to happen there would be more civil unrest than the 60s. Trump supporters would immediately and vehemently accuse the deep state of the assassination and every bridge between them and the existing government framework would be burned to hell. That would be crossing the rubicon for the deep state and I believe that's why trump is surrounding himself with generals. Ultimately it would come down to who the military sides with.

       We'll keep Russia going for years. Either it'll end in Trump being impeached or indicted (both incredibly unlikely) or we'll just keep him fighting against that narrative for as long as we can, and hopefully it'll impact his re-election chances.

       Except an ongoing investigation?  I think it's funny how people try to act like it's a sham because "nothing has come of it so far!" when there's an ongoing investigation.  How can you deem nothing has happened when we don't have the results of the investigation yet?  Surely that will prove something one way or the other and we can put it to rest right?

       Doesn't matter if no one cares or believes. They'll still push that shit and even with everyone knowing it's bullshit, there can still be real world effects from it. Remember 2002 when Iraq bullshit started up in the media? Remember in 2003 when we invaded Iraq even though it was obviously on bullshit pretenses?

       Given that only 6% of the country actually gives a shit about this, you're fucking deluded.

       Maybe you should realize civil discourse is used to paper over the crimes committed by American empire. So-called adult thinking has precipitated decades of war crimes in the name of American freedom. I take being called childish, by the likes of you, as a badge of honor, because at least I know that I am not infected with good-thinking liberalism, which at its root, depends on the deaths of millions to exist (and has for centuries, tbh).

       The CIA funded jihadis in Syria who beheaded a child while on Obama's watch. Obama let the CIA sow chaos in Syria that  led directly to that war crime. The refugees that have fled Syria and drowned in the Mediterrean is another war crime. The illegal drone war approved by Obama is a series war crimes. Imprisoning Manning and allowing her to be tortured for revealing said war crimes, is a war crime.

       We'd be crazy to not keep talking about it. It certainly helps that Trump and Co keep walking right into it too. Conservatives tried it with the birther movement, but it became sort of irrelevant. As long as Trump stays shady with Russia, the narrative will continue.

       Ok so I have a honest question...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there so much attention and finger pointing to the shittiness that is CTR/ShareBlue but very little when it comes to Right leaning organizations like Cambridge Analytica?

      <p>
       We are in middle of an astroturf war on both sides

       I would just like the truth.  That's it.  Not right spin not left spin not disinformation from anyone.  Shouldn't our focus be on weeding out fake narratives from every side?

       Pretty fucking simple. This sub leans hard on right wing even though most of them say they are non-partisan. So you get things like "Both sides are the same" or "what about Clinton" or "X did this first" ect.

       As a BernieBro I witnessed first hand CTR destroy Reddit last year. /politics was always liberal but was like 80% fellow BernieBros before the convention. I'd even say there was more Trump support than Hillary support there back then. Or at least close to equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary supporters were the ones ridiculed and ostracized there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In /conspiracy the love for Bernie and Trump was more equal but back then no one attacked the other like they do now for saying which side they were on. Both were outsiders. We had a common enemy, we all hated Hillary and knew her corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weekend of the Democratic convention CTR took over /politics and has maintained their stranglehold ever since. With small pockets of normalcy here and there, like the day after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was obvious. You could tell a difference. You got human responses like "well I voted Hillary but I hope Trump is successful"
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew it was only a matter of time before they came here. It started mid to late January, around the inauguration, and they've been here ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dozens of them with names I'd committed to memory that almost all were accounts made in January. Those names got too compromised however and they don't post here anymore, but new ones keep popping up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking people with no prior post history in /conspiracy, and who tow the MSM propaganda line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, because I haven't experienced Cambridge Analytica. They didn't make me hate Hillary. They didn't make me start loving Wikileaks those years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may exist and be active. But they don't have the power and reach of the mainstream media.

       Lol if you've paid attention long enough on this sub you can tell more and more of his supporters are embarrassed, even on here. They all started out as Trump supporters, and by now they say shit like "I'm not a Trump supporter but.... Then they'll defend his every action. Another popular trick they use is by calling themselves Bernie Bro's. It's honestly funny and anyone outside of thier circlejerk can tell thier wearing masks.

       Yeah, the whole "as a ____" or "I'm not a trump supporter but..." angle is kinda funny to see. Especially when they get called out for not being a muslim/mexican/black person/etc. from other previous comments of theirs.

       They definitely seem a lot more low energy these days. There are threads on the front page of the_donald with only 23, 26, 34, 36, etc. comments.

       Or instead of your silly little strawman you can realize that there's a lot of broad support and overlap across the board with both Bernie Sanders and Trump, due to the fact that they both were outsiders and ran anti-establishment campaigns.  Some people aren't partisan hacks and can set aside their mutual differences for shared goals, theirs was to make sure that Clinton didn't get in.  Tons of Bernie voters switched to Trump after the primaries too.

       Not going to get into a massive discussion about it here since it's the wrong sub, but the only reason Bernie conceded and backed Hillary is so he has any chance whatsoever to do anything with the backing of the democratic party. He's going to need them for his fight for single-payer.

       Just like Trump is.  And her investigation was started with hearsay allegations.  Don't act like she's guilty just because there's an investigation.  If you do, start acting like Trump is guilty too.

       I find it hard to believe that so many Sanders supporters went to Trump's side, especially given their vastly different ideologies and political tendencies. It's like saying, "Yeah sure I supported veganism, but since it was shut down I moved over to a strict meat-only diet".

       I was a Bernie or Bust'er from the start and I meant it. When the DNC robbed me of my vote for Bernie, I voted for Bust. I didn't vote FOR Trump, I voted against Hillary. She of all people needed to be kept out of office. So I voted for incompetency over malice. A lot more of us exist than expected. A vote for anybody other than Trump was ultimately a vote for Hillary and so it had to be done to stop her.

       Because those Bernie supporters saw the media attack Trump like they did Bernie, enemy of my enemy.  Trump was also the only candidate calling out Hillary for her BS, I'm sure that endeared a lot of them to him.

       A lot of young people didn't care about the politics and just wanted an outsider which Trump was, and Hillary most certainly was not.

       Not supporting Trump doesn't mean you have to support Hillary. Supporting neither is an option. Supporting grassroots candidates is an option. Supporting a third party is an option.

       You can't speak for an entire group just because you feel a certain way. It doesn't matter what percentage of Sanders supporters ultimately voted for Trump, it was a lot. I doubt Trump would have won the election if most of the Sanders supporters voted for Clinton. But it's okay, she didn't need us, right?

       A lot of people supported Sanders because it was the first chance we had to stop Clinton from becoming president.

       Interesting. I only asked because I've read lots of data that suggests Bernie supporters in more democratic states opted to stay home rather than vote Trump or third party. Supporters in more republican states were the ones to vote Trump or third party. Obviously all data has outliers, but just interesting.

       I was planning on Johnson but since Obama took my red state in 2008 I didn't want to take any chances and voted Trump to make sure she didn't too.

       It's funny to read this when, if you had YOUR way, you would have eagerly had the party fuck over Clinton supporters. You pretty much admit as much.
Don't try to stand on some moral high-ground. You're just mad you couldn't rig it your way. If it was an option, you would gladly have backed it.

       Fuck, I am so glad I didn't vote last election. There was not a single good candidate. Bernie was trash. Clinton was garbage. Trump was a shit. Stein is a moron.... I would've voted for Johnson if anything. But I don't regret staying home

       How do you know you haven't? I agree with pretty much everything you've said about CTR, but just because you don't think you've experienced astroturfing from another outfit doesn't mean you haven't. Personally, though, I'm sick of these meta ShareBlue/CTR posts (not yours, the OP and several others recently voted to hot)... it's just one big bitchfest and blanket statements about those that lean left or disagree with a conservative narrative or want to discuss conspiratorial aspects of Trump's presidency. It's getting really challenging to have any sort of discussion because there's just a lot of accusations of shills and now also "sanitized" accounts.

      <p>
       Again, I'm just curious, if you don't think you've experienced them then how do you know this to be true? Maybe their shilling is so good that you assume they are just a Joe the Plumber sharing their opinion when in reality they're playing on your hate of HRC/DNC and using that to push a narrative.

       I remember reading something that Cambridge Analytica has plenty of funding, so I'm not sure you really understand the level of influence they possibly have.

       That is opposite to what I saw CTR doing because Hillary was despised by both the left and the right for so long, to have them go all pro Hillary is just obvious.

       You're assuming that CA is only pushing a negative narrative about HRC. I hope you understand that CA also works to discredit negative stories about Trump and push conservative talking points which harden citizens' beliefs about these things even moreso (whether or not those beliefs are based on lies). CA is not just against HRC, but they're
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       establishment republicans. You're being fed propaganda by both sides and your assumption that CA isn't affecting you only allows them to continue to do it.

       I know. For some reason, they don't seem to get why a sub that's been left leaning for YEARS would be anti-Trump:
      </p>
      <p>
       -the president that fucks over the LGBT
      </p>
      <p>
       -that insults and demeans women
      </p>
      <p>
       -belongs to a party that won't raise the minimum wage
      </p>
      <p>
       -won't move towards universal healthcare
      </p>
      <p>
       -that hired Betsy Devos who wants to privatize the entire education system and screw over borrowers at the benefit of lenders
      </p>
      <p>
       -Hired Jeff Session who wants to criminalize marijuana and push more private prisons
      </p>
      <p>
       -Is anti-immigrant
      </p>
      <p>
       -Has the backing of conservative Christian groups that push for teaching Christianity in schools and institute it's Christian morality over an increasingly religiously-diverse nation
      </p>
      <p>
       -Is not intelligent or intellectual in ANY way and only embarrasses this country worse than George Bush
      </p>
      <p>
       -Is a republican
      </p>
      <p>
       -Became president despite losing the popular vote by the largest margin in history
      </p>
      <p>
       -Lies CONSTANTLY
      </p>
      <p>
       -Has an absolutely toxic following
      </p>
      <p>
       -is the most polarizing political figure in American history
      </p>
      <p>
       -has record-level unpopularity nationwide...
      </p>
      <p>
       So GEEEEEE,
       <em>
        I wonder why he would be so unpopular to Reddit
       </em>
       . Honestly, you couldn't tick off more boxes the demographics of this website is against if you fucking
       <em>
        tried
       </em>
       . It's not some massive conspiracy. This website has hated those things for years... and you think it's a mystery conspiracy as to why so many people hate the guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       How stupid do you have to be to think it's a mystery Donald Trump isn't popular on r/politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why the fuck do you obsess over it and care so much???? Jesus Christ. I have never seen such an obsession to be liked by a shithole sub you claim to hate so much. r/politics is GARBAGE. It's always been GARBAGE.

       This is exactly. I saw it change, and no amount of paid activist gaslighting will ever convince me what i saw was a wrong memory.  It changed, we all saw it who were there. It is a cesspool now and i pity any who go there for thoughtful discussion.

       There's still thoughtful discussion, it's just much harder to find.  Many of the most active users have been purged over the months, along with the best mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       ShariaBlue doesn't just astroturf here, I saw a marked uptick in months old articles and reposted shitposts get pushed to the front page on heavy news days.  Also, most important posts have "Bill Clinton is a rapist Infowars.com" or some such spammed as the top 100 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The waters over there have been muddied beyond recognition, and the mods who used to keep it clean have been run out.

       That is insane and not remotely true. Don't pull things out of your ass. I'm a Bernie supporter and I sure as hell didn't vote for that Dbag, neither did any of the Bernie supporters I know, and Bernie himself asked his supporters not to vote for Trump. That is a complete and utter lie.

       For me it is spirit of intent. The td folks are goofy and trollish, I can't quite decide if they even take themselves seriously. The CTR contingent are bitter, cruel, and hateful. The malice is palpable. TD folks are like a party that went too long, everyone is too drunk, and the jokes are really only funny to them.

       I think you've got that backwards. Trump people are so hateful. I only ever had one rational discussion with one of them. And this sub especially. Their favorite insult here is that I'm a pedophile or sympathizer, which if anyone knew me they would know that's nowhere close to true.

       Thing is it's mostly people from the T_D who come here to comment and are pro-trump, they arn't bots. ShareBlue comes here to suppress  stories that are damaging to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like if your pro MSM in a conspiracy sub, your an idiot. If  all you do is shut down ideas and opinions instead of an open convo, you may as well say nothing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Weed out the fake narratives from both sides" is hard since one side is possibly right. Look at Seth Rich for instance. Look at how much people are defending the original story in a conspiracy sub. They attack and go on for ever. It's obvious.

       Not at all. My point was the pro-trumpers are actually human, I do believe they may bot brigade the votes, but the comments are often authentic. Reason being they are on the right side of these current conspiracies, in my opinion. Seth rich for example, and pizzagate. Lots of shills involved with these 2 topics. How can one be a T_D shill when they are just exposing the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may shill over the whole Russia thing, but again... Russia Meddled, colluded, how bad is it? Not any worst then the CF so why is it being pushed down our throat.

       There's often a double-bind mentality that dominates threads, assuming that if I disagree with X therefore I must agree with Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich is a case in point. Some folks like myself don't buy the original MSM narrative but aren't convinced of the 4chan/wikileaks narrative either. And then folks on both sides start shouting
       <em>
        muh shills

       all over the place and all you're left with is static.

       Simple: this sub has stopped pretending to be about truth in conspiracies. Since the influx of right-wing spam during and after the election either the userbase shifted or people started showing more true colors. Then you have any user dissent being banned for a few months so when you have a younger account going against the narrative they can just say "lul 2 month account please" and you get a nice echo chamber. Cap it off with all mods added since the election being blatantly biased with enforcement and oh look here we are.

       How many times in your life have you seen the deep state try to take out a sitting president? The stakes with this Russian BS is the very foundations of American democracy. I realize this, and I am not a Trump supporter. This can not be allowed to happen, in my eventual hope, that Sanders or a Sabders backed candidate becomes President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unelected spooks can not rule our country and undermine the will of the people, which is what they (elements of the CIA and other intelligence agencies) are doing at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fake news the right-wing puts out is usually fairly easy to counteract with facts because it focuses on policies. This Russian shit is an insidious bag of lies that those who think they are the ruling class keep pushing out there in the long term desire to fully kill American democracy. You tell me which one is a real threat.

       <em>
        If
       </em>
       a president was elected who had allegiances or strong ties with a foreign adversary, how should that be handled?  If someone was elected who received information, online narrative assistance (bots, disinformation, hacking etc), and/or other forms of "assistance" to get elected in exchange for guiding policy in a favorable direction for that foreign power, what can be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll even take it to another level....what if the American public elected someone who was a murderer?  What if we had elected Hillary and it turns out that all the conspiracies about her and Bill were true?  That they personally ordered the death of a handful of people who had dirt on them, or opposed them?  Should the FBI be disallowed to investigate because it's not in line with the "will of the people"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there's a lot of misinformation flying around, and I agree that the MSM is spinning some seriously dubious information.  I also think that there might be some truth to the allegations buried in all the bullshit.  Look, my mind isn't made up one way or another because I really don't think that we know the whole story.  Could the IC be out to get Trump, sure.  Could Trump be dirty as fuck, sure.  Can both be true, sure.

       There are Constitutional channels and methods for dealing with these things. Spooks planting anon stories in the press, that have lead nowhere, is evidence of their attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the office, which in the long run, plays into their desire for power in this country, regardless of who is elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the CIA was funding jihadis in Syria (as well as other regions and countries, think Dagestan and Chechyna, as well as Af-Pak) while "fighting" the war on terror. Yet, you are more concerned that Trump is a criminal, when we have a criminal organization supporting groups that ultimately want to kill American citizens and thier allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are being distracted from the criminal reality of so-called American intelligence and secret defense operations. Shit that Snowden, Manning, and Wikileaks, as well as people like Sy Hersh have demonstrated over and over again for decades now.

       But that's how it is framed in most MSM contexts. And you want to act as if the actual crimes of intelligence agencies are equivalent to the supposed crimes of the sitting President. I don't play false equivalency games, that's something good-thinking liberal types do to justify their cultivated ignorance about the murder machine that is the US government. And I have no interest in maintaining that illusion.

       Again, I didn't say or imply that there was some sort of equivalence.  They're two separate issues.  Intelligence agencies can be up to nefarious shit AND the President can have his own bag of garbage.  In no way are those two things dependent or reliant on each other to be true or false

       Point me to the favorable position Trump has taken on Russia, please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he pull out of Syria and hand it over to them?  Did he rescind the sanctions his predecessor put in place (even after his SoS asked him to for his former company)?  Has he pulled out of NATO?  Has he moved any troops out of Eastern Europe?

       The thing about anonymous posts is that ANYONE CAN DO THEM. This is very far from conclusive...do you not think it's within the realm of possibility that these posts in your link are an attempt at false flag?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming they are legitimate, this is an example from TWO MONTHS AGO. For your line of reasoning to be valid, this would have to happen in roughly equal amounts between both sides...which has not been my experience at all. Every single thread that is even remotely political, quickly becomes bashing The_Donald or bashing people who think that Seth Rich was murdered for leaking to WL, or turns into a circlejerk about how corrupt Donald Trump is. Every single thread.

       I think it's naive to believe that only one group of people uses online bots/paid forum warriors to push an agenda.  You asked for evidence and I provided it.  If you want to keep your head buried in the sand, that's up to you.  But the truth is, like I said in my original comment, we are being astroturfed on all sides.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Is that a question? Okay, well the answer to your question is no, CA and CTR make/made very different claims about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, I know you weren't trying to ask a question. However, the thing that sets CTR and ShareBlue apart from other organizations is their direct engagement in social media using fake accounts. Sometimes, what may appear to be 15 different people is in fact one of David Brock's virgins off in some basement somewhere following ShareBlue talking points and guidelines.

       I am so sick of this partisan bullshit. There are shills on both sides. Just because you happen to agree with one side doesn't mean they can't be a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is just fucking killing conversation that doesn't follow the narrative. If someone doesn't agree with what the hivemind is saying, they're called a shill and downvoted to fuck. The ENTIRE POINT of this sub is to think for yourself and question the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe this is a daily fucking conversation on this sub. And this is coming from someone who was right along with you guys shitting on Hillary this time last year.

       Just to clarify - what are your views on ShareBlue shilling accusations, etc.? Does it not happen - or happen in roughly equal amounts between ShareBlue and conservative analogues? Do you have a problem with Trump supporters posting here in general, or is it something you find an issue with only when they blindly defend the God Emperor every time his name comes up?

       CTR even admitted to hiring and paying shills to operate, and I believe subs like ETS is or was a CTR run operation. David Brock owns both CTR and Shareblue and has said that he wants Shareblue to be the left version of Breitbart, so yes, I think there are CTR/Shareblue shills on social media like Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since CTR came out into the open, I was pissed because I knew it was going to be used to shut down substantive conversations, and it's just such a shady POS of way to do politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck David Brock, fuck Clinton, and fuck the DNC for allowing that type of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I absolutely do believe there are
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0385535597">
        conservative paid shills
       </a>
       and foreign shills like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades">
        Russian trolls
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Just go to the Fox News comment section as an example, and it's super easy to observe. I used to be a regular there before I started commenting on reddit more often, and there was some users that were obviously bots that would comment practically 24/7, and would not reply to comments, and would just say same stuff over and over and over. Plus, if you make liberal comments there, they would remove your comments and censor you. I don't think they do that as often as they used to, but they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a huge problem with Trump supporters in general. I just think a lot of them are misguided and are fed constant propaganda through AM talk radio and far right wing news sources. Most of my family are Trump supporters and I live in the rust belt, so I do have some sympathy/empathy for Trump supporters,
       <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/">
        especially in the rust belt, where the economy hasn't worked out for them.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't have a problem with Trump supporters in this sub. I don't think anyone should be censored, or attacked on a personal level, just for their personal beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have is when people attack or harass other users because they disagree with them, or when they just blindly defend their position with no evidence or sources to back them up.

       Lol. Dude, I'm a fucking marxist, it isn't shutting down liberal points of view. It's that the liberal POV is hypocritical and shallow, and this is easily seen if you are an actual leftists (or even a right-winger).

      </p>
      <p>
       I've been called a liberal.  I don't personally identify with a particular political group, but I probably am pretty liberal.  I definitely wouldn't have voted for Hillary and think she was a disgusting candidate.  I don't support any of the bullshit Obama did either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think it's unfair to say that there aren't any liberals capable of critical thinking, or that there aren't any liberals that would disown Obama and Hillary.  I don't see the connection that you're making between liberals and siding with those candidates.  It seems more that you'd be applying that specifically to democrats.

       Evidence: Anon sources in the media from the deep state stating that Trump is a traitor or engaged in behavior that is traitorous. And they say these things without evidence. And when they fables are undermined by facts and reality, they change the fable.

       You're just ignoring all the lies coming from Trump about his Russian ties. This predates the election through Manafort and Page, continued through Flynn, later there multiple lies from Kushner and Sessions about their Russian ties, eventually leading to Special Counsel Mueller and most recently another set of lies about Trump team meeting with a group of Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is al verified, often by Trump team itself, yet you sit there and say "no evidence". How is it possible to have a reasonable debate when you deny so many obvious facts?

       None of those contacts illustrate collusion. If you take all of those contacts to be problematic, then you need to take Clinton's contacts with the Russians (and the Saudis and Qataris honestly) through the Clinton Foundation as problematic and probably criminal as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you won't, you'll handwave away Clinton's obvious pay to play crimes. My hope is that Mueller is investigating those (he has the mandate to do so, which is why it is politically stupid for Democrats to have supported the appt of a special prosecutor).
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a narrative that the MSM has laid out for you. You haven't applied any critical thinking about it because you want to believe that Trump could have only one with the aide and comfort of the Red Menace or however you want to characterize Russia.

       Trump writing the statement for Trump Jr lying about the Russian meeting is pretty damning, but you're right that there's no direct proof that collusion actually occurred. But, you're saying that there's no evidence at all, which is a very different statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also took you precisely one comment to pivot to Clinton's alleged wrongdoings, for which there is also "no evidence" by your standards. Given that Republicans publicly stated that they had a year's worth of investigations queued up for her (in addition to the numerous investigations they had already run), your use of Clinton as an example seems like a deflection.
      </p>

       The "MSM narrative" was being talked about as soon as Trump hired Manafort. Since the MSM talked about Clinton's alleged corruption repeatedly, you are also just repeating MSM stories prepared for your consumption. Your casual mention of the Red Menace also suggests the typical attempt to portray all people who think there's something to the Russian conspiracy as trying to push for WWIII, which is a ridiculous straw man.

       I pivot to Clinton because of your side's impenetrable cognitive dissonance. You are not interested in the rule of law, you are interested in overturning the results of an election. Your sides obsession with the Trump Russian narrative has not born an actual fruit. Just endless speculation which is fuel to delegitimate him as President.

       Where do you think this all leads? Do you know anything about the Mackinder thesis or Brezinskis plan to tighten the noose around Russia (which is what informs the CIA in paying and arming jihadis in the middle east and the caucuses in Russia -- Chechyna and Dagestan). America is an empire, and you want to pretend it isn't. Ok, but how can I have a rational discussion with someone like you then?

       The White House confirmed that Trump "weighed in" on the statement. You're either misinformed or misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       You pivot to Clinton because you can't defend Trump's apparent corruption, so the best you have is "Clinton did it too!" It's also worth pointing out that Republicans have been investigating the Clintons for decades, and so far the best they've come up with is a blowjob and some emails. By your standards, "no evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether the Russian narrative has born any fruit: Manafort, Page, and Flynn resigned, Sessions recused, special counsel appointed, Comey fired, and Trump and Trump Jr recently caught out in a lie about meeting with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were in a Cold War for 3 decades without WWIII. After Korea, the wars we did engage in were of our own choosing. The idea that sanctions against Russia will lead to WWIII is hyperbole pushed by the right as a form of concern trolling with regards to possible Russian collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also never denied that America was an empire. That non sequitur from you again illustrates the degree to which you're projecting when you insist that rational discussion is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thesis that the Russian conspiracy is completely fabricated by the Deep State is heavily contradicted by the many lies and connections by team Trump about and with Russia. Trump Jr. admitted to attending a meeting with a Russian lawyer and lobbyist in order to obtain Russian government intel on Clinton. You can't address these points, so you just ignore them until they're brought up, then you just keep repeating "no evidence" while using far more specious evidence to deflect to Clinton's wrongdoings.

       Criticizing Trump is fine and perfectly accepted.  My experience with "liberal POV" in this sub is they try to shove the Russia narrative down my throat and if I can't keep it down I am a racist, bigoted, anti-intellectual Trump supporter.  There are legit things to criticize Trump over but don't get mad when I don't care about things I consider insignificant.  It's not that Trump gets a free pass, it's just typically the stuff the media wants you to be infuriated about is mostly silly stuff.

       I doubt people are pretending the murder didn't happen at all (there are witness protection/new life theories, but we know Seth Rich died that night). There are people claiming that some of the claims made by Rod Wheeler are BS and those claims may have been pushed by the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say "the Seth Rich conspiracy is a hoax" I'm guessing they're talking about the idea that Rich's murder was politically motivated because of his alleged contacts with Wikileaks. The "you think he's still alive lol" comments are misinterpretations and drive the conversation away from actual discussion into snark and insults. It's what you would do if you wanted to try to make your opponent seem stupid and naive without actually engaging in debate.

       I quit this sub months ago when the CTR shills took hold. Just think about the basic premise of the Trump Russia narrative. DJT colluded with Russia (unfounded.. suspect at the very least). To what end, to use the Presidency to enrich himself and his family? Trump can't even sneeze without it being scrutinized and torn apart. He wouldn't have been much better off scamming and scheming the private sector? Give me a break.

       My favorite is when one of these fucking shills spends their entire time on Reddit being an unimaginable douchebag hurling insult after insult (and never being banned by any of the main subreddits) in order to shame people into shutting up....but when you bring up the murder of Seth Rich, they all of a sudden have this huge swell of empathy and concern for Seth's family and shame you for bringing it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,by extension, implying the feelings of a murder victim's family should be enough of a reason to totally disregard a murder investigation.

       Look, when you can't defend an argument, you attack the person.

       That's what a shill accusation is. You cannot defend or form a coherent argument and it's got you all in your feelings about it, so you name-call.

       Notice that the people who cry shill the most tend to belong to a besieged political faction that has become increasingly hard to defend.

       Yeah, not exactly what I meant, but I would wager that 99% of liberals are anti-Trump, so when a liberal like myself comments here I get personally attacked.

      <p>
       But, obviously there are republicans and conservatives that are anti-Trump as well.

       There's still thoughtful discussion, it's just much harder to find.  Many of the most active users have been purged over the months, along with the best mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       ShariaBlue doesn't just astroturf here, I saw a marked uptick in months old articles and reposted shitposts get pushed to the front page on heavy news days.  Also, most important posts have "Bill Clinton is a rapist Infowars.com" or some such spammed as the top 100 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The waters over there have been muddied beyond recognition, and the mods who used to keep it clean have been run out.
