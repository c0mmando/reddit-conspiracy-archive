       Unpopular Opinion Incoming!
      </p>
      <p>
       I Frequent T_D almost every day. It's not because im a major trump supporter but moreso because i like to observe people.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D Users merging into Conspiracy was a natural thing that was always bound to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about it....in Conspiracy most posts are just that....conspiracies!
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        usually they have little to no evidence, sourced using some kind of "technique" by the OP
       </li>
       <li>
        OP who is usually role playing, has already made up his mind on a conclusion and is now simply looking for any and everything to confirm his own preconceived notion
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's exactly what T_D does!
      </p>
      <p>
       most T_D users are trump fans with a very strong preconceived notion that Trump is infallible and god-like, while every other politician is "deep state"  and Democrats are literally monsters who rape and consume children for food
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D users and "some" conspiracy users literally come up with and share their theories the exact same way....its a natural match made in heaven for T_D users to feel comfortable on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "left-wing" conspiracies ive seen posted here usually dont fit the format....they are usually direct quotes that can be confirmed or even watched on video, it doesnt have the more vague and loose role playing feel the right wing conspiracies have....and thats why they dont get upvoted as much unless its from outside this subreddit
      </p>
      <p>
       i dunno....just a theory

       but is it not that?

      <p>
       most the posts nowadays arent just conspiracies....they are right wing conspiracies
      </p>
      <p>
       i literally saw a post in the_donald....posted word for word here in conspiracy...same thumbnail...different user
      </p>
      <p>
       he just reposted it here and made top spot
      </p>
      <p>
       and its easy to see why....like i said in my post above

       It's as simple as this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all US conspiracies of the last 70 years have been deployed by the globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a firm grip on the left and are moving on Republicunts too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican, Democrat, all BS. Either you're a globalist or anti-globalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is anti-globalist, he loves this country. I suspect many of those here in r/conspiracy do, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either you love America, freedom, democracy, mutual wealth, the American dream, the middle class and free markets, or you hate humanity, want slaves, despise families and home ownership, and desperately want tyrants governing your every move.

       "I'm a nationalist and a globalist." You can't build an international real estate empire and outsource manufacturing of your own products and then claim to be a nationalist. I mean come on. His history does not jive with the advertised present...if he's changed course it's purely for ideological reasons and votes, after benefiting from the system bigly for years.

       Ohhhh that's what that is...the American Dream to stiff workers domestically, outsource every job you can otherwise, and build luxury hotel suites for other millionaires in foreign countries, or simply sell your family name to be plastered in gold on the facade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually that all is the American Dream really, which has become a hollow, globalist, imperialist practice.

       If you want to ignore the contradictions I've presented and feed me the exact new government's line on everything, well I guess that's your prerogative. I do know all of those things were already happening prior to his presidency, the growth rate is average, consistent with Obama, illegal immigration was already reducing since the '08 crash, health care was already blowing up in a rather obvious fashion. Any new president will simply take credit for the present and ignore the context that led to it. I'm not one of those guys who think he's Hitler or a real fascist, but his DOJ is actively doing damage to the rights of people and the press, militarizing and giving more authority to cops, aiming to further suppress voting, all things I knew were on the horizon and I wasn't willing to trade for the promise of economic boom mass deregulation always promises.

       Yup. Americanism not globalism. We're a plucky bunch, Americans. Pick ourselves up by the bootstraps, dust ourselves off and get to work. Move the world forward, invent, innovate and create. Things like the internet, airplanes, cars, NASA...and we're winners. Like winning two world wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're the greatest nation on Earth. That's why we say, "America first"

       thats a really stark choice
      </p>
      <p>
       what if....
      </p>
      <p>
       i want a country that values scientists and experts above the opinions of common people who "googled"
      </p>
      <p>
       what if i want a country that doesnt allow the "Free Market" to do whatever it wants to the environment and pay its workers as little as possible while entrusting obscene amounts to one or two people at the top of the pyramid
      </p>
      <p>
       what if i realize minorities are treated worse in this country and it didnt end when lincoln freed the slaves....so maybe a focus on improving their lives is needed as much (if not more) than the people who are naturally slightly better of than them due to being in the majority ethnic group?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if i want a leader who speaks better than me, has more patience and tolerance than i do....and doesnt beg the mexican president to not embarass him by telling the truth about not paying for a wall
      </p>
      <p>
       theres so many more choices than the two you painted....
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore....we live in a global economy...part of my workforce is in siberia and the Philippines....you're fighting a losing battle
      </p>
      <p>
       as technology and transportation improves....the world gets smaller...that should be fucking obvious ...even to you

       How about no? I've been to the absolute bottom but I'm steadily progressing to the top. How about you stop saying "give me, give me, give me everything for free, I want it all and I want it now" and get some shit done instead?

       It's literally a subreddit about US politics. Isn't it natural for them to rally against a ruling party that ran on breaking the usual rules of politics, basically the government is against what that subreddit stands for.

       trump is president

      <p>
       80% of articles are gonna mention his name

      <p>
       he is also not very popular in america

       so the mentions reflect that

       i would even dare to say....he is so unpopular now....that being anti-trump is more normal than being pro-trump nationwide

       which is why his rallies take place in small isolated areas like a town in west virginia rather than ANY major city ANYWHERE

       FiveThirtyEight does some good aggregation, as evidenced by past performance. They were even pretty close on the presidential election even pinning a significant chance to specifically Trump winning the electoral college but missing the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their methods are open and thorough.

       How does the adjusting work? Every time they adjust approval downwards, it's 1-5% but if the adjust upwards it's 1-2% at the best.

       If you click the "How this works" you will get way more info they you will need. For a more technical detail, click the letter grade and it'll take you to a site listing how they break down polls and their adjustement. There on top is a link to "Methodology" where they describe how polls are ranked and assigned bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great think about FiveThirtyEight is they do massive linking to follow their information and to sources if need be.

       I could see how this adjusting could go wrong. But honestly I can't say it's not accurate because I'm not sure if I can really wrap my head around it. It's a complex thing and I should study it throughly if I cared enough.

       Yep, that's why I mentioned their past record. The premise of the site "uses statistical analysis — hard numbers — to tell compelling stories about elections, politics, sports, science, economics."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can agree adjustments are necessary to account for individual poll differences. While I bet there can be disputes, the site's reputation is basically getting these adjustments and weight right. They have been pretty spot on in the past.

       r/politics doesnt "naturally" frequent this sub....because r/politics and r/conspiracy are nothing alike

       left wing news is more strict and verified

       right wing news is more opinion laced and driven by personality....which lines up alot more with the core content of r/conspiracy

       You've obviously never been to any other conspiracy forum. Go to godlikeproductions - one of the most popular conspiracy forums in the last decade, and you'd probably consider that forum to be right wing. Most conspiracy forums would be perceived as right wing by you

       Personally, I don't consider godlikeproductions the bar for conspiracy subs.  AboveTopSecret, maybe, but not GLP.  They've always been on the crazy end of the spectrum.

       say the elites or trump perhaps have a goal of crushing Hilary Clinton once and for all she has been getting in there way for years now and they deemed her to be a liability at this point. so instead of offing her them selves they could plant a seth rich style story to just harness our vitriol for elites as we will work twice as hard at exposing the corrupt and we have more man power
      </p>
      <p>
       we could be used as weponized crowd source investigators for free they just have to dangle the proper carrot.

       im sure others here could expand on the many creative ways our good nature could be exploited but thats just me spiting off the dome.

       I think it may be simpler than that. The Russia story is mainstream news, not really a conspiracy. While Seth Rich still isn't really being covered. That's just two examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Seth Rich can't get discussed in places like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       while the Russian story can. That leaves this as one of the only places on Reddit that isn't totally partisan to talk about Seth Rich.

       I would agree that's a small part of it.  But there's also a theory (and ample evidence) the alt-right is pushing the Seth Rich/Pizzagate theories as a distraction (which brings the alt-right here en masse).  Pizzagate melted down into absurdity with enough scrutiny, but I admittedly haven't been closely following the Seth Rich theory, it's just too convoluted for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'd agree with your observation.

       but is it not that?

      <p>
       most the posts nowadays arent just conspiracies....they are right wing conspiracies
      </p>
      <p>
       i literally saw a post in the_donald....posted word for word here in conspiracy...same thumbnail...different user
      </p>
      <p>
       he just reposted it here and made top spot
      </p>
      <p>
       and its easy to see why....like i said in my post above
      </p>
      <p>
       unsubstantiated claims run high in T_D  and mix well in conspiracy

       It's as simple as this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all US conspiracies of the last 70 years have been deployed by the globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a firm grip on the left and are moving on Republicunts too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican, Democrat, all BS. Either you're a globalist or anti-globalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is anti-globalist, he loves this country. I suspect many of those here in r/conspiracy do, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either you love America, freedom, democracy, mutual wealth, the American dream, the middle class and free markets, or you hate humanity, want slaves, despise families and home ownership, and desperately want tyrants governing your every move.

       How does the adjusting work? Every time they adjust approval downwards, it's 1-5% but if the adjust upwards it's 1-2% at the best.
