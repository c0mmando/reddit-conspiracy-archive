        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It can&#39;t be a coincidence that so many dupes believe the same thing. obviously this silly idea came from the top down, and the dupes just regurgitate it because it sounds somewhat plausible to the average idiot.</p>

<p>My standard rebuttal is to ask the dupe how they would&#39;ve expected the Russians to communicate their skepticisms of the Moon Landing Hoax with the American public? through the same corrupt media that just got done duping the Americans into believing the Moon Landing Hoax? were they actively monitoring Russian media in the 1960&#39;s, to know what the Russians thought of the Moon Landing Hoax? </p>

<p>&quot;If it was a hoax, then the Russians would have informed me!!!</p>

<p>How? by singing telegram? </p>

<p>Anyway, not every Russian was duped by the Moon Landing Hoax, and some Russians have expressed pubic skepticism and demanded investigations into the Moon Landing Hoax. There are links to articles about this available online, but the stories are not heavily promoted. </p>

<p>That was a few years ago. Today in 2017 the US-Russian relations are at a low, because HRC lost the election and couldn&#39;t take responsibility for her loss... so she blamed the Russians, and the other puppets in DC followed suit</p>

<p>Muh 17 incel agencies </p>

<p>Russia has been hated by the Kazarians (Revelation 2:9 and 3:9) for centuries  </p>

<p>Kazarians were behind the Bolshevik revolution and subsequent murder of 10&#39;s of millions of Russian Christians. </p>

<p>Today, in 2017, the same Kazarians that took over Russia have taken over the USA, and continue to incite a fake &quot;cold war&quot; between both sides that they control. </p>

<p>They used to get away with the fake cold war, but with the internet the public has figured out that the whole Muh Russians narrative is BS, yet the US Congress presses on with sanctions against Russia, and threatening Russia with long range nuclear missiles. </p>

<p>one Russian mentioned that if they are not able to keep up with the US nuclear weapons escalation, they may have to resort to asymmetrical response. (such as hacking HRC&#39;s emails?)</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rqg4o/putin_talks_about_the_international_balance_of/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rqg4o/putin_talks_about_the_international_balance_of/</a></p>

<p>The best asymmetrical response that Russia could give is to spill the beans on the Moon Landing Hoax. it would be so easy to do, and would obliterate the very first line of reasoning the American dupes rely on to keep believing in the myth</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to wait around for Putin to assemble a press conference.  we just have to go out and find the Russian criticisms that already exist, and help publicize them. </p>

<p>the Moon Landing Hoax is one of the best all-around red-pills that we can prescribe to the average dupe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i spent about 2 weeks studying Rev Sun Myung Moon. </p>

<p>in a documentary video called &quot;Emperor of the Universe&quot;, Rev Moon&#39;s assistant was overly-impressed with the fact that Rev Moon could focus his attention to a single point. </p>

<p>i didn&#39;t understand why that was so impressive or important at the time, but then i focused my attention on Autism, and it was kind of amazing what i was able to do with focused attention</p>

<p>one of the things that Julian Assange (controlled opposition, limited hangout) said many years ago was that he was disappointed that nobody came to wikileaks to go through the leaks... everyone just waited around for someone to TLDR it for them </p>

<p>even on this board at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> there are so many topics that the average user is overwhelmed, and his attention is fragmented, and he frozen, like a deer in headlights, lost at sea, unhinged, listless, lethargic, &quot;unaware and complaint&quot;</p>

<p>its depressing, knowing that all this is going on, and being helpless to stop it, much less helpless to stop supporting it against your will, by paying many different taxes to many different corrupt entities... the leftovers, are what you call a paycheck </p>

<p>like chris rock says... you don&#39;t <em>pay</em> taxes, they <em>take</em> taxes  </p>

<p>anyway, what I&#39;m trying to say is that we need to, each of us, focus our attention on that ONE issue, whatever that issue is, that is important to us, for our own personal reasons.  </p>

<p>thats not to say you have to tune everything else out, but that you will commit yourself to keep going back to that issue every day for an extended period of time, in spite of the distractions. </p>

<p>i have focused my attention on autism daily for almost 3 years now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you make a valid point there. But also if everyone is fragmented looking at one individual topic then you are limited to people you can discuss with. It also to a degree reminds me of divide and rule. Perhaps people should have a specialist topic but still be open to others?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if &quot;Sputnik&quot; was a hoax? If that is the case, the Russians can&#39;t blow the lid on the Moon Landing Hoax because it would expose their space exploration as a hoax. From 1958 to 1962, in a joint program called &quot;Operation Fishbowl&quot;, both the Soviet Union and the United States sent hundreds of thermonuclear bombs into &quot;outer-space&quot; to try and &quot;break&quot; the dome that covers the Earth. They failed, and then they agreed to stop above ground nuclear testing after everybody got a &quot;good dose&quot; of radioactive fallout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always say this and it seems reasonable at first, but then you realize it would have been totally pointless for the USSR to blow the whistle. A counterattack of propaganda from the USA would have made sure that the American people didn&#39;t believe this slander from our enemies at the time anyway. How could the USSR prove anything? They could not. </p>

<p>Much more advantageous to blackmail the United States, which they did.</p>

<p>There are many examples. I&#39;ll share one that happened a few months ago. This is about slosh damping in propellant tanks. I used to believe that the slosh damping effect would increase with propellant fill fraction (that a tank 100% full would have more damping than a tank 60% full, 40% full, and so on). However, after reading some papers and performing an experiment of my own, I now realize that the maximum slosh damping occurs around 60% depending on the tank geometry. <a href="http://ssl.mit.edu/publications/theses/SM-2010-BurkeCaley.pdf">Here</a> are some <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120004028.pdf">sources</a> that helped <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160006562.pdf">change</a> my view.</p>

<p>A tank filled 100% with fluid does not allow motion of the location of the fluid within the tank and an empty tank has no fluid to impact force, which is why these fill fractions are not high risk conditions for slosh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right. but you weren&#39;t really emotionally caught up in this idea, were you? otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have bothered to research, because you would have felt that you already knew, intuitively. </p>

<p>i guess intuitively i would have guessed what i copy-paste from the article into my previous comment. i probably would not have guessed 60% was the maxima. i probably would have had to take into consideration that the tank constantly changes its fill level as the propellant is used.</p>

<p>mind my asking what was the application, and how this knowledge helped change your project?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a good idea to do research into ideas one emotionally believes in... we need to challenge our own beliefs! That&#39;s why I&#39;m here at all.</p>

<p>As for evidence changing my mind of things I&#39;m emotionally caught up on... it&#39;s happened a lot in my life too. Probably the first ever time was finding out Santa Claus wasn&#39;t real. As a kid I was emotionally invested in his existence, but then I found the christmas presents hidden in a closet one year :P</p>

<p>Slosh damping can have a negative effect on spacecraft but actually we are using it for spin stabilization. A spinning spacecraft with sloshing propellant in it will eventually damp back down into a steady spin, if the spin is disturbed by something (a thruster firing for example).</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to know exactly what the effects of this will be. The results of our experiments led us to design and add baffles to improve the slosh damping.</p>
