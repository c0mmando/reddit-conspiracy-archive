        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Money started off with good intentions. People were trading items and figured they may as well use metals as a standard of trade. Ever since there, we have been having money related problems. </p>

<p>Fast forward to now and money has become the God-Weapon of the cabal to enslave the world. It&#39;s all very simple actually. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are about 10,000 very rich Robber Barons in this world who run our banks and every other structure of importance. They simply own most everything of major value and even own a money printing machine (IE Federal Reserve). With that printing machine, they pretty much printed the money they needed to purchase everything of importance. They own the airports, the major corporations, the universities, the banks, the hospitals, ect.. They leave the junk for the 99% who are forced to complete against the Robber Barrons like the Walmart family. </p></li>
<li><p>These Robber Barons also used the money printing machines to buy influence in government so they basically ended up &quot;owning&quot; the government. This gave them power to write their own laws and they changed all the laws around to benefit them on behalf of the struggling 99%. This created massive homelessness, drug abuse, ect.. </p></li>
<li><p>These Robber Barons essentially became a mafia and what do mafia members do? Crime! They took over the top echolon of the drug trade, human trafficking trade, and every other crime trade imaginable. </p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of buying out everything and then squeezing the 99% for every dime they have is to maintain a highly struggling economy. The idea is to create so much suffering and when the suffering is at a peak, they will offer &quot;relief&quot; IF we give them power over the whole planet in a new NWO run by the Baron Robbers. They would essentially take over the world in totality and do what they please with it. </p></li>
<li><p>These Baron Robbers have mechanisms in place to give them the power to maintain a certain amount of money in the economy. For example, they caused the Great Depression by taking out 30% of the money from the economy. They do these recessions every once in a while for their own political purposes. Mostly, they aim to leave just enough money so that the economy can never really recover and when it somehow does, they just remove more money out of the economy to create a deeper struggle. The whole economy is basically artificially held down by consolidating lose cash into the hands of the few Robber Barons. </p></li>
<li><p>The struggling economy creates many, many desperate citizens. The Robber Barons artificially created this desperation and they also used this desperation to their own advanctage by convincing people to &quot;sell their own souls&quot; for a life away from financial struggle. This is how they created the first drug dealers, gangsters, corrupt politicians, and so on. Not all people are willing to do scandalous work for some decency but there are people who fall completely apart and simply feel like they have no choice. This is especially true in the devastated economies of central and South America. It works differently in the devastated economies of the Middle East. In the Middle East, they use American tax payer dollars to hire mercenaries to run ISIS. That&#39;s how Muslims end up selling their own souls for some decency. </p></li>
<li><p>So now, the average 99% member is surrounded by things they don&#39;t own and in a struggling economy 24/7/365. Wherever the 99% walk, they see amazing building and amazing businesses all owned by the Robber Barons. Almost all property on earth is owned by these same Robber Barons so our rent money usually works its way up into their own piggy banks. The 99% is dependent on the Robber Barons for a job since the Robber Barons own so many amazing corporations. They tell you they developed these corporations in their garages but that&#39;s all a big lie. They were selected to run these organizations because they are part of the Robber Baron family. (IE, the facebook owners, Mark Zuckerberg, is said to be related to the Rockafellars). </p></li>
<li><p>So now that the Robber Barons cornered the 99% into slavery, they decided to ridicule the &quot;slower&quot; slaves by ruining their credit score. Most of these people with a low credit score aren&#39;t even really slower but they just simply didn&#39;t get lucky because luck is a big factor in this economy. When the economy is this bad, one has to be in the right place at the right time to score a nice income. There are plenty of geniuses without a penny to their name. They even made education as grueling and expensive as possible so that it would repel people from getting smarter. So these, Robber Barons made the credit score system to act as a badge of shame to a large portion of the population. A good/lucky slave gets a high credit score and gets to pat himself on the back. </p></li>
<li><p>The Robber Barons found endless ways to constantly take, take, take from the economy. They don&#39;t need the money so why do they have to take? It is because they have to keep very little floating cash in the economy because if too much cash flows into the economy from the Robber Barons, the economy would boom and they would lose their criminal employees. They hired people willing to sell their souls because of a horrible economy and so these people would be unwilling to continue selling their soul when they can easily get a nice paying, decent job. Keep in mind, the Robber Barons control the human stock of America by throwing money at them. This is how Sorors runs Black Lives Matter, how the DNC runs ShareBlue, and how they run all those corrupt politicians. They simply throw green paper at them because they know these people would do anything for some green paper with the state of this horrid economy. Since they are constantly dumping money into the economy, they have to constantly funnel it back out from the other end in order to maintain the low amount of cash in the economy. There is a sweet spot with Cash flow. You don&#39;t want too little money in the economy because it forces the economy into almost a grinding halt and you don&#39;t want too much money in the economy because it devalues money but there is a sweet spot. The cabal, in America, leaves too little and in Venezuela, they flooded it with too much to destroy the economy there. The point of this is that whenever people question the government on extracting too much money from the economy, they make a stupid claim that if they add anymore money into the economy, the dollar would collapse. This is a blatant lie to trick the people into keeping the economy at a grinding halt. Another trick is that they make people think that if they work hard enough, they will make it to there level which is pretty much an outlandish lie. Most of these people were born into riches through connections and all those stories about starting in their garage is a full blown hoax. </p></li>
<li><p>So now they have the whole 99% who are born into this world broke because the Robber Barons own most everything of value. This 99% has no power over its own laws because the Robber Barons bought out all the politicians. The 99% are enslaved in jobs they hate and are treated like slaves because they are living in a slave based system. All the stress compounds on itself and so many of these stressed out Americans end up using illegal, harmful drugs which is an operation run entirely by the Robber Barons from atop. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Everything of value from organization, education, politics, ect.. is owned and controlled by the Robber Barons. They literally run the whole fucking show and leave the 99% with a few scraps just to barely get them by and keep them in a state of perpetual misery. What is their big secret? $$$$ and Trade. In reality, this world belongs to all of us and we should all be tending to our human needs using the many mechanisms we humans have developed such as the internet, the government, our organizations, ect.. but we can&#39;t because the Robber Barons hogged all that shit up. These high level haters despise the 99% so there&#39;s no chance they will share anything with us unless it is an absolute must to push some agenda. </p>

<p>Since the Robber Barons have complete and utter control over wealth, they will forever keep us in perpetual slavery because they are the world&#39;s grandest haters and haters don&#39;t like anybody except themselves. </p>

<p>But there is a solution! We can drop the entire money and trade system altogether and just simply share everything. Basically, we all work for free and consume for free. Instead of a trade based economy, we switch to a gift based economy. Sure, this would level us all out but we would also all be working for the same exact thing and that thing is &quot;Planetary Wealth&quot;. We would use all of these fantastic organizations, government, education centers, ect.. to build a planet so utterly wealthy, it would feel like we live under a luscious grape tree with delicious grapes only an arm reach away. </p>

<p>Luckily someone built a gift based economy called Sacred Economics here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs</a></p>

<p>The whole world is sick of this financial problem shit that is artificially implemented by the Robber Barons, AKA the World&#39;s Most Sinister Haters. They played us for fools.. fine. But we can now all agree to take a big risk and jump into a gifting economy. It will take work to get this going but this is our best bet of eliminating the Cabals control over us. Nobody wants to be a slave but we can&#39;t expect the government they control to help us nor can we expect to succeed in a massively rigged financial system. We simply have to all pitch in and present ideas on how to make the big swap. </p>

<p>I went ahead and got the ball rolling on some ideas below if anyone is interested in perusing this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally the opposite of what you wrote is true, global poverty is at an all time low</p>

<p>The human life span is at the highest it has ever been </p>

<p>Your average human now has access to safe clean food, drinking water, computers, electricity, mobility, communications and higher education </p>

<p>Just because YOU personally don&#39;t like that some things in YOUR life are not great does not actually mean the global economy is not fundamentally working.</p>

<p>America and Western Europe are in decline but most of the world are having amazing growth.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like how YOUR life is, change it.</p>

<p>Learn a new language and move to a nation that is growing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a masters degree and run my own operation successfully but I have realized that the world&#39;s pains are my pains and vice versa. Your success is also my success. Right now, most of the world is in a horrid mess and the silent majority is afraid to speak up because people like you might come around and call them stupid losers who need to stop being so &quot;lazy.&quot; This is not the case. The economy is set up in a way that you have to rips 20 new assholes just to reach success.  It&#39;s not supposed to be this hard. We haven&#39;t even reached 5% optimization of this economy meaning we can do MUCH MUCH MUCH better. We are ALL able to live is total dignity and money isn&#39;t really an issue. This turbulent economy is artificial. It&#39;s not even real. </p>

<p>We all have to stop ONLY thinking of ourselves. It&#39;s time to grow up and flush the toilet like a big boy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just give me fish when I need fish and I&#39;ll give you corn when you need corn. </p>

<p>I can only promise you one thing. Sometime in your lifetime, hopefully very soon, we will all wake up to realize how money has been used to enslave us and so away with it altogether. Then, we will all work and consume for free. </p>

<p>Need a burger? Get one free at TJI Fridays. </p>

<p>Need a new tire? Go to Pep Boys and get one for free.</p>

<p>Need a slurpy? Stop by 7-11 and get it for free. </p>

<p>Need to fix a broken bone? Go to the hospital and get it fixed for free. </p>

<p>All we will have to do in return is all work a job of our choosing and since the 35% or unemployed American will now have empkoyement, we can start working 5 hours a day/5 days a week. </p>

<p>Also, we will get our robots and put their asses to work for all the menial jobs to make life more interesting for us. </p>

<p>At some point, you will slap your own knee and say &quot;Hot damn. That guy in Reddit was right. Life is way better now!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, autocorrect on an iPhone always changes IPhone to iPhone.  You&#39;ll even get the red dots under it if you force type it that way.   The words then and than being used incorrectly multiple times in your reply seems more like a misunderstanding of the language than (or should I say then - haha) a typo.</p>

<p>Every attorney I know is careful of syntax being used correctly, as it can change the meaning of a statement.  I also imagine that one who is trying to establish their superiority over the internet might be careful to not come across as uneducated through poorly written rants. </p>

<p>I wonder what the Chinese government thinks of you conversing on an American-hosted conspiracy theory subreddit.  You must be firing off some red flags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every attorney I know is enjoying lunch with me since it&#39;s the Middle of the afternoon here and we are deep in the baiju </p>

<p>Regardless, going in to grammar is always the last resort of an idiot with nothing left to say in an internet conversation, I mean it&#39;s basically poes law</p>

<p>Also if you had any understanding of china you would know Reddit is not blocked in china and even if it was foreign workers can use vpn to access w/e we want, most media restrictions of for the locals</p>

<p>I have been a lawyer here for years, I could go into details but you would have no idea how anything works in the main land. As far as I can tell if it doesn&#39;t involve Israel no one on this sub gives a fuck </p>

<p>No one on here ever cares about china, I try and post the crazy shit I learn about all the time and all I get is yawwwwwwn</p>

<p>Regardless(really wanted to write irregardless just to piss you off, btw that word is not marked red so fuck your iPhone lies but I think your to stupid to get that it would have been on purpose) your still a broke idiot and honor does not pay bills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blame the al-al-al-alcohol.  And it&#39;s: you&#39;re or you are too stupid.  Your implies possession. And it&#39;s too, not to.  </p>

<p>For example:  You&#39;re too drunk to understand how simple-minded you sound when you think the Chinese government isn&#39;t monitoring your communications.  You&#39;re in their country, and you&#39;re now a person-of-interest for stating that you&#39;re sharing secrets that you learn in China.  </p>

<p>See?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, the Chinese are reading my Reddit lol</p>

<p>You do realize the American government is reading your Reddit right now as well, Reddit is just GIVING IT TO THEM</p>

<p>There is no magic to this </p>

<p>I work with their banks, I literally know how their laws work here, if they want my info they will get it regardless of what I do, and frankly I don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>I am not afraid of the Chinese government at all, I have even been to North Korea, I have no idea how that wambier idiot got in trouble, he must have been a real ass, I had a great time </p>

<p>Then again I am a rich grown man who was their with powerful Chinese lawyer and he was a young idiot </p>

<p>See? It&#39;s fun to be Rich! It&#39;s fun to be powerful!</p>

<p>Next month I am going to Korea and I am just going to party my ass off</p>

<p>Maybe I will get a photo of myself riding the thaad like I am in dr strange love lol</p>

<p>Fuck it!</p>
