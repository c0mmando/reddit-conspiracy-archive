        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US military has developed directed energy weapons that they covertly use on people who oppose their corruption. It is subtle and a person usually does not realize they are under attack. It operates similar to the idea of reward and punishment. Lets say someone is researching something they don&#39;t want that person to know. They use their directed energy weapons to cause the target discomfort, irritation, and stress. Most people are not even aware that its a directed energy weapon causing this however a part of their brain registers or associates that doing something like speaking out or researching corruption is linked with stress and they do it less. Its like a subconscious deflection or denial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The electronics radiate electromagnetic frequencies. The human body uses electric signaling. So if these frequencies penetrate the body they can hack into the nervous system. They have engineered them covertly to do this. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.defendershield.com/learn/electronics-emr/">https://www.defendershield.com/learn/electronics-emr/</a>
Electronic devices also communicate outside the device, transmitting communication signals from your device to other devices so you can talk to a friend on a phone or maybe connect to the internet with your WiFi. These signals are called Radio Frequency (RF) signals and can also be referred to as Microwave (MW) signals. RF signals can be transmitted at many different frequencies and power levels. A cell phone signal, for example can travel several miles while a WiFi signal stays below 100 feet. These varying distance capabilities require the electronics to generate differing power levels in order to accommodate the distances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused what you are saying here. The only actual link you&#39;ve posted is that History Channel clip, which shows this device being controlled from a vehicle, and doesn&#39;t seem to allow it to penetrate walls (we know that it only affects the most surface level of the skin from that clip) and certainly isn&#39;t subtle enough to not realize it was happening as you talk about in your OP. </p>

<p>How am I being defensive?</p>

<p>You are making an in substantiated claim, I am asking you to substantiate it. Seems like a normal thing to do in my opinion. I haven&#39;t made any remarks for or against any party. I&#39;m honestly not sure how you came to believe I was defending &quot;them&quot;.</p>

They are criminals and must be dealt with. They are at war with humanity. They cannot be tolerated. They must be combatted. Their end goal is pure enslavement and human trafficking.
