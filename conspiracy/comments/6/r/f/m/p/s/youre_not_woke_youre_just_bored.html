      <p>
       I've come to the conclusion that many people around these parts that claim to be "woke" (whatever the fuck that means) are actually just bored as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've become bored with all forms of entertainment and mental engagement. There was a time when a good scary movie was all it took, or a good action thriller spy vs. spy novel, to satisfy your mind. But that's no longer the case. Now you're bored mentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you can no longer find satisfaction with the stimulation from current forms of entertainment and mental engagement, you have to invent fantastic stories to explain the most innocuous and mundane things. You don't do it to be harmful or deceptive, but because your mind needs to be stimulated in such a way to justify its continued existence. It's a survival mechanism, so you imagine things. You invent your own reality to satisfy your own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bennington and Podesta look alike? They must be related you tell yourself. If they're related, "what does that mean?" you ask yourself. So you seek out answers and invent them if necessary to satisfy your minds desire for stimulation, creating ever more elaborate explanations that paint a picture of depravity, horror, sadness, and debauchery to satisfy your mind and imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite having no evidence to support the idea, you rush into a building with a gun, fire off a couple of shots, because there just has to be babies in that basement. There have to be babies in that basement because if there isn't, then that just means that everything is...boring. Even normal. And your brain can't accept that because it needs to be stimulated, and normal or boring is not stimulating, SO THERE MUST BE BABIES IN THAT BASEMENT! There has to be! "What could they be doing with all those babies in the basement?" you ask yourself. What if...no...they wouldn't. Would they? They're eating them! For the love of God and all that is holy, they're EATING THEM ALIVE! You have to save them! You have to get into that basement and SAVE THEM! You have to save those babies...otherwise...you're just bored.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be enough to satisfy your curiosity to consider the government was simply covering up an alien crash while hiding the bodies behind a mysterious military base that didn't "officially" exist. There was a time when that's all it took. But now your mind craves more. It's not enough to think the government knows about aliens and is simply hiding it. No. Now your mind needs the aliens to be walking among the rest of us, in positions of power, cleverly pulling the strings to our own destruction, because that's simply....more exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when the idea of a faked moon landing fascinated you? I'm sure you do. But that idea is now boring to you. It no longer captures your imagination. "But why would they fake that?" you ask yourself. There has to be something they're hiding, but what?
 Wait...you figured it out...space...IS NOT REAL and THE EARTH IS FLAT. A global conspiracy of people working in tangent to hide the truth from you is why they faked the landing! You have to prove they're lying to everyone! You do this, because it's exciting to you. It makes your mind work to solve problems. The stimulation feels good...and you need more of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time goes on, you become more and more bored, desensitized by over stimulation from excessive internet usage and a neat little device that follows you every where. As you become more bored and disillusioned by the stimulation from external sources, your mind starts to look to itself for the stimulation it craves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're like an addict. You're tolerance building with each successive hit. Before you even realize what's happening, you die from dehydration because the water is infested with chemicals that turn the frogs gay, and you refuse to drink it. Just like all addicts, eventually you'll hit that point where your addiction kills you. All because your mind craved just one more bump man! Just one more bump!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not enough to accept the fact that there are some fucked up people in the world. No. Everyone has to be the worst of the worst all the time. Because that's what your mind craves. It takes an exceptional level of depravity and deception to satisfy your addicted brain. The pictures you paint in your minds eye, and the conspiracies you believe, say more about you than the conspiracies themselves say about the world around you.

       You still have a long way to go, especially if you believe more than 10 or 15 things on
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/37-things-normies-believe/">
        this list
       </a>
       . All I ask people is, why do you believe these things? Then I explain the following concept: appeal to consensus, appeal to ridicule, and appeal to authority. Without those three fallacies, most people have NO reason to believe
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       on that list. Few are courageous enough to admit it to themselves, let alone to others.

       While  I agree with the addiction of crisis etc, I can't step in line with a not discussing mentality. I suppose that is preference though. I would rather discuss each point to a large topic, rather than the alternative. Everything dies out. Nothing is forever. Our ability to observe the world, and problem solve solves for the time of left of all objects. Why not use it?

       I worked with a girl at Starbucks, who was a complete cunt by the way, and she had a tattoo that literally said “stay woke”
Long story short- she got fired (and her barista girlfriend also got fired) both for being so completely arrogant and rude and disrespectful to the point the staff AND manager couldn’t take it.
After all this happened- they tried to sue because “we all weren’t accepting of their relationship at work”
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything that’s the most opposite of staying woke I’ve seen. I thought it was an awareness thing, staying woke..?

       I believe many of the younger conspiracy theorists that are being captivated by politics have found their entertainment in Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       He stands out from the conventional politician because he's not detoured by conflict resulting from his actions. This appeals to certain individuals' lust for entertainment as they await a climax and resolution to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sprinkle in some conspiracy theories about political opposition and a dash of confirmation bias from the alt-right. The perfect concoction for the "red pilled" Trump supporter.

       Yes some things on here are disinformation, and the tenured theorists know and can discern this when researching. Maybe Pizzagate isn't necessarily right on the point, but google "Democrate and Republican pedophiles" and you get a long long list of pedophiles that are or were in the government, and that's fact. More and more trafficking/child abuse assailants are being taken down weekly now. There is proof that this sort of disgusting is happening!

       It's naive to think that us humans are the only sentient beings in the universe. You have to at least believe it's a possibility. For me I believe. Because I am a spiritual person I mediate often. A few years ago, while mediating in a public park, I was specifically focusing on aliens and that if they were out there to give me a sign. Then all the sudden a flaming ball of light was SLOWLY crossing the sky at a horizontal alignment, then 1 minute later another one. Everyone in the park saw this, and one guy said if that's a plane it's completely engulfed in flames...There was no "tail" to this ball of light, thus it couldn't have been a meteor...
      </p>

       You're also talking down to what seems like all of us, and you don't get to do that. You don't get to group us all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us actually do care what might be in the water. Portland, OR has for over 10+ years VOTED to not have fluoride in the water supply. Why do you think that is? Do they all want to have bad teeth? No, it's because they know it's poison and don't want to drink that shit! Fluoride has to be stored in special containers because it eats through almost every substance...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there's definitely fucked up things that happen in this world. But you can't also say that the leaders and elites of this world aren't pulling the strings. We have FACTS that this is happening. Agenda 2030, Bilderberg Group, G20...It's not also that we MUST think everyone has to be the worst of the worst, it's also because it's being shoved down everyone's throat. Tell me, does any of the MSM news you watch, I figure you watch it from your post, ever have much happy news stories to shove down your throat?

       this definitely needed to be said. What happens with a lot of legitimate, well supported conspiracy theories is that they fall into the hands of people who distort them almost beyond recognition, and of course when it filters down to the public it's always the distorted versions that people remember. Chemtrails is a good example - talk to aircraft propulsion engineers and they'll tell you that there are aluminum and other nano-particle additives in a lot of the aviation fuel out there, but my and many others' first exposure to the idea was "the government sprays mind control compounds from airliners". I don't know if this is intentional on the part of the perpetrators of these conspiracies, but it definitely distracts from the reality of it and keeps people from looking into it further and asking questions about what perhaps might be the effect of aluminum nanoparticles injected into the atmosphere on a massive scale

       This is a great post and needs to be on the front page, maybe even stickied.  When I saw the ridiculous Chester post yesterday, that was enough.  There are too many shit posts here making stuff up rather than providing good research/evidence.  Crap like that drown out the good posts that are here every day.

       I agree and disagree. In round table discussions some ideas get ripped on. It's conspiracy, it's nice to hear a different conspiracy about a certain subject. I don't want to hear only what I think. On the moon debate no one should be a cunt and shut any ideas down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just saw videos of the moon wave, which is a crazy though, but it led me to a couple hours of Youtube videos. Was fun, something new.

       If buddy has a couple points to relate Chester to something (didn't see the post), then I wouldn't mind it. The only post or comments that I hate are the pro/anti Trump or Clinton ones. 99% are shit. Clintons is what got me into conspiracies a long time ago but this clickbait title bullshit about them OR Trump have got too go.

       I look at it in a way of people simply pointing out corruption. With the hope of informing more people to make the world a better place. Never looked at conspiracies as being some kind of form of entertainment that's why I like watching terminator.

       Sounds like you're really bored lmfao. You make some cool points though. But you are on a conspiracy thread posting about how you think conspiracies are just made up by people because they're bored, aka a conspiracy to make things up. So while talking down to everyone here about how they crave conspiracies because of boredom you literally just wrote paragraphs about a conspiracy of our brains to collectively make up conspiracies purely for entertainment. Add to the fact you are reading a through a conspiracy thread while also disagreeing with the notion they could exist seems strange. That's like hating tv yet watching it and making fun of people for watching it. Get a new hobby, reading things you disagree with and writing posts to be a contrarian makes you seem like a boring loser who needs arguments to keep his brain going. Lmfao
