    <div class="md"><p>That last part I agree with. Nationalism and patriotism are gross, so I can&#39;t imagine on a global scale. As far as being the only way, i don&#39;t know. Maybe instead of scaling up to the extreme, we need to be just as extreme in the opposite direction - get rid of government entirely. Sure, it&#39;d be violent and bloody but at the end of it we might have a fighting chance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Population is not grow as exponentially as they want you to think. Considering that every man, woman, and child of the world could fit into the state of Texas, is pretty telling. There is plenty of land, food, and water on this planet. It&#39;s just the greedy psychopaths want to lower the population to protect themselves from being overthrown.</p>

<p>Maybe the government should give up all the federal parks (which they have no right to own) and give it back to the people who want say.. ~2-4 acres of land to homestead (living a self sufficient life), moving them out of the crowded poverty riddled inner cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!  Before we give in to the overpopulation myth, we need to educate ourselves. Traveling is the best way to do so but we can do it just by talking to others.  Even the areas considered uninhabitable (such as deserts) aren&#39;t really so anymore. Look at Las Vegas or parts of Southern California. We have means now to sustain life in those areas if needed.  We don&#39;t because doing so is expensive and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Not yet. It&#39;s getting there though. And once it happens, there will no longer be much need for them to placate the masses. They&#39;ll lay down whatever laws they want. They&#39;ll probably start by making all non-pharmaceutical drugs illegal again, and proceed from there.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that aliens are real. I don&#39;t know what that cult told your family members but keep in mind that all institutionalized religions are also cults. These cults are all about brainwashing people into what they want them to believe. Religion is supposed to be a person issue and no middle man (ie priest or church) is needed. </p>
