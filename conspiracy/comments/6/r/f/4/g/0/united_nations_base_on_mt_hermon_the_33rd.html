<p>Its summit straddles the border between Syria and Lebanon it&#39;s the highest point in Syria. On the top there is “Hermon Hotel”, in the buffer zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory, the highest permanently manned UN position in the world.</p>

<p>Hermon means “Forbidden Place.” A 4th-century translator of the Latin Vulgate, Jerome, interpreted Hermon as “anathema.” Mount Hermon was the port of entry for a group of evil angels, who corrupted the human race in the days of Noah.</p>

<p>“Paris Zero Meridian” Mount Hermon (and the ancient territory of Dan) is located at 33 degrees east of the Paris Zero Meridian (longitude), and 33 degrees north of the Equator (latitude)</p>

<p>The Book of Enoch speaks of a group of fallen angels who rebelled against God and came down to the earth and shared such ancient knowledge with the human race…
according to the book of Enoch these fallen angels were to be once again released after 70 generations.</p>

<p>Two-hundred ‘fallen angels’ descended from the heavenly realm on to the summit of Mount Hermon and they were so smitten by the beauty of human women that they took the form of a human and had sex with them. Because of this sin, a race of half-angelic, half-human species sprang up (Genesis 6:4) in the land. A race is known as the Nephilim Giants.</p>

<p>“Bind them [fallen angels] fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, until the day of their judgment and of their consummation, till the judgment that is forever and ever is consummated.” Enoch 10:12</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a mobile and couldn&#39;t find much anyway. Check out comparative mythologies. I do recall an Indian tribe where the warrior put up a pole with a rope coming off it. At the end of the rope were nails that he dug into his breast and then he would pull against the rope and stay there until the vision would arrive. The meaning was that he now had to sacrifice himself for the good of the tribe. But the myths are everywhere. Harry potter is the same story as Jesus. It&#39;s all about sacrificing yourself for others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Native American tribes are different than Aboriginal tribes. They also have vastly different creation stories. Some of these tribes believe in cannibalism and different things ontop. But no matter how hard you twist it there creation stories are nothing even close to the gospel. Sure some are close, but others are wayy different. I just don&#39;t think we can assume everyone on Earth got a fair chance to hear the gospel. God is omnipotent so maybe I am just not privy to him enlightening these people but I don&#39;t think we can assume everyone has gotten to hear the gospel once at least. I am a born again Christian btw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just now learning and researching the Book of Enoch. But does Revelations say anything that ties into the Book of Enoch and these fallen angels or the Nephilim?</p>

<p>I honestly think that most of the Bible is talking about astrology. I think that Revelations and the whole &quot;Rapture&quot; will take place now or soon, as we transition into the Age of Aquarius. But I don&#39;t think it is literal. I don&#39;t think Christians will fly away into heaven. I think it means many people will &quot;wake up&quot; to the truth. The evil people have been in charge for the entirety of the age of Pisces. But they won&#39;t rule and have power in the Age of Aquarius.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:37-39King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>

<p>38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</p>

<p>Emphasis mine, I want to get people&#39;s thoughts on something</p>

<p>Anyone else..seen anything weird? Like, signs?</p>

<p>Specifically the Pepe/Kek face</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDTWUFKs.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fmilliondollarextreme%2Fcomments%2F61fjy1%2Fgoogle_censored_a_portion_of_the_virgo%2F&amp;amp;docid=SxY5_2lpGDYCtM&amp;amp;tbnid=EdYw2R1FvqaD7M%3A&amp;amp;vet=10ahUKEwilwvrr5r3VAhUBRyYKHfiVCF0QMwg9KAYwBg..i&amp;amp;w=1696&amp;amp;h=860&amp;amp;client=ms-android-americamovil-us&amp;amp;bih=560&amp;amp;biw=360&amp;amp;q=pepe%20in%20the%20sky&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwilwvrr5r3VAhUBRyYKHfiVCF0QMwg9KAYwBg&amp;amp;iact=mrc&amp;amp;uact=8">Like this</a></p>

<p>Except, here&#39;s the thing</p>

<p>The other night, as I was going to bed, I checked reddit, and saw the Seymore Hersh audio tweet from wikileaks.</p>

<p>I was reading comments, and I was pretty happy about the whole thing.</p>

<p>So, I sparked up a bowl to celebrate, and I swear I saw that stupid frog face appear in the flames in my bowl, smiling at me like an idiot. It had the two derby eyes and the smiling mouth in just the right place. It was vivid. The lines were clear enough that it was clearly a frog face and not just any old smiley face.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder.</p>

<p>Suppose this &#39;kek&#39; is a real, godlike entity.</p>

<p>Suppose he really is sending people on the &#39;at right&#39; signs like this, that are so subtle that they would feel stupid talking about it (like I do right now), but clear enough that they personally view it as a sign.</p>

<p>It would certainly explain the cult like behavior.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was stoned, but also, I grew up in my church, and never in my life had I experienced such an otherworldly, vivid, believable &#39;sign&#39;. It was fucking creepy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a second, you&#39;re actually claiming to be a descendent of nephilim? How can you know that? We&#39;re talking theory here, he never acknowledged any given race of today as being nephilim descendents.

<p>So if we are talking theory here... Then why not let it be in theory that I&#39;m nephilem?</p>

<p>Even if I made my reply personal, what I said doesn&#39;t really rely on me being nephilem. Nor do I think it really makes me a dick. </p>

<p>Here it is with parenthesis around phrases changed from referencing
me to referencing others and dollar signs over taken out phrases that reference me.  Still, I would agree with it.</p>

<p>&quot; So (someone), as a supposed descendent, just (has)to accept (they are) evil?</p>

<p>When cloning happens, all the clones must be evil or condemned?</p>

<p>Essentailly you are trying to push others to be evil. Why? Why not let (them) have a choice for (them)selves? Why give (others) no choice but to be below you? Even to put (descendants of nephilem) below people that chose evil, because they had a soul.</p>

But I believe that they may be brought into conditions that could encourage our promote them to exercise the &quot;evil&quot; aspects of their nature to best see them through the reality they perceive, be that circumstances, genetics, artifacts from past lives etc. There&#39;s infinite variables. And evil is relative. As is reality.<br/>
How might you know if you were supposedly a descendent of nephilim? The events described took place at least 12,000+ years ago. I&#39;m genuinely interested. </p>

<p>I get it, it was hypothetical, but hypothetically would they not be a race of people? I addressed this already.</p>

<p>I already showed how if I was Nephilem descendant or not didn&#39;t really matter in context.</p>

<p>However; if you THINK you are a nephilim descendent; I can&#39;t say that I know God&#39;s heart on Salvation...</p>

<p>Here is someone that agrees with you: <a href="https://reptiliandimension.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/can-a-nephilim-receive-biblical-salvation-as-described-in-the-new-testament-of-the-bible/">https://reptiliandimension.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/can-a-nephilim-receive-biblical-salvation-as-described-in-the-new-testament-of-the-bible/</a></p>

<p>My understanding that a portion of DNA is different than the full Triple-Helix corruption.  But since you offer no proof; my original statement stands, and I think you stand to divide and conquer on this thread by using things such as &quot;race&quot; to bait me.</p>

I really like when there&#39;s some from reddit...because it&#39;s usually from you posting my link on various reddit threads...and you always lead me to the most interesting reddit threads.  Ones I could never find on my own. Ive never figured out how to navigate Reddit...it&#39;s always confusing...and I usually don&#39;t last long when I come here because trying to find anything interesting feels like finding a needle in a haystack..so I appreciate whenever I see redit referrer links....because they&#39;re always great. :) Thanks for liking my piece btw.

<p>In my belief system, the &quot;fallen angels&quot; were simply an alien race who lived here, partially against their will, but were not hostile to humanity. There&#39;s some evidence that they were hostile towards individuals and groups that were hostile, but not our human race. At baseline, they tried to be cool, not freak anyone out too much, teach &amp; instruct as well as they could, and fuck our women.</p>

<p>If this is true, 70 gens = 2800 years.</p>

<p>As for all this UN stuff? It&#39;s really weird how much emphasis they place on symbolic/esoteric stuff. I don&#39;t know about Nephilim/aliens landing or portals. But the kind of people you find at the upper levels of the UN sure do like their symbolic dates and locations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understand that the Annunaki are actually Nephilim, and Benai-Elohim are the fallen angels who created them</p>

<p>Fallen angels had sex with human women, and their offspring are the Nephilim.</p>

<p>Genesis 6:
Wickedness in the World</p>

<p>1When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, 2the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 3Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend witha humans forever, for they are mortalb ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.”</p>

<p>4The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>5The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 6The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 7So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” 8But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

<p>Try to find favor in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rapture is the transporting of someone to heaven. If they are trafficking and murdering a percentage of them, then I would say those poor children are last seen by the people who report them missing - and if they die, I would say God would have mercy on them enough to let their innocence gain them entry into heaven.</p>

<p>Of course, there are broad terms that would need to be addressed but in the most basic religious sense - these families are losing their children as though they just vanished and went straight to an afterlife. The only time these families thought they would see their children again would be in heaven, so it&#39;s like they went straight there from the date of their disappearance.</p>

<p>It brought comfort through the years to many people, I would think, to believe that their children were swept off to heaven instead of brutally raped or murdered by people who are part of an effort that many people around the world turn a blind-eye to. </p>

<p>I never realized human trafficking was as bad as it was. Not until pizzagate, anyway. Now, it&#39;s blatantly obvious to me that it&#39;s an epidemic. But many, many people are still in the dark about it all.</p>

At the end of the rope were nails that he dug into his breast and then he would pull against the rope and stay there until the vision would arrive. The meaning was that he now had to sacrifice himself for the good of the tribe. But the myths are everywhere. Harry potter is the same story as Jesus. It&#39;s all about sacrificing yourself for others. </p>
