<p>If voting Trump into office is what it takes to wake everyone up and actually start paying attention to politics and it forces the DNC to either get their shit together and actually be progressive or die as a party then all Americans everywhere win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually shills on Reddit were one of the biggest deciding factors in me voting for Trump primarily as a protest vote.</p>

<p>Would have voted for Bernie over Trump in a heartbeat. Was going to vote Gary Johnson in protest but Internet/Reddit shills tried so hard to make me think Trump was literally Hittler that I looked into all of the DNC fuckery in corruption and realized that while Trump may not be perfect he was the only real choice we had in 2016 for any remote chance at changing the status quo.</p>

<p>Thanks Reddit shills for helping me realize that. I almost wasted my vote on Gary Johnson in a swing state. </p>

<p>Thankfully we went RED anyways but that wasn&#39;t something I was willing to risk once the shills made me aware of how corrupt the DNC had become. I can&#39;t be the only one.</p>

<p>Millions of shill dollars spent creating Trump voters. The irony is fucking astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ensuring real justice for all Americans and ending corruption in American politics are far more important than healthcare and border walls. </p>

<p>We cannot fix the real problems in this country until we have resolved the corruption. HRC would not have done anything to help with the corruption in politics.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have a real Healthcare bill passed that actually benefits the American people until you remove the corruption from politics. I hope that helps you understand since you seem to think thats the only issue that people should have voted on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing how corrupt the DNC is and that until that corruption is resolved voting for anyone in the DNC is just like voting for George Bush again.</p>

<p>You are also missing how taking down the DNC will lead to taking down the RNC because they are both intertwined in this massive web of corruption. </p>

<p>If Trump is corrupt he will have his day too, but that is yet to be determined. We know that the Bush and Obama administrations are filled with criminals that need to be investigated. </p>

<p>CEOs, lobbyists, and Trumps family are not by definition &quot;evil&quot; or corrupt&quot;. Perhaps its possible he put people in place he could trust to help him root out the corruption.</p>

<p>I cannot claim to know the future however I am hopeful. It is quite obvious to me an many others that had Trump not won the corruption would have gotten worse. </p>

<p>Is it possible it might still get worse? Sure, but with Trump theres a chance it might not.</p>

<p>Thats what your missing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, well I am definitely missing something, because I am not sure how you think the current administration is less corrupt, or what makes past administrations seem more corrupt.  So far it seems a pretty tight race, but with less competence in the current administration.</p>

<p>What corruption has Trump avoided? What corruption has the DNC committed? I&#39;m not trying to say DNC is not corrupt, I think any two party system bends towards corruption anyways--I&#39;m trying to clarify by comparing and contrasting here. Can I get one or two major specifics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC colluding with the mainstream media and rigging the DNC primary against Bernie Sanders is enough reason to dismantle and completely destroy the DNC and replace it with a new party.</p>

<p>The corruption the DNC engaged in the past 8 years is just a continuation of the corruption from the Bush years. The DNC has been hijacked by Neocons. Hillary Clinton was literally George Bush in a pantsuit. </p>

<p>Obama, Bush, Clinton they are all Neocons. </p>

<p>John McCain, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitt Romney, are all Neocons. They are all one in the same.</p>

<p>What corruption has Trump avoided? He prevented another Neocon from getting elected into office.</p>

<p>Is it possible that Trump may be lead astray or controled by the Necons? Sure that could happen, nothing is for certian.</p>

<p>But right now it looks like Trump is fighting the Neocons/Establishment pretty hard, and the way the media is trying to portray Trump as Hitler and the worst thing to ever happen to the US without him actually doing anything wrong makes me and many others think that they are scared he will actually do something to help the American people and ruin their corrupt little game they have been playing.</p>

<p>Fox news LOVED Bush it was literally a 24/7 pep-rally of how AWERSOME George Bush was 2000-2008 </p>

<p>Compared to the way Fox treated Bush Fox HATES Trump.</p>

<p>When the Establishment Politicians who have done nothing but fuck everyone in this country over for decades and CIA Propaganda Mainstream Media on the Left and Right are so vehemently against someone for &quot;alleged corruption&quot; when they gave every other president in history a pass on corruption and war crimes... well, that should really tell you all you need to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve never seen so much blatant and in-your-face corruption in American history. Your puritanical view on stamping out &quot;corruption&quot; backfired. You did not achieve your goal. </p>

<p>MSM is putting on a show and you are still buying it. Last Friday, Bill Browder testified before Congress about Russian motives -- pointing out that Russia was playing both sides for the purpose of causing chaos in the United States. Your press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders misrepresented and reversed the implications of what Bill Browder said -- carefully selecting one side of the Russian equation and using that to vindicate Donald Trump. BTW, that&#39;s corruption. MSM did not call her out on this. </p>

<p>Today, WikiLeaks promoted a selected one-sided audio release to turn around a story involving Trump colluding with a Republican operative to create Seth Rich fake news. The audio had Seymour Hersh saying that he had an FBI source indicating that Seth Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks offering them the DNC Leaks. Conveniently, the person at WikiLeaks who he supposedly contacted DIED in the meantime, so there&#39;s no one to speak out now. (Isn&#39;t that ironic? The whole thing with Seth Rich is to say he leaked the emails, therefore Democrats killed him.) </p>

<p>Seymour Hersh also said, according to the complaint, &quot;Mr. Hersh cautioned Butowsky that the information was not necessarily true, and that, even if true, it did not preclude the possibility that the Russians also hacked the DNC.&quot; The recording omitted this portion, and MSM has not bothered to ask about it.</p>

<p>MSM is not opposing Donald Trump -- it is rallying his base with outrage while discouraging others from paying attention.</p>

<p>BTW, if there really is an FBI report, I hear that Donald Trump just got a new FBI director who can find out and tell the public very quickly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To create division in people and make everyone think they either have to be for Trump or against Trump. They don&#39;t want people to think there is a middle ground in this mess and that we all have more in common than we disagree on.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want people to realize that none of us really support either major party.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want people to realize the real reason Trump won was because neither major party nor the mainstream media (including Fox) actually supported him.</p>

<p>Most Trump voters were NOT Neocon-Republicans they were Independents, Libertarians, and Real Republicans, and Real Progressives.</p>

<p>The DNC has been hijacked by Neocon Republicans. Thats why Nanci Pelosi, John McCain, Chuck Schumer, and Paul Ryan,etc all seem like members of the same party even though they arent. They are all Neocons/Deep State.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want people to realize that Trumps election is actually the collapse of the 2 party narrative being rejected by Americans before their very eyes. So they are doing everything they can to create division and keep the 2 party nonsense going. Pretending no Bernie supporters would ever vote for Trump is part of that.</p>

<p>EDIT: Nice edit, your assumption that no one who truly backed Bernie Sanders would vote for Trump will be DNC&#39;s downfall. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe its possible to make billions of dollars without being a little corrupt but Trump is just one person. Maybe he screwed some people over in business deals to make his billions? Big fucking deal. </p>

<p>Thus far ZERO evidence exists that Trump is not working in the best interest of the American people as presiden. </p>

<p>He may be a &quot;mean guy&quot; or say &quot;mean things&quot; or things you don&#39;t like but in NO WAY does that excuse the treason and deceit the entier DNC has subjected American Democracy to over the past 8 years. Let alone the election they STOLE from Bernie and the American voters.</p>

<p>Zero? There is nothing the Trump administration has done that is not in the interest of the american people? What about Net Neutrality? What about holding a nuclear strategy session at Mar A Lago? What about claiming we should confiscate Iraq&#39;s oil? What about propagating a budget designed in part to cut funding to Meals on Wheels? what about filling White House advisory jobs with family members? What about refusing to give up his unsecure cell phone?</p>

<p>I know these are things you and I will not agree on, but zero seems hyperbole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can I get a clarification on what the DNC did that was treasonous that is not still being done by the current administration? Because that Venn Diagram looks a lot like a circle to me today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you find it odd that the same companies who were once against Net Neutrality are now for it? </p>

<p>&quot;Net Neutrality&quot; doesn&#39;t mean shit if huge companies control everything you see on the internet and that&#39;s whats been happening gradually over the past 15 years. Before you know it the internet will be just as shitty a source of information as TV. Reddit is working hard to make this a reality.</p>

<p>Well I would have to say that the overwhelming ammount of evidence that the DNC colluded with the media to bash Bernie Sanders and then rigging the primary and stealing American voters choice in what was supposed to be a fair election by the people for the people is a good place to start. </p>

<p>That alone should kill the Democratic Party forever, if your a real progressive that should be a good thing. There could be an ACTUAL progressive party to take its place!</p>

<p>I could go on about the Uranium One deal where the DNC sold a large portion US Uranium to Russia. The only actual Russian conspiracy that&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I could also go on about how the Clinton Foundation took money in exchange for political favors from foreign nations while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Which is literally the definition of treason.</p>

<p>Or I could talk about how the Obama Administration gave away US Ambassadorships to the highest bidders.</p>

<p>Honestly the list is endless. If you really curious just do a little bit of research on the Uranium One Deal its pretty clear and cut, but I am fairly certain I am wasting my time typing this and you are just wasting my time :)</p>

<p>But please tell me about how the awful things Trump has done in 6 months somehow overshadow all the awful things Bush and Obama did from 2000-2016 :)</p>

<p>If anything Donald Trump got people to actually start paying attention to politics for the first time in my life. I&#39;d call that a win.</p>

<p>Trump may be corrupt but we KNOW FOR A FACT the DNC is literally a criminal organization. The RNC may be as well but thats to be determined. </p>

<p>The DNC needs to be investigated under RICO. The RNC probably does too but currently we only have evidence to implicate the DNC.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand why DNC corruption needs to be investigated then your hopeless. </p>

<p>I support investigating Trump for any REAL corruption if and when that occurs.</p>

<p>Currently WE KNOW the DNC has engaged in numerous criminal activities and that needs to be addressed. If you think HRC was going to address that then you are smoking crack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Policy does not matter as much as justice for all.</p>

<p>You cannot change policy until the level of corruption has changed and in order to change the level of corruption someone who might actually instill that justice needs to become involved.</p>

<p>Many of us were hoping that might be Trump, we may have been wrong but its only been 6 months.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that HRC would have done NOTHING to stop corruption in politics and ensure justice for all because she helped birth the corruption into existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking down Hillary wont end ALL corruption... your right, just like arresting one of the greatest jewel thieves in the world wouldn&#39;t end ALL jewel theft forever, but it&#39;s a huge dent in the problem and would deter future jewel thieves from trying the same.</p>

<p>It would be insane to put one of the greatest jewel thieves in history in charge the worlds biggest vault of the rarest jewels with no security and expect jewel theft to be ended by the jewel thief.</p>

<p>Which is basically what your logic is suggesting.</p>

<p>Hope that helps :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Policy can spur or squash justice. Citizens United, civil asset forfeiture, right to work, Wall Street, unaccountability in law enforcement, marijuana prohibition, for-profit prisons... these are policies being supported and introduced by this administration that deny the people justice. </p>

<p>If OP is as concerned about justice as he sounds, he should be holding Trump accountable for his failure to nominate a Supreme Court justice that will overturn Citizens United instead of making up excuses. Any Bernie supporter would be ashamed of AG Jeff Sessions, who is entirely in the pocket of private prisons and the prison industrial complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know one person, but he has zero capacity for critical thinking. When he was a Bernie supporter, it was all about beating Hillary, not about any specific vision or policy. In a lot of ways, he was just like the rabid Hillary supporters I&#39;ve met — only able to oppose the opponent instead of actually standing for something.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to be clear, individual examples don&#39;t delegitimize the people who actually swung to Trump. I don&#39;t deny that those people exist, nor do I see a point in doing so. And as I&#39;ve already argued, it&#39;s in the establishment&#39;s best interests to make those people seem more powerful and significant than they actually are.</p>
