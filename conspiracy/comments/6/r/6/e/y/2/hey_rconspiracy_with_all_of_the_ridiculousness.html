       Take yesterdays events: 
RE:Rod Wheeler
I think it is a huge troll to get #SethRich back into the news cycle.
Frame it as fake news, then drop the "leaked" bombshells.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod is clearly in the room when these recordings are taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone uploaded this:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8at6PD4L8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8at6PD4L8
       </a>
       and this:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccJ2d9DVExo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccJ2d9DVExo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Which was released yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Trolled the MSM into talking about Seth Rich long enough for people to google it and hit the myriad stash trove of evidence that has been sperged all over the internet, combined with his leaked testimony...Is this his way of circumventing the Gag order?
      </p>
      <p>
       SY HERSH SAYING SETH LEAKED TO WIKILEAKS: And having SEEN the FBI Case file on it....
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giuZdBAXVh0">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod Wheeler has a GAG ORDER as per DNC spokesperson.
It is my understanding you can say whatever you want as an allegation in a lawsuit; so did he concoct this to get it back in the news? Then he dropped his OWN conversation in order to prove that what he said initially in the Fox5 Interviews was accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Rod Leak his own Tapes?
And Sy Hersh's stuff WOWZA.
      </p>
      <p>

       Are you deliberately being obtuse here? He is under a federal investigation for stealing equipment from the DNC, HD's with who knows what kind of sensitive material. DWS kept him on payroll until his arrest, even though he couldn;t access the network. His wages being paid by taxpaying dollars, so please explain to me why the DNC is defending him, considering the allegations of the FBI investigation, and how this is not connected to the DNC? You being upvoted is just plain sad.

       I doubt it's a bogus charge. Numbers do not really lie. I mean he was being investigated for a higher crime, and they used the lesser crime to keep him here. The real questions is why is the DNC representing him? He stole equipment and got terminated for it, you have DWS saying there will be "consequences" to the DC police chief on camera, pertaining to her laptop that they took as evidence. A lawyer that had previous connections to Clinton is representing him. None of this makes any sense to me. Why would the DNC defend this man? Why is the DNC paying a shared IT staffer more than the majority of the directors? This whole story reeks.

       If he was up to shady stuff with the dnc. Why would they literally keep him on the payroll. These are not good guys but they are smart and have gotten away with crimes collusions and atrocities for decades. A payroll error is not gonna trip them up. This has a pizza gate vibe,but that's just me...

       All the pieces are on the news. Half a sentence here, the last line of an article there.  If you pay attention, it is possible to understand what is going on just by reading the news but you have to discard 95+ percent of everything published.

       Like the little bit a few years back about the Army using CNN newsrooms for training psychological operations propaganda officers.  It
       <em>
        was

       reported, but few people noticed and even fewer put the pieces together as to which dog is actually running the show.

       I agree, because credit fraud seems like it's not really related to the DNC. Diddnt the DNC bankroll their lives even when they were on the run and no longer working for them?

       They worked for Debbie Wasserman Shultz. You can twist agency around all you want, but there's clearly a connection between the DNC and the Awan brothers through Shultz.

       So it went from 'working for the DNC' 'bankrolled by DNC' to a 'connection'. Why can't you admit you got something wrong instead of  all this pretense? I can stretch these kind of 'connections' to make absurd claims as well, want to see me try it?

       Yea I misspoke. I meant paid by Debbie Wassermann Shultz. I thought everyone would automatically connect Debbie to the DNC. But you know, I guess that's not inherently obvious for a person like you.

       What was your original point? That they weren't paid by the DNC? Did you look at my original comment? I correct my statement. So as far as an admission of being incorrect, I think that gets as good as it gets, no?

       This was not just about a connection, being paid by the DNC is very different than working for a Congresswomen who is not even part of the DNC leadership anymore.

       That you were wrong and the 'DNC' 'connection' implied is propaganda. An IT guy getting arrested for bank fraud implicates the DNC how? How does it even implicate DWS???

       You are so delusional to the reality of the situation, you are wondering how Debbie Wassermann Schultz is implicated. And the bitch is threatening the D.C. Police Chief on the Awan brothers behalf. She personally and publicly made an appearance to recover their computer.

       What's to argue, I called you out multiple time for inaccuracies, you keep insisting that they are real when they are not. Show me when you have something real, like an actual crime DWS is involved in and stop with the 'connection' stuff. As I said, I can make up lots of theories with connections too when it comes to anyone.

       I don't need to argue with a bullshitter. There's no point. Any one reading this can see your going through leaps and bounds to ignore obvious connections. The biggest one being DWS arguing on the Awan brothers behalf trying to recover their computer. And you saying DWS has no connection to the DNC is simply laughable.

       tbf she was correct that it was illegal for them to keep the laptop if it was hers, theres something in the constitution about not being able to take things that are part of a congress persons jobs from off the grounds. They still never got to look at it because of that until DWS was supposedly giving them an image a week before the awan arrest(don't know if she ever actually did, just saw in the news that she was going to)

       I never said stop talking about it. I implied it shouldn't be spammed. There's quite the difference. Spamming one story every day multiple times a day all day long as a distraction tactic hurts everyone. It's harder to talk about shit like Kennedy when almost every post on the front page is one or two things.

       Here is a full break down of Awans "bank fraud" scandal.. Actually you can find the r/conspiracy thread that blew this up in March HERE:
       <a href="https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60l4pu/the_awan_brothers_compromised_at_least_80/">
        https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60l4pu/the_awan_brothers_compromised_at_least_80/
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Awan Brothers*
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       3 Awan brothers are named by Webb : Imran, Jamal and Abid. (A 4th brother and wife of one of the Awan's are also believed to be involved).
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Won’t the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, "ya got no proof," but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events.

       I think he's out already under house arrest.  And his attorney is deeply connected to the DNC; very high priced as well.

       Awan's lawyer is Chris Gowen. I would be a bit hesitant with citing "deeply connected to the DNC" as the only connection that's public campaigning for the Clintons. But I guess it depends on your definition of deeply connected so meh.

       The DNC/DWS/Hillary is not defending him. The attorney in the past worked for the Clinton campaign, but he is not part of their apparatus. No money is being spent by DNC/DWS/Hillary for this attorney.
      </p>

       This is Washington D.C., people have connections with each other all the time, especially since Chris Gowen and Hillary both were lawyers so they are in the same field.

       They have been covering it, it's a developing story that isn't all that interesting to people that don't go to alternative news sources.

       You're right, the Awan story is far less interesting than the typical MSM faire. You know what would go great with this Russia story they haven't stopped talking about? Another Malaysia Airlines plane going missing.

       Do you realize how many people on this planet now roll their eyes any time seth rich is brought up?

      <p>
       Not everyone is able to amp themselves up for every potential development of a story that's been pushed, repushed, and repackaged over and over again for quite some time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's right or wrong, I'm suggesting people look at how everything has played out in the public eye and to consider that not everyone is going to want to examine every potential lead  in a year old case, that, one way or another pretty much everyone has already decided how they feel about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if solid legal action like movement in the courts happens, not just a freedom of information request, then people might become interested again.  Until then, it's only profitable to a specific 'target market'.

       I agree, because credit fraud seems like it's not really related to the DNC. Diddnt the DNC bankroll their lives even when they were on the run and no longer working for them?

       Source for that? Is that what he was arrested for?

       If he was up to shady stuff with the dnc. Why would they literally keep him on the payroll. These are not good guys but they are smart and have gotten away with crimes collusions and atrocities for decades. A payroll error is not gonna trip them up. This has a pizza gate vibe,but that's just me...

       You're the one who made up a scenario which includes a bogus charge to keep him in the country.

       Pure speculation, nothing else.

       What facts? You made a baseless claim. You speculated that there is another reason for his arrest than the stated reason. There is absolutely no evidence at all that this is true.

       All the pieces are on the news. Half a sentence here, the last line of an article there.  If you pay attention, it is possible to understand what is going on just by reading the news but you have to discard 95+ percent of everything published.

       Like the little bit a few years back about the Army using CNN newsrooms for training psychological operations propaganda officers.  It
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       reported, but few people noticed and even fewer put the pieces together as to which dog is actually running the show.

       I kinda do think that's what is happening.  Personally, I like it.  We are well beyond Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World, so, sure, why not?
