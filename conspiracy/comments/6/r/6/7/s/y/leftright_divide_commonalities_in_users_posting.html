        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheMadQuixotician.html">TheMadQuixotician</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will begin with a disclaimer that I rebuke the idea of a two-party system and believe that the divide between left and right is perpetuated to keep those at the bottom from diverting their gaze upwards. It is with this notion that I form this post:</p>

<p>So a few weeks ago I was browsing r/conspiracy and found an odd post. The link was to a story hosted on <a href="http://www.donaldtrumpus.com">www.donaldtrumpus.com</a>, a site that at first glance seems to have a pretty clear agenda, right? </p>

<p>I posit that this is not the case. </p>

<p>The site fashions itself like a poorly run blog, but there&#39;s still the sense that something is off. Even the most virulent &quot;pro-right&quot; sites at least attempt to put forth information in a way that&#39;s full of buzz words and invokes an emotional response from the reader. This site however seems to be a caricature of a &quot;pro&quot; or dare I say &quot;alt&quot; &quot;right&quot; periodical.  The information is displayed in such an inflammatory was so as to ensure the ridiculousness of the site discredits itself. </p>

<p>This was a first impression.</p>

<p>I saw the OP had only posted in r/AskReddit and had a little over 100 karma. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today; I see another post linking to donaldtrumpus and lo and behold, the OP is a relatively newer account, a little over 100 karma and had only posted in r/AskReddit. </p>

<p>So now I became curious. &quot;Who would believe this site?&quot; I asked myself. So I decided to search r/conspiracy for some elucidation. I found that most of the accounts linking to this page were (as of today) 67-68 days old. </p>

<p><strong>Accounts Posting donaldtrumpus.com link</strong></p>

<p>u/mastork 67 days old
u/brezok 68 days old
u/Krlemp  68 days old
u/oregol.  68 days old
u/zubasas  68 days old
u/mostersk 68 days old
u/Karelonn 68 days old
u/masterdis 68 days old 
u/meytoj
u/pisterkk
u/brakore
u/sartod
u/briznos</p>

<p>They&#39;re all created within days of each other and all link to donaldtrumpus.com</p>

<p>So what does it mean? Why make a post to draw attention to simple spammers?</p>

<p>I believe that this site is indicative of a campaign for pushing partisan divide. Posting a link to these stories is inflammatory. It prompts left sympathizers to come in and correct incorrect information, while simultaneously getting a few of the more emotionally inclined right sympathizers to fight back to defend their side before necessarily fact checking the information in the article. </p>

<p>The result is a widening of the partisan divide, increased argument, and most importantly, it draws attention away from potentially constructive discourse elsewhere.</p>

<p>Please be wary of Argument Phishing and good luck in your quest towards some form of greater understanding. Remember, where some will try to convince you to point the finger to the left or the right, we as should instead divert our gaze upwards. </p>

<p>The partisan divide is an effective tool used to manufacture distraction; let&#39;s sift through this shit together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and that could be as simple as what it seems at face value, but I toy with the idea that it could be putting out deliberately weak information from a rightwards position so that it may be naturally discredited by a more left leaning voice, generating argument all the while. I don&#39;t subscribe to either camp, but either way we wind up with the same result from this site and its subsequent linking to this page. </p>

<p>Lefties want the government to take peoples wealth and redistribute it, in addition to controlling many minutia of peoples lives.</p>

<p>How do conceive a reconciliation of these two sides such that they are a false divide? Only the right could conceivably exist absent the divide due to the absence of government. The left could only exist absent the divide by capturing the state apparatus and liquidating non-believers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could definitely see this as another attempt to divide just as easily as I could see it as legitimate Trump spam. It&#39;s getting hard to tell the difference. But this reminds me of something else I ran into recently.  </p>

<p>I had made the mistake of mentioning that I voted third party in an <a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> thread and I received a bunch of negative comments saying it was my fault Trump won. The one that really stood out to me though was one that vowed to torture me and actual Trump supporters &quot;until our families regretted raising us&quot;. It was very graphic and specific. The mods removed the comment and the user quickly deleted it, but I still had his user name so I decided to do some snooping. The account was three years old and had no comment history before his death threat to me. However, every single comment after that was on T_D, EuropeanNationalism, and other &quot;far right&quot; subs.  </p>

<p>So was this someone from the right trying to make the left look violent, or someone from the left trying to make the right look bad? Obviously it was an attempt to divide, but by who? </p>
