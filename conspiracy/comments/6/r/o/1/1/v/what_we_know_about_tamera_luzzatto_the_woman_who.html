        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Please read this thread, and if you agree, please do upvote. People like the ones active in the thread I linked below will downvote no matter what.</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôm creating this thread because I saw the post on the front page today about the bizarre heated pool email received by John Podesta and written by Tamera Luzzatto. The thread I am talking about is this one: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rjx82/wikileaks_podesta_email_discusses_children_in_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rjx82/wikileaks_podesta_email_discusses_children_in_a/</a></p>

<p>What deeply concerned me were the top comments trying to justify and debunk the whole email and more specifically, Tamera‚Äôs blog called ‚ÄúEvie‚Äôs Crib‚Äù. It seems like this is a recurring theme in Pedogate related threads. There is a group active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is actively trying debunk Pedogate by pointing out irrelevant information about the subject being discussed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rjx82/wikileaks_podesta_email_discusses_children_in_a/dl5qawx/?context=3">This comment</a> in the thread linked above is a prime example of this. He shows some of the blog posts which are innocent, not mentioning anything actual pizzagate researchers have pointed out. I will show you what actually IS relevant below. Somehow though, the comment gets upvoted massively and gets a spot as one of the top comments. Accounts like these purely exist to try and debunk (mostly pedogate) conspiracies. The thread itself is upvoted to the front page yet almost all of the top comments are bashing the subject.</p>

<p>Tamara Luzzatto wrote this email:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a></p>

<p>This part is deeply disturbing to a lot of people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you‚Äôll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People started to investigate Tamara and found her blog, Evie‚Äôs Crib. First of all, the entry text to the blog is rather weird. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ELHWg">‚ÄúFor a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.‚Äù</a></p>

<p>When we look further, we can see some <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ELHWg">deeply disturbing tags</a> for a blog about a baby.</p>

<p>Tags such as <strong>Discomfort, Parental Manipulation, Public Intoxication, Skullduggery, Transquilizers, Malpractice</strong> and more.</p>

<p>Lastly, but not least: Swordfish69, famous Pedogate reseacher has <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1786134">uncovered evidence that the Luzzatto family are both linked to occult kabbalah worship and the Black Nobility, a globalist faction based in Northern Italy and Switzerland. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was a messianic cult leader accused of promoting black magic through a secret cult during the 18th century</a></p>

<p>This is worth the read. It‚Äôs amazing what this guy has found so far. You can look at all of his submission <a href="https://voat.co/user/swordfish69/submissions">here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shills and controlled opposition here are REALLY stepping up their game.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint for everyone on this sub. If a post has an extremely and unusually large amount of comments in it, in relation to the upvote count. (EX: the Lozzatto post on the front page has 1k upvotes and 1k comments), that is usually Indicative of a shill brigade.</p>

<p>Massive amount of comments usually = shill brigade. In other words, the content in THAT post is very good and revealing information and they need TONS of shills to sway the comment section tone. </p>

<p>Truly a ridiculous number of shills here, but they&#39;re active even in the relatively unpopular posts. It&#39;s easier to shill when there&#39;s only a few comments, then they can work together to get a forum slide post on the front page full of shilled commentary like &quot;evie&#39;s crib is proof that Podesta fucks children!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly im not sure. Im not convinced that this was part of a plan to seize guns, but it is deeply troubling.</p>

<p>Im conflicted. I want to believe that the atf was working to justify their existence, and while I can see how further regulations would be benificial to the atf the Holder issue makes me doubt things were this clear cut.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm.....</p>

<p>Know youve got me wondering if the true issue is not banning guns but eventually regulating to near nonexistance.</p>

<p>Honestly im not sure. Im not convinced that this was part of a plan to seize guns, but it is deeply troubling.</p>

<p>Not seize guns in one fell swoop.  To push it and accelerate it, but not all at once.  When folks said Obama was coming for your guns...he was coming to limit gun ownership...to marginalize it....to tell you what kind of stock you can have, or how many bullets you could have in your magazine.</p>

<p>Know youve got me wondering if the true issue is not banning guns but eventually regulating to near nonexistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the actual source material for the claim that Luzzatto was involved in something nefarious. In reality, the Luzzatto ancestor believed he had received a visit from an angel and found himself in conflict with the rabbinical authority of his time (300 years ago!)</p>

<p>Most of the relevant text is available on Google books, and it talks about the utterly mundane conflict between a Jewish messianic figure and the rabbinate. It&#39;s a tale older than Christianity. There is no mention of satanic or nefarious practices of Luzzatto, and in fact it details how is chastised for failing to grow a beard and get married.</p>

<p>I love this sort of rabbit hole, and some of them seem real, but the evidence presented in your link is incredibly weak. The key point is a lie sourcing an obscure book detailing a religious conflict in European Jewry 300 years ago.</p>

<p>Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phrase black magic is in the original post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, but not least: Swordfish69, famous Pedogate reseacher has uncovered evidence that the Luzzatto family are both linked to occult kabbalah worship and the Black Nobility, a globalist faction based in Northern Italy and Switzerland. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was a messianic cult leader accused of promoting black magic through a secret cult during the 18th century</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you even read this shit before you upvote it?</p>

<p>Are you referring to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Nobility">Black Nobility</a>? It seems odd that a Jewish family linked with Kabbalist traditions with ties to the Jewish elite in the early 1700s would also be tied to a group of families known for supporting the pope, but stranger things have happened. There&#39;s nothing in the sources provided that tie the Lazzutto family to the Black Nobility, nor can I find anything tying the Black Nobility to some modern globalist faction. I&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t look very hard, every time I scratch the surface I find fool&#39;s gold and bullshit, so maybe you can point me in a better direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did. The post makes the key lie where it conflates kabbalism and the conflict between Moshe Chaim Luzzatto and Hagiz with some sort of satanic black magic.</p>

<p>The relevant section is mostly available on [Google Books0(<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N7PQjAl8ugMC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=N7PQjAl8ugMC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false</a>). Go to page 228, towards the ned of the chapter on the Luzzatto Controversy, to get to the key description of the circle of Jewish believers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During this period, in January 1731, the members of the circle wrote and signed a new covenant of unity. It seems certain that the persecutions, culminating in the oath, were the primary impulse behind this new recension. One provision encouraged the members to remain steadfast in their undertaking and never to pay heed to the mockery of others. The new contract also reflected the renewed commitment of the circle to intensify its efforts and expand its reach. It made specific provisions for introducing new members into the circle.. The covenant contained... a special set of obligations for the second rank members... Some of these provisions reveal the degree of messianic intensity that pervaded the circle.  The secondary group was cautioned to remain ever alert to the purpose of the group&#39;s activities: cosmic restoration and national redemption. They must pledge never to accept any form of personal reward or compensation for their studies, as that would deflect them from the goal. They were to remember always that they were permanently bound to the unified circle. The assigned rotations provided for a continuous, uninterrupted flow of Torah study whose purpose was: &quot;To elevate the Shekhinah so that it would never descend again... to crush the strength of Samael and his entire evil cohort... so that the Bride of Moses [the Shekhinah[... will be united with Moses&quot;<sup>98</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this sounds like a (perhaps deluded) messianic Jew in the early 1700s that came into conflict with an influential rabbi. It amazes me that somebody took the time to hunt down these sources and twist the language to forge a lie tying the Luzzatto&#39;s to some satanic cult.</p>

<p>This shit feels professional. Damn, who puts this together? I&#39;m impressed. If this book weren&#39;t readily available online, I wouldn&#39;t even be able to check the sources without ordering a book or finding this obscure book in a library, and the source itself looks like a legitimate scholarly work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conveniently there&#39;s no mention of summoning of the dead available in the book preview, and otherwise your interpretation relies on equating kabbalah with satanism.</p>

<p>The chapter on Luzzatto mentions an influential rabbi who praises Luzzatto as enlightened by God. The entire controversy comes down to a conflict between Luzzatto and Hagiz. There&#39;s no actual discussion of anything satanic in any of the available text. When the covenant gets mentioned, it&#39;s all about studying the Torah (which would be hilarious if you weren&#39;t completely twisting the history here).</p>

<p>So, do you have anything at all besides quotes that aren&#39;t in the actual text? Because the book your pal is using as a source doesn&#39;t support the claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all ignores my original point. If all of this is so obvious, why are you lying about satanic ancestors of the Luzzatto family? If you have no links and only vague insinuations, I have to assume the entire conspiracy is built on this flimsy evidence and outright lies. It certainly works well enough on gullible rubes, but then these same people thought Trump would save them, so it just goes to show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the relevant section of the book (Chapter 7, the Luzzatto Controversy), and you&#39;re lying about it. We&#39;ve been over this.</p>

<p>The rest of your &quot;evidence&quot; amounts to some bizarre taste in art. You&#39;re claiming that these families ran a children-trafficking operation in plain sight, going so far as to advertise services on their blog, and yet nobody has any evidence beyond a video of a 1990&#39;s performance art exhibit and some weird instagram photos.</p>

<p>Do you want to delve into the &quot;Dahmer statue&quot;?  Because it&#39;s common knowledge that there is <em>no way</em> Bourgeois could have been exposed to the Dahmer crime scene photos before creating the sculpture.</p>

<p>So what do we have left from your shitty link?  One Djurdevic painting that isn&#39;t even <em>remotely</em> linked to pedophilia outside of your own pedo fever dreams?</p>

<p>Quit being a pussy.  Post the links to the art pieces that they own.  I know it blows the pizzagate narrative, but I think it&#39;s pretty important if we&#39;re looking for the &quot;truth&quot; here.</p>

<p>I almost can bet you can give a bot a &quot;general mood of discussion&quot;, and then hit &quot;go&quot; on a thread or sub comment section and let bots go to town auto-populating/submersing any valuable discussion w &quot;hot or what&#39;s newest&quot; comments. </p>

<p>From a computer science angle, it&#39;s a simple thing to achieve, from a human level, that&#39;s depressing as fuck to realize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a mother of 3 sons and I can tell you there&#39;s NO WAY I would advertise and allow anyone to see them &quot;LIVE Raw and uncut&quot;. Also, there is not one parent I know who would allow any of this with their children. God, I&#39;ve even said NO on a permission form their school sent to us to show images of our children on the school website and facebook. </p>

<p>For anyone to suggest this is innocent or harmless is either partisan, stupid and/or not parents themselves.</p>

<p>Call me anal and a protective mother all you want but the behaviour of parents like that woman is abusive for an obvious attempt of using her child as a commodity and in this particular case - for way more nefarious reasons.</p>

<p>And tbh I personally don&#39;t really know what to do about it because as we&#39;re finding out, child protective services are just as bad in using children as commodities to be bought and sold or &#39;hired&#39; out and passed around for whatever purposes.</p>

<p>CPS agencies receive funding and I believe commissions for &#39;caring&#39; for children at risk and foster &#39;carers&#39; receive money for each child they care for - it&#39;s a massive child trafficking racket.</p>

<p>As such, the only thing I can think of is to publicly expose, name and shame the individuals partaking in such practices. In the end, what happens to the children?</p>

Full name and age means they have never met before. Why are people who have never met my children being &#39;entertained&#39; at a dinner party by swimming in a pool for them? Even if we take everything in the best light possible, that is fucked up. There is no way I would allow a step-grandmother to take them to a political social event where there are no other kids coming. Why is this even something they have requested? Why not get some nice wine and have a normal adult evening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when was the last time you were going to a party and the hosts provided you with a dossier of their grandchildren or friends children? &#39;Oh, by the way, my niece will be at the party. Her name is Jane Doe and is age 7.&#39; Why is that necessary to include all of that information? </p>

<p>Why will they be in the pool &#39;for sure&#39;? There is no reason to include &#39;for sure&#39; unless it is seen as some incentive or perk. This is a concern for the guests in some manner, which is concerning.</p>

<p>Also, no mention of any other children. These children are not related to this woman by blood - she married into the family 3 years before their grandpa died and is a step-grandmother. If there were other children coming with the other guests, then I could better understand the situation, but instead the children are literally being referred to as &#39;entertainment&#39;, but without the apostrophes around it. You can spin that all you want, but it&#39;s suspicious and as a parent myself, it&#39;s a big red flag. The language is as such that I can&#39;t help but think there is something strange and predatory going on.</p>

<p>Are you really arguing that breaking down language has no bearing on meaning and intent? You realize that words - especially written words - have meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have difficulty grasping the concept of slang. When someone asks &quot;what&#39;s up&quot; do they literally mean to ask what&#39;s directly up? No they are asking what you have been doing. You are trying to dissect a slang statement literally, how do you seriously not under stand that the meaning behind what people say is NEVER straight forward. This isn&#39;t a shakspearwan play, it&#39;s a lady sending an email about her kids. If you can&#39;t understand how breaking down her language literally is very very disengenous, then you&#39;re just willfully misrepresenting what this woman said for partisan reasons. So much real shit you guys can go after but instead you make shit up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So whats the &#39;slang&#39; in question here? Slang still designates meaning. getting &#39;ubered&#39; somewhere means being driven somewhere - correct?
Are you saying that &#39;ubered&#39; implies that the person also stayed? Why wouldn&#39;t they just be referred to as attending instead of as a driver?</p>

Like I said you&#39;re thinking into it too much and dissescting exactly what an Uber driver does on a level way deeper than this woman did. She thought &quot; Ubers drive people place, she&#39;s driving my kids, she&#39;s the Uber haha I&#39;m so hip&quot;. This woman probably thought about it for 1 second, but you having thought about it much longer can derive different meaning behind what she said. See what I mean by thinking into it too much? You&#39;re going layers deeper thinking about word choice than the person that actually chose them. there&#39;s no reason she didn&#39;t just say drive just like there isn&#39;t a reason I say what&#39;s up dude instead of how are you.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Or do you want to assume people are guilty until proven innocent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All people are doing is asking questions - it is up to the authorities to make that call. With that said, the pubic domain is exactly that.</p>

<p>If the family weren&#39;t connected to high-level politics and other elite families, I don&#39;t know if this would be such a big deal. If it weren&#39;t found in Podesta&#39;s emails, it probably would have slid by. If Luzzatto didn&#39;t have a weirdly cryptic blog talking about &#39;raw and uncut&#39; infants being available in some capacity, it probably wouldn&#39;t have blown up. Let&#39;s not pretend there aren&#39;t reasons to be suspicious.</p>

<p>So by your logic, the only time we can even catch pedophiles and human traffickers is if they are sloppy enough to get caught in the act? People paying attention is always a good thing. A community needs to be tested and people need to be held responsible. The reason this issue is so big is because people are now becoming hyper-aware that the elite do not answer to the same laws as you or I. So when these types of things come up (pedophilia/corruption of authority), random users become very interested and far more aggressive because they feel and know that these victims are not being represented. It would not be some great revelation to have proof of a massive elite pedophile ring - it would be a confirmation of things that have been said for decades already. That&#39;s the angle - not &#39;guilty until proven innocent&#39;. Have I called for locking them up or confronting them with aggression in any way here?</p>

You have not, but A LOT of people have. And idk I just think it&#39;s dangerous for throngs of people to go into witch hunt mode. It&#39;s different when people say that &quot;yes it might be suspicious but we dont know for sure.&quot; That seems reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously it&#39;s good people are protective of children. And i understand why people want the elite to be taken down, and would love if the source of the pedo ring rumors were exposed. But there could be innocent people being roped into these conspiracy theories and their lives destroyed. Luzzatto is unable to engage in social media without someone accusing her of unspeakable things yet for all we know she might have just made a bad joke. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s human nature to be suspicious and these emails and the blog are weird but at the same time I wish there was a culture of empathy and civility so that innocent people dont have their lives ruined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, so best case scenario, reading it in &#39;your&#39; voice you&#39;ve chosen, what we have is a group of political insiders, out on a colder night (mid-60F) that have 3 children that they do not know swimming in a pool for &#39;entertainment&#39;? Why are the children involved at all? Why does them being in the pool seem to be some sort of incentive or condition that is being met?</p>

<p>The inclusion of the children without mention of other children and also the target audience is what doesn&#39;t line up. There is really no reason to include the children, yet they seem to be putting them in the center of it all. That is what&#39;s concerning.</p>

<p>Also, look at the reply to the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walter Jones is known in american politics to be the extreme example of a &#39;do-gooder&#39; or a principled man. By saying he passes the &#39;Walter Jones&#39; test, he means there will be no doubt on his character. How is that a logical response?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t thought about the Luzzatto email in a while.  That&#39;s what originally caught my attention about pizza gate.  For the first time though, I am wondering if it isn&#39;t specifically talking about an actual pool.  I thought it seemed creepy enough, but now I&#39;m thinking it might be lightly hidden code words.  Maybe pool refers to an outside building that&#39;s not typically heated?  Or maybe it refers to a building/structure and &quot;heated&quot; means proper security is in place to safely &quot;swim&quot;?  Or referring to live and uncut, maybe this specific ring only lets you &quot;swim&quot; if it&#39;s broadcasted, so in the pool means the kids are (shudder) available, and heated is the comms/video equipment ready to roll?  Not being familiar with that world I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a hundred possible interpretations, but I can definitely see it being either creepy if it&#39;s literal, or even worse coded</p>

Everything in that e-mail is very easily explainable, so easily explainable that if shown to a person with no prior knowledge of the matter they wouldn&#39;t think anything of it. This e-mail is the biggest example I&#39;ve seen in a long time of people starting with a conclusion and making connections based on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is clear is that this woman speaks in a very objectifying manner towards her step-grandchildren in a way that many parents find appalling. I could not write that email like she did - there were too many things that make me stop and go WTF as a parent. </p>

<p>1) my children are not going to swim on a cold day as &#39;entertainment&#39; - even jokingly - for a bunch of people they don&#39;t know. they had to be introduced by full name and age, which means they&#39;ve never met these people before</p>

<p>2) The community of the gathering were all political folk. Why no mention of other children? Building on that, why are the children even involved? Is it normal for a bunch of adults to seemingly center their evening around some children swimming in a pool? Why not get some good wine and skip the kids?</p>

<p>3) Why do the kids need to be in the pool &#39;for sure&#39;? The language seems to put some sort of incentive or condition on whether the children will be swimming. Also, they are advised to dress warmly - again a sign that they are really focusing on the swimming pool. This is strange for a bunch of adults IMO.</p>

<p>4) Bonnie is only playing &#39;uber&#39;. If she was staying, she would have said that the kids were coming along with Bonnie, and not referred to her as a taxi. So where are the kids&#39; parents in this? I don&#39;t think i&#39;d be okay with my children being watched by a bunch of strangers without me around. Even that is very strange to type out. Get my point?</p>

<p>And I thought I‚Äôd share a couple more notes:
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be
Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and
almost 7) so you‚Äôll have some further entertainment, and they will be in
that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun,
and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever
attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so
we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>

I honestly thought even last night Luzzatto was an obvious pedo but all it took was listening to someone read the email and blog headline outloud for me to realize how innocuous this might be.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you why. When Pizzagate was first reported, I was a believer. I bought into the codewords and the hidden meanings, all of it. It seemed to make sense, and more than that I wanted to believe it because it was a fascinating conspiracy. </p>

<p>However, the more I looked into the, the less things made sense. The code words weren&#39;t actually part of an FBI document, that was only the symbols. The comment wasn&#39;t &#39;dominoes on pizza or pasta&#39;, it was cheese or pasta, in an email that was referencing a cheese platter gift they received. Each little piece of evidence, examined on it&#39;s own individual merits, just didn&#39;t hold up.</p>

<p>&#39;But look at the mountain of evidence as a whole&#39;, supporters would say, &#39;There&#39;s so much there&#39;. But each bit of evidence, on examination, came down to either obvious jokes taken out of context, distasteful or shocking art, and a large amount at the end of the day was a simple dislike for homosexuals.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just a matter of motivation, it&#39;s a matter of knowledge. Most of the conspiracies on this board I find interesting, but I don&#39;t know enough about them to comment with any confidence. However, I was here from the beginning of Pizzagate and read about it as it came out and developed, so it&#39;s a topic I feel confident enough to speak on.</p>

<p>There is also a whole lot of misinformation and logical fallacies that get thrown around on this topic. For example, and this is what you are hinting at but don&#39;t seem to have the courage to directly say: If you are skeptical about pizzagate, people call you either a pedophile apologist or a shill. This is so obviously and painfully illogical, because it&#39;s obvious to anyone who remains objective that someone being skeptical or refuting pizzagate /can&#39;t/ be a pedophile apologist if they truly, honestly believe that PG is fake. </p>

<p>The other big accusation is &#39;shill&#39;, which I find supremely arrogant. You have to have your head pretty far up your own ass to assume that no one could legitimately disagree with you on this topic, that you have to be paid to take an opposing view. Only slightly less insulting is the almost as common accusation that anyone who doesn&#39;t believe in Pizzagate hasn&#39;t done their research. They just simply refuse to believe that someone could have seen all the same material but come to a different conclusion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where we&#39;re different. I can legitimately understand why someone could read all of this and believe in Pizzagate, especially with all the misinformation that gets tossed around in these threads. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a shill, or some other nefarious motivation, for believing differently than me, I just think you&#39;ve come to the wrong conclusion. Are you able to extend the same compassion to me?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Do you really think your little bullshit dance here is fooling anyone?
 Of course you didn&#39;t directly call me a shill, because it&#39;s against the rules and you&#39;re a coward. However, I&#39;ve seen you elsewhere in this thread, when one user said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shills and controlled opposition here are REALLY stepping up their game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when someone else called people shills, you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>especially when they have given themselves a 100+ upvote advantage on the top 5-10 threads... it&#39;s clear as day when you look at the effects.
I mean, how is this a topic so many people are willing to put huge amounts of time into? The comments were often long and wordy, so who&#39;s spending hours of their day defending random people from being pedophiles? Many of the accounts that were top replies had massive amounts of replies in each thread all the way down - again, showing a huge commitment to providing a narrative on the comment thread. It&#39;s all very obvious. Not hard to see at all. It&#39;s sad tho.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems like you think people who are &#39;motivated&#39; are doing so for less than honest reasons. Your little disingenuous tapdancing around the issue here tells me everything I need to know about how intellectually dishonest you are, and that I don&#39;t need to waste my time responding to you, because an honest conversation is not part of your agenda.</p>

<p>I am allowed to be suspicious. This is a woman who spoke of her granddaughter as someone that could be watched &#39;live and uncut&#39; on her private blog. She has a real way with words when it comes to her step-grandchildren (she bears no blood relation). Its my prerogative to be suspicious.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem.  These allegations have life-long repercussions.  There is no &quot;coming back&quot; from false allegations of pedophilia.</p>

<p>You&#39;d better have some bulletproof evidence before you start lobbing this accusations about.  And I&#39;m not talking about instagram photos or artwork that you personally find distasteful, or language from e-mails that you connect post facto to a list of &quot;codewords&quot; from 4chan.</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m going to be on here... hammering the pizzagate investigators, and hopefully shaming you into changing your ways.</p>

<p>See you around!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I am calling for is investigation by those who are qualified to do so. Anything more is your own projection - I haven&#39;t initiated a witch hunt on anybody. This lady could also get in front of this in some way too, but she&#39;s decided to completely ignore it (which is fair).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my fault this lady seems to use very objectionable language in regards to her step-grandchildren. The email roused suspicions because of the strange language within it. Her blog was discovered and once again the language was very questionable. I think that is worth looking into.</p>

<p>The problem with this subject is that we have seen huge amounts of corruption and failed justice, so people are more motivated to do their own research. There is nothing wrong with that - compartmentalizing community well-being to strictly the authorities is how you create a police state.</p>

<p>Frankly, I feel like having people who do really strange things and show questionable behavior to have to answer some questions and clear investigation is a small price to pay to stop child abuse. At some point, we can&#39;t give everyone the benefit of the doubt. You are being reckless by not allowing for critical thought and reason - you are reacting emotionally and you are motivated to perpetuate the darkness rather than shine light on it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real problem here. You are trying to obscure the truth rather than illuminate it. Think about what you&#39;re doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, first off, thanks for the respectful response.  I apologize for the name calling earlier in the thread, and I&#39;ll refrain from it going forward.</p>

<p>My whole problem with Pizzagate is:  From the very beginning, it was a foregone conclusion, and all of the so-called &quot;evidence&quot; was lined up to arrive at that conclusion.</p>

<p>There is literally nothing on that web site that would suggest pedophilia if you didn&#39;t stumble upon it looking for clues of pedophilia.  There are <em>thousands</em> of mommy and grandma blogs out there that have similar content... but you&#39;re singling out this woman because you have already arrived at the conclusion that she is pimping her grandkids out to the DC elite.</p>

<p>That is <em>incredibly</em> messed up.  These aren&#39;t harmless allegations that you&#39;re throwing around.  These accusations will be there for everyone to read 10, 20 even 30 years from now.  Whenever these kids google their names, they will see the abhorrent shit that you (yes, you... you&#39;re not just &quot;asking questions&quot;) posted about them.</p>

<p>So if you have hard evidence that Tamara Luzzato is/was pimping out her grandkids to the DC elite, then I think you should go to the police.  If you don&#39;t, I think you should tread lightly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to say how much I appreciate this, and agree with it. You&#39;re a far better man than I am for not letting your eyes roll right out of your skull at &quot;You are being reckless by not allowing for critical thought and reason - you are reacting emotionally&quot; ;)</p>

<p>I am sure sometimes it feels very much like you&#39;re banging your head against concrete and screaming into the abyss in one of these exchanges. Do know that, while it&#39;s unlikely that you will be able to get through to this one individual, others out there do read and greatly appreciate your words.</p>

<p>On topic: In addition to the irrevocable harm a spurious child-abuse accusation does cause, I do believe that a significant amount of elite child abuse does occur in this world, and that all this fanciful critical thought-free moral panic does is make it <em>more</em> difficult to get serious attention focused on it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad that you don&#39;t enjoy raising your kids, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that a great many people do enjoy watching kids play in a way that has nothing to do with sex. Do you dispute this? you seem to be trying to argue both sides of the issue at the same time. So, let&#39;s actually get your belief out there, I think that would help this along. I think it&#39;s perfectly possible and natural for people to enjoy watching children play, even if those children are not their own. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? </p>

<p>Pedos like to watch kids, water is also wet and up is the opposite of down. Do you have any other perfectly obvious and irrelevant truths you&#39;d like to share? It&#39;s irrelevant because while pedos do like to watch kids, so do a great many other people for reason that have nothing to do with sex. So, enjoying the antics of children isn&#39;t in any way diagnostic of pedophlia.</p>

<p>By the way, no I don&#39;t actually believe that you&#39;ve encountered people touching themselves and watching kids at the park. Surely you placed them under citizens arrest, or at the very least got some good cellphone video of their face that you could use when filing the police report? I mean, surely you must have done this, just &#39;chasing them off&#39; as you said you did would have left the children at horrific risk. </p>

<p>No, you replied to my comment. We&#39;re talking about the issue you replied to, or we&#39;re not talking at all. </p>

<p>Because whipping people up into an emotionally charged frothy witch hunt is neither an effective way to uncover the truth, nor enact positive change. All this hysteria is blind to critical thought and is only going to delay people taking the issue of elite child abuse seriously. </p>

<p>of course not, you idiot. the fact that you are writing out essays trying to make a point like that is kind of ridiculous. you should get some help man. You are putting words and arguments into peoples mouth they never made or even inferred. </p>

<p>Frankly, I think you&#39;re the one to worry about here. Look how much energy you are putting into accusing me of being a pedophile (which frankly I will be bringing up to a mod - rule 10).  I don&#39;t have blogs talking about my kids &#39;raw and uncut&#39;. I don&#39;t invite my kids to pool parties full of adults they don&#39;t know and no other kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been writing out essays trying to engage with you because I think this is an important subject, but you do everything possible to not actually engage is the discussion. Just affront about what you didn&#39;t say and didn&#39;t mean as you dance around.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that you agree that there are non-sexual and valid reasons to enjoy watching children play. Given that, wouldn&#39;t you also agree that it isn&#39;t suspicious to find children playing entertaining? As we both agree that both pedophiles and non-sick people enjoy watching children play.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve got to wonder why it is that you ate pushing this point as suspicious when you admit that it is normal to enjoy the antics of children. How do you square that? Where is the sense? </p>

<p>And no, don&#39;t try and spin off into an unrelated point. I&#39;m talking specifically about the &#39;entertainment&#39; part. Each point must be evaluated in isolation, you people never understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you have to know a child well to be comfortable enjoying their play? I don&#39;t personally like the energy of children all that much, but I have enough exposure to know that one screaming playing group of kids is much like any other. I very much enjoy watching dogs play even if I don&#39;t know the dog. Because it&#39;s cute, whimsical, fun. Do you find that suspicious? How are kids very different?</p>

<p>When bringing new people over to someone&#39;s home for the first time, it&#39;s pretty standard to let the home owner know who you are bringing so they know what to expect. With children, their age is a rather reliable indication of temperament. Another thing that it is polite to inform someone off when coming to their home. (this is the sort of explanations that come to a mind that isn&#39;t poisoned by confirmation bias)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crib website was only found after the creepy email was uncovered... it&#39;s a part of the trail of crumbs, so it&#39;d be stupid to just completely discount it. What is clear is that this woman speaks in a very objectifying manner towards her step-grandchildren in a way that many parents find appalling. I could not write that email like she did - there were too many things that make me stop and go WTF as a parent. </p>

<p>1) my children are not going to swim on a cold day as &#39;entertainment&#39; - even jokingly - for a bunch of people they don&#39;t know. they had to be introduced by full name and age, which means they&#39;ve never met these people before</p>

<p>2) The community of the gathering were all political folk. Why no mention of other children? Building on that, why are the children even involved? Is it normal for a bunch of adults to seemingly center their evening around some children swimming in a pool? Why not get some good wine and skip the kids?</p>

<p>3) Why do the kids need to be in the pool &#39;for sure&#39;? The language seems to put some sort of incentive or condition on whether the children will be swimming. Also, they are advised to dress warmly - again a sign that they are really focusing on the swimming pool. This is strange for a bunch of adults IMO.</p>

<p>4) Bonnie is only player &#39;uber&#39;. If she was staying, she would have said that the kids were coming along with Bonnie, and not referred to her as a taxi. So where are the kids&#39; parents in this? I don&#39;t think i&#39;d be okay with my children being watched by a bunch of strangers without me around. Even that is very strange to type out. Get my point?</p>

<p>The WL email also used the phrase &quot;transporting&quot; when talking about the ubering of the kids.

    <div class="md"><p>So, you swat your child on the behind in the grocery store and someone calls the police.  The police will investigate you for child abuse, whether or not it actually occurred, just based off of the complaint that someone said you were abusing your child.  So, theoretically this should be no different.  There are millions of people who are suspicious about this, why not actually investigate to confirm or debunk the allegations?  I agree that confirmation bias can cause one to see what one wants to see, but there has to come a point where coincidences aren&#39;t just coincidences anymore.  IMO, this is one of those instances, to use their own turn of phrase on them, if they have done nothing wrong, they have nothing to be scared of.  At this point, until it is addressed, they (pedo punks) will have to endure the scrutiny (if they are innocent) and the wrath (if they are guilty) of the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Celebrity interviews. Are you willfully ignoring the reality of the world in order to further your agenda? Raw and uncut is a term that originated in the film industry, because the film they were showing was literally not cut, as cutting the film was the methodology for editing. It then later moved to and was popularized by tabloid magazines boasting &quot;raw and uncut&quot; interviews with various celebrities. Finally, it&#39;s a common phrase on animal planet for their shitty dangerous animal shows where all the action is &quot;raw and uncut&quot;.</p>

<p>You can push this bullshit world view all you want, but &quot;raw and uncut&quot; is not even remotely as popular in pornography as it is in non-pornographic media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanists are political operatives who use their secret societies called skull and bones to wage wars and push their satanic ideologies on a compliant unsuspecting population. Awareness is growing and it become very dangerous for those pushing ignorance to the general public. The rabble can be very violent and vicious against the luciferian elites when they find out the underdealings committed by theses satanists cults. Evil is evil no matter what label you try to stick on it. Illuminati, reptilian, demon, satanist, psychopath, who cares? The result is the same inhuman operatives who use power to destroy humanity. </p>

<p>What deeply concerned me were the top comments trying to justify and debunk the whole email and more specifically, Tamera‚Äôs blog called ‚ÄúEvie‚Äôs Crib‚Äù. It seems like this is a recurring theme in Pedogate related threads. There is a group active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is actively trying debunk Pedogate by pointing out irrelevant information about the subject being discussed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rjx82/wikileaks_podesta_email_discusses_children_in_a/dl5qawx/?context=3">This comment</a> in the thread linked above is a prime example of this. He shows some of the blog posts which are innocent, not mentioning anything actual pizzagate researchers have pointed out.</p>

<p>Yes, I showed &quot;some of the blog posts which are innocent&quot;. In fact, that&#39;s almost all the blog posts which were archived. <a href="http://archive.is/Yo82y">Here is another batch.</a></p>

<p>If you have links to any that are <em>not</em> innocent, show them now. Oh, right. There aren&#39;t any.</p>

<p>It looks like I&#39;m the one who is trying to link to the complete evidence and you&#39;re the one who is posting manipulative, misleading, out-of-context fragments.</p>

<p>People started to investigate Tamara and found her blog, Evie‚Äôs Crib. First of all, the entry text to the blog is rather weird. ‚ÄúFor a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not Tamara&#39;s blog. If you had actually looked at in closely, you would have seen that it&#39;s run by Evie&#39;s father. And you would have seen that he uses a lot of humor in his posts. The tag line is clearly meant in a humorous way.</p>

<p>So because she enjoys sitting upright so much, we got her a fancy new chair, and she likes it (about as much as she likes anything anyway).</p>

<p>Its pretty hilarious to watch her in it, and eventually she seems to sort of slump to the side when she tires out.</p>

<p>Elisabeth was in town last week and stopped by for a meeting with Evie. Afterwards they posed for this photo-op.</p>

<p>In other news, Evie attends her first Seder tonight. She confided in me that she is sad that she isn&#39;t able to eat gefilte fish yet, but is sure she will like it next year. </p>

<p>One issue we have been dealing with is her sleep regression: she is actually sleeping LESS now than she used to. She isn&#39;t crabby really, she just doesn&#39;t sleep. we will keep you posted.</p>

<p>Why the fuck would anybody even think that &quot;EWB&quot; is something disturbing? It&#39;s the initials of a friend who stopped by to see the new baby.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all the ones I could find.</p>

<p>So, for the ones we could check out, nothing sinister is going on. You are spreading out-of-context innuendo again.</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped and really considered that you might be wrong?</p>

<p>Call me anal and a protective mother all you want but the behaviour of parents like that woman is abusive for an obvious attempt of using her child as a commodity and in this particular case - for way more nefarious reasons.</p>

<p>And tbh I personally don&#39;t really know what to do about it because as we&#39;re finding out, child protective services are just as bad in using children as commodities to be bought and sold or &#39;hired&#39; out and passed around for whatever purposes.</p>

<p>CPS agencies receive funding and I believe commissions for &#39;caring&#39; for children at risk and foster &#39;carers&#39; receive money for each child they care for - it&#39;s a massive child trafficking racket.</p>

<p>As such, the only thing I can think of is to publicly expose, name and shame the individuals partaking in such practices. In the end, what happens to the children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you think it&#39;s normal to consider kids you have never met and don&#39;t know the parents of as entertainment for a dinner party?</p>

<p>Has that happened to you before? Have any of your friends invited you to a dinner party with some children swimming as entertainment?</p>

<p>The people invited to the party did not have children nor did they know the children who were invited. They admit it will be a cold night, yet the pool and the children still seem to be a focus.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they just skip the kids if this was a political get-together? Why not just get a few bottles of wine and enjoy yourself in other ways?</p>

<p>I am allowed to be suspicious. This is a woman who spoke of her granddaughter as someone that could be watched &#39;live and uncut&#39; on her private blog. She has a real way with words when it comes to her step-grandchildren (she bears no blood relation). Its my prerogative to be suspicious. She hasn&#39;t done a good job of dispelling my interest either.</p>

<p>Honestly im not sure. Im not convinced that this was part of a plan to seize guns, but it is deeply troubling.</p>

<p>Not seize guns in one fell swoop.  To push it and accelerate it, but not all at once.  When folks said Obama was coming for your guns...he was coming to limit gun ownership...to marginalize it....to tell you what kind of stock you can have, or how many bullets you could have in your magazine.</p>
