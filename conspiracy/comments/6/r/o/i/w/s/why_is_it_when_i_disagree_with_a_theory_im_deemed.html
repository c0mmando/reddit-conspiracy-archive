    <div class="md"><p>Off the top of my head, I don&#39;t believe 9/11 was a set up. I think it happened at an opportune time and many politicians used it as a casus Belli to invade the middle east. What I do find odd is that Saudi Arabia wasn&#39;t denounced or invaded since most of the hijackers were Saudis and the Saudi government have been shown to fund and aid ISIS affiliated groups and personnel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess that the reactions which you have received in the past were due to the presentation of the ideas you now shared, not so much the ideas themselves. I thought that this was perfectly reasonable, and though I might not take the time to engage with the fine points myself simply because I have already done so many many times and came to a different understanding, I am sure that there would be people here who would be willing to have those discussions with you :) </p>

<p>Would you perhaps be willing to give us a specific example which you had in mind when you made this post? It&#39;s hard to say for certain why you were dealt with harshly, without a bit more to go on. </p>

<p>Regardless, we are all glad to have you among us! If anything, the act of debating in earnest increases everybody&#39;s awareness of key issues, and I trust in the conclusions and discernment of this sub enough that I can rest easy knowing that the information we most desperately need to be spread will stand on its own if allowed to be discussed fairly by two level-headed individuals :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because so many bots and shills post opinions we have debunked repeatedly that it&#39;s frustrating.</p>

<p>Not to accuse you of that bc I have no idea your opinions.</p>

<p>Not to mention this:  imagine going into a party or a coffee shop and saying shit you&#39;ve been trained extensively to say to sway others to believe lies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disingenuous, it&#39;s shitty, and it damages our children&#39;s futures bc the truth isn&#39;t being revealed.</p>

<p>The deep state knows we have them outed.  They can throw attn on Trump all they want but <em>they are the problem.</em></p>

<p>So arguing these unproven and fully made up points is annoying.  The proof is In the Wikileaks, and the people who are being paid to be all Trump all the time are flat out unproven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I dunno what to say.. If there&#39;s one common thread that ties together all conspiracy theorists, it&#39;s our ability to perceive patterns. We saw the pattern of manipulation <em>first</em>, and then began to theorize the who and why of it all. That we are shilled is practically beyond question at this point. </p>

<p>I can certainly see the allure in thinking otherwise, though, and I don&#39;t fault you for choosing to do so. :) It was a much nicer world, when there weren&#39;t shills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Major corporation and political groups hire public relations firms who handle their online public presence. They very much care about public perception. Also I would suspect that it is much cheaper to manipulate public perception online than it is on traditional media venues. This is standard operating procedure for publicly traded companies where public perception can literally add value or diminish the value of your stock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people here are used to not being challenged. They probably stick to subs where everyone agrees on everything. So when Simone disagrees with them they are like oh fuck. Better call this dude a shill and avoid debating someone who might make some good points. I get called a shill every single day. I also get private messages that ask me how I sleep at night. </p>

<p>At the end of the day it&#39;s good for you guys to have people that challenge you here. Nobody would learn anything if this place was a circle jerk. </p>

<p>Remember back when regular users thought of themselves as a part of this sub? I remember.. :( Seems like there&#39;s a lot more &quot;all of you conspiracy theorists&quot;, and &quot;you people here&quot;, etc, being thrown around lately. Remember that unity is everyone&#39;s goal! If you see friends where you now see a group of idiots, it will change the way you write, even if the subject matter is the same. Try it out sometime! It feels really good, too, whereas being all fighty all the time kind of sucks. :D</p>

<p>I wish you well, friend! </p>
