       This was a time in history when a lot of people were writing and a lot of stuff survives. Why then is there only photos ever used as evidence?

       you aren't going to the like the answer but its a simple one. Truth is we do have accounts of major catastrophic events throughout the 18th and 19th century. One proposed theory is that all those cataclysms actually occurred all at once. lotsa people died and anyone writing or documenting the event wouldn't be documenting it on a global scale only locally. if you read the op i linked to i go into details on how basically upwards of 75 percent of the population was some kinda serf or slave or prisoner  with no education at all. All of a sudden everyone was "free'd" and re educated. these reeducations schools are well documented. look at the art work of Francisco Goya after 1816 look at what he's documenting. so much mud everywhere. we have to come to terms with the facts that archives have been falsified and there was next to no one around to question it.

       Could I ask what years this cataclysm was then? Because if we're talking pre 1816 by anymore than a few years I can't buy it because of Napoleon and the entire continent of europe at war

       Some researchers discuss the possibility that wars were also fabricated to cover for the destruction that happened during that cataclysm. napoleon= Apollyon= the destroyer. I think 1816 is a good approximate date.

       But fabricating the napolenic wars is impossible, they were absolutely enormous plus there's archeologival evidence for it.

       1816 on its own? Like all in that year?

       theres evidence that there was fighting of some kind. In my opinion its too much to assume we have the full story on who was fighting who and what the true motivations would have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       you may find it interesting to know that there are 200+ parallels between the the event surrounding the life of napoleon 1 and 3 suggesting that neither of them were who we think they were

       bottom line is i wasn't there i don't know for sure but its always good to go back and look at the evidence with new perspectives in mind.

       There's evidence of a huge conflict across all of europe. So every single person writing at the time and just after wad lying? Have you researched this period for who was fighting who and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I can't read russian, Napoleon III probably intentionally tried to make himself like  Napoleon I, just like whenever France had a revolution they put the flags in the same places, raised the barricades in the same position etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like Napoleon crowned himself as Charlemagne did

       I cant address your "points" because they are too broad. We need to look at these alleged writings individually and see if our modern interpretation holds up when we consider the new information that this thread is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are there 200 plus straight up parallels between these two mens lives  and their so called deeds there are dozens of parallels between the life of napoleon and the myth of Perseus. it's starting to seem like they are all based on the same basic outline.

       Was everyone writing lying? To claim that is astonishing and ridiculous frankly.

       again you are asking me if people are lying in some hypothetical writing you would actually have to have the piece of writing in front of us to decide if its credible or if it resembles propaganda. what is propaganda if it's not state sponsored lying?

       'Some', so all 33,000 (ish) letters of napoleon alone, the papers, orders of the day, army documents, numerous diaries, letters to wellington, letters to the admiralty. And this is a tiny, tiny amount of the available literature (you'd also have to make up all of the buildings after the event). So do you truly think that this is credible?

       so you don't see buried buildings across northern europe. When they made the glass pyramid at the louvre they didn't uncover pristine rooms that they had no idea were even there? nothing weird about the crumbling buried churches in the middle of siberia with fine brick walls 7 feet thick in regions with no industrial history at all? these churches have no fire place... how they keep warm...Its not weird that at some point in the 19th century just about every city even those that were majority stone buildings burned to the ground or experienced some other catastrophe and had to be re built?

       Same as the burning of the Library of Alexandria, likely the knowledge and text was suppressed/destroyed, it is obvious if you look into it that there is something more to it.

       Your debating a theory on a guy asking for material so he can read it up, how fucking stupid are you? Your trying to debate someone, who is trying to look into it themselves, your either a shill, or your a person who wants to argue with random people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked for material to be presented to me, why are you arguing with me when

        this post

       is by someone presenting the theory, not asking for material to research it themselves.

       That's why I made the thread.

       Besides trying to instigate a conversation based upon the fact that you want to refute a theory that I am just learning about and curious about, what the fuck are you trying to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I requested something specific in my thread, and you are technically digging/instigating, you did not answer appropriately and now your trying to project that I am upset, very foolish.

       If you have questions, or want to refute something, make your own thread, your targeting someone in the process of researching, this is a payed tactic and is disgusting and pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your original comment is also being upvoted, which means there are multiple people with you, trying to project that this is right, but it is not, its a very blatant and horribly versed payed troll tactics.

       There's evidence of a huge conflict across all of europe. So every single person writing at the time and just after wad lying? Have you researched this period for who was fighting who and why?

      <p>
       Also I can't read russian, Napoleon III probably intentionally tried to make himself like  Napoleon I, just like whenever France had a revolution they put the flags in the same places, raised the barricades in the same position etc

       'Some', so all 33,000 (ish) letters of napoleon alone, the papers, orders of the day, army documents, numerous diaries, letters to wellington, letters to the admiralty. And this is a tiny, tiny amount of the available literature (you'd also have to make up all of the buildings after the event). So do you truly think that this is credible?
