        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By the way.
Although all the bigfoot stuff is usually laughed off as a joke from the 70&#39;s there have in fact been a hug e number of sightings on camera with the wide use of cell phones just as you would expect.  Of course video is also easier to fake now but some new footage is convincing . Again if the beings are real then one would expect more to have been captured on vidoe from phones and that has happened.</p>

<p>Additionally a couple of groups actually go looking for them in america high country. One thing they have discovered is extremely large trees bent and broken into shapes that appear to be  non random sign posts and structures. There are even videos of the creatures breaking large trees by themselves which would be hard to fake.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9nVFWv0uo#">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9nVFWv0uo#</a> </p>

<p>People even left food and gifts for them and recorded their calls.</p>

<p>So its eithe rgetting to be an elaborate big con business or its getting pretty well seriously docunented.</p>

<p>Look for &quot;colorado bigfoots hunter&quot; on youtube and it will also bring up some even better channels . Thats just the name i remember.</p>

<p>The thing that is interesting is the creatures all have very tall elongated heads and reddish hair.
For example look at the vidoe of this supoosed bigfoot baby when it looks up and you can seehow largehis head is. These are much taller creatures than silverback gorillas by the way. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-qWNO7B_nqU#">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-qWNO7B_nqU#</a>
And of course all cultures around the world have stories of these beings too.</p>

<p>Not that different really form the small human species found in the caves recently or the old giant bones the smithsonian had  etc etc.   And of course the neaderthal record which we now know partly survived as dna in europeans.</p>

<p>No reason to beleive subspecies wouldnt pop up and survive in isolation in modern times.</p>

<p>Video of a bigfoot carrying a baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8zv4WCCtrY">https://youtu.be/l8zv4WCCtrY</a>  sur eit coukd be a costune but the baby woukd be harder toake and the gait matched exactly the gait of the old 70&#39;s bigfoot film which many human anatomists declared was wrong for human legs .</p>

<p>There are LOTS of videos of sasquatch / bigfoot  now as you would expect with all the camera phones and ancillary evidence as well.  Could of course be a huge industry of fakers but right now there is the growing  evidence of more and more recorded sightings and its up to others to disoure it if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bigfoot is more ethereal or shapeshifter type in origin, so technology wouldn&#39;t be able to see. But he can be caught on real film on an old style camera since there is no electronic interference in the area.</p>
