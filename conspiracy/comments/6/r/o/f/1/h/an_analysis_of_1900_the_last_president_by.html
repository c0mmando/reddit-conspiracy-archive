       After reading through the Baron Trump 4chan and conspiracy posts, I realized I wanted to delve into the topic for myself. I didn’t just want to take anybody’s word for it, so I ordered a copy of “1900, Or: The Last President” by Ingersoll Lockwood. To be honest, I ordered this because it was only $5 on Amazon versus “Baron Trump’s Marvelous Underground Journey” which was about $25. Anyway, I also felt that this book had an eerie title, and I wanted to see if there was something actually deeper there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the foreword, Tarl Warwick writes, “Somewhere along the lines it seems Lockwood went past crafting a short political satire and delved into something deeper. Regardless, the semblance of this work to modernity is uncanny to a frightful degree – if he was indeed not practicing some sort of foresight, he tapped into the same unwittingly” (p.4).
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading the book, I am completely shocked. The entire time, I honestly kept thinking “this is boring”, and I have to admit the language made it difficult to get through. I stopped at chapter 5 a few weeks ago, and I did not pick it up until today. I honestly believe this book is predictive (or even something more!), but wait until you read the conclusion for it to really hit you! Here is a summary of each chapter. I saved you the trouble of reading it, but if you are not sure, order a copy yourself, and see if I am on the right track.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Summaries
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 1: Bryan is elected president of the United States, and mobs are breaking out in NYC. On page 7 it states, “The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob.” Interesting, Trump’s hotel is currently located on 5th Avenue. The chapter basically describes a battle between those who support the president “Bryan” and those who do not, and ultimately, the “city” is saved from the protesters (anti-Bryan) but not necessarily the republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 2: The next chapter transitions to Chicago. Bryan won the election by 24 electoral votes, and he is looked at as a savior and even God to many. It appears that the people finally feel that the rich man will fairly pay for his portion of happiness (p. 11).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 3: This chapter takes place after the election, nearing toward the inauguration day. While there are still many that oppose and fight against Byran, he has the love of the “Common People. They “were so dear to Mr. Byran, and who had made him president in the very face of the prodigious opposition of the rich men, whose coffers had been thrown wide open all to no purpose, and in spite too of the Satanic and truly devilish power of that hell upon earth known as Wall Street (p. 14)". I think the most important thing to take away from this chapter is how the “common man” feels a deep connection to Byran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anybody feel like this sounds exactly like the type of people Trump appeals to (btw it appeals to me).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 4: At the beginning of Chapter 4, the author notes that there is a strange prophecy that there would be a dawnless day. Well, that prophecy was fulfilled, and on March 4, 1897, the “Dawnless Day” occurred. The President was to announce the selection of his cabinet, and many said that this would ultimately prove that he was a “sell-out”, but apparently their apprehensions were misguided. The president chooses a strong cabinet, and most notably, he chooses Lafe
       <em>
        Pence
       </em>
       as secretary of agriculture. His inauguration speech, again, is aimed at the common people, and then he gives out executive order one – the immediate abandonment of the “gold reserve” and the gold and silver standard of the Constitution shall be resumed. People’s reactions were of shock, exhaustion, and sheer terror, especially those on Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 5: There are fifty thousand people on the streets of Washington without bread or shelter, and the president establishes camps and reserves rations for these “common people.” On page 20 it states, “the first act…was an act repealing the act of 1873…and opening the mints of the United States to the free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one, with gold.” This chapter mentions a bill for the admission of New Mexico and Arizona (interesting!), and a division of Texas of east vs. west. The chapter ends with the “long session” of Congress ending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 6:The beginning of this chapter notes somebody wanting to “move the usual adjournment of the holidays” and people are very upset. They are not willing to take a break – there is much to be done. They say there should be no adjournment until they can “emancipate” the Common People. On Washington’s birthday, the president makes an address on how great the country is doing – a lovely speech. At the end of the chapter, the president says that he hopes his epitaph will read, “Here lies the friend of the Common People.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 7: Things start to get out of control, and it states, “There began to be ugly rumors that the government was no able to hold the white metal at a parity with gold.” The Common People started to protest, and new taxes were put on the wealthy. Unfortunately, the government was powerless to stop the decline of the dollar. People began to hate the name of “silver”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 8 : In ’99, rioting broke out everywhere, especially in the north, and socialism and anarchism “found willing ears.” – that’s a little unnerving, isn’t it? The South seems to form great power, and they are extremely upset about the tax put on them, especially because the North is much richer. There are cries of treason and the republic is shaken at its foundations. The North then had to start to prepare for a second rebellion. The president was deeply troubled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 9: The rebellion had been squandered, but there was a new prophecy that the North, “rich with 100 cites”, would rise against the federal government. There would have be a revolution within a revolution. The North would have to fight or lose its power. (From my understanding, the South seems to be the Common People). The North wanted to separate itself from the union and from its own republic. How long would they have to wait?
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 10: Congress refused to adjourn over the holidays. The entire chapter centers around the final debate between the North and South. At the point the president is pale, and seems to be weak. The Speaker of the House says the president must resign. Then, the president speaks, and it seems almost godly – he has everybody back under his power for a moment! Out of nowhere, the capitol is struck by dynamite and destroyed (what a twist!). The republic was dead, and “it had died so peacefully, that the world could not believe the tidings of its passing away” (p. 43).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        CREEPY ENDING
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “As the dawn broke cold and gray, and its first dim light fell upon that shattered dome glorious even in its ruins, a single human eye (the all-seeing illuminati eye? Wtf?!) filled a gleam of devilish joy, looked up at it long and steadily, and then its owner was caught up and lost in the surging mass of humanity that held the Capitol girt round and round” (p. 43).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to admit that reading this was tough and boring, but the conclusion I am gathering from the book is that it is all planned. Perhaps the president has good intentions, and perhaps he does not. Who is to say who is bad in this book? The North or the South? It is interesting that is directly linked to the dichotomy today of the left vs. right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, the republic is destroyed, and the “one eye” (I have goosebumps) is pleased in quite the devilish way! Perhaps there really is a devilish power controlling us all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the lesson from this book is that even if we do all disagree on some major points, we need to unite in some way. They are constantly using this divide and conquer tactic, and it is undoubtedly working. When they divide us enough, they can crush our union, and then they can truly take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump causes much controversy, and maybe just maybe, he really is looking out for the welfare of the people, just as president Byron seems to be. However, it seems that some more malevolent force has put him into office so that he can ultimately divide the people. Whether or not Byron is really for the common people in this book is hard to say, but it might be so, and I would say the same is true of Trump. Is he really for the common people, or is he part of the ultimate plan? What is for sure is that the division is the most prominent part of this book: The Common people vs. the Wealthy (does this not sound familiar?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to order the “marvelous adventures” series next, and do an analysis on that if you are interested. Any commentary is welcome.
Please remember that I actually saved you some time and read the book, so please do not attack me!! 😊

       Take it personally as a good thing. Those raping the world are scared of you so they attempt to stiffle your speech. Your words have power. Dope post btw. So the country as we know it ends because the two sides fighting each other failed to realize Bryan wasn't actually looking out for either of them?
      </p>

       Interesting parallels. At this point how can we be sure of anything. Do you know if the Baron Trump books are in the same world-canon as this?

       They love to give hints about what they want, I have a creepy feeling WWIII is close. They do this in an almost religious way, the 6 million number of the holocaust comes to mind:

       The south was the common people and the president ended up taxing the north and they got pissed. They were rich and they did not want those taxes!

       I think the biggest culture class is the "common man" verses everyone else. Think of who voted for Trump. Trump appealed to a lot of the common type of people even though he is a rich billionaire.

       So this essentially equates to today's wealth vs poverty, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly enough, nonetheless, there was a time the north was more prosperous than the south; from the civil war until about the 1970s. Only in recent years has this began to reverse.  Now the south is seeing prosperity in their cities while northern states struggle with a much broader gap between wages and cost of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this possibly mean, over the years, we've done enough to change the plan (but obviously not stop it altogether)?  I know my mind is certainly contemplating all this now.

       Great thoughts. I definitely think it's something.

       I think the weirdest part is how the book seems to show the love for the president. A lot of see that Trump is hated on most of Reddit, but he really does have a strong following of people who truly love him, like the common people.

       Thank you for doing so much leg work, polkadotgirl. It is interesting to see some of the parallels to today. No matter what people personally believe, most of us can agree that the status quo is on life support, and big changes are likely on the horizon. I just hope those changes are for the benefit of mankind

       absolutely not if you mean a person who work!
but he appeals to the frustration of people, no matter who... he seems like the guy how every frustrated guy would like to be, the average joe in a position of abuse who likes petty revenge. Like a rapper.

       Of course he has an appeal to a lot of people. It that does make these books prophecy.  You shouldn't doubt what you feel and see. Whether you agree with him or not is a choice but he certainly has an appeal to many people. Not all of them ignorant common people.

       the one eyed is maybe referring to the AL-Dajall
Muslims believe there is a one eyed devilish man will rise up in a time of depression and claim that he is GOD, his signature in Islam is that he  is one eyed man.

       I am particularly interested in the fact that the Capitol is destroyed in the book:
      </p>
      <p>
       “As the dawn broke cold and gray, and its first dim light fell upon
       <strong>
        that shattered dome glorious even in its ruins
       </strong>
       ..."
      </p>
      <p>
       If the book is predicting future events, then the charges may have already been set:

       The book is a work of Victorian-era dystopian (depending on your perspective) political fiction best understood
       <em>
        in its historical context
       </em>
       rather than in an attempt to suss out Nostradamus-like predictions about our current political situation. Ingersoll Lockwood was most likely not clairvoyant, but rather a particularly astute political observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the note preceding the first chapter:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Chicago Platform assumes, in fact, the form of a revolutionary propaganda. If embodies a menace of national disintegration and destruction. Garret A. Hobart"
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some information about The Chicago Platform:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.sonofthesouth.net/democratic-party-platform.htm">
        http://www.sonofthesouth.net/democratic-party-platform.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The author imagines what the fate of the nation would have looked like 30-odd years later, had the Chicago Platform won the day in 1864 and George McClellan had won the presidency. Tl:dr of the Chicago Platform? It purported that the Union was primarily indispensable and that as such, the lawful institutionalization of slavery should be considered as an option to end the Civil War. Pretty horrific premise to spin a yarn around, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Last President is a quick and easy read for anyone with even a passing interest in American history or politics, particularly Civil War and Reconstruction-era. It is 49 short pages. The language is entirely approachable, and would have in the days before the Great Dumbing Down been considered about fourth grade reading level, maybe sixth. Don't be scared off from this one - read it for yourself, might take you an hour or two at most.

       Thought it had some weird parallels and this is a conspiracy sub.

      <p>
       Also it was just boring which made kind of difficult to sit through.

       So yeah. Not everything has to be extraordinarily serious all the time.

       I mean, you're right - this is a conspiracy sub, and as such your content is appropriate in my opinion. It's even fun, like a ouija board. But like that toy, it isn't to be taken seriously.

       Why are you driving people away from considering the primary source themselves, and thus drawing their own conclusions (isn't that this sub's mantra?) by giving them the mistaken impression that the text isn't completely approachable and that it's boring? This is dime-store novel quality stuff, not Milton. I weighed in on its length and reading-level. I found it a very quick and frankly,
       <em>
        interesting

       read.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate that so many readers of this sub who consider themselves politically-aware are also so painfully historically ignorant.

       I really do think there are some interesting parallels in the book and to today. Even if it isn't predictive, I feel we can draw some things from it.

       I was just being honest. To me it was boring. People can read it online at any time. I will be honest it is not a book I would normally pick up, so perhaps that is why it was challenging to me.

       People are busy. This is probably on a low list of their priorities. I do agree the book is free online so anybody can read it. Very few will.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I made my post I tried to quote from the text and be mostly objective. I even tried not to fully analyze the chapters and let people figure it out themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any time they can go back to the book to see if I'm misrepresenting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate you adding your commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I came off as aggressive is because I have been dealing with a lot of topminds people lately and it's very tiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes this book could be no more than historical commentary of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could be predictive in some ways. Could the US ever break out in civil war?

       True that. Wish more people would take the time. Though I had heard of the Chicago Doctrine, I learned a bit more about it this morning when trying to gain context for the book. It would give people some serious perspective on the Democratic Party and its history.

       No worries! It was definitely meant to be more light hearted since I honestly do not know in the end. I mean maybe there is truth that it was predictive...maybe not. I honestly would not know for sure, so I thought it would just be interesting if it related to anything happening today.

       And I did get defensive I'm very sorry for that. Just have been attacked a lot lately but I'll calm down : )

       My take on these similarities are that Trump and family being well read and aware of the name connections possibly even have played into some of these conclusions. If I had read such a thing maybe I would have named my child Barron and even built a building on fifth avenue. It doesn't mean the he is a demon. Perhaps on the other hand he is just very smart.

       So true. Fucking liberals are crazy. Conservatives are crazy. Extremism never works. Middle of the road is the way to be. Each side has its valid points. Something, someone is controlling things. But for what? For more money? To cause chaos, war, and profit from it all?

       When you scare the people through actions like Brexit and Trump, people end up accepting an otherwise crazy idea. Look at iliberals and illegal immigration. Look at British and the EU, all these things are pushing people towards a one government planet.

       Girl! Let me tell you, I 'm going to do a post talking about this if it's okay. I even found evidence of a female crucified during the time that Jesus would have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine Judas was her lover and picture her telling him to give her up thinking they wouldn't kill her. Why else would Judas kill himself? Why else was she worth 30 silver coins?

      <p>
       I would be appalled to discover that everything Jesus represented would be completely obliterated and then used as a tool to control the masses and commit atrocities. That, that would be the greatest sin of humankind.

       I'm still sick with fever and body pain but I will collect the information and present it in a few days. The spike I stated, is called a sedile and it was often pointed to create more pain.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        to sit on the cross.” Both Erenaeus and Justin Martyr describe the cross of Jesus as having five extremities rather than four; the fifth was probably the sedile. To increase the victim’s suffering, the sedile was pointed, thus inflicting horrible pain.

       Girl! Let me tell you, I 'm going to do a post talking about this if it's okay. I even found evidence of a female crucified during the time that Jesus would have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine Judas was her lover and picture her telling him to give her up thinking they wouldn't kill her. Why else would Judas kill himself? Why else was she worth 30 silver coins?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be appalled to discover that everything Jesus represented would be completely obliterated and then used as a tool to control the masses and commit atrocities. That, that would be the greatest sin of humankind.

       I'm still sick with fever and body pain but I will collect the information and present it in a few days. The spike I stated, is called a sedile and it was often pointed to create more pain.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        to sit on the cross.” Both Erenaeus and Justin Martyr describe the cross of Jesus as having five extremities rather than four; the fifth was probably the sedile. To increase the victim’s suffering, the sedile was pointed, thus inflicting horrible pain.
