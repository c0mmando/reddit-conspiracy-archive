<p>&quot;They already won. We&#39;re just sitting ducks at this point. They&#39;re too powerful!&quot;</p>

<p>Especially people who post this shit on this sub. Like, why the fuck are you even here then? Just checking in on how fucked we are from time to time? Fuck off..</p>

<p>Have a few laughs here and there. It&#39;s pretty funny when you really think about it. Kinda like a bunch of wimps and sad people found a way to exploit humanity, and honestly thought they could get away with taking over the world? Ha! It&#39;s classic comedy right there...what a group a truly sadistic and defective &quot;human beings&quot;. But remember, that&#39;s all they are; human beings. </p>

<p>One day we will look back at this whole thing, and teach our kids what we went through and what we dealt with. How sinister these people really were, and how much better our new lives are. A refreshed sense of optimism and the tree of liberty will start bearing it&#39;s sweet delicious fruits once again. </p>

<p>Peace to all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed for the most part. Cynicism in this sub is a disease. Negative attitudes and closed mindedness is rampant on r/conspiracy. Thankfully there are people here who keep open minds and don&#39;t shut others out for having a difference in opinion and theory.</p>

Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won&#39;t leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!
Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Positivity is critical, yes... and I wish people of this sub knew how they were aiding and abetting TPTB by posting defeatist sentiments. Half of the power of this group stems from acquiescence, or, merely granting them authority.  If everyone reclaimed their sovereignty it would be game over: quit drugs, don&#39;t go to war, get to know your neighbors, help the community raise good children... basic but powerful stuff. The solutions are so much simpler than we think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally have been a watcher on this forum for a while, I started rapping, and sliding in little bits here and there, music is the gateway to the people. At least for me, if we have enough people in enough different places, there is no way we can&#39;t be heard. Even if people don&#39;t listen if they hear it and subconsciously process it they will have an opinion on it one way or the other, maybe it will wake them up as many of us have been awakened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I COMPLETELY AGREE!! All my group of friends and my brothers friends are all waking up and spreading the word! </p>

<p>If we all did our part in telling our friends, we could make a HUGE change!! We can all reach this mass awakening faster if we push for it! </p>

<p>The world is so small and if we knew how connected all of our lives are, we could win! That&#39;s why they want us divided and watching nothing but TV. </p>

<p>Stay positive and spread the word!! To kids and adults and everyone!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t spend your time arguing with people either, their change will come, maybe not after one person tells them, but maybe after they hear it from others.</p>

<p>LOVE WINS! </p>
