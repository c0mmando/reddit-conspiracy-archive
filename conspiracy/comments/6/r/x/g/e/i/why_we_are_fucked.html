       The OPM hack of all federal employees past and present including even Applicants who never made it.
      </p>
      <p>
       21 million possible vectors to use
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single federal employee PAST and PRESENT data has been compromised and is being used against them. Why wouldn't it be? It's intelligence heaven
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe that was all apart of their plan. The "Trojan Horse" plan in motion
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the information an SF-86 contains and that information is/will be used to subvert the success of our country either Militarily, Politicly or economically
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think people understand how fucking devastating this is.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; This allows chinese companies to obtain blackmail intelligence on company owners in the west, or even lower-level people.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example with the data from the OPM hack, They can craft emails to federal employees - knowing their social security #s, and their exact payments amounts for their credit accounts (all info on the SF-86 ) and send an spoofed email titled "ALERT; your PenFed mortgage monthy payment is being reduced from 5,620 to 4,730.".
      </p>
      <p>
       How many federal employees will click that immediately thinking it's legit because they used information only you and that company would know? BAM malware installed. Easy peasy
      </p>
      <p>
       Signal Intelligence HEAVEN!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they got you and are collecting intel at a level that only HUMINT spy's could dream of!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        You get people to do things they don't want to do, things they would go to prison for if caught through FEAR via BLACKMAIL intel, That's how the powers that be run this shit
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       **With the OPM data Country's like China or Russia or Iran can now identify and target key government positions and also employees who would need to be compromised to successfully complete whatever operation they're running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Targets and even family members can be "hacked" though social Social engineering methods as I described or just any of the hundreds of CIA hacking tools now available**
      </p>
      <p>
       As a foreign country or entity at war with the United States once you Identify the corrupt/blackmail-able Government employees and depending on the level the employee is this can determine a lot of factors. Possibilities are endless
      </p>
      <p>
       or identify federal employees with pasts to hide. For example you could easily socially engineer a target to reveal information that may be a direct contradiction to what they listed on their SF-86 or you could investigate and find issues that may have been overlooked by a background investigation because of overburdened case load.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is find one contradiction that is made by an employee on their SF-86 and it's over and the employee knows it. Lying on a federal document is the sin of sins and not a forgivable
      </p>
      <p>
       See now easy they could convince/blackmail a target to divulge classified information even if it was against someone they support and like, truth is they probably did just that. Who knows
      </p>
      <p>
       OR hell even if your target is clean after combing though their life and they still remain un-blackmail able  with the targets SF-86 information you can even now easily plant things like Child Porn or Drugs in vehicles etc because you know where all targets live. Is this type of operation really that far fetched? I don't think is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can now see now easily it would be to force/bribe/blackmail that "CBP officer" at any of the various POEs to let a particular vehicle with that "dirty bomb" or a deadly "pathogen" or particular shipping container though a port that contains a nuclear device, all because you now have blackmail intel off the ying yang all the radiation detection devices, X-ray trucks that are used my CBP officers and agency's to detect these very things are now useless and with thousands of possible vectors someone is bound to crack and be the straw the breaks the camels back.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need is one Secret Service agent, one CBP officer, one FBI agent and you have 21 million possible vectors to mine off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for these reasons when TPTB are ready for the collapse it can and will be easily used to execute whatever event that will be used as a catalyst to start the collapse
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI There are approx 1-2 CBP officers or BP agents being arrested per month for conspiracy to allow vehicles of drugs or people to into the US. And that's just who gets caught... my point is they are there on the front lines it's just a matter of finding them
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility to compromise the enemy (western civilization) are endless if you really think about how many people we are talking about
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest question...How could you stop it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its Social engineering heaven when you have an SF-86 packet of information to use on all past and present employees of your enemy nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think you can hide from being targeted or tracked, think you could change your identity, get a new legal name etc ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope they also got the 5.6 million Fingerprint cards that are submitted as part of the security clearance process 
You're out the game, and I believe this was part of the their plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blackmail Tactic straight from the first FBI Director, Hoover
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hoover wielded enormous power as head of the FBI for 48 years, during which he is believed to have kept a file on hundreds of government officials and political leaders."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like that but on steroids!
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of a million scenarios in which this can be devastating for America
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what we have to face and there's no stopping it it's only a matter of time and I'm not even Red Team planner so I'm sure they have thought of way more shit
      </p>
      <p>
       We probably saw one of the biggest transfers of power in the history of America because of this and unfortunately it may not even be realized that the vector that allowed the variables that would be needed to be in place, all stemmed from this data leak
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, you're the "Deep State" you know the fiat QE party is mathematically certain  to come to an end might as well position yourself accordingly and even make it happens when you're most prepared to handle the change. But you would still be left with a huge problem..
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you defeat an Army of People who possess the
      </p>
      <p>
       knowledge, skills and abilities to defeat you.. if you don't know who they are
      </p>
      <p>
       This was all planed by the Trojan Horse Administration to transfer information/power to the globalist under the guise of a "hack"
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with NSA and CIA spy tools. Another transfer of power from a nationalist organization to a now Globally powered one.

       I would not be surprised if the Chinese now know more about the actual workings of the US government than Americans do -- because I've seen evidence of it.  You're not even mentioning the fact that US agencies are all still compartmentalized
       <em>
        except for DHS
       </em>
       which is basically a Mossad operation.  The writing is just right there on the wall.  The US really is toast.

       I think people need to consider the fact possibility that intelligence leaks, sensitive information being compromised may not just be coming from Trump opposition or hold overs from the previous administration but in fact from Trump loyalist who may be, being blackmailed to do so by a particular entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be why someone who supports Trump in every way gets removed from key positions and people are left wondering why..

       No, the Trump-supporters are getting removed from key positions by Deep State loyalists. Like McMaster colluding with Susan Rice to help Obama unmask people, and then firing all the Trump loyalists like K.T. McFarland, Michael Flynn and others (while keeping only Obama holdovers).
      </p>

       He just fired three more Trump loyalists this week.

       Phishing is serious business. I never click links in emails. I don't care if its my best friend sending it. Because the from address can easily be spoofed. Once people understand this it's hard to trust anything in emails. Just go find what your looking for on the Web or go directly to the website your trying to find.
