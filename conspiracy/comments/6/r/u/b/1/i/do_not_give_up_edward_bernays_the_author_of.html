        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The past few weeks have been crazy on this sub. I have never been attacked on here on all my years on Reddit like I have for the past 2 weeks or so.</p>

<p>However, despite those attacks, I have been able to discuss with so many awesome people - even those who disagree with me. </p>

<p>I see so many awesome posters here, and I think we need to continue to back each other up.</p>

<p>Also remember the techniques they use to slide threads:</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm</a></p>

<p>Shill? Troll? I don&#39;t care what they are - they are here to spread misinformation and disinformation and to make people feel weak.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m asking you do not give up. The other day I was feeling down, and I remembered that I know my true self and character - not them.</p>

<p>What we can do is understand their tactics. They understand how groupthink and social control works. We need to understand the tactics of these small but agressive groups.</p>

<p>It is information warfare. It is even spiritual warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey it&#39;s me.  :)</p>

<p>I hope that your encouragement helps others who are experiencing some of what you are experiencing.</p>

<p>I believe that mind control of the masses is an ancient art, which makes me deeply concerned how advanced they are now let alone all of the technology that can spread it.  Shilling and botting is a new form of this.  It clouds the truth, discourages us, and prevents deep connections from being made between people to name a few things.</p>
