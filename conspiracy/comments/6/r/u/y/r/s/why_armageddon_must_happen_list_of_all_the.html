       WW3 is just around the corner. In the Bible, The Almighty God of Israel promises to release great anger when this event occurs. A type of destruction that has never been witnessed before. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "real" Jews that the Holy Bible speaks of are in actuality the negroes that were sold in the transatlantic slave trade. Many people are waking up to this truth and even Hitler spoke of this fact during public speeches
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 28:68
      </p>
      <p>
       “And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       These people in Israel today claiming to be jews are prophesied in the book of Revelation also
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 2:9King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       King Solomon, a Hebrew Israelite, black man and the wisest man ever (if you believe in the Bible) reveals in the Bible all the nations of the world who hates God's chosen people and who are/were involved with their downfall. King Solomon reveals them in an excerpt from the Song of psalms
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalms 83:1
      </p>
      <p>
       A Song or Psalm of Asaph.
1Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.of Asaph: or, for Asaph
2For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
3They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
4They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
5For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee
6The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarites;
7Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
8Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tabernacles of Edom are the European Caucasians, the Ishmaelites are the Arab Muslim nations. Moab are the Chinese. Hagarites are  Africans nations as is Gebal. Ammon is Japan and Amalek are those fake Jews in Israel, the Khazars. Philistines are the Palestinians and Assur is a specific African nation that worked with the Chinese and Japanese to enslave Israelites.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these nations were heavily involved with the capture and bondage of the real Jews of the bible and here's what King Solomon himself wanted his God to do to these evil bastards
      </p>
      <p>
       Song of Psalms 83:13-18
13O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
14As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
15So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
16Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord.
17Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
18That men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This world is in serious trouble and if any of you or your family were in any way involved with the slave trade and have profited off the blood of God's chosen people, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes at all...

       You're right. Colour doesn't matter. But you know what does? Nationality!
      </p>
      <p>
       If I kicked you and your whole family out of your house right now and unto the streets to live like tramps and paupers, would that matter? If I stole your family name, your nationality and used up all of your family credit, whilst still living in your house, to benefit my children and my children's children and theirs after that, would it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it does. And that's exactly why the Messiah is returning. You guys need to read the Bible more. Who you refer to as Jesus Christ isn't coming back to clap hands and sing melodies you know?

       What does matter is that we all treat each other right. And people aren't doing that. Even the people of

      <p>
       There is no specific 'chosen people', we are all equal and we all need to get along and work together, not cut and divide each other. No people are without their fault. Over the centuries all 'peoples' have wanted to enslave and control each other. No one 'nationality' is exempt from this truth. Some won, some didn't. Some sold their own into slavery. The tower of Babel actually holds a great lesson for all.

       You're completely wrong. This is the Almighty God of Israel talking to the 12 tribes of Israel:
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 7:5-7King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hebrew Israelites are God's special, chosen people. Above ALL other people that walk on this planet! So, no, we're by no means all the same at all. So says the Almighty God. Or is he wrong?

       You gotta use Biblical scriptures to prove your points and not your own comprehension. Because they are null and void.

       That's something you'll have to take up with the Almighty God of Israel. Because he ordained it that way. The Hebrew Israelites are his chosen, special people, above all other people on the earth. The Messiah is returning so ALL you other nations respect this fact too. And you are going to respect it, or receive your judgement.

       When you've been waiting over 400 years for justice you'll surely know the meaning of torment. What does God say of his people who are waiting for his day of Armageddon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 14:11-12King James Version (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I sure can't wait for the big day. For that will be a great day of justice. You looking forward to it?

       What? How does that make sense, what you quoted was the tower of Babel. That literally talking about speech. It has nothing to do with everyone being the same. There is a rule, you have to have at least two precepts to match what you are saying in order for it to hold merit.

       I'll concur the world is closer to the great 3rd WW than it has been since the end of WWII but I've also been around long enough to know people have been claiming it's near all my life. There claims too have been based on scripture they were certain applied to current events. Thus I've reached the conclusion that yes, it is coming. Period. Maybe now, but probably not so I'll just prepare myself with the essentials in case I'm still around when it does and pray (to my God, not the manipulated one of The Holy Bible) for the best.
