<blockquote>
<p>The Trump campaign paid Parscale’s company more than $90 million during the course of the campaign, most of which went out the door for advertising and vendors.</p>

<p>He had over 100 people working in his San Antonio operation — digital and media operatives, writers, website builders and others</p>

<p>What do digital operatives do? I wonder...</p>

<p><a href="https://therivardreport.com/giles-parscale-success-breeds-a-brand-challenge/">https://therivardreport.com/giles-parscale-success-breeds-a-brand-challenge/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This presidential campaign was an amazing experience,” Parscale said. “I am going to continue to work for the president and into the 2020 election. I also am running America First’s digital operations.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm, what&#39;s America First and what are its digital operations?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.americafirstpolicies.org/media/trumps-outside-army/">https://www.americafirstpolicies.org/media/trumps-outside-army/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>America First gave a $3 million outside push to help get healthcare through the House. They ran TV, phone and digital in key districts</p>

<p>&quot;We strongly believe that for us to get the President&#39;s policy agenda passed we need to harness millions of voices.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harness millions of voices, hmm? I wonder what that is? Nah, but really, only liberals use paid commenters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More projection than IMAX.  Simply assume every accusation is a confession and it entirely makes sense.  </p>

<p>What I noticed is that normally left leaning reddit suddenly turned pro Trump, anti Democrat and pro right wing while suddenly spewing forth a barrage of accusations about Shillary bots and DNC propaganda and liberal media propaganda (which transformed to MSM media and ultimately &quot;fake news&quot;).</p>

<p>What I noticed is that one day you couldn&#39;t say a nice word about Clinton in r/politics without being downvoted to hell, nor a negative word about Trump without the same happening, nor a nice word about the DNC, nor speak negatively about the GOP without a barrage of comments about Clinton being the worst, the DNC being the worst, DWS, Podesta, etc.</p>

<p>This all very suddenly changed by an order of magnitude.  Over night.  And as they suddenly realized they were no longer in an overwhelming majority but in an overwhelmingly minority, posters who were pro Trump slowly leaked out of the sub.  Before Trump was even being sworn in people were started to bemoan that r/politics was extremely biased but in exactly the opposite direction to the very clear biases shown before the election.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I noticed.  I noticed that despite the talk of Shillary bots reddit suddenly became uncharacteristically pro RNC and anti DNC and anti liberal and that this changed to the extend where r/politics now has a reputation entirely opposite its pre election reality which was in itself completely at odds with the trends seen in all other earlier elections for that sub and for reddit.  And that this all more or less switched off very suddenly when the election ended with reddit trending back to normal at a very swift pace.</p>

<p>Just as if all the accusations coming from the pro Trumpers and the right were actually confessions about themselves all along, which in fairness perfectly fits their MO.</p>

<p>Yep, I was banned from r/politics for no reason during the primaries last year. I&#39;ve been banned from over 15 different politics-related subreddits despite not breaking any rules in them. </p>

<p>They use bans to censor, and until or unless r/conspiracy starts banning people like me, the shills probably won&#39;t be able to achieve a takeover here like they have in other subreddits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only pro-Trump posts are left out of contest mode they can (and often do) organize brigades to control not only the number of posts on the front page, but they can control the comments in those posts as well. </p>

<p>People complain about other subs brigading conspiracy, but I rarely see more than a handful of conspiracy related political posts against Trump in here per week.  When t_D brigades, they fill the whole page and it&#39;s obvious they do it to drown out the one post that is anti-Trump when that post is significant.  Like the recent one which showed that Trump&#39;s WH was likely colluding with Fox News. </p>

<p>This is a grossly put apocryphal comparison. Trump attacks those agencies only because he&#39;s being investigated by them. </p>

<p>On one hand, Kennedy was genuinely interested in putting american privacy before himself. His animadversions were aimed at every agency involved in American businesses, especially the Mossad. Coincidentally, the only President whom standed to the all-powerdul Mossad was also assassinated. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Trump is motivated by his status. He attacks the CIA, only to praise afterwards the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/23/remarks-president-trump-israel-museum">Israeli&#39;s and Saudi&#39;s services</a>. Nixon did also attack the CIA as Trump is doing. He would be a better candidate to fit your comparison.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t compare JFK to Trump. Just don&#39;t.</p>

<p>No you fuck tards, we aren&#39;t going to take your dumb tactics. They don&#39;t work here. The only reason your tactics &quot;appear&quot; to be working is bc the shills bought mod spots and its OKAYD By Reddit INC. the mods haven&#39;t flipped and the shills are pissed (hence the anti-mod posts... Really organic right?)</p>

<p>The real reason why shills are here is to silence our discussions... Why would CNN or WaPo go out of their ways to attack Reddit and its community&#39;s? Bc we have exposed them.. Simply by participating in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look, another &quot;Trump is the government&quot; line.  Since you seem to not understand how the US government works, here&#39;s some helpful information.</p>

<p>The president is in fact, not the government.  Today you&#39;re going to learn a lot!</p>

<p>There are three separate branches that make up the United States government; the president only being the chief executive of one of those.  Our founding fathers were smart enough to create two other branches for something we call &quot;Checks and Balances.&quot;</p>

<p>Our founding fathers realized that one man could not rule a nation, like King George III did (who they were at odds with at the time), so they added a congress to represent &quot;the people.&quot;  The congress is comprised of two separate houses, the senate and the house of representatives.</p>

<p>Now, many of our founding fathers were lawyers so they knew they also had create a high court, to rule on weather or not laws passed in congress followed the constitution.  This high court is what we call the &quot;Supreme&quot; court.</p>

<p>Because this is a nation of, by, and for the people, we elect our representatives and executive, and entrust that between the two they can agree on who should sit on the supreme court.  </p>

<p>However, there are appointees and hirings made by the branches that are not chosen by the people, beaurocrats to keep the machine turning if you will.  These beaurocrats run the most influential part of the US government and stay hidden in the shadows for decades, to include every single person in the &quot;intelligence community.&quot; </p>

<p>The intelligence community comprises what most now accept as the &quot;Deep State.&quot;  A nefarious group with untold power and wealth who believe it is in their best interest, and the interest of those with whom they deal, to keep &quot;the people&quot; in the dark as to what actually happens behind the scenes in our government.  They believe that morals and ethics have no part in their profession, and would sell out their grandmother if it was beneficial to them.  </p>

<p>This Deep State is connected to every major corporation in the United States, and has the ability to blackmail just about every single important American in both the private and public sectors.  The American people are waking up to this deep state and are sick and tired of them running it into the ground for their own gain.</p>

<p>The Deep State is suspected of assassinating a sitting US president, is known to have incited violent revolution in democratic nations such as Chile and Nicaragua among others around the world, is known to have operations in wich they use their media contacts to sway public opinion, and is generally extremely shady.</p>

<p>This Deep State corrupted our government to such an extent that the United States of America <em>actually</em> elected Donald Trump to be their warrior in Washington.</p>

<p>At first President Trump tried to play nice with the government and country in shambles that he inherited from his predecessor<em>S</em>.  But it has been shown that the Deep State is unwilling to play nice with the people&#39;s choice so President Trump has been attempting to isolate himself from those who make up the majority of the government who wish to see him, and through extension the people, fail.</p>

<p>So you see, no, Trump is not &quot;the government.&quot;  Today you learned.</p>

<p>It just tickles me when people edit their comments to complain about downvotes </p>

<p>What kicks over my giggle box is when redditors that mod &quot;anti-hate&quot; subreddits go out of their way to comment on other subreddits and say hateful things.  </p>

<p>Then when they get called out on it, they delete their offensive posts without so much as an apology.</p>

<p>To find out later that they also mod a sub about people editing their comments is the cherry on top of the hypocrisy whipped cream.</p>

<p>Have you asked admins as to whether brigades are coming from outside of reddit (as they would not only be able to see if it&#39;s true, but they could also know where it&#39;s coming from)?</p>

<p>I feel like this ability to claim &quot;offsite brigade! Lock/delete/contest mode/bans!&quot; has far too much potential for abuse. Some could argue it&#39;s already being abused.</p>
