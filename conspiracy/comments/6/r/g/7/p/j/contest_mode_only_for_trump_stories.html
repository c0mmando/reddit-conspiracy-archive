       Can we get some kind of criteria from the mods on what will cause a thread to get put into contest mode?  Because it seems to be happening more frequently, but also only for stories that are critical of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is it for making the front page and shifting it for r/all?  Because that doesn't seem to be the case since a lot of stories with more votes don't go to contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it for brigading?  Because that wouldn't match up either since many of the Seth Rich threads get brigaded by T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the criteria?  Or is it to be blatantly pushing pro-govt agenda?

       So did the mods just figure out how to shut out the shills and reengage the community? I feel like this is going to get the sub on track before the shills came hard alittle over a year ago.. Ahh the good days of r/conspiracy... And Reddit in general

       Nah, I dont see how it hinders discussion. It might hinder manipulations, but I see that as a good thing. Plus I dont see how it hides replies. You are able to expand on every comment.

       There are 244 comments. In a normal post I open a thread and immediately see all posts and replies, even ones that are heavily downvoted.

       In contest mode I see about 20 comments. I have to click "view replies" for each level of replies on a given post. Posts are shown with no discernible order.

       Censorship need not totally prevent you from commenting, just heavily discourage it. For example, voter ID laws and purging voter rolls. You can still vote, so long as you go through the long and tedious process of making sure you can still vote. But is it really worth your time?

       So your saying the censorship applies to your manipulations and that's why your upset? The only reason the randomization and collapse of comments might upset you is because you feel a reason to influence others. You are showing your motivations to shape others opinion.

       Is that not the fundamental goal of engaging in discourse? To influence others with one's own arguments? I can't imagine any other reason to comment on a reddit post... or for that matter, write or even speak at all.

       Sure, but when those influencers are being manipulated by bots or by something that isn't organic, shouldn't we have some sort of response? Do you allow the data to be corrupted by something you can manage or control? Contest mode doesn't hurt anything except the popularity of the comments in the thread. There is really no major downside except to people to whom influencing others is more important than just sharing opinion (like you opine for here). These are people who are motivated by the wrong things (money, power, etc.) and their annoyance with this tool is proof of that. They want to control the messaging, and when they can't, they know they will go back to their unhappy 'customer' and it will not go well for them.

       But a poster named MAGABot was posting irrelevant deflections, contest mode puts him in the same category as those commenting about the thread, how is that right?

       Haha u/Woots_67 has been around this sub quite some time and yet he's going into extreme negative imaginary Internet points... Wow I guess r/conspiracy is "changing" their opionions.. It would "appear" that way wouldn't it?

       Sort by new would solve that too. Contest mode flattens replies, jumbles the discussion to make it harder to browse, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorting by new would also mean brigading wouldn't matter because the post posters would just slide down to the bottom as new comments ping the top.

       Alright, maybe nothing.  But let's have it by default on every thread then and not be so one sided with it.  It's the blatant agenda/hypocrisy from mods that bothers me, not so much the actual view.

       The problem with that idea is that the should can just spam a shit load of comments so that the end result of the brigading is the same as regular mode, it has to be implemented after a brigade so that comments down voted into Oblivion can see the light of day

       Yeah, that is the problem with contest mode, and one thread on contest mode was heavily brigaded by a single pro-Trump spammer posting many comments, but mods don't seem to care about that.

       They only activate it when there are clear signs that threads are being manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is that hard to understand? The one they put in today was because helpful and respectful comments were being quickly downvoted to -30 level scores and that is very strange compared to other threads similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they feel something is being manipulated, they activate contest mode and the influencers lose their edge. To pretend like there isn't being big money being spent on 'online opinion shaping' is ignorant. There has to be ways of dispelling influence given to the mods. Should the police work with nerf guns?

       Are you a mod? Were you part of the discussion to enable it on the thread? Do you have any idea what you're talking about here?

       Very few things get downvoted to -30 on here in short order. Contest mode doesn't actually hurt anything except the popularity of the comments. If you are just a genuine user sharing your opinion, why should this matter so much?

       It's as simple as the fact that several mods are openly pro-Trump and they've used flairs and other mod tools in a pro-Trump fashion before, people are rightly suspicious that they are abusing mod tools again. Now they save contest mode for threads on major breaking news on the Russian conspiracy and they don't crack down on blatant pro-Trump spamming in those threads.

       I think there are both, but since this is a conspiracy board, we don't try to lean only one way or another. Again, the reasoning for enabling contest mode is due to vote and comment movement - not based on the topic of discussion.

       Why do they only put it in contest mode when the top comments aren't good for Trump? If they are going to use contest mode, then make all posts that way. But lately, they only shake up the comment section when the highest upvoted comments don't fit the circle jerk.

       Because instead of people seeing the anti trump comments which lay out what exactly is happening and why the relevant news is important, people now see a random assortment of comments ranging from "fucking MAGA you stupid clinton cunts!" to the afore mentioned well research comments.

       Unfortunately the mod log doesn't tell all, the 3 users I've seen banned for shilling didn't have a reason stated in the logs, I only saw them because the banned users edited their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish mod log actually helped in some way, sure we can see they're biased, but we can't do anything about it or even get answers in mod mail.

       I don't understand all the recent "this sub is T_D 2.0!!" stuff, in all honesty. I like some of their stuff. Not the stupid hype, or the ENERGYTRAINBRICKS?!?! stuff, but some of the info that they put out, it's the stuff that this sub has always loved, and that's really all I've seen make it's way here. Not to mention, it's the kind of stories that get buried by the MSM, which, by default, we like. I dunno, seems weird, to me.

       Oh, hell yeah, I love the shit out of that element. Not Trumpsters doing it (nor do I think they're actually openly doing so, here, if we're honest) for Trump and in the name of Trump; that's dumb. I really, really like the idea that we are part of growing consciousness unified under a common perception of deep-seated power systems throughout the world, though. You gotta admit, it's pretty fishy how the talking points of CNN, ABC, NBC, Colbert, Jon Oliver, etc, all coincide with this eery deep-state monster that we're all trying to trace back to the root.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aw man, I bet I probably lost your ear somewhere in this, huh? And I didn't even get to the part where I talk about Jewish influence in the media, or international banking cabals, much less Saturnic cult sacrifices of children. Not even the multidimensional oneness that I suspect we live in, which also plays at division for fun and education, thus giving rise to the universe and all the myriad other planes of existence. Darn it.... Gotta get better at the exposition..

       Just start with part of the exposition next time. Seriously, though, It's beyond fishy... institutionalized journalism has been a tool of the elite for centuries. The internet amplified it. Smart phones and social media apps amplified it even further. We live in a culture right now that can spread propaganda like a fiber-optic fast virus, a "viral _____", and to billions.

       Great idea, maybe every post that is the top half of the first page, or based on a total score.   It makes the discussion a lot more interesting even though one has to open up the comment chains.  It is a minor inconvenience for increased quality.

       It would let OPs decide whether they want the discussion they're starting to suffer the costs of contest mode in exchange for the benefit of avoiding brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a real tradeoff. Even if we assume that brigading is a serious problem (I'm not convinced yet), contest mode opens up other distortive tactics. There's a guy in the grand jury thread who threw a whole bunch of low-effort top-level comments into the mix; in a normal thread they'd be appropriately downvoted, leaving the more substantive conversations on top. In a CM thread, that user can dilute the conversation with high-volume, low-quality comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is better, the risk of brigading or the risk of shitchaff? I think the decision should be left up to the person who creates the post.

       Not everyone wants to scroll past shitty comments to get to the good ones. It discourages people from getting into the conversation if they know they'll have to do that. And I think that's the point--not trying to get a low-effort comment to the top, just trying to water down the conversation generally in a way you can't in a normal post.

       Like I said, I'm not convinced. Not that I'm asking you to care what I think, but why not let posters decide for themselves? I don't know if Reddit makes it possible for OPs to toggle CM on or off, but OPs could request, "Please no comment mode" in their posts. If moderators honored that request, then everyone could make up their own mind whether the risk of brigading justifies the annoyance of CM. Since different users have different opinions about the costs and benefits of both regular mode and CM, I think that gives maximum flexibility and control to the users.

       So having comment distribution random means you won't have shitty comments at the top all the time.   Threads where the vote is manipulated will.

      <p>
       My experience has been diametrically opposite.  Instead of comments and comment chains being strategically placed only the content of the post matters.   So people interested in the content will share their opinions and engage in a conversation. People who are only interested in manipulation of discourse are placed at a disadvantage.

       I mean if you want to post a thread, than I have no problem with a poster  having a chance, however, there are criteria that should be in place for topics that are targets, to be placed in contest mode, independent of the OP's wishes.

       Not every thread is manipulated. In the grand jury thread, for example, you can (if you're lucky with the randomization!) see a lot of users complaining that there was nothing wrong with the voting--just a MAGAbot getting low-effort comments downvoted. I have no idea if they're right or not; why not let them decide for themselves when they create a post?

       I think that although we disagree about whether CM is a good thing, we might agree on what to do about it--let posters choose whether or not they want it, and in the absence of such a choice (or if there's a real need, maybe even regardless of that choice) follow clear and public criteria for imposing it. Right?

       That's silly. Often the person making the post would want brigading in the first place but other users of the sub would not want that. The person making the post doesn't have some right over the rest of the users...especially when a lot of the people mysteriously in the sub these days want to hijack it and steer discussion and opinion.

       The mods here are blatantly obvious. They never deleted a post or put it in contest mode when the entire front page was trashing CNN. Apparently they don't care when cross posts from the_donald have an unusual amount of upvotes. But it really gets under their skin when the comment section doesn't fit the circle jerk.

       No you fuck tards, we aren't going to take your dumb tactics. They don't work here. The only reason your tactics "appear" to be working in other main subs is bc the shills bought mod spots and its OKAYD By Reddit INC. the mods haven't flipped and the shills are pissed (hence the anti-mod posts... Really organic right?). One would think that the shills would have stepped their game up over the last year but holy fuck is their game weak. It's so balant. Notice how the gold giving stopped.. I'll give that but god damn their tactics are piss poor. My sub conscience now naturally filters all their shit out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real reason why shills are here is to silence our discussions... Why would CNN or WaPo go out of their ways to attack Reddit and its community's? Bc we have exposed them.. Simply by participating in this sub.

       perhaps you should be reported for rule 10. If you can't come here and have a adult conversation, why come here?

       Laughable really.. Pull up any AstroTurfed thread and see who's the most downvoted. If you have 30% of the comments Calling out shill thread and all of them are negative scored, isn't that a sign that shills are trying to censor that 30%??

       Honestly, I tend to come here more than anywhere else if I want to read about shit that matters. I'll check the links and the comments and try not to come to concrete conclusions because a lot of the time the best conspirators are three steps ahead of us and the things that are pushed here as real conspiracies on the regular could more than likely be a limited hangout type situation. I like to discuss ALL of these stories with my fellow theorists without belittling their sensibilities. The only real side I get behind is the one that looks out for all of my fellow human beings. 99% of the globe have been enslaved by a ruling class that transcends borders, creeds, and socio-political-partisan divides. These same people are running their grubby palms together in their ivory towers while the critical thinkers in the huddled masses fling shit at one another over petty shit that was manufactured to divide them

       The intersection of

        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       , and even
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is nonempty. In other words, there are real people that participate in all three communities, and that is okay. People are allowed to support Donald Trump here, or not. People are allowed to think whatever they want here. We just don't want anything to do with MSM sponsored propaganda and the supportive manipulation techniques employed by ShareBlue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us who have been here for a few years are not surprised to see Donald Trump supporters here. Watching a president expose Deep State corruption has been the dream of many conspiracy theorists for decades. We watched this support develop organically. The people who say it looks fishy are either new to this community or are intentionally lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, what is suspicious is the sudden influx of posters aggressively supporting MSM propaganda rags like CNN and WaPo. It is suspicious that almost the entire media and political establishment is united in opposing President Trump, the first conspiracy theorist president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think it is so important for neocons and neoliberals to take him down? Because his skin is a bit orange and he calls them Fake News? Get real. Elite criminals are freaking the fuck out. That's not a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you may disagree with my interpretation of all of this, and that's fine. Disagreeing with other users, including moderators, is not what gets you banned from this community. The thing that gets you banned is posting in bad faith. For example, being disingenuous is posting in bad faith. And you might say, "Hey I wasn't being disingenuous, I really believed in my strawman, honest!" Well, guess what? Fuck you, we are not gullible children. We know when events are being twisted and we know when evidence is being whitewashed and history is being rewritten.
      </p>
      <p>
       ShareBlue is certainly not the only group attempting to manipulate this community, but they are absolutely the most determined and the most effective (destructive). Finally, the moderators are standing up for regular Americans like me who have been here for nearly a decade and banning accounts that appear to be posting in bad faith. I say GOOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't want to get caught up as a false positive? Then put a little more effort into your comments and critically consider  the possibility that you may appear to be using logical fallacies intentionally. Stop doing that and you'll be fine.

       This talking point has been shoved down our throats here since Trump took office. There is a battle happening between the establishment and the sitting president. This is historic. If Ron Paul had somehow won in '08 or '12, he wouldn't have magically transformed into The Evil Establishment the day he was inaugurated. You are arguing with a strawmen. Stop.

       I was polite, civil, and made it clear I was looking for a discussion. I got none of that back and was abruptly told to "go back to

       You say "they are full of shit" as a way to dismiss people but the truth is they have a point. As do many others. You're just stubborn about accepting other's viewpoints.

       is a community, not a problem. They are allowed to use this subreddit just like anyone else. Cambridge Analytica is a data mining and political advertising company. You know those sponsored ads on Facebook? The targeting for those ads comes from organizations like Cambridge Analytica, and there are hundreds of similar groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the same thing as running massive networks of fake people to manipulate discussion on every major social media platform. That particular evil is the lovechild of David Brock and Hillary Clinton, as we learned from WikiLeaks last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, just as CTR loved to deflect onto Revolution Messaging during the rigged primary, ShareBlue loves to deflect onto Cambridge Analytica. These tactics are all coming from the same place: Media Matters.

       Watching the votes here is pretty hilarious. You claim
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       and Cambridge Analytica are a much larger problem, but as of the time this comment was written, you were sitting at +27 while he comments calling out ShareBlue have negative scores. So, it looks like they aren't very successful and therefore not a very large problem. So then what is happening to this community? Obviously
       <a href="/u/psyderr">
        /u/psyderr
       </a>
       is right and the vast majority of the original community sees right through the aggressive vote manipulation in the comments.

       You are repeating a lie. The mods DID NOT invite
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       here. I know exactly which thread you mean. Feel free to post the link, if you like, because your claim does not hold up to scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see this claim made repeatedly in this subreddit and yet nobody seems to want to include the link. You'd think that supporting evidence would help bolster your claim, but that only works if the claim was made in good faith. In this case, the evidence absolutely does NOT support the claim that the mods invited
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       here, so this particular lie is repeated without the link almost every time.

       shuts down because there is a natural overlap between the user base. Some people just spend more of their time over there, and this community would be their second choice. So, what the fuck is so wrong about reminding them that we have different rules over here and they will get banned for calling people cucks?

       I'm glad you asked Bob.  The first thing you need to do is go to the infowars store and pick up a bottle of their tangy tangerine immune boosting super male vitality boner enhancement juice, then you go to your local corner pharmacy and pick up a box of extra heavy flow tampons.  Soak a tampon in the tangy tangerine, drop your pants and shove the tangy tampon up your ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the industry we call this butt chugging the bohemian Grove.  You can repeat as necessary until sanity is restored but watch out for boners that last more than 4 hours or you'll end up doing a 3 hour podcast wearing a bird mask and accidentally polishing off a 700 dollar bottle of scotch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this all made sense because I'm typing with one hand while digging around in my ass for this tampon string.

       According to the criteria anyone who comments in t_d at least 5 times is considered a t_d poster and therefore a Trump supporter when in reality there's lots of reasons why a non-Trump supporter would post in t_d

       They didn't kill the discussion. You can still go and reply and have conversations with people. You get to look at the thread without looking at the voting scores but the context of the comment.

       It does kill discussion. First, because it hides every reply in the entire thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, it randomizes all top-level comments every time you refresh the thread which makes it a lot harder to find posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, it creates even more noise when people start posting "why is this in contest mode" type posts that are randomized and mixed in with all the other top-level comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does all that help a discussion?

       Show your partisanship some more.. Lmao it's the complete opposite of what you said. Anti-Trumpers are upset that anti-Trump news was put into contest mode because it was being brigaded. Pro-Trumpers aren't bitching.

       Oh sure if you say so. I mean the CIA and Congress have bought in to it, and they'd never lie, deceive, or misdirect the public to push an agenda. If our intelligence community says it's true, it's obviously very logical and likely.

       We know that Russia actively attempted to influence the American election, we know they did so to help one candidate in particular, we know that particular candidate refuses to criticize Russia or its dear leader, and we now know that candidates son went to a meeting under the pretences of receiving dirt on Clinton from the Russian government.

       Accepting information from a foreign national is absolutely not a crime in any way. Trump ran on a platform of improving relations with Russia and was elected - not exactly the 'greatest conspiracy of all time' that Trump is more civil with Putin. We know that Russia -
       <em>
        as well as every other country on earth to the extent of which they can
       </em>
       attempted to influence our election. A country having a preferred candidate and pushing their perspective through media is again not exactly 'the greatest conspiracy of all time'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still struggling to understand what exactly the 'Russia hacked the election!' crowd thinks happened, and how it's such a remarkable and unique event. Do you think Trump paid Russia to spread pro-trump propaganda? Is it not exceedingly more likely that Trump campaigned on a the United States improving relations with Russia and thus Russia strategically determined that between Hillary and Trump, A Trump presidency would be preferable and thus used their media outreach to support Trump?

       There are a few questions about Trump&lt;&gt;Russia collusion that are important:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Is Trump indebted to any Russians?  Trump owns real estate all over the world, but he is in debt to those who finance his real estate deals.  If Trump owes money to Russians, it is fair to assume that the Russians expect something from him in return.  Did the Russians support Trump in return for an easing of sanctions related to the Russian invasion of Crimea?  Trump's actions related to Crimea + Russia as well as Trump's reluctance to release tax and other financial information are suspicious with the above question in mind.
       </li>
       <li>
        How did the Russians know to target specific districts in swing states so effectively?  Russian bots spread fake news on social media platforms in competitive districts with such precision that it is unlikely they did so without the help of American political advisers.  Who were the Russians working with to coordinate their social media propaganda broadcasts and were they associated with the Trump campaign?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also, your statement that "accepting information from a foreign national is absolutely not a crime in any way" is just
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/31/gregg-jarrett/fox-news-hosts-wrong-no-law-forbids-russia-trump-c/">

       First, did you read your politifact article? It points to laws forbidding foreign nationals from providing FUNDS to political candidates. The idea that information is money is laughable. Politifact is such garbage to rate that statement false, and then provide no legal precedent for it, just 'legal scholars' saying that maybe a law intended to keep foreign nationals from providing campaign funds to political campaigns
       <em>
        could be
       </em>
       interpreted to include information (even though it never has been even though foreign nationals have previously given information to political campaigns. Hell - the Clinton campaign literally paid Ukrainian government officials for opposition research).
      </p>
      <p>
       And please stop with your baseless propagandize questions about nefarious things Trump
       <em>
        might have done
       </em>
       . Your baseless MSNBC style speculation about a president you don't like is again, not 'the greatest conspiracy of all time'.

       <p>
        if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure.

      <p>
       Also,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime... And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So to recap, Russia:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Hacked the e-mails of the DNC + other Democratic operatives
       </li>
       <li>
        Offered to release that information to the Trump campaign.  Keep in mind there is an e-mail titled "Russia - Clinton private and confidential" that also says the words "Russia and it's governments support for Mr Trump" that was sent to Donald Trump's oldest son, who replied "I love it".
       </li>
       <li>
        Propagated fake news targeting voters in swing districts in order to support Donald Trump's campaign by depressing Democratic turnout
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Also, keep in mind that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Numerous members of Trump's political campaign, current administration and family deliberately mislead and lied about meetings that occurred with Russian officials during and after the campaign
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump has fired the lead investigator into potential Russian collusion and has since mused about firing the replacement investigator.  He has also mused about pardoning family members and himself in regards to the Russia investigation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Looking through your Reddit comments, you were denying the fact that any collusion between Trump &lt;&gt; Russia even existed a few months ago and now you are debating over legalese as to whether or not any crimes were committed in said collusion.  Mueller could very well find that Trump did not commit any crimes, but to call the whole situation "baseless speculation" is just dishonest.

       Not just conspiracy theorists. These people have invaded almost every community imaginable, pretending to be members of the community, and preaching the greatness that is Trump. LGBT rights groups, Bernie Sanders supporters, green party supporters, social conservatives, white nationalists, libertarians. It's most obvious around these parts and the "Bernie Bro" communities but they're fucking everywhere.

       Nope. I think we just figured out the shill problems! Once again, r/conspiracy is stopping the balant propaganda. There are so many threads calling out the balant shilling and yet shills try and play the victim card..

      <p>
       "Trump this, dear leader that. This sub is that.. The mods are corrupt"
      </p>
      <p>
       No you fuck tards, we aren't going to take your dumb tactics. They don't work here. The only reason your tactics "appear" to be working in other main subs is bc the shills bought mod spots and its OKAYD By Reddit INC. the mods haven't flipped and the shills are pissed (hence the anti-mod posts... Really organic right?). One would think that the shills would have stepped their game up over the last year but holy fuck is their game weak. It's so balant. Notice how the gold giving stopped.. I'll give that but god damn their tactics are piss poor. My sub conscience now naturally filters all their shit out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real reason why shills are here is to silence our discussions... Why would CNN or WaPo go out of their ways to attack Reddit and its community's? Bc we have exposed them.. Simply by participating in this sub.

       What shilling? The only thing contest mode does is scatter and bury any critical and potentially meaningful discussion among the hundreds of low effort pro-trump comments. I'm not convinced that contest mode, which again has only been used in threads critical of the current administration, does anything about astroturfing but instead gives a preference towards one group over another.

       Ya I wouldnt trust that mod's comments. Crying about a breaking news story about an on going conspiracy that was posted a hour before another post on the same topic and it getting more attention is some how indication of brigading....

       Lol it's funny to see the balant attacks on veteran community members.. Your imaginary Internet downvotes are really proving our point. In yesterday's thread I saw u/putin_loves_cats get hammered with downvotes the other day and now u/WooTs_67.. Good one shills. Have us all fooled.. Once again 👍

       When big news happens on the current admin a lot of people come here to check to see what's going on, plain and simple the #s go up. And their numbers are much greater than the alt right crowd. They also tend to bring mature conversation along with them up against the other side with their bad grammar and name calling. I welcome them and their maturity to our sub and hope they will stick around more and more as things heat up in Washington so that I can come here and discuss a very visible and very real conspiracy in a tactful and meaningful way without the alt-right buzzwords.

       Your pedantic bullshit doesn't change the fact that you're not here for the right reasons, and that you're denying very obvious connections that regulars here see very clearly.

       At least with brigading we have proof that it is happening. In the mueller thread there is redditor u/magabolt who was just spamming   links. They basically just throw away all moderation responsibilities.

       And if the thread wasn't in contest mode, all of his shit would be downvoted to the bottom. But because of contest mode, if he comments 15 times then you are 15 times more likely to see his spam at the top as opposed to whatever the actual best comment would be. And he's not going to be banned for it because the mods are on his side politically.

       Magabolt is a very clear shill account. I noticed he was spamming all "anti-trump" threads yesterday. Anyone who doesn't believe me just look at his comment history, that is unless he's deleted comments since last night.

       Laughable really.. Pull up any AstroTurfed thread and see who's the most downvoted. If you have 30% of the comments Calling out shill thread and all of them are negative scored, isn't that a sign that shills are trying to censor that 30%??

       No, not really. People yelling 'shill' adds nothing to a discussion so it's logical for them to be downvoted.

       Oh yeaaa lets discuss! Let's discuss how the democratic establishment has literally lead us to Donnie. Cmon fellow countryman for the truth this time!
      </p>
      <p>
       The democratic establishment rigged the primaries against Bernie. With the help of the corrupt MSM, along with the shills, the dem establishment alienated their own base and waged all their chips on a Cunt that America hated. Because of their actions, the dems lost ALL POWER and gave it to the republicans. Now we have a 1 partied ruled democracy... All because it was "HER TURN". The shills had the exact opposite effect and instead of getting America to vote for that cunt, shills made more Americans vote against that cunt. Soo please do tell us how we should be focusing on trump and Russia even though the dems just destroyed their own party and any chance of real change. Bet you won't 😘

       Here's a thought, when contest mode is used could the mods sticky a comment just explaining why? I think it would help by giving the users an avenue to discuss whether contest mode is needed in that given time.

       Since the exact reason is internal to the mod team I cannot give exact reasons without risking being kicked from the team, but what I will say is that my actions were part of the discourse going on there about which posts were being selected to be put into contest mode and why.

       It would be great to get some insight into these discussions. From the outside, this seems like a clear and flagrant pattern of squashing any threads that are critical of Trump. "Contest mode" just seems like the latest tool to suppress threads that gain traction.

       As a mod, you should be a leader. Take some responsibility for this issue and try to fix it. Otherwise, you're nothing more than a glorified comment tagger. I don't mean to antagonize but this is a pretty serious issue for this sub. We've seen, and now continue to see, a total vacuum of leadership.

       Thank you for the link. It's very telling to me that in the past 3 months there were only 2 threads set to contest mode, one of which was to vote on new moderators, until the recent slew of threads that are damaging Trump being set to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how anyone can look at that and not see the biased ways contest mode is being used on threads about Trump.

       I did go ahead and take them right back out. Then another mod came by and only put two of them back in. You may want to take a closer look at each action.

       It most certainly was not false.  Trumpers just moved the goalposts by attempting to redefine doxxing to shut their worldview of trumps innocence.   Either way, it was still shitty and petty and came straight from the great cheeto.

       What part of the story was "completely false"? The part where the white house released personal information sent to them over a 6-10 day period BEFORE they warned people that public comments would be released in full (including personal info).

       Nothing about that story was false, and I'm still waiting for someone to prove to me that the white house warned people that their personal information would be released prior to the day before they released it.

       Exactly, the email was not for public use or provided to the public at all, thus those who emailed should not have expected secrecy. It would be like if you tracked down my email address, emailed me, and and then acted surprised when I shared it with others.
      </p>

       Also, it's been nearly a month and they have released zero emails after the first batch. Which still leaves me under the impression that this was done in retribution for all of the unsolicited negative comments.

       They may have chosen not to because of the backlash or they may on do it every so often (6 months, a year, when they reach a predetermined number of emails, etc). There isn't transparency with it so it's too hard to make any sort of determination.

       Laughable really.. Pull up any AstroTurfed thread and see who's the most downvoted. If you have 30% of the comments Calling out shill thread and all of them are negative scored, isn't that a sign that shills are trying to censor that 30%??

       NPR who criticizes the shit out of "conspiracy theorists" somehow makes to it the top within an hour. All top comments, shitting on the sub while all downvotes comments are calling propaganda... It's balant. Every time, they try to pass off CNN or WaPo, it's the same MO. Top comments shitting on sub. Comments calling out the balant propaganda get downvoted to shit. Gaurereed that thread I has listed, 25-30% comments calling propaganda.. Propaganda. Their shill downvotes is a shitty attempt at censorship.

       Yes genius, if you want a private security firm to analyze your servers you have to pay them, you don't think it's free do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, I'd love to hear why you think the images provided to the fbi are any worse than the physical servers? Can you also tell me why the fbi wouldn't demand the servers if they needed them to do the analysis? Are you aware of our governments collection capabilities, which give intel agencies better insight into attacks like this than the physical servers ever could?
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you have real intellectual answers to give me for this completely off-topic comment you made, I'm sure of it.

       If you want a private security firm to cover up and sell a fake narrative, then you hire them to "analyze" your server(s). What was the bleach bit for again? Oh yea she's was just "wiping" her sever with a "bleach cloth"

       I say read the comments for a bit, usually you can figure things out. If that doesnt work, you can use the search bar or just go ahead and ask in the comments.

      <p>
       Not sure which ones you dont know here but Ill explain a couple. T_D is the Trump subreddit. And brigading is when someone from a different subreddit brings people from the other sub to downvote or try to change the tone of the comment section of a story they dont like.

       It's to late to catch up, SHTF no later than Nov.1st. that's about as cliff notes as I can get for ya. The funny thing is, 20yrs. ago I would have never seen it go down the way it did, these guys are good, truly a tactical soft kill at all levels.

       The sub is getting brigaded to shit by ShareBlue and TMOR/all/politics so yes, it's absolutely necessary.   It completely strips those retarded fucks of their power to abuse the rules to control the narrative in this sub, and that's only a good thing.  I guess you're going to have to rely on the strength of your arguments instead of the feelings you get when you get those updoots!

       I see people kind of calling
       <a href="/u/creq">

       out for having a pro-Trump moderating agenda,
       <a href="/u/Flytape">
        /u/Flytape

       is also moderating from a pro-Trump agenda. Even though Flytape looks like a lower level mod, because he was kicked off the mod team once, he is actually the most experienced mod and my guess is likely wielding a lot of influence amongst the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that
       <a href="/u/creq">
        /u/creq
       </a>
       <em>
        is not allowed to discuss why contest mode is being enabled without risking being kicked off the mod team
       </em>
       is absolute bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we need to purge the the pro-Trump activist mods. There is nothing wrong with being for Trump. There is everything wrong with pushing a stealth pro-Trump agenda on to the sub.

       That's pretty harsh.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no restrictions on mods discussing contest mode.  We are simply are experimenting with the only tools Reddit provides to see how they effect the highly political, highly brigaded posts hitting this sub.

       Also
       <a href="/u/creq">
        /u/creq

       is definitely not pro-trump, while that label fits me just fine it certainly doesn't fit creq.  The fact you're labeling creq that way just exemplifies that you're attributing political bias to moderation actions where there is none.  Creq is VERY anti-trump.

       I wrote that first part about
       <a href="/u/creq">
        /u/creq
       </a>
       unclearly, I should have just ended the sentence instead of lumping him in with you, who is on the record supporting Trump. I was just stating my observation of the comment section because people were accusing
       <a href="/u/creq">
        /u/creq
       </a>
       of moderating for Trump. I don't know if creq is doing that, but people are implying he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, I just want you guys on the mod team to button it up a little bit and get on the same page. I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       you guys to be way more pro-active than you are being and get this sub a little bit more under control. There is way way to much political bullshit in the sub. I have advocated a (temporary) heavier hand from you guys when it comes to the saturation political spamming that goes on here so that perhaps they get discouraged and move on from the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you guys need to get ahead of these perceptions of bias a little bit. For example, I thought the active clean-up of all the Seth Rich spam done the other day should be posted to the sub. When you  guys do something like that it clearly shows that you guys are clearing out political spam from both sides of the fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I wish you guys would be even more strict on the duplicate and redundant political posts. Keep the first or most upvoted one and removes the others as spam. I was reporting a lot of the stuff as spam the other day, I thought that it was removing those posts because they would be gone when I refreshed, but then when I opened up Tor browser I was bummed to see the spam still there in the hew queue..:-/
      </p>
      <p>
       When a submission get reported as spam do you guys actually see that it was reported? or is the 'reported' post just something individual to the person reporting it?

       As far as getting ahead of perception, honestly man it doesn't matter what we do or how we do it there are groups of people out there who want to spin drama into everything we do.  Acknowledging their drama only legitimizes it, which it usually isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example we we remove these posts then people complain that we are censoring, if we contest a post those same people complain that we did that.  If we let the spam brigades run wild those same people also aren't happy with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're honest with ourselves here, people from one side of the divide don't want their posts tampered with but they want their opposition's posts strictly regulated.  This goes in both directions.  We are experimenting with an actual solution that doesn't involve capitulation to either side of the divide, and once again everyone is losing their mind over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad state of affairs, so we are forced to bite the bullet and make everyone temporarily unhappy and see which users are capable of being confronted with opposing views while still valuing a sub of this nature.  We aren't going to capitulate to one oppressive group of brigades over the other.

       Exactly, there is no way to win the war, but if you don't fight it you'll definitely lose it.

      <p>
       And maybe we're wrong for trying to keep the sub about the long time regulars, maybe we should embrace all the new people.  But I can't help but see that almost ALL the new people want Conspiracy to just be place to shamefully push the most extreme examples of either /the_donald or /politics.  When faced with that scenario, no thanks!  They can host their own Conspiracy theories within their own appropriate subs.  And I don't even care if they leak into /Conspiracy a little bit, but they are attempting to drown us out so they can gentrify /Conspiracy with whatever they are selling without the other side having access at all.  Well /politics already does that and they don't need two subs for it, /the_donald already does that and they don't need two subs for it.

       It's a futile competition between two groups who will never agree on anything. If we can find individuals from those two groups who can debate without losing their God damn minds over it then those individuals are welcome.  The obvious brigades need to go the fuck away.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I'm a Trump Supporter but I don't hate Trump critics, I don't want to hurt anyone, I don't want to burn everything down.  I just want to see the corruption exposed, and eradicated.  IMHO Trump is doing just that, even if not intentionally.

        starting w the unauthorized, insecure, non government monitored server that sat on the same host as good ol Bills Clintons old server? Should we talk about those balant crimes that have been just dismissed and ignored?

       Let's chat about the DNC server and let's talk about the said evidence that Crowd Strike used to say that it was hacked by "Russia" (cause any hacker group from anywhere is apparently "Russian").

      <p>
       But I believe it was it guccifer 2.0 (catchy name right? 2.0 lol) that actually started unraveling the the narrative when he left a nasty trail of meta data?

      </p>
      <p>
       The democratic establishment rigged the primaries against Bernie. With the help of the corrupt MSM, along with the shills, the dem establishment alienated their own base and waged all their chips on a Cunt that America hated. Because of their actions, the dems lost ALL POWER and gave it to the republicans. Now we have a 1 partied ruled democracy... All because it was "HER TURN". The shills had the exact opposite effect and instead of getting America to vote for that cunt, shills made more Americans vote against that cunt. Soo please do tell us how we should be focusing on trump and Russia even though the dems just destroyed their own party and any chance of real change. Bet you won't 😘

       That's silly. Often the person making the post would want brigading in the first place but other users of the sub would not want that. The person making the post doesn't have some right over the rest of the users...especially when a lot of the people mysteriously in the sub these days want to hijack it and steer discussion and opinion.

       What censorship? The only thing votes does is facilitate shilling in the current state of Reddit where shilling of communities is widespread.

        if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure.

      <p>
       Also,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime... And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime."

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So to recap, Russia:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Hacked the e-mails of the DNC + other Democratic operatives
       </li>
       <li>
        Offered to release that information to the Trump campaign.  Keep in mind there is an e-mail titled "Russia - Clinton private and confidential" that also says the words "Russia and it's governments support for Mr Trump" that was sent to Donald Trump's oldest son, who replied "I love it".
       </li>
       <li>
        Propagated fake news targeting voters in swing districts in order to support Donald Trump's campaign by depressing Democratic turnout
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Also, keep in mind that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Numerous members of Trump's political campaign, current administration and family deliberately mislead and lied about meetings that occurred with Russian officials during and after the campaign
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump has fired the lead investigator into potential Russian collusion and has since mused about firing the replacement investigator.  He has also mused about pardoning family members and himself in regards to the Russia investigation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Looking through your Reddit comments, you were denying the fact that any collusion between Trump &lt;&gt; Russia even existed a few months ago and now you are debating over legalese as to whether or not any crimes were committed in said collusion.  Mueller could very well find that Trump did not commit any crimes, but to call the whole situation "baseless speculation" is just dishonest.

       Well then, perhaps you guys putting on the teflon for a while is the way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end I think you guys have the longtime regulars behind your efforts, at least you got me behind you. We all know you can't win with the brigading crossposting shills no matter what you do.
