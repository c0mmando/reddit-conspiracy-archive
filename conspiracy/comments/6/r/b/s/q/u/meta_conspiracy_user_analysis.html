        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT4: thanks for all the additional input, I added a few more numbers to paint a better picture of the whole situation. I honestly believe that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users that were here long before the whole political mess we are in were actually interested in any type of conspiracy (as they should be). And both groups on the left and right side of the spectrum come in here and post politically charged links and trying to skew the overall opinion. And I mean both sides: the_donald on a regular basis (based on the 25% link content with over average upvotes) and politics/the left whenever a conspiracy falls into their laps over at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (based on the analysis of the 1st of august when the NPR article was posted). I think the data is conclusive enough to show that both sides are a pain in the ass of this subreddit (in their own way) and both try to influence what&#39;s going on in here. Funnily enough both sides have a right to feel brigaded and suppressed ;p The_dons when a left wing article hits conspiracy and the left wingers all the other days.</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>

<p>I made a previous post concerning what conspiracy users are made up from. Yesterday I claimed half of the posts were by the_donald users and the first quick analysis confirmed it but I made a small mistake by including ALL their comments and not limit it to a specific time frame, which of course is not a valid method. So here is my full analysis.</p>

<p>I created two groups. First the_donald users and second a mixture of multiple anti trump subs: enoughtrumpspam, esist, trumpcriticizestrump, marchagainsttrump, fuckthealtright, againsthatesubreddits ,shitredditsays. All combined make up slightly more subscribers than the_donald. I also made sure that the_donald users that posted in both subreddits are not counted as leftist. Since some of these subreddits don&#39;t ban even if you go against the grain. Also I tried to use politics as a counterbalance but that subbreddit has way more subscribers and they don&#39;t ban any users unless you are racist, so not really a great sample for anti-trumps.</p>

<p>A user for a specific group means they posted in at least 5 different link threads. Which means if you for example had a discussion in a single link with a huge amount of comments you are not considered as such a user. If you posted in multiple threads you are an active user. IMO this rule benefits the_donald statistics since many people posted in these anti-trump subs complaining about why there is another one of these anti-trump subreddits. So they might not even be anti-trump but are now counted as. So the data can be skewed in that regard. But the_donald data alone is interesting to look at.</p>

<p>Also deleted comments are not counted, so if you have been banned from the_donald and all your comments got removed. I don&#39;t have them and you are not considered to be in that group.</p>

<p>Here is the output of my analysis:</p>

<p><strong>Users</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Total number of analysed users: 7,370</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of total comments from Jul 27 2017 to Aug 02 2017: 31,870</p></li>
<li><p>Number of comments by anti-trump subreddit users: 1,127</p></li>
<li><p>Number of comments by the_donald users: 8,354</p></li>
<li><p>3.16 % users from anti-trump subreddits are writing 3.54 % of all comments in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>26.17 % users from the_donald are writing 26.21 % of all comments in conspiracy</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of total links: 1,249</p></li>
<li><p>Number of links by anti-trump subreddit users: 8</p></li>
<li><p>Number of links by the_donald users: 305</p></li>
<li><p>3.16 % users from anti-trump subreddits are posting 0.64 % of all links in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>26.17 % users from the_donald are posting 24.42 % of all links in conspiracy</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upvotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Anti-trump users have a median upvote of 2 vs 2 for the_donald vs everyone else 2</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-trump users have an outlier free avg upvote of 4.049<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> vs 1.96 for the_donald vs everyone else 2.439</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-trump users have a median link upvote of 11<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> vs 10 for the_donald vs everyone else 8</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-trump users have an outlier free avg link upvote of 12.857<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> vs 15.323 for the_donald vs everyone else 10.284</p></li>
</ul>

<p><sup>[1]</sup> A great number of them were in the seth rich-trump-fox collusion thread, so this might not be indicative of the whole subreddit.</p>

<p><sup>[2]</sup> Not enough data to be conclusive, a sample size of 8 is too small.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Anti-trump users barely post here, if they do they are upvoted more. Which I think makes sense since anti-trump users only get here if something important happens that is anti-trump and a conspiracy combined so they boost their own scores by the nature of coming here when something specific anti-trump happens. And given that 70% of the commenting population are in neither group they can outvote the_donald users in these cases. My assumption is that the very small difference in average upvotes between the_donald users and conspiracy users means that conspiracy users have a large overlap in opinion with the_donald users BUT they are slightly less liked than the default user. Especially when something like the seth-trump-fox scandal happens and the real conspiracy users downvote trump apologists.</p>

<p>Overall comments and links seem to be organic, I&#39;d say there is no obvious botting going on. Anti-trump people come here only when there is an actual anti-trump conspiracy active in the news. They barely post any links. Also when something hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> upvotes explode and can mess up the analysis. I tried to combat it by removing outliers but even then an <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> post can heavily influence the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So, is conspiracy the_donald 2.0? Hard to say, people can create multiple reddit accounts to avoid these kinds of analysis. But given the difference in link upvote rate between the_donald users and everyone else means that there is a significant bias towards the_donald users posted links. So yes, I think conspiracy likes the_donald driven content right now more than their own content.</p>

<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/RsfcsXwq">Source Code</a> All subclasses are part of my data miner nothing fancy in there. The logic you see is the important part. <strong>If you see something wrong, tell me I want to be absolutely right and not find results that fit my narrative</strong> And yes the code is inefficient and I could have written methods to make it even more compact but hey, I don&#39;t get paid for clean code ;p</p>

<p>I may post the data but it&#39;s like 6GB of raw uncompressed data and I&#39;m not sure how I can post truncated data without it looking like fakes. I can post hashes of all users I analysed and hashes of all links/comments. So people can figure out if a given user or comment was included but it can only be tested one way. That might be the most reasonable thing to do. Let me figure this out in a few hours.</p>

<p>PS: it&#39;s still downloading more data BUT for the past few hours the numbers stagnated. So for most of the values the sample size was large enough to converge.</p>

<p>EDIT: just because you wanted to see it, here politics interpret it any way you want, I wouldn&#39;t even try to interpret these numbers since politics is way larger than the_donald, they don&#39;t ban contrary opinion. I mean they fit my narrivite but I wouldn&#39;t even try to use these numbers to say anything. Please note the total number of users has changed since I&#39;m still downloading more and more data, but the values do converge so nothing to worry about.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>14.07 % politics users are writing 14.45 % of all comments in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>14.07 % politics users are posting 8.72 % of all links in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have a median upvote of 2</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have an outlier free avg upvote of 3.597</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have a median link upvote of 11</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have an outlier free avg link upvote of 13.661</p></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 2: Upvotes = score, if you check the source code I specifically used score since upvotes of course can&#39;t be read out. Excuse my mistake.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: same analysis over 6000 random users (more just takes too long sry) for only the 1st of august as requested. Please note the number of links by politics users is way too low for the percentage to make any kind of sense. This of course includes the NPR story most likely thus explaining the huge avg. </p>

<ul>
<li>Total number of analysed users: 5,942 (58 users haven&#39;t posted during this timeframe)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of total comments from Aug 01 2017 to Aug 01 2017: 5,508</p></li>
<li><p>Number of comments by politics users: 866</p></li>
<li><p>Number of comments by the_donald users: 1,397</p></li>
<li><p>14.09 % politics users are writing 15.72 % of all comments in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>25.23 % users from the_donald are writing 25.36 % of all comments in conspiracy</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of total links: 139</p></li>
<li><p>Number of links politics users: 4</p></li>
<li><p>Number of links by the_donald users: 36</p></li>
<li><p>14.09 % politics users are posting 2.88 % of all links in conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>25.23 % users from the_donald are posting 25.9 % of all links in conspiracy</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upvotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>politics users have a median upvote of 2 vs 1 for the_donald vs everyone else 1</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have an outlier free avg upvote of 3.62 vs 1.558 for the_donald vs everyone else 1.897</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have a median link upvote of 7.5 vs 6 for the_donald vs everyone else 8</p></li>
<li><p>politics users have an outlier free avg link upvote of 36.25 vs 6.321 for the_donald vs everyone else 10.356</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So both the_donald comments and politics comments were downvoted BUT the_donald comments were definitely more downvoted during that time. You can feel vindicated that the_donald posters have been brigaded by people that didn&#39;t like your content. Surprisingly content by standard conspiracy users were the same. I think this tells us a lot. Politics users rushed in here that day and downvoted links which were created by the_donald users but didn&#39;t downvote links posted by standard conspiracy users.</p>

<p>So in conclusion I&#39;d say that the regular conspiracy users would probably love it when both politics users and the_donald users would kindly fuck off ;p</p>

<p>Depending on your method it could be interesting to see if there is some kind of time related stuff (T_D/anti_D users posting more/less during the day or on the weekend?) but ~1GB data per day is quite a lot and could make a longer (8 weeks analysis maybe) harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the data includes the full comment and link history of that user. I only limited it to the past week since I only looked at the links from the past week. The moment I include their full comment history as well, the results get a bias towards those that were active within that week. But those are not a representative sample of the past year for example. That&#39;s why I had the 50% result yesterday. Which was misleading even though 25% is still pretty high, it&#39;s not 50% =)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can get a longer time frame analysed but at some point the comments during that time get lost since reddit API only allows to see the past 1000 comments. So if someone posts a lot of comments those from a year ago are lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bot loaded the top 300 links of the past week.</p>

<p>Then went through each link and downloaded all comments in that link.</p>

<p>Then for each comment he extracted the user that posted that comment.</p>

<p>Then for each user he downloaded the full comment and link history.</p>

<p>At that point I have a long list of users that posted in the past week in one of the top 300 links in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Then I sorted the users to be either a T_D poster (by looking in how many different T_D links they posted in the past, if they exceeded 4 links they are considered to be a T_D user). Since they are that ban happy i&#39;d be surprised if anyone that doesn&#39;t circlejerk made it that far.</p>

<p>Same thing for all the anti-trump subs (combined in an OR statement, so it doesn&#39;t matter in which subreddit you posted, you are now an anti-trump poster).</p>

<p>Then I filtered out all comments and links posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by these users within the past week and the numbers you see are based on these comments and links. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t weighted anything. The only thing I did is remove outliers from the links and comment sets (of each user) given that for example one hit wonders that make 1k+ points for a single comment are not standard and might skew the results.</p>

<p>It took me a full day since I started the download process yesterday (still going...) reddit has a limit of 1 request per second. I have right now around 9k users collected. Each user takes up around 200kb zipped and 1MB in memory when loaded. Which means right now I have some problems doing a full analysis over all 9k users because I can&#39;t extend my RAM usage over 8GR... Have to figure this one out later. I just randomize the list and pick the first 7k and work on that for the meantime.</p>

<p>I used to be a silent reader of this subreddit. Once they started flooding the pages with Russian styled conspiracy theories about Hillary, I left. I am no liberal or conservative.

I can tell that the_donald people started targeting this subreddit mainly at the time of election because before the stories and comments didn&#39;t have much traces of extreme bigotry and blind admiration for Russia. </p>

<p>the only way to counter trolls is not to feed them. if you counter shills, you only boost their visibilty. down vote and move on.</p>

<p>one thing i do wish is that all of 100 original posts on the same exact news tid bit etc that is already posted be down voted. the inundation by 100 posts on exactlybthe same thing is really, to me, the core problem. sometimes it exhausting to just peruse the sub for the 3 1/2 seconds (including new) it takes to sigh in defeat and leave.</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;m anti-Trump I don&#39;t post in the anti-Trump subs because they&#39;re almost all Shareblue shit holes. And because of Shareblue, at times the_donald is the only source for certain kinds of news, so I have found myself posting there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DING DING DING DING, WE HAVE A WINNER!!!</p>

<p>The president is in fact, not the government.  Today you&#39;re going to learn a lot!</p>

<p>There are three separate branches that make up the United States government; the president only being the chief executive of one of those.  Our founding fathers were smart enough to create two other branches for something we call &quot;Checks and Balances.&quot;</p>

<p>Our founding fathers realized that one man could not rule a nation, like King George III did (who they were at odds with at the time), so they added a congress to represent &quot;the people.&quot;  The congress is comprised of two separate houses, the senate and the house of representatives.</p>

<p>Now, many of our founding fathers were lawyers so they knew they also had create a high court, to rule on weather or not laws passed in congress followed the constitution.  This high court is what we call the &quot;Supreme&quot; court.</p>

<p>Because this is a nation of, by, and for the people, we elect our representatives and executive, and entrust that between the two they can agree on who should sit on the supreme court.  </p>

<p>However, there are appointees and hirings made by the branches that are not chosen by the people, beaurocrats to keep the machine turning if you will.  These beaurocrats run the most influential part of the US government and stay hidden in the shadows for decades, to include every single person in the &quot;intelligence community.&quot; </p>

<p>The intelligence community comprises what most now accept as the &quot;Deep State.&quot;  A nefarious group with untold power and wealth who believe it is in their best interest, and the interest of those with whom they deal, to keep &quot;the people&quot; in the dark as to what actually happens behind the scenes in our government.  They believe that morals and ethics have no part in their profession, and would sell out their grandmother if it was beneficial to them.  </p>

<p>This Deep State is connected to every major corporation in the United States, and has the ability to blackmail just about every single important American in both the private and public sectors.  The American people are waking up to this deep state and are sick and tired of them running it into the ground for their own gain.</p>

<p>The Deep State is suspected of assassinating a sitting US president, is known to have incited violent revolution in democratic nations such as Chile and Nicaragua among others around the world, is known to have operations in wich they use their media contacts to sway public opinion, and is generally extremely shady.</p>

<p>This Deep State corrupted our government to such an extent that the United States of America <em>actually</em> elected Donald Trump to be their warrior in Washington.</p>

<p>At first President Trump tried to play nice with the government and country in shambles that he inherited from his predecessor<em>S</em>.  But it has been shown that the Deep State is unwilling to play nice with the people&#39;s choice so President Trump has been attempting to isolate himself from those who make up the majority of the government who wish to see him, and through extension the people, fail.</p>

<p>So you see, no, Trump is not &quot;the government.&quot;  Today you learned.</p>

<p>Government is a tool. It is hard for the people to wield it with their lack of time and money and easy for wealthy business owners to wield it with their abundance of time and money.</p>

<p>We should stop blaming government so much and start asking ourselves what specific interests are corrupting the government to work against the people? Who has these interests?</p>

<p>By just attacking government, we play into a trap set up by these wealthy business owners.

We disempower ourselves that way, by refusing to engage the system. Then we impotently complain and turn away more reasonable people that would otherwise be aligned with our interests in pushing government toward the will of the people. </p>

<p>R/politics is worse than t_d because at least t_d is a sub with a name dedicated to their &quot;hero&quot;, so of course they will ban you.</p>

<p>Politics is broadly named &quot;politics&quot; and absolutely bans anyone who goes against the grain, as well as shadow-deleting their comments.</p>

<p>Anyone who says otherwise is part of the politics circlejerk, a liar, or goes with the grain too much to understand what that subreddit is.</p>

<p>What people like you don&#39;t seem to realize is that you have these beliefs because you perfectly go with the grain.</p>

<p>Going against the grain in r-politics will get you banned as quick as t_d and you are also very likely to have your comments shadow deleted.</p>

He is the first guy to get the office from outside the traditional political establishment, and he doesn&#39;t talk like a teleprompter reading robot and his responses to questions might be cheazy but they dont seem coached. He might still be a member of the global elite but he wasnt in the political inner circle and I think that is obvious, although I do admit it would be the ultimate plant if they really did plant him like they did with Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure your analysis is meaningful.  the_Donald supporters are aware of machinations by the deep state against the Trump presidency -- so naturally they will gravitate to a conspiracy site.  The Deep State IS a conspiracy, treason as committed by various Democratic controlled agencies (including DNC) is also a conspiracy.  anti-Trump people prefer to ignore these realities.  </p>

<p>Both Democrats and Republicans, including Trump, work for the deep state. Is that not obvious? </p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about the guy who led chants of &quot;lock her up&quot; and as soon as he clinched the presidency, squashed any rumors that he was going to prosecute Clinton. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far. Trump is obviously nothing like what he claimed to be, but he&#39;s not nearly as bad as Obama, the Bushes, or the Clintons.</p>

<p>Obama was a <a href="http://conspiracyarchive.com/Articles/Obama_CIA.htm">CIA agent</a>, and he knowingly <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/2015/07/blame-isil-150728080342288.html">created ISIS</a>. Trump recently cut all of the programs supporting the &quot;moderate rebels&quot; which was all going to ISIS.</p>

<p>His connection to the Rothschilds is through Robert Mercer, who didn&#39;t support Trump in the primaries, and only became a major donor in the general. The connection is there, but it&#39;s not like they loved him.</p>

<p>And my point was that not all of the elites are equally evil. Not even close. If you assume they don&#39;t have disagreements, or can&#39;t be turned to good purposes by public opinion (i.e. FDR), then you&#39;ll act as if you can&#39;t do anything when you absolutely can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/EagleofAmerica">/u/EagleofAmerica</a> is making the claim that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama... and,he knowingly created ISIS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Linking to a video of Micheal Flynn and Mehdi Hasan as support for that claim. Which is a verifiable  false claim. Actually reading over the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/2016/01/transcript-michael-flynn-160104174144334.html">transcript</a>, it looks like Flynn never actually made that specific claim. So I take that part back. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCHuZM_9qTk">Trump made that claim.</a> and then repeated it: <a href="http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-makes-return-visit/#more-31501">http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-makes-return-visit/#more-31501</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[HH: I’ve got two more questions. Last night, you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.</p>

<p>DT: No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>HH: But he’s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He’s trying to kill them.</p>

<p>DT: I don’t care. He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why did EoA link to a video of an interview of Flynn, as proof of a claim that he never made? I don&#39;t know. Probably because it was long enough that no one would actually watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol so you make it up. Nice. </p>

<p>Does r politics count as an anti-Trump subreddit?</p>

<p>What subs do you consider pro/anti and why haven&#39;t you listed them?</p>

<p>I just ask these questions because this &quot;study&quot; was done by you, a user with a very clear bias and reddit history of pushing that viewpoint. </p>

<p>Your unscientific joke of a study has a ton of variables, you personally get to make up data (oops, I mean &quot;interpret&quot; non-existent data), it&#39;s unclear what definitions you&#39;re using for anything, and it just so happens to give the results you want to push!</p>

<p>Garbage. </p>

<p>This is a fake &quot;study&quot; done by a person with a clear agenda who is literally mixing and matching &quot;data&quot; with their own made up bullshit and standards. </p>

<p>Many people on this sub have differing political opinions. That&#39;s a good thing and necessary for any real discussion.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a huge contingent of people whose entire purpose is to shut down and de-legitimize opposing political opinions.</p>

<p>The people who get furious when the story the DEMAND be the focus isn&#39;t, and follow up with &#39;omg I thought this was a conspiracy sub but you&#39;re not upvoting my story so I guess you&#39;re all donald shill or russian bots!!!!&#39;</p>

<p>That kind of shit is just so obvious. And it&#39;s ubiquitous on this sub. </p>

<p>You make a great point about the fact that ....interested accounts wouldn&#39;t be posting in the anti-Trump subs because those subs are already marching in lockstep.</p>

<p>They come here to shit all over discussion because apparently the idea of people discussing things they don&#39;t approve of is a serious problem for them.</p>

<p>When people try to frame the discussion of a topic so that any deviation from their political opinion must be due to an illegitimate user, just keep an eye on it. </p>

<p>Your account is <strong>1 month old</strong>, bro lol. What I&#39;ve personally noticed is that the people accuse everyone of being Shareblue/CTR shills are generally never older than 6 months, and more often fall into the days to 3 months range.

<p>There&#39;s definitely flaws in the methodology. It&#39;s too short a period of time, and I agree that it may be too simple to lump people into one of 2 categories without a true criteria.</p>

<p>Where I will disagree, though, is that T_D-type posts litter the front page at a 10:1 ration easily, and the upvotes on those posts don&#39;t exactly appear &quot;organic&quot; to me. But do I have solid method to say they aren&#39;t? No. Won&#39;t even claim that. I&#39;m just saying that this sub definitely looks &quot;overrun&quot; at times by duplicate shitposts. And it seems that the users that are annoyed by it (e.g., me), tend to upvote comments run counter to the post&#39;s narrative as a means of balancing the bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe certain aspects of it, sure. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not talking about pizzagate, a phrase that has been turned into an easy way to discredit people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about institutionalized human trafficking and pedophilia within our government and other power structures. To a lot of people, that means pizzagate. To me, that means a fucking evil that has tons of evidence for it.</p>

<p>Pure BS you say? </p>

<p>Whatever. I saw that fucks instagram account before it went private. No sane person would defend that sicko or his buddy Skippy if they actually took the time to look into it.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure you and your buddies know that already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the fact remains that the audio was presented 3 weeks before the NPR story ran. This means someone had foreknowledge of the story, and set up a contingency plan.

<p>I think that&#39;s a pretty big logical leap that someone involved in the case leaked the audio. I don&#39;t even understand how you&#39;re getting to that assumption. And have you listened to all the leaked audio? There&#39;s a 20 something minute upload where Wheeler contradicts aspects of his complaint. Why would he leak that? I&#39;d imagine Wikileaks were the ones who sat on the audio and knew the complaint would be filed, and that the story would break-- leaking it when it would get maximum play.</p>

<p>Regardless, it was definitely released as a response to the NPR story, and took over the narrative of the NPR story (which was in itself concerning) on this sub and others.</p>

<p>This all seems to be a &quot;something burger,&quot; both Wheeler&#39;s complaint and the leaked audio. I&#39;d love for it to be parsed out in the courts or in more articles about this mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but it was still leaked at a strategic time after the story broke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not leaked. Published. There is a very big difference. It was leaked at least 3 weeks ago, probably as soon as someone found out wheeler was filing a law suit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d imagine Wikileaks were the ones who sat on the audio and knew the complaint would be filed, and that the story would break-- leaking it when it would get maximum play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikileaks absolutely does this, but how would they know what wheeler was planning? How would they know 3 weeks ahead of time that they needed recordings from these specific people? They&#39;re not spys. They don&#39;t tap phones, hack computers, and sneak into people&#39;s houses. They only know what they are given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that&#39;s a pretty big logical leap that someone involved in the case leaked the audio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not at all a big leap. The audio was very specifically from people named in the suit or involved in the investigation. It was leaked before NPR announced the lawsuit, and in fact before the suit was even filed. Thus, the leaker must have known about the unfiled suit before hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wheeler contradicts aspects of his complaint. Why would he leak that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he new the information in the suit would cause the Seth Rich case to be discredited in it&#39;s entirety because of 3rd party (Fox+Trump) actions 9 months after the fact. If his intention of filing the suit was to point out that Fox/trump had Coopted the story for political gain. The leaked audio isn&#39;t the only footage that contradicts his statements in the suit. There are tweets and interviews where he contradicts himself as well.</p>

<p>There definitely is something to this burger. I expect there to be more traction in the future.</p>

<p>12.8 vs 13.7 upvotes on avg. per link. So my selective group was pretty close to poltics even though the group was definitely smaller.</p>

<p>The comment contributions are way higher but that was to be expected since again, politics is huge but they are still dwarfed by the_donald users so it actually supports my statement.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s kinda my point about people who post in T_D. Just by having posted there you can&#39;t say if they are a supporter, opponent, or somewhere in between. Simply having posted some place does not mean any of the above. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not hiding it. Downvote me if you want. But you are the one that claims it shouldn&#39;t matter what people think or where they post or what they post, it only matters what the content is. My analysis is pure math. The interpretation might be biased but you can look at those numbers any way you want. T_D posted links are higher upvoted than links posted by none_T_D users. Interpret that any way you want.</p>

<p>Right, because it&#39;s been <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000">dropping from 10% since October 2009</a>. When Obama took office, U3 was 7.8% and rose to 10% within the next few months. Since then, it has fallen to 4.8% when he left office, trending downward.</p>

<p>And at least looking at DJI, it went from ~8500 when Obama took office to 19500 when he left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s break this down, because damn you&#39;re struggling.  Noise in data refers specifically to data that resides outside the median or mean of which you are studying.  The reason r/politics wasn&#39;t included from the get-go is that multiple users, those who reside in both anti- and pro-trump forums, exist.  It is hard to distinguish responses from these types of forums because the overlap is so great.</p>

<p>IF you begin to do manual curraton of this data, it is hard to not have a user bias in this and begin to restrict or remove certain data points.  OP eliminated this bias by not including it in his official post but then included it because users like you screamed &#39;muh r/politics.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMFAO!  You should feel bad because you do that for a living.</p>

<p>So what your saying is his methodology is flawed.  He should have found a way to discern which users post in both and removed them so as to remove the noise in his data.  Not hard if your programming, look for doubled usernames and remove, no &quot;manual curration&quot; needed.  Okay sure, he added /politics in, still doesn&#39;t mean his methodology isn&#39;t flawed.  His short date range just so happens to coincide with an event that would draw many users from one particular sub.  He counted vote totals and not where the voting was going or even who did the voting (yeah I know, he doesn&#39;t have access to that data, kinda important information to have).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seriously?  Even if every single person who posted in T_D also posted to /politics, you could probably still remove T_D users (It&#39;s 460k vs like 16mil). Which isn&#39;t the case at all, I&#39;d be willing to bet that the vast majority who post in T_D do not post in /politics.  The &quot;overlap&quot; is most likely in the single digits in percentage points.</p>

<p>The only bias is in the OP and how he decided to compile his data.  I&#39;ve seen other comments point out that he doesn&#39;t even show if it&#39;s one account posting 1000x or 1000 accounts posting 1x.  That&#39;s some pretty important information if you&#39;re trying to convince people that an entire sub is brigading here.  It doesn&#39;t take a statiatician to pick this &quot;argument&quot; apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want to remove power-users essentially, or users who make up a large number of votes and comments?  You&#39;re immediately going to bias your data because your removing these people.  If you know what the 80/20 rule is, then you realize that 80% of posts of posts are made by 20% of people.  So yeah, remove those and now you&#39;re inherently bias towards a small portion of your data.  Cool.</p>

<p>Good to see you&#39;re insanely biased and swallow T_D talking lines like no other, it&#39;s helpful to see the type of person you&#39;re &#39;debating&#39;</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re attempting to remove users who comment often.  You realize that all your comments and votes would be distilled into one, right? I&#39;m sure you have multiple opinions even in the same topic.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>He linked the source code, literally in the OP.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re dumb or trying to subvert to a different topic, but either look is not flattering on you.  My take on this is that it has been clearly pointed that T_D post often and hard here and you don&#39;t like how that looks.  Prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be. There are two outcomes. Either trump is a good president and we all win (even hillary in her concession speech wants a good president and the crowd applauded. So it&#39;s not just her speech writers who thought that is important to say). Or he will be a bad president and liberals get another turn in 2020.</p>

<p>like the right accusing Hillary and Obama of being demons? The same way the right jokes about people like that, the left jokes about people calling trump hitler. There are parallels but Hitler and Göbbels are way out of his league :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has always been more of an overlap here with the Donald as mutual users.</p>

<p>The reason of brigade perception here being more focused on anti-trump subs such as /politics is because those user tend to not be Conspiracy theorists in any way shape or form outside of Trump is Russia!</p>

<p>You rarely see those users post anything other than anti-trump content where I have seen a totally different behavior from TD users.</p>

<p>Statistics be what they are, the Donald users are more similar to Conspiracy users in almost every metric.  They also tend to deal with other Conspiracy posts not having anything to do with Trump, such as anti-vax posts, without calling everyone retarded or otherwise breaking our rules.</p>

<p>Statistics alone are not sufficient to explain this phenomena.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huzzah! Love that closing quote and quite agree! One statistic I want to point out. In one week we had 1127 comments from anti trump sub users. 866 of those were in one day. That&#39;s 76%. I imagine the great majority of the remaining 261 comments occured on august 2nd. </p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> users, by and large, avoid this sub. Most of the reason for this is because of the massive T_D presence. This is unhealth for the sub because it becomes an echo chamber where only one side is heard, and the other side is censored. Politics is also at fault for this. The vocal left has taken a very aggressive stance in the past 6 months, which is understandable. But that very same aggressive stance has caused T_D users to rally and push back. I think if we get more users who take a thoughtful, non-confrontational approach like this, and T_D stops immediately stonewalling <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To expand on those numbers. the 261 comments are spread out over 6 days. Even if one could assume that those were evenly spread across all 6 days, the average is 43.5 posts per day. That&#39;s 20 times more activity than usual.</p>

<p>One thing that should also be considered. Politics can&#39;t go to <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. T_D will ban anyone who posts anything counter to the narrative they have established. And I&#39;m not talking about just downvoting it into oblivion. You will never be allowed to post there again. I imagine most people in politics are already banned. Thus, this is the only place they can go and discuss the NPR story without discussing it in an echo chamber.</p>

<p>I am anti-Trump on almost every issue, but according to this criteria, it sounds like I would be labeled a the_donald user.</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;m anti-Trump I don&#39;t post in the anti-Trump subs because they&#39;re almost all Shareblue shit holes. And because of Shareblue, at times the_donald is the only source for certain kinds of news, so I have found myself posting there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, read what I said again. Sometimes t_d is the only place on Reddit for <em>certain</em> types of news. For example, during the election, as a result of the CTR censorship, t_d was one of the only subs posting about Hillary&#39;s FBI investigation and Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Currently, t_d is the only sub where Seth Rich news makes it to the front page. I don&#39;t support Trump, but due to Shareblue controlling Reddit, I have found myself posting in t_d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done some work with data analysis, so I may be able to speak to this. When you&#39;re doing analysis against a large data set, you have to devise some sort of criteria for sorting. There has to be a cutoff somewhere. There just not really a practical way to analyze every single person&#39;s intent. Take me: I&#39;ve made a couple of very neutral posts in the_donald, many more posts in anti-Trump subreddits, and have a long history in a variety of subreddits. There&#39;s no neat category for me. What matters is that the aggregate numbers across thousands of users give you a general feeling for what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>And I can tell you having the data in front of me that there is a huge amount of users that post in both the_donald and poltiics.</p>

<p>I pick randomly 5000 users and out of those 1760 have posted both in politics and the_donald.</p>

<p>Now lets look at the average upvotes in politics for these users: 336.76</p>

<p>vs the avg upvote of those that didn&#39;t post in the_donald: 587.50</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not unheard of and it&#39;s not easy to determine who is a supporter of whom just because they posted in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s kinda my point about people who post in T_D. Just by having posted there you can&#39;t say if they are a supporter, opponent, or somewhere in between. Simply having posted some place does not mean any of the above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And concerning your second part: Didn&#39;t some philosopher once say that if you act like a fool all the time you are indistinguishable from a real fool?</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s undeniable that the_donald is heavily invest in the seth rich thing and every time the_donald is on a seth rich posting brigade it also gets brought up here. That&#39;s not a coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, here we go. Someone on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> making fun of conspiracies. Seth Rich was a story here completely independent of T_D. Hell, I was a Sanders voter, and we want his murder solved as well.</p>

<p>The Seth Rich conspiracy is not foolish, but you&#39;ve tipped your hand. Good day. </p>
