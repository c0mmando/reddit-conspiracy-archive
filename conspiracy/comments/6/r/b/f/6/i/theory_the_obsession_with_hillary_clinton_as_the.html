<p>What&#39;s more likely? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a massive cabal running everything behind the scenes which is both highly competent (subverted the whole government and all agencies) and incompetent (constantly leaves clues in plain sight and is unable to conceal the simplest things) and somehow centered around Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Trump is an incompetent idiot and his fanclub tries to make us believe that all his failures are the fault of the Deep State &amp; Hillary. </p>

<p>Clues:</p>

<p>Constant &quot;predictions&quot; by &quot;anons&quot; that get hyped up but never turn out to be true. </p>

<p>Massive spamming internet forums with pre-packaged talking points and key words &quot;HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH&quot;.</p>

<p>Desperate attempts to tie literally everything that gets some media attention into one, huge conspiracy. &quot;DEPRESSED ROCK STAR KILLS HIMSELF! THIS IS CONNECTED TO SETH RICH&quot;</p>

<p>etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that I am right. I&#39;m just asking you to apply some logic and skepticism and look back critically over the last year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because someone is not convicted does not mean they aren&#39;t a criminal. It just means our justice system doesn&#39;t apply to the wealthy and powerful. HRC has destroyed many lives, is responsible for the deaths of US citizens in Benghazi,  and yet still walks free. All the while people are being thrown in jail for smoking a joint. </p>

<p>My point here is our justice system doesn&#39;t mean shit when it doesn&#39;t apply to powerful politicians. So to use the fact that she&#39;s never been convicted is an invalid argument.</p>

<p>&quot;Inner city youth are predatory and have no sense of morals and must be brought to heel&quot; - in reference to Bill&#39;s crime bill in the 90&#39;s responsible for mandatory minimum sentences for minor drug offenses.</p>

<p>&quot;We came, we saw, he died! Hahaha&quot; - in reference to Gaddafi</p>

<p>&quot;What difference does it make anyway?&quot; - in reference to all the Americans who died in Benghazi</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s my turn to be president!&quot; - at a rally during her campaign, in reference to her opinion that she deserves to be president for no reason..</p>

<p>Still want to defend this lady?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can. I&#39;m not saying she&#39;s a mass murderer. What I&#39;m saying is that there have been many people who were very close to the Clintons who have died under VERY mysterious circumstances at very convenient times for the Clintons. That statement can&#39;t be proven false; Vince Foster and Ron Brown are two great examples of this. </p>

<p>Look at what the Clintons did to Haiti. They took most of the money that was donated to help Haiti and they also took control of Haiti&#39;s mining all under the guise of charity. Haitians absolutely HATE the Clintons and for good reason. And Hillary&#39;s little friend Laura Silsby (changed her last name to Gaylor after the incident) was caught trying to flee Haiti into the Dominican Republic with a bus load of children and was stopped and arrested by customs. Thanks to HRC&#39;s connections, she got off scott free and is now working for the company that issues Amber Alerts. Hillary is shady as fuck and should be in prison, if not for any other reason that for using a private server and sending/receiving classified information on that server.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it very disrespectful and incredibly shallow the way people didn&#39;t even give Trump a chance. I am Trump-neutral as well, but I remember going into work the day after the election and seeing some of my coworkers visibly wrecked by his victory and hearing them already talking about impeachment. All I could think to myself was &quot;get a grip people&quot;. The president is NOT the most powerful person in the world. Also, what has he done so far that has directly affected your life on a personal level? Yes, he mandated the travel ban. Yes, he recently banned transgender people from the military (which I don&#39;t even think will work). But seriously, the worst thing he has done so far was the middle strike on Syria (in my opinion). I have no tolerance for our imperialist foreign policy.</p>

<p>Let me just say this, there have been books written about the Clinton crime family that were published before Hillary began running for president. Do you think there would be all these books, documentaries and other sources describing the Clinton&#39;s crimes if there weren&#39;t at least some truth to them? People don&#39;t just make this shit up for fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When has Hillary been called that? I think you&#39;re exaggerating a bit. If you know anything about her political history, then you would know that morality is not exactly something she&#39;s concerned with... at all. I&#39;m not going to make a list of examples of this, but I will suggest you look into her being fired from the Watergate Investigation by Jeffrey Zeifman (although snopes will say this is false. If you think Snopes is a source for truth then we should just end this convo now. They are part of the censorship brigade). </p>

<p>Simple logical deduction can be applied here too:</p>

<p>Most politicians our corrupt.
Most politicians lie.
Most politicians say one thing, but do another.
Hillary Clinton is a career politician, therefore it can be deduced that she more than likely is a dishonest and corrupt person. (By the way, this applies to most career politicians, I&#39;m just using HRC as an example).</p>

<p>Trump has been called Hitler, a Nazi, racist, sexist, misogynistic, and a big orange pimple. Hillary is not the only one who has been demonized and criticized.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy figured it out! Donald Trump is an idiot! He has been president for 6 months and his idiocy is responsible for all the worlds problems. There is not global cabal. The UN is your friend. Soros is just a nice grandpa. Close the sub guys the truth is finally out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First we have to prove evil exists, which we can&#39;t. So we can right away say we cannot prove Hillary is evil.  Is she corrupt? I have seen much to prove to me that she and her foundation are extremely corrupt. I am not going to sit here and list all her transgressions. We all have google and a brain.</p>

<p>Now can we prove trump is an idiot? I would say we cannot. Despite the spin of the media it is clear to me Trump is intelligent. He has done more in his life than anyone who has ever criticised him. So what does that say about his critics if he is this lumbering idiot?</p>

<p>I think OP&#39;s post and &quot;argument&quot;,  as you call it, is weak and unresearched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has done more then previous presidents? Then Mark Cuban? Then Elon Musk? Then 2,3,4 star generals and admirals? Color me surprised.</p>

<p>He is a great conman, probably one of the best to ever do it. I wouldn&#39;t say the spin of the media is against his intelligence. I&#39;ve listened to him speak when he was running and now as president and it is clear he says things people want to hear. Otherwise, he is a poor grasp on grammar, syntactic structure, and cadence of speech. He is a lame duck in his presidency already, having passed no bills through except for EOs where he literally overturned Obama&#39;s orders for the sake of the fact that they were Obama&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of Hillary as the source of all evil. I find these from revelations interesting at the least. Reads like Clinton to the t. </p>

<p>&quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/18/hillary-clinton-says-ready-come-woods-st-patricks-day-speech/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/18/hillary-clinton-says-ready-come-woods-st-patricks-day-speech/</a></p>

<p>&quot;And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/08/hillary-clinton-made-a-rare-appearance-at-the-color-purple-and-got-3-standing-ovations/?utm_term=.3621bdbf199d">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/08/hillary-clinton-made-a-rare-appearance-at-the-color-purple-and-got-3-standing-ovations/?utm_term=.3621bdbf199d</a></p>

<p>&quot;For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it funny when topics like this come up.  Switch the names around (The obsession with Donald Trump as the source of evil is a pysop to distract from the failure of Hillary Clinton) and OP would be cheerleaded and congratulated five ways to Sunday. </p>

<p>Instead what we see is blatent name calling because people either a) can&#39;t refute his claim for whatever reason or b) because they won&#39;t dank internet points and think it&#39;s cool to call x, y, or z a &#39;shill&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending Hillary in this one; to say she isn&#39;t corrupt would be a lie.  However, Donnie Boy is not so clean in this either.  He has shown himself to be a lame-duck president within the first 6 months of office, which has to be some kind of record. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Constant &quot;predictions&quot; by &quot;anons&quot; that get hyped up but never turn out to be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People make claims constantly, the loud trumpeting that Clinton was 98% likely to win comes to mind. And those were people with names and reputations, not just anonymous persons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Massive spamming internet forums with pre-packaged talking points and key words</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like Correct the Record or Shareblue, organizations literally a part of this &quot;massive cabal&quot; you claim is so unlikely. What do you imagine this cabal would consist of, if not the collected group of international movers and shakers? Billionaires, media sources, alphabet agencies, etc. They didn&#39;t subvert anything, the power structure for a ruling class has basically always existed and it has always been attempted to be exploited by members of that class. To deny this in favor of &quot;Trump is just an idiot, there&#39;s nothing behind this curtain&quot; is short-sighted at best and openly disingenuous at worst. </p>

<p>Also, Seth Rich was killed under unknown circumstances, while being connected to damaging information about the Clintons. This is hardly the first such death. Decrying people wanting to know more about it is distasteful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Desperate attempts to tie literally everything that gets some media attention into one, huge conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say desperate, some people brought up that idea (or other ones about Chester being Podesta&#39;s son, shit like that), but I don&#39;t think anyone continues to think of that is true. Just discussion of an idea, which is okay and should be encouraged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that I am right. I&#39;m just asking you to apply some logic and skepticism and look back critically over the last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would also suggest everyone do the same. Look at the way Hillary was treated by the media vs how Trump was treated, watch Obama tell Trump to stop whining and pull on his big boy pants, that no one can hack a U.S. election, followed by months of russian scaremongering, watch undercover videos of CNN employees saying that it&#39;s mostly bullshit or a nothingburger, everyone should look into the DNC emails, and everything else  wikileaks has released. And look back further, at where Tim Kaine came from, and why Debbie Schulz, Hillary&#39;s former campaign manager, took his place at the head of the DNC which proceeded to rig the primary against the actual contender Bernie Sanders, look into who cheated at the debates and which news agencies helped her cheat. And then you can legitimately ask yourself if there is maybe an undercurrent of power and corruption.</p>

<p>I would also suggest looking into an uncovered real-life example of a shadow government: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59z1le/breaking_korean_shadow_government_uncovered/">South Korea</a>
And once you&#39;ve done all that, if you still think Trump is an idiot, that&#39;s fine, they&#39;re not mutually exclusive ideas. But for sure, there are always people working behind the scenes working unpalatable means for nefarious ends.</p>
