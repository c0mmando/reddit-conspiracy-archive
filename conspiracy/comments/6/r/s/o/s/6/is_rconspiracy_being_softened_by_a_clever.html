        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed this sub becoming more and more government friendly lately. Every other post speculates about or makes claims of some major government action that would/will &#39;bring down the pedos&#39;  or &#39;drain the swamp&#39;. </p>

<p>Just because a narcissistic billionaire &#39;outsider&#39; was elected president does not mean that the real decision makers behind closed doors have changed. Why would they want to cause civil unrest in any capacity when they wield so much influence under our current system? </p>

<p>I have a theory that this sub is being attacked, not by downvoting bots, but by a shrewd marketing campaign to keep us waiting for Uncle Sam to fix our problems so that no-one takes the initiative themselves to attempt to make a difference.</p>

<p>History has shown us what happens to Presidents who actually try to fix our broken system. Don&#39;t look to your oppressor as your savior. The people who are benefiting the most from our current political system won&#39;t help us change it because it does not behoove them to do so. </p>

<p>All we can do is facilitate the spread of knowledge. And I don&#39;t mean hit strangers in the face with a 20 pound conspiracy hammer. I mean plant the seeds of independent, investigative thought in the minds of those who already have a tendency toward critical thinking and they will work toward logical conclusions on their own when they are ready to accept their implications. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant. Just some thoughts I&#39;ve had for a while and wanted to share with some like minded individuals.</p>

Who can stop corruption unless you only hire incorruptible people and keep them forever. Politicians are corruptible by nature. They have to be in order to be able to push their agenda. They all flip flop with how they think the wind is blowing. It&#39;s impossible to have an un corrupt government, there&#39;s just no way to keep account over that many corruptible people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a loaded word at all, he was very obviously pandering. If you look at who he&#39;s hired and what he&#39;s done, it&#39;s pretty obvious that he&#39;s not an ally to the conspiracy community. The Trump campaign saw a group of people that is normally ignored by other politicians, and they seized an opportunity to get their votes with no intention of following through on their promises. It&#39;s the definition of pandering</p>

<p>The few times MSM gets featured on the sub is when it&#39;s for breaking news or developments that are too big to ignore, i.e., Trump Jr&#39;s emails, Flynn resigning, Rod Wheeler lawsuit, etc. </p>

<p>Even then there&#39;s always claims of it being &quot;fake news&quot;. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, screenshots from 4chan and various blogs are treated like gospel. </p>

<p>I just cannot understand how people can advocate for war, when just in the last few years we had the chance to watch live, 24/7 how a once prosperous country is getting destroyed.

    <div class="md"><p>Some people want war. Some of them just want chaos and destruction, but this is fortunately the minority. But there are others, people who want war to get away from their shitty life, who are already disappointed and angry. These people are the pawns in the chess game.</p>

<p>Freedom is relative. These people are underpaid, undereducated, and overally underrepresented. They have the least freedom everywhere, anywhere on Earth. With more money, the middle class usually has more freedom, the freedom of education, freedom of travelling, freedom of having spare time besides their job to pursue their dreams. And there&#39;s a higher class, with more freedom (being even slightly famous can get you a lot of things), and above that, the (sometimes not so) secret elite, acting like gods. In a civil war, mostly the two lowest levels are hurt, while the &quot;elite&quot; is playing their games in safety, that&#39;s why I say that a revolution/civil war is counterproductive.</p>

<p>I believe that our only hope is to educate people and help those who are the most vulnerable, this is the only way to stop our puppet masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You people&quot; ? No, see this is where everything starts to go completely off track. For the previous 18 months Trump supporters have been brigading and manipulating any article, comment section or Reddit thread that pertained to &quot;the god emperor&quot;....... And I think a lot of people probably were content and sit back and watch, because they thought there was a possibly that he&#39;d actually drain the swamp and bring some much needed transparency and accountability to Washington.</p>

<p>So here we are 8 months in, and it&#39;s become pretty obvious to most of the non partisans that a lot of those campaign promises were bullshit. I would bet that a lot of those neutral people that were previously up voting pro Trump articles are now kind of disturbed by a lot of what&#39;s been going on, and now when someone challenges something people have different opinions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not bashing this sub at all. There&#39;s a multitude of different opinions here, that doesn&#39;t lessen the quality of this sub....... I think if anything that makes it stronger. </p>

<p>These are kinds of blatantly false statements that I can only assume are gaslighting attempts.</p>

<p>Are you really trying to convince me that a website that has spent the last 18 months turning into the largest anti-Trump echo chamber on the internet became that way because of &quot;td&quot;?</p>

<p>Wow. Is the sky also black in the day and blue at night? </p>

<p>I understand it must be hard to correctly interpret the world around you when every media outlet, social media site, loud co-worker, TV and radio, are all running a psyop on you.</p>

<p>Trump may be complete shit, but the angles that are being presented to you have been created at a 3rd grade comprehension level, and are all easily dismissed when you begin clicking back to the sources being used as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>And dont worry, I also dont believe that Trump is &quot;playing 4d chess&quot; or whatever stupid talking point that is </p>

<p>I see an establishment-led information war being waged against a person who is outside of the Washington DC inner circle.</p>

<p>I see a fall-guy in the making and a gullible population with too little of an attention span and too little critical thinking skills to do anythinf but blindly go along with the ride and the bullshit narratives being shoved down their throats hourly.</p>

<p>And I see a coordinated team of people who already spent 18 months turning this website into an echo chamber, who are now angry that this subreddit isnt falling as easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s total hogwash. This talking point is so easily picked apart that it&#39;s actually kind of scary that it keeps appearing on this sub.</p>

<p>People in this sub have been supportive of specific politicians for as long as it existed. Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, etc etc. There are Bernie Sanders and Trey Gowdy posts on the front page regularly, and Ron Paul used to be a huge topic here. It just so happens that one of those people became President, so a certain percentage of people support the President. </p>

<p>Trump has marketed himself as anti-establishment. Some people believe he is, and a lot of conspiracy theorists are anti-establishment, therefore some conspiracy theorists support Trump. Whether or not Trump is actually anti-establishment is besides the point.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also kind of strange that people here have a selective memory. There are many anti-Trump posts that hit the front page of this sub. Do yourself a favor and search. Many of these people support the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, etc. Many of the pro-Trump threads have comments massively upvoted that are anti-trump, supportive of Clinton, the democrats, etc. These people are also &quot;pro-Government,&quot; yet this is cast aside in these discussions of Trump supporters. Remember that we are talking about the Trump administration versus the CIA, FBI, NSA, the democrats, and even people within the Trump administration continue to leak, so there is a huge divide. If you pick a side, you are &quot;pro-government.&quot; Apparently you are also pro-government is you like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pro Trump threads here outnumber the anti Trump threads by about a 10 to 1 ratio.</p>

<p>Trump may have marketed himself as anti establishment, but how is he governing? Drain the swamp? Yeah right. </p>

<p>So are we judging anti establishment politicians by what they say, or what they actually do? If Obama had filled his cabinet and communications staff with former employees of Goldman Sachs corporate big wigs how would that have gone over? If Obama started hiring people associated with mercenary contractors like Dyncorp or Blackwater how would that have gone over? I&#39;d bet it would have fed into what I perceived to be a strong suspicion of the federal government.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m seeing ( and I could be wrong ) is a massive double standard in terms of the level of scrutiny this government is facing compared to the previous one, in that things that would have been condemned previously are now given a free pass. </p>

<p>Come to find out he was given a list of approved choices by Citigroup.</p>

<p>Criticism of Trump:</p>

<p>I think Mnuchen is in bed with TPTB.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like Tillerson at all until I heard Musk say something along the lines of  &quot;he fights hard for his team and now his team is America.&quot;  I&#39;m still not a big fan but the fact that Trump denied his request to give Exxon special permission around sanctions was pretty relieving.</p>

<p>I think a poor black kid from a single parent home in the projects, who went on to become a friggin brain surgeon, is probably a pretty good choice to run HUD.  </p>

<p>I think Perry is a mook but he loves this country.</p>

<p>I think DeVos getting rid of common core and pushing for more private schools is a good thing (see Brooklyn and Booker).  I don&#39;t like that her brother is Eric Prince but ya know what, I don&#39;t know if I trust the media&#39;s spin on him anymore.  Because the media is full of shit and hates patriotic Americans and because I&#39;ve seen him speak about the Bagdad incident. He pointed out how many missions they completed peacefully but they had a couple of cowboys do one bad thing (fucking terrible thing) that got portrayed as their MO.  I disagree with private armies entirely but his was singled out when others did tons of shady shit as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not crazy, I never said the situation was perfect or that his cabinet was full of angels, but I do believe that right now we need to come together as the United States of America and take our country back from globalists who want to see NGO&#39;s rule the world.  Then we can decide whether we&#39;re happy about the president&#39;s cabinet.</p>

<p>Trump is trying to install people who love this country and want to bring prosperity back to it.  Not international bankers and swamp creatures dying to sell us out.  </p>

<p>IMHO</p>

<p>Did you miss that part?  </p>

<p>First it was Obama and now all of a sudden you&#39;re talking about Hillary?  Hillary is on a level of corruption that surpasses most politicians in history.  Her corruption of not only our government but government&#39;s around the world, her two faces, her foundation, her disdane for the average American, her superiority to the rule of law...</p>

<p>Look, you asked for criticism of Trump and I gave it to you.  Not every single last successful person in this country wants to sell it out, there are still people who love it above all else.  </p>

<p>Do some of those people swindle us?  Yes, they do.  But ya know what?  I&#39;d rather be swindled by people who want to keep it in the family (America) as opposed to those who want to destroy us and take their winnings elsewhere.  Because at least the former need us to be strong in order for them to succeed.</p>

<p>Would it be nice to wave a magic wand and live in a utopia?  Of fucking course it would but we live in the real world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has openly shared his reservations about Vaccinations, JFK, 9/11, the Weapons of Mass destruction lie etc. Do you know of a past President that spoke publicly about many conspiracies? Do you think maybe that has something to do with why this Sub gives him a little more benefit of the doubt, especially since he is only a few months in? Is everyone on this sub just supposed to be blind anarchists? I would like to think that most here hate those that cover up the corruption just as much as those corrupting. When we see a media that courted and propped up the last President for 8 years do a complete 180 on Trump, it tells us that the Deep State most likely opposes Trump. If the Deep State fears him then maybe he has something that can destroy them. The mob powered by the truth is the only thing I can think of that could take out the deep state and harness in the rampant corruption in Government. Regardless I believe most users on this sub understand that both r/politics and t_d are sending troops here and trying to stake claim. r/politics / Shareblue are just seem really bad at it.</p>

<p>This is a patently absurd statement, but since this is your first post here, perhaps it&#39;s because you know very little about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you spend some time looking for posts which demonstrate your case that this sub is &quot;pro-government&quot;, and link them for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh seriously don&#39;t play dumb. How fucking much of this do you expect the users here to take?</p>

<p>Every single day there are dozens of posts about the bullshit nonsense Fox News pushes to distract and disenfranchise people so that Trump and the Republican party can continue to run roughshod over the country, and on the <em>other</em> posts (posts that are actually remotely similar to what&#39;s been popular and pertinent here for the last decade) the mods either delete it using some obscure interpretation of a rule that&#39;s never applied to the pro-Trump spam, or they activate contest mode or some other bullshit to prevent real discussion.</p>

<p>I completely disagree with the sentiment that this place is becoming like T_D 2.0, because at least T_D is honest about their complete cucked subservience to the government and their desire to censor and silence anyone who questions the leadership of their infallible dictator. Here, the pro-government sycophants pretend to have applied some sort of critical thought before deciding that <em>every single person that ever criticises the most bigoted, ignorant, egotistical and incompetent POTUS the internet has ever known</em> is some kind of shill or bot being employed by Soros and the DNC.</p>

<p>In any case, the idea that this place hasn&#39;t been taken over by Rebulican/Trump/Us Government hacks is easily countered by taking a quick glance at the post history for any of the moderators that defend and justify the pro-government circlejerk here. Just go look at their comments, search for &quot;Rule&quot; or &quot;Removed&quot; and see have a look at the extreme amount of censorship that is directed towards popular posts that counter the narrative this subreddit has been taken over to push.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rsos6/is_rconspiracy_being_softened_by_a_clever/dl7pnfa/">the sibling comment</a> to yours that was posted moments after your comment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s someone called &quot;MAGABolt&quot; deflecting any criticism of the Us government and its leadership with the same irrelevant Clinton distraction that has been used to deflect since the election. This is what we&#39;re talking about: this is becoming an overt and <em>constant</em> theme here - every time there&#39;s another big scandal or revelation involving Trump or someone from his party (aka The Government), people that rabidly defend Trump come out of the woodwork posting obscene amounts of the exact rhetoric Trump and his propagandists use to deflect attention from their scandals.</p>

<p>Add to this the use of contested mode or deletions with inane justifications on so many of the big revelations about Trump/Republican corruption, but never on the consistent Clinton spam, and what are we supposed to think?</p>

<p>And then there are so many and such consistent accusations of &quot;bots&quot; and &quot;shilling&quot; coming from the obsequious pro-government posters, but the wildly arbitrary Rule 10 is never enforced against people like MAGABolt below claiming that me and half the commenters here are bots or shills, just because we don&#39;t want to suck the shit out of the president&#39;s arsehole. While at the same time, people who question this pro-government shitsucking are often silenced using Rule 10 as a justification.</p>

<p>Seriously? This is the level of discourse to expect from the mods here on this topic now?</p>

<p>In your last comment you accused me of &quot;a blatantly partisan diatribe&quot; so I linked you to another response that comment received that was, to me, &quot;a blatantly partisan diatribe&quot;, but you seem to have glossed over that to now accuse me of &quot;<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> bias&quot;.</p>

<p>Now being that you&#39;re a moderator here, and you&#39;re in a thread about how this subreddit is being corrupted to support the Republican government/Trump, and you&#39;re levelling explicit accusations of partisan bias at me, can you clarify exactly what &quot;<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> bias&quot; is?</p>

<p>I feel like it&#39;s very important for the posters here to know what constitutes bias in the eyes of the moderators, so please elaborate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascist pro-Trump US government supporters, sympathizers and shills have nearly completed their takeover/neutering of this subreddit.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;MSM&quot;, you ignore the fact that the most obvious, childish and partisan bullshit being spread here comes directly from Fox News, the mouthpiece of billionaire warmonger Rupert Murdoch and the same company that fought to the Supreme Court for their right to lie to and deceive Americans under the guise of news. It&#39;s convenient for the fascist coup that their lackeys are referring to everything except Fox News as &quot;MSM&quot; to discredit the only remaining places trying to hold these evil liars accountable.</p>

<p>And then, at the same time, pro-government fascists (like you) are trying to treat themselves as some kind of counter-culture revolutionaries while they defend the party that controls the entire US government and the petulant wanker currently leading it. </p>

<p>You&#39;re accusing ME of bias while you&#39;re describing in this thread how you&#39;ve RES tagged other pro-government fascists to be able tell who the &#39;good guys&#39; are - as opposed to those who have what you call &quot;<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> bias&quot;.</p>

<p>For the last decade this sub was about tackling actual corruption and conspiracy. If you had&#39;ve been sucking Obamas arsehole while trying to claim to be anti-government, you would have been laughed off this forum. Sure, there were always complete fucking idiots who would spam the Fox News talking points back then - such as Benghazi, birtherism, etc. - but they didnt dominate the page and get used to conceal real diacussion about US government corruption. Now, however, there are a bunch of mods like you, defending the sitting president and his party in any way you can - while accusing others of doing what you&#39;re overtly and explicitly engaged in.</p>

<p>So, mod who hates the government and yet viciously supports the president and the party that controls the government, are you able to clarify yet what tou think &quot;government&quot; is?
And while you&#39;re at it, can you explain how the notorious liars, fascist propagandists and obvious shills for the Republican Party at Fox News don&#39;t get counted as MSM?</p>

<p>Most importantly, though, you haven&#39;t addressed what this thread should be mainly about: you and the moderators who share your pro-government bias are having an extreme influence over the range of acceptable discussion here by using contest mode and worryingly ambiguous rule interpretations to shut down comversations that don&#39;t involve Clinton or the DNC... you know, those people who aren&#39;t in government. </p>

<p>I like this next move by the left. The left are been disingenuous for a long time and everyone knows they have employed online users to support their agenda. &quot;They&quot; believe they can infiltrate a sub and turn it with simple statements like yours above (as in, not the ones invited from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> to help brigade). </p>

<p>Anytime anyone brings the TD conversation in to the mix, it exposes the agenda of trying to &quot;smear&quot; them for supporting the POTUS when all else has failed and they have failed from the beginning. </p>

<p>This sub is responsible for exposing the corruption by the deep state and the Clinton Cartel and it makes sense that they would send their Bot / Zombie army in to try to Correct The Record! </p>

<p>However, can we please address the fact that the pro-government sycophants who are all over this subreddit spamming anything they can to deflect from the corruption and failings of the POTUS are using &quot;bots&quot; and &quot;shills&quot; as way to pretend their toxic partisanship isn&#39;t responsible for the problems they want a dictator to fix?</p>

<p>Seriously, conspiracies aside, how popular do you honestly think Trump is? Do you really believe there isn&#39;t natural and organic hatred and animosity to a man who abused and insulted so many people in his election campaign alone?</p>

<p>This subreddit used to be a place where we could discuss all of the players of the deep state, but now some people want to constrict the discussion to a couple of peripheral people (Clintons etc.) and prevent any discussion about the larger and more deeply ingrained deep-state actors. How many Republican congressmen who are a part of Trump&#39;s government voted for the PATRIOT Act, or to let the TSA strip people&#39;s rights, or to bolster drug laws and for-profit prisons, or to tighten &quot;free speech zones&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you really think that everyone against Trump is a bot? Or do you just <em>want</em> to believe that because then it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re a part of an extremely vocal minority helping the deep state hide their crimes while using a new puppet that will be helpfully defended by self-proclaimed conspiracy theorists?</p>

<p>There&#39;s obviously a ton of people on this sub who disagree, many pro-Trump and many anti-Trump to pick one thing that people can agree/disagree on.</p>

<p>Is there evidence that there are paid shills? Everyone uses this argument that someone is a shill when they say something against their views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not calling anyone a shill. Just saying there may be disinformation being spread that discourages activity by keeping everyone waiting for a moment that won&#39;t ever come. Whether the source is primary or it&#39;s being spread by well intentioned individuals who are desperate for change is beside the point. My main point is that no significant change is likely to come from someone who has a vested interest in the preservation of a system that gives them lots of power and influence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To most people the idea that their all time greatest adversary may have undue influence on their chief executive is a very scary thought.  That makes it extremely newsworthy, particularly to people who don&#39;t trust said executive (Donald Trump has a long standing reputation for being a charlatan and a sleazeball, going back over 30 years - Trump and charlatan were basically synonyms long before even Barrack Obama ran for president).  With all that has come out, it is unreasonable to assume that everything related to this Russia scandal is conspiracy made up by boohoo-ing democrats.  The only way you could possible think that is if you lived in a complete 100% right-wing bubble, basically a fantasy world.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how far Trump himself went, but it&#39;s pretty clear that some ethical lines were crossed by his campaign and family, and probably legal ones as well.  As such, most people are very interested in this Russia stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?  It&#39;s a conspiracy sub.  I&#39;ve been on conspiracy message boards for at least 20+ years and in all that time they&#39;ve always had a disdain for the government and presidents.  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen a conspiracy community so pro-president before and it&#39;s definitely suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, Trump is treated differently than every other president the last 30 years is because he&#39;s unlike any other president. It&#39;s unfair to treat him like he&#39;s bought out by Goldman sachs, or what have you because it&#39;s clear he isn&#39;t. We&#39;re all suciscious of any president but for many of us the most suspicious thing about him is a Russian relationship that is hard to prove anything malice. The anti-Trump attitude here is the same tried boring crap all over reddit. you don&#39;t like him because of the way he presents himself and not on how he governs. People can&#39;t help but thinks he&#39;s sexist, racist, and all other &quot;ist&quot; you label him with and refuse to look at his actual governing and instead are in a perpetual anti-Trump mentality that never stops.</p>

<p>Come on now.  The head of Goldman Sachs literally said (in May) it &quot;generates a lot of inconvenience&quot; having so many Goldman Sachs employees in Trumps administration.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t like him for a number of reasons, some of which you mentioned.  But also because he&#39;s pandering hack with a ridiculous number of conflicts of interest - which should <em>especially</em> concern a conspiracy sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those speculative posts are from the r/donald influx. </p>

<p>A small act of kindness of flytype&#39;s part would accidentally result in a lot of Trump supporters seeking refuge in the often judgemental but open arms of r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I apologize for stereotypling, but these Trumpist hopefuls still believe that deep within the machinations of our government some plan to oust all the bad guys is being concocted which is utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Option B is that these are pro government plants trying to keep people on the hook but sadly I think it&#39;s the former. It&#39;s nonpaid organic idiots who never learned the first rule of conspiracy club.</p>

<p>Do not expect the government to do anything to help. Expect the opposite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK was government. This sub applauds his assassination as the death of a powerful government oppressor I guess. </p>

<p>Or maybe there&#39;s nuance. Maybe there are factions; some of which are more desirable than others. Maybe there really are lesser evils and greater goods. Maybe in a world of impossibly complex and constantly shifting power structures it is still possible to give support to a politician or political faction that can move things in a slightly better direction.</p>

<p>Or maybe we should languish in a simplistically cynical paralysis and commune with the DMT aliens for a spiritual awakening that will solve all mankind&#39;s problems or better yet go [redacted] up shopping malls or something.</p>

<p>But the idea that trump is the deepstates boy is pretty hard to sell when that is the reality. </p>

<p>What i think is more telling is how many of these stupid posts pop up and how quickly the vote counts quickly swing to the anti trump position as soon as certain areas start their work day, almost like a bot farm gets its orders or something...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where was it called out and shit on?  The media fawned over Obama.  Young and diverse cabinet, qualified candidates, the right people in the right places with fresh ideas on how to fix the country.  They blew so smuch smoke up his ass it was it coming out of his ears.</p>

<p>Come to find out he was given a list of approved choices by Citigroup.</p>

<p>Criticism of Trump:</p>

<p>I think Mnuchen is in bed with TPTB.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like Tillerson at all until I heard Musk say something along the lines of  &quot;he fights hard for his team and now his team is America.&quot;  I&#39;m still not a big fan but the fact that Trump denied his request to give Exxon special permission around sanctions was pretty relieving.</p>

<p>I think a poor black kid from a single parent home in the projects, who went on to become a friggin brain surgeon, is probably a pretty good choice to run HUD.  </p>

<p>I think Perry is a mook but he loves this country.</p>

<p>I think DeVos getting rid of common core and pushing for more private schools is a good thing (see Brooklyn and Booker).  I don&#39;t like that her brother is Eric Prince but ya know what, I don&#39;t know if I trust the media&#39;s spin on him anymore.  Because the media is full of shit and hates patriotic Americans and because I&#39;ve seen him speak about the Bagdad incident. He pointed out how many missions they completed peacefully but they had a couple of cowboys do one bad thing (fucking terrible thing) that got portrayed as their MO.  I disagree with private armies entirely but his was singled out when others did tons of shady shit as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not crazy, I never said the situation was perfect or that his cabinet was full of angels, but I do believe that right now we need to come together as the United States of America and take our country back from globalists who want to see NGO&#39;s rule the world.  Then we can decide whether we&#39;re happy about the president&#39;s cabinet.</p>

<p>Trump is trying to install people who love this country and want to bring prosperity back to it.  Not international bankers and swamp creatures dying to sell us out.  </p>

<p>IMHO</p>
