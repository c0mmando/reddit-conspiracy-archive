       Currently? The Coup attempt going on in the United States. It will impact the entire world.

       Overall, I would say the deliberate destruction of morals, values, family, relationships, etc. It seems to be directed and coordinated. It has been done slowly, and is totally degrading society. This is not progress.

       Flat earth. It's easily verifiable by anyone, and it's absolutely massive in scope and implications. Nothing makes you see the matrix quite like it. Second would be WW2. The crass distortion of truth and kosherising of history couldn't be any more shameless. The reality of ww2 is so radically different, that after years of indoctrination one cannot help but have tremendous difficulty accepting it. Third would be the role of jewish intellectual movements and jewish supremacism. The supranational financial elite, political genocidal zionism, the mercantilisation of the world and every aspect of life, erosion of cultural identity, national sovereignty and ethnicity of every peoples in the world, these are all direct outgrows of uncontested jewish supremacism. The latter are all modern phenomena but radical jewish supremacism has been a contanst through the ages and preceded every ill we face now.

       Spiritual warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are being attacked spiritually every way possible. We are being told God isn't real and life is meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are following a satanic path and they don't even realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People's minds are so immersed in garbage that it takes a lot for them to get out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People dismiss that the ultimate conspiracy is spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could relate every conspiracy on this sub to the spiritual attack. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       *9/11 is said to be part of their "rituals" (satanic)
      </p>
      <p>
       *NWO (who do you think will lead it?)
      </p>
      <p>
       *Oversexualization of children (satanic pedophilia)
      </p>
      <p>
       *All the gender craziness (attack on traditional (Godly) gender roles and values. Attack on families
      </p>
      <p>
       *Sandy Hook (another ritual?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you don't have to agree with me. But the op did ask what I thought.

       I would add at lest for me that the Mandela Effect has become highly important to track. I also realize it's very hard to believe but it is what it is.

       I disagree with Sandy Hook and 9/11 being a ritual but the other ones I think your right.

       I think there are a lot of good answers in here and I would agree with the top comment that calls out the banking issues; James Corbett's Century of Enslavement doc does a great job of illuminating the issues we face with the Fed.

       But, for my money, the most important localized conspiracy is the Vince Foster case. I think this is because it is perhaps the best documented example of a government cover-up. Because of FOIA lawsuits and a few independent researchers combing the underlying investigatory record, anyone who wants to know how the deep state operates can see it in all its terrible forms in the Foster case.

       I lived at Fort Detrick, MD as a kid (mid 70's). My dad was a lab tech and he wanted out and switch career paths rather unexpectedly and we were moved eventually. His reason, he said was that he could not stand to see the animals used for testing suffer as they do. Not a huge shock as my dad loves animals but it seemed odd. Flash forward, mid-80's, I got to college and came home one wkend with a poorly copied 'underground magazine' which had detailed articles about Fort Detrick and conspiracy theories related to it. I asked my dad about it and he took it from me and very, very uncharacteristically freaked out asking me if I put my address or name on anything or subscribed or anything like that. It really stunned me. I had not and I told him and he took it from me and told me to never ever talk to anyone about any of it. Flash forward, about 2002 - overheard my father and my wife's dad (also ex military) talking about the number of scientists murdered who work at Fort Detrick. I knew if I tried to get in the convo - it would stop, so I lingered and acted like I was not listening and clearly heard my dad say, '..and that's why I knew I had to get us the hell out of there....' Neither my dad nor step father were lock step soldiers and not at all conspiracy people. In fact, my dad would always tell me not to follow leaders and not to have blind faith in politicians, etc. Flash forward, last Winter when I took my dad on a surprise road trip. Just the two of us talking about all manners of subjects that we normally could not. Scandalous stuff about other relatives, etc. The kind of stuff you don't talk about with a parent until they finally see you as an equal. The second I started dancing around tentatively asking him about when we lived on that army base - complete shut down and changed the subject. Later, after a few drinks and chilling out and making jokes and getting to the heart of why I love the old guy - he looked me dead in the eye (we were both fairly drunk) and he told me that he knows I am not stupid - but there is no good reason to ever dig into that shit and he did what he did for you and your mother and sister. He was teary eyed and I just let it go. I waited to see what else he would say, but he didn't say anything else. We crashed and woke up the next day and I decided I didn't need to find out any more.

       Prepare to go down the rabbit hole. Fort Dietrich is at the root of a LOT of conspiracies (AIDS, LSA, chemical warfare, mind control, anthrax).
