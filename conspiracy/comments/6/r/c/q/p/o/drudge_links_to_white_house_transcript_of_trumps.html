Great names too like Bill Clinton and his raid on the Social Security system, Harry Reid and his never ending fight for Nevada property owners or even Barrack Obama who in my honest opinion was the most transparent person to ever occupy the Oval Office.  Look how far we have fallen now that Trump came to town. Why anyone voted for him when there was so many honest hard-working candidates to choose from is beyond me. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much for &quot;ending the carnage&quot;, eh? More like, &quot;continue the incompetence.&quot;</p>

<p>The media might be against Trump but they also carried him through the primary with wall-to-wall coverage. And the media being against him is no excuse for the greatest President at everything, ever. If you don&#39;t like the media coverage, find different media. It&#39;s not in short supply. But it won&#39;t make the President a reasonable or competent actor. </p>

<p>Every administration has cons, fumbles, schemes, and mistakes. Nothing is worse than potentially colluding with a foreign government -- largely viewed as a long-time enemy -- in the acquisition of political power. Nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well lets be honest, she should be locked up.. I&#39;m pretty sure any honest investigation would leave them both in hot water.</p>

<p>But i get why the Trump fan base are the way they are.. especially the younger ones. He promised them rid of the corruption they saw. Unfortunately he took advantage of their trust. </p>

<p>The older Trump supporters are a bit more of a mystery to me.. I mean surely at their point in life they&#39;ve realised that politicians routinely lie through their teeth to grab at power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump also created a narrative where anything that didn&#39;t go their way equaled corruption, and he started working on the minds of his base years ago so they wouldn&#39;t trust any media sources and would only believe Trump.</p>

<p>There&#39;s things Clinton has done that are shady as fuck, and probably ethically bankrupt. There&#39;s a ton of reasons not to like her.</p>

<p>But this whole narrative where they secretly run every law enforcement agency in America in nuts. No matter who you are, once you&#39;re being investigated by a big federal agency there are so many people involved it&#39;s pretty damn hard to cover shit up........ It&#39;s one thing if there&#39;s only a couple of investigators involved, but something on the scale of congressional hearings, mass media headlines with thousands of journalists digging for dirt, and hundreds of agents many of which would have republican affiliations? It&#39;s nearly impossible to cover something like that up.</p>

<p>So all the investigations the Republicans have done on the Clintons since the mid-90&#39;s weren&#39;t honest?</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4084578/benghazi-hearing-hillary-clinton-analysis/">She sat for an 11-hour hearing for the Benghazi mess</a>. 11 fucking hours of questioning and testimony. The Republicans were unable to find any wrongdoing on her part. You honestly think further investigations will find anything?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge Hillary fan either but at some point you just have to let shit go, man. Our current President&#39;s daughter is working as an adviser in our White House that we pay for with our tax dollars while she makes millions from her business. The President himself takes trip after trip to properties he owns and spends our tax dollars there to line his own pockets. That doesn&#39;t piss you off even a little bit?</p>

<p>Can you imagine if Hillary Clinton was President and she took a 17-day golfing vacation at a golf course she owned and spent tons of your tax dollars to line her own pockets?</p>

<p>Now that we have the full transcripts, we can tell that previous reporting on it was out of context and misleading (ie fake news!!!). It is much more benign now that we have the full context. Yet, Democrat or die media will exasperatingly pretend it is the Mecca of terrible and proof that earlier misleading exaggerations are supported, not deflated by this.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s a matter of perspective but he isn&#39;t begging. The leaked transcript, if true, kinda reinforces what Trumpsters have come to expect from him. </p>

<p>&quot;and the reason I say they are going to pay for the wall is because Mexico has made a fortune out of the stupidity of U.S. trade representatives. They are beating us at trade and they are beating us at the border, and they are killing us with drugs. Now I know you are not involved with that, but regardless of who is making all the money, billions and billions and billions – some people say more – is being made on drug trafficking that is coming through Mexico. Some people say that the business of drug trafficking is bigger than the business of taking our factory jobs,&quot; Trump added.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of Trump, he is lesser of the two evils. But I don&#39;t read this as too damaging.</p>

<p>So I know the intent is to make Trump appear weak and feeble minded, but I don&#39;t think the Trump Martyrs are going to see it that way. </p>

I guess if I ask somebody for a glass of water, i&#39;m &#39;begging&#39; for it too? They are in a mutually advantageous position. Trump is saying &#39;if you don&#39;t mention the wall, it will put me in a better position to get you a better deal in the long run&#39;. If Mexico has an interest in working with the US in certain capacities, it makes sense to request that. You can&#39;t have good working relationships when one side is making it very difficult on the other to bring something to the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;General Kelly is one of the most respected generals in the entire military system and he is a very fair man, but he is a very tough man. And we have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – is coming from the southern border. So we have a lot of problems with Mexico farther than the economic problem. We are becoming a drug-addicted nation and most the drugs are coming from Mexico or certainly from the southern border. But I will say this – you have that problem too. You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out. We have a massive drug problem where kids are becoming addicted to drugs because drugs are being sold for less money than candy because there is so much of it. So we have to work together to knock that out. And I know this is a tough group of people, and maybe your military is afraid of them, but our military is not afraid of them, and we will help you with that 100 percent because it is out of control – totally out of control.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And talent that wants things to happen. They are dealmakers, they are not obstructionist. We have some of them, but so do you of course. With that being said, if you would like to try and work a deal, that is okay. But if we cannot work a deal, I want to tell you we are going to put a very substantial tax on the border coming into the United States because, honestly, we will not want your products unless your products are going to be taxed. I do not want the products and lesser tax. And what that will mean is factories and plants will start to be built in the United States because the taxes will be too high in Mexico. I do not want to do that if we can work out a deal&quot;</p>

<p>In terms of security, Mr. President, it is clear that organized crime is just as much our enemy as it is the enemy of your administration.</p>

<p>TRUMP
Enrique, you and I have to knock it out – you and I have to knock the hell out of them. Listen, I know how tough these guys are – our military will knock them out like you never thought of, we will work to help you knock them out because your country does not want that. Your citizens are being killed all over the place, your police officers are being shot in the head, and your children are being killed. And we will knock them out.</p>

<p>PEÑA NIETO
&quot;I fully agree that we should work together. And let me tell you that a lot of what is happening in terms of traffickers in Mexico is being largely supported by the illegal amounts of money and weapons coming from the United States. And this has led Mexico to fight against criminal gangs with the participation of the military and the entire army of Mexico. And this has taken many lives within the military and all the elements that are committed in this fight. But they are criminal groups that are well-armed, especially with weapons coming from the United States illegally into Mexico. I fully agree that both governments can work together to knock out and to do away fully with these criminal gangs.&quot;</p>

And btw, I worked for the Obama administration so don&#39;t give me any shit about conservatism.  I just have a brain and can distinguish between partisanship and an actual signal of wrongdoing.  And of course no one believes that all anti-Trumpers are paid, but the half-assed messages are most certainly coordinated.  It&#39;s simply that when people get triggered by Trump they see to abdicate all logic and reason because he incites such an emotional response.  Feelings should not trump logic and reason...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ideologically we&#39;re all partisan.  Bu partisanship should be about ideas and philosophy, not party.  Honestly, if one word (democrat, republican, or otherwise) embodies your political philosophy then you&#39;re an idiot (not you specifically).  In reality I want what&#39;s best for this country and having spent 6 of the last 8 years advising our last presidents team, I can tell you flat out that a continuation of that policy / behavior would be a terrible outcome.  I&#39;ve worked for more democrats in my career than republicans.  I love democrats.  But that does not mean that many of them 1. have no idea what&#39;s really going on, while simultaneously posting their feelings to message boards, and 2. have an alternative agenda that may be deleterious to the nation.  By the way, the same is true of many republicans, I just require proof to direct that assertion at a specific person.</p>

<p>When I see actual proof (not papers pontificating based on anonymous sources and then retracting or correcting stories) of collusion or some other crime I will be the first person calling for action.  But I refuse to lob wild accusations for months on end with no actual signal.  What&#39;s being done right now is the opposite of Watergate.  Watergate took months and months of quiet reporting to build a real case and then some great investigative journalism to eventually connect all the dots all the way up to the president.  Right now &quot;leakers&quot; and the media are throwing out every possible charge on the front page in order to deliberately rile people up against an elected official they don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s fundamentally unamerican and painful to watch.  I didn&#39;t serve my country for this shit.</p>

<p>And I will not walk any of that back.  There is proven child trafficking and abuse by those in high levels of political, economic, and social power.  This is also not a partisan issue.  Dennis Hastert was jailed for it.  Jimmy Saville (good friend to the crown) was proven guilty postmortem, Epstein was imprisoned, it goes on and on.  Several inquiries in the House of Commons and Lords have been stalled or flat out railroaded.  Why would that be?  I&#39;m casting light on shadows, not throwing gas on a fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, it&#39;s certainly on purpose, and then I explained why. I&#39;ll be clearer: I don&#39;t acquiesce to the requests of people who cannot control their anger. It&#39;s pretty basic, really. You&#39;ll come to find that much of the world is the same way. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s adorable. Instead of admitting defeat you wrap your excuse for withdrawal in a concocted imaginary martyrdom of retreating because your opponent was some sort of &quot;angry&quot; that you made up in your head. </p>

<p>It seems from your comment history that this is quite a common capitulation for you. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t argue your case like a man, don&#39;t slink away in such a pathetic guise. It&#39;s embarrassing. Now tuck it in and toddle along. </p>

<p>Not going to pander to an amateur who can&#39;t debate any longer. I think anyone reading this thread in future will see who had their chord struck. And from the looks of you&#39;re comment history, it seems arguments are something you&#39;re not familiar with winning. </p>

<p>Best of luck little guy. Especially with your &quot;doctorate&quot;. You&#39;re going to need it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There aren&#39;t any comments in this thread defending or explaining this for Trump. How refreshing. Just a couple people calling OP a shill. As to be expected. So I guess the Trump folks just have to suck it up and admit they got punked on the wall. So far you&#39;ve been punked on the two main cheers at the rallies. Locke her up and build that wall. It&#39;s almost like he was just saying what ever the crowd wanted to hear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m confused.</p>

<p>did anyone actually believe mexico paying for the wall was a real thing?</p>

<p>the wall itself is a fake thing.</p>

<p>the law mandating it was passed originally while clinton was still a senator. she voted for it.</p>

<p>it disappeared from public notice because most of the land along the boarder is privately owned. much of it has been in the same families since before the civil war. they refused to sell because they would loose their water rights to the rio grande, the middle of which is the actual border for most of its the length. they would also loose their ability to cross the river to graze. some of the deeds actually include land across the river. the fed govt tried to force sales via eminent domain and all hell broke out. in TX you had ranchers all the way in OK saying they&#39;d come down to defend it. texan politicians, state and fed, are the ones who quietly killed it.</p>

<p>people who want stupid fucking wall live predominantly in the deep south. TX, NM, AZ should all threaten to take the land of alabamans...oh yeah, they don&#39;t own any. first it was owned by planters, now it is owned by perdue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, his supporters did and still do and think Mexico will literally hand over a check.</p>

<p>Never mind the fact that they were planning on using tariffs to pay for it which Mexicans are totally going to not pass on the to consumers, right?</p>

<p>No wonder Trump loves the uneducated. Who else would fall for this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me translate for u. What Trump is saying is wouldn&#39;t u rather pay X billion dollar for the wall than double or triple that in economic policies ill place in trade? And he is not begging he is telling him that if he continues to use press to attack him, he will stop negotiating and implement economic policies against Mexico.  It was a threat to walk away from the table. And then they came to a mutual agreement and moved on. Where is the begging?</p>
