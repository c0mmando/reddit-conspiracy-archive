<p>Something has been bothering me about Julian Assange since his absence after they cut his Internet. He has become increasingly erratic as far as his posts go. WikiLeaks has seemed more one-sided and less objective than it has ever been. However, every time I get involved in a conversation pointing it out, I catch a lot of flak and in this case I got banned. My gut telling me the whole organizations been subverted in some fashion and is being used as a PsyOp.</p>

<p>Everything about him has been wrong since he&#39;s been back. Am I crazy?</p>

<p>would it be easier to Clone Julian Assange or to threaten him into conforming to the Trump narrative?</p>

<p>Also Assange might just be doing these things to get himself and his organization talked about because there&#39;s huge news on the horizon and the more erratic he acts in the build up to the newest revelation the bigger impact it will have as he proves he was only masquerading as a Tump support to draw up attention.</p>

<p>Your first post ^</p>

<p>If truth were your only agenda you&#39;d plaster your personal information for all the world to see and you&#39;d want to have every moment of your life recorded so that you can show others just how dedicated to truth you are and how sincerely honest you are. You would also wear a lie detector at all times to prevent yourself from being capable of deception as well.</p>

<p>My personal opinion based on your last 3 comments is that your agenda is to prove how much time you&#39;ve spent researching conspiracy theories and to prove that your iq is above 150, congrats. mission accomplished.</p>

<p>So you think they cloned people and then made an executive order to stop cloning people or they said nobody can clone human beings and then began cloning human beings?</p>

<p>Your second post ^</p>

<p>That&#39;s not evidence that people have been cloned, that&#39;s an article that has the laws surrounding cloning in the united states as it&#39;s main focal point but I don&#39;t see any evidence. I&#39;ve only skimmed the article reading every first and last sentence, I&#39;ll reread it but this article was too long for you to read before you commented so if you haven&#39;t read the full article before and bookmarked it for later i&#39;m going to assume you just googled cloning in the united states and copy and pasted that link because it looked solid. I&#39;ll comment back after I finish the article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st video- Obama saying we shouldn&#39;t clone human life<br/>
2nd video- never see anything more than 2 tiny blobs on a screen that we&#39;re told will become humans. I mean it&#39;s like a 10 cell organism on a screen with a 6 celled organism next to it with people in white coats saying this is human life and then we don&#39;t even get to see it progress into twins or whatever those cells will become. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll read the other cloning info but holy shit this looks like nothing more than disinformation. I think you&#39;re being taken for a ride dude, this rabbit hole is littered with bull shit and cow patties every which way which either means it&#39;s disinformation and they aren&#39;t capable of cloning but want us to think they&#39;re capable of cloning or they are releasing bullshit watered down versions of extraordinary cloning capabilities. I&#39;m going to say for myself it seems much more likely that this rabbit hole conspiracy theory of cloning is a deliberate operation meant to indoctrinate intelligent people into defending ridiculous ideas so they&#39;re easily targeted and dismissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  That is exactly the behavior I&#39;m trying to point out. He used to say here&#39;s the documents make up your own mind. Here&#39;s hard proof that X happened. But he was absent from the Internet for I believe several months and incommunicado. During that time anything could&#39;ve happened but he miraculously popped back up online and really acted like nothing happened. Since then, he is taking hard sides on different issues and is far less Objective than he ever was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if he was actively colluding with Trump. It seems like too much of a stretch. Now, people around Trump?  Operatives like Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, or even Michael Flynn, I can see that.</p>

<p>Roger Stone is the obvious one, as he publicly talked about his &quot;back channel&quot; with WL and did briefly work on Trump&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>As far as Russia, I think where there&#39;s smoke - there&#39;s fire. Someone at the Russian FSB once told reporters that they could destroy WikiLeaks. That was many years ago. </p>

<p>Since then, WikiLeaks has barely published anything on Russia and one of the times they did, they <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/wikileaks-syria-files-syria-russia-bank-2-billion/">censored information about a $2,000,000,000 transfer from Syrian to Russian banks</a>. Clearly, they are at the very least willing to protect Russia. Which is more than what can be said about other countries.</p>

There is a lot of specifics and alot of our democracy being scrutinized with a magnifying glass, which I actually feel has been long needed. He spent his life dodging and exploiting loop holes that only now that he&#39;s president is it ever going to come to light. Which makes me think, why the hell did he ever want to run for president?

These fucking people put her out because it was her turn not because it was rooted in anything reality. I was a liberal and and a Democrat until that bullshit went down. It was a hard red pill both sides were a fucking illusion that did what they wanted when they wanted and only looped people in when it help to get them in power</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d almost take that a step further, and say that the merger has already taken place.</p>

<p>Trump started it years ago with the &quot;Birther&quot; bullshit...... It&#39;s where Trump cultivated his base and I think where he started his campaign. There were about a dozen conspiracy theories about Obama being pushed by right wing media outlets.</p>

<p>Then that started shifting to Clinton when it became apparent that she was the frontrunner for the 2016 nomination. She certainly didn&#39;t do herself any favours, and she fell into that shit head first. By the time last summer rolled around, there were literally a dozen active conspiracy theories surrounding her........ Alex Jones was in on it, Trump was actively pushing conspiracy theories, Mike Flynn was pushing &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, and a lot of the right wing pundits were in on it. </p>

<p>The conspiracy community has basically become an extension of the communications apparatus of the Republican Party. Anyone doesn&#39;t believe me? Look around.</p>

<p>The Ecuadorians are fucking pissed that wikileaks played such a public, and partisan, role in the US election and he may realize his life on the lam may be coming to a close, which puts him at risk at everything from jailtime to an &quot;accident.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing when Ecuador has cover and can say &quot;hey, he&#39;s just facilitating whistleblowers! Transparency!&quot; and entirely another when they are seen as shielding someone who is partisan and actively playing politics with his leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just take this big story from the other day. Seymour Hersh supposedly confirmed Seth Rich was the leaker. A (not so) mysterious recording comes out to undermine a long list of revelations concerning the Trump administration colluding with Fox News. </p>

<p>The recording was a cut and paste job posted anonymously by long-time Republican operative Ed Butowsky weeks ago. Somehow, WikiLeaks was aware of the recording and popularized it within hours of the lawsuit news.</p>

<p>The audio recording was touted all over the web. Two conclusions were drawn:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Credible reporter Seymour Hersh &quot;confirmed&quot; that Seth Rich was the leaker. FALSE. According to the complaint, Seymour Hersh was skeptical of his source. Where is the recording of this part? It was cut out in James O&#39;Keefe style. If Seymour Hersh is skeptical, then it was not &quot;confirmed.&quot; Even stranger, people are talking about how &quot;credible&quot; Seymour Hersh is, but they are not considering his assessment of the source as &quot;not necessarily true.&quot; You can&#39;t have it both ways. You can&#39;t say his &quot;confirmation&quot; is credible but his doubts about what he heard are to be ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>Since Seth Rich was the leaker, there could be no Russian hacking. FALSE. Both things could be true. One doesn&#39;t depend upon the other. This is a huge leap and one that <em>nobody who is thinking at all</em> should make.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you read through the complaint, there are all kinds of interesting things in it. Ed Butowsky was tryng to &quot;shut up&quot; another Republican who had a different view -- for the purpose of getting the narrative out there -- specifically number two above -- which is ridiculously false.</p>

<p>Ed Butowsky had many contacts with the Trump administration. He was a visitor at the White House a few days after the story. He worked with Breitbart and he is friends with Steve Bannon. MUCH more is going to come out. </p>

<p>The Seymour Hersh recording was preemptive damage control. </p>

<p>WikiLeaks is either being played by Republicans or working with them. Six months into the Donald Trump administration it is pretty obvious that he has no plans on cleaning everything up. Yet, WikiLeaks is still stuck on 2016. Why? </p>

<p>If it was their honest intention to bring down HRC, then they should take the win and move onto the next problem -- Trump. But they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>These games are very thick, very fact intensive, and very dirty. Always stop and think. Ask yourself questions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because there is no concrete info, and Assange/Whoever has Wikileaks these days is using the anti-DNC hype to shore up opinion on the current govt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to go digging but I used to have a pirated documentary about Wikileaks, this was a good 4-5 years ago when Assange was still very much Assange. It was indicated that wikileaks receive tons of stuff that never sees the light of day, people just send it there as a sort of anonymous storage house for the record. I see no reason to believe that WL releases everything they&#39;ve got, they probably have some pretty repulsive stuff on their HDDs.</p>

<p>I also see no reason to trust WL. I trust them about as much as I trust ABC, CNN, Infowars, NaturalNews, you name it. Their motivations seem to differ, as WL doesn&#39;t seem to be in it for the money, but I personally think Assange got gotten to right before the whole DNC leak and things were squared up to make sure the Trump bait and switch went off without a hitch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim is that Wikileaks, and I&#39;d assume Julian Assange himself, will never reveal their sources even in death.  People say that&#39;s to protect the sources and protect the family, but if that&#39;s the case then they&#39;re doing a piss poor job of it in regards to Seth.  They&#39;re trying their utmost to play the &quot;we&#39;re not saying it was him, but it was him&quot; game publicly, which makes me believe either WL doesn&#39;t care about releasing the identity of their sources or they&#39;re intentionally obfuscating the actual source by deflecting suspicion towards a dead guy who can&#39;t defend himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found that very, very odd as well. At one time Wikileaks wouldn&#39;t really talk about anything that they were not prepared to back up with evidence....... They kind of just dumped things out and let the masses decide.</p>

<p>But this whole business of hinting that Seth Rich was the leaker completely baffles me if its not to push a political narrative. I mean a lot of people say &quot;Wikileaks can never reveal a leaker because nobody will ever leak again&quot;....... Then what benefit is there in hinting so strongly that it leaves no doubt as to what Assange is referring to? Why not just release information to back up the assertion? </p>

<p>And if he did have information to prove Seth Rich was the leaker, wouldn&#39;t that be a massive blow to the credibility of the American Intel agencies? That&#39;s exactly the kind of shit that is Wikileaks bread &amp; butter, exposing lies or hidden truths in the American Intel community. And Seth Rich is dead, so what repercussions could he possibly face? It&#39;s not like he could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>But then it comes back to &quot; But Wikileaks can&#39;t reveal sources&quot;......... Well for fuck sakes, then don&#39;t hint around that Seth Rich was the source.</p>

<p>My logical conclusion? The only plausible scenario here is that Assange is teasing that Seth Rich was the leaker because it&#39;s politically beneficial for Trump....... There&#39;s just no other explanation, it&#39;s a &quot;follow the money&quot; deal. Who else benefits from this? And the thing is, he doesn&#39;t even need to provide a shred of evidence to back up that Seth Rich was the leaker to achieve the desired result. </p>

<p>&quot;Good morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.</p>

<p>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.</p>

<p>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.</p>

<p>What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?</p>

<p>I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.</p>

<p>Best</p>

<p>Is this... is this not evidence of collusion? </p>

<p>The prosecutor general of Russia is not &quot;some random person&quot;. The options are A) Chaika was acting in official capacity or B) Chaika was using government assets for his own private desire to see Trump elected because he really loved those MAGA Hats. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So from this we know that there is an ongoing pipeline of support from Moscow to Maralago.  They appear to be attempting rudimentary OPSEC so much of what was done is either undiscovered or classified. Hence, you know, Mueller convening the grand juries to discover previously hidden info. </p>

<p>We know that removing the Magnitsky Act was discussed at the meeting.  Not only was this truth trickled by Trump Jr., but Akhmetshin would have no reason to be at the meeting if it were not. This is a violation of the Logan Act, which is small potatoes but points to illegal actions.</p>

<p>We know that the meeting had actionable intelligence from Trump and the Steele Dossier which contradicts Jrs statement as well as Veselnitskaya.</p>

<p>Are you expecting Putin to just say &quot;yes is was me the whole time!&quot;? Luckily the FBI is chugging along despite Trump firing 4 people investigating and threatening to fire more and I&#39;m sure we&#39;re in for a wild Autumn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html">The previously unreported meeting was also attended by Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, Paul J. Manafort, as well as the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to interviews and the documents, which were outlined by people familiar with them.</a></p>

<p>The point of this is that the campaign manager and son in law of Trump would not have attended a spurious meeting out of a feeling of whimsy.  The sex joke was that it takes two to tango, and we know that Trump got something from the meeting as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-lawyer-jay-sekulow-russia-meeting-2017-7">40 minutes after the meeting started, he tweeted about Hillarys emails.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/minutes/135614/trump-sarcastic-asked-russia-hack-hillary-clinton">Trump asking for Russia to hack emails was pretty heavily covered during the election</a> and the timing of that request, 6 weeks after the meeting, raises questions that can only be answered by wild suppositions or an investigation by the FBI. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/4/16090812/trump-russia-sanctions-congress-putin">The whole sanctions thing is weird, you&#39;d imagine that whether Trump is a Russian agent or if he&#39;s the second coming of Jesus he&#39;d happily sign off on more Russian sanctions but instead he dragged his feet on it which is again really suspicious.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d admit that everything up to DJTJrs emails was circumstantial at best, who doesn&#39;t owe millions to Russian banks? At the same time, do you have any doubt that Al Capone was the leader of the Chicago Outift? You know it, I know it, everyone knows it.  And that fucko went down for tax evasion.  </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think Trump is a Russian agent, he was an opportunity by Russia to enact one of it&#39;s lines of effort from &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2016, Assange promised an &quot;October Surprise&quot; for Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>21OCTOBER2016, the internet to the Ecuadorian embassy is cut, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-21/wikileaks-reveals-heavily-armed-police-gathering-outside-ecuadorian-embassy-london">and WikiLeaks tweets that police are staging outside the Ecuadorian embassy</a>. Before the blackout is announced, the WikiLeaks twitter tweeted out 3 codes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pre-commitment 1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd021</p>

<p>pre-commitment 2: Ecuador 
eae5c9b064ed649ba468f0800abf8b56ae5cfe355b93b1ce90a1b92a48a9ab72</p>

<p>pre-commitment 3: UK FCO f33a6de5c627e3270ed3e02f62cd0c857467a780cf6123d2172d80d02a072</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that same day, 21OCTOBER2016, the world&#39;s largest BotNet attacked the internet. it was the one that was novel because it used many &quot;dumb&quot; computers, like microwaves and coffee makers and shit, to DDoS the internet.</p>

<p>afterwards, Assange went dark for a long time, failed to deliver his October surprise. did a couple interviews that <a href="https://youtu.be/ApG1XdI-Dd4">appear to be inauthentic</a>. stopped providing Proof of Life for something like 8 months, which he did periodically by standing on a balcony at the embassy.</p>

<p>the speculation being, Assange was captured that day in October 2016 when they cut his internet, and the 3 codes were the Dead Man&#39;s Switch. the &quot;oh shit&quot; button was pressed, and the internet went down. Assange&#39;s captors then seized the WikiLeaks twitter, and installed a body double who needed around 8 months to learn to emulate Assange and for the plastic surgery to heal. i&#39;d like to remind whoever&#39;s reading this that even Saddam Hussein had body doubles decades ago so fuck off with trying to pretend like it&#39;s not possible.</p>

<p>i also remember some sleuthing found evidence of a black flight off the books that fit the time frame that could have been used to fly Assange or his body back to the states.</p>

<p>this is a saga that has been unfolding for almost a year now, so i&#39;m sure there&#39;s some details that i may have missed. if you know any, share it!</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.&quot; - Julian Assange</p>

<p>It happens in many subreddits. If you&#39;re going to post a comment which is going to be critical, you should try to check the rules to see if it could get you banned.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy seems to be a LOT more tolerant. There&#39;s a Rule 10 here which would get many users banned but don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of the leaks is the information. I get Assange behaviour. When you spent 7 years in isolation, just to help the people wake up. And the only news coverage is how they are colluded with rusia.</p>

<p>I think we will get some major fcked shit to see at some point and I  think this is just the beginning to reach as many people as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d almost take that a step further, and say that the merger has already taken place.</p>

<p>Trump started it years ago with the &quot;Birther&quot; bullshit...... It&#39;s where Trump cultivated his base and I think where he started his campaign. There were about a dozen conspiracy theories about Obama being pushed by right wing media outlets.</p>

<p>Then that started shifting to Clinton when it became apparent that she was the frontrunner for the 2016 nomination. She certainly didn&#39;t do herself any favours, and she fell into that shit head first. By the time last summer rolled around, there were literally a dozen active conspiracy theories surrounding her........ Alex Jones was in on it, Trump was actively pushing conspiracy theories, Mike Flynn was pushing &quot;Pizzagate&quot;, and a lot of the right wing pundits were in on it. </p>

<p>The conspiracy community has basically become an extension of the communications apparatus of the Republican Party. Anyone doesn&#39;t believe me? Look around.</p>
