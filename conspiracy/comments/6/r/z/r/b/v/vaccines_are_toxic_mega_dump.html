In a perfect world vaccines would be harmless and would inocculate the world against all diseases, except we live in a world ran by horrifically evil people. Does everyone think they wouldn&#39;t ever touch vaccines? You know they control big pharma, big agro, create false wars, topple countries, manipulate us through media, poison our food and water and air, yet you think vaccines are untouched? People bitch about anti vaccers as being anti science, but that&#39;s not true at all. Time and Time again vaccines give people allergies, a new article about a negative side effect of vaccines I&#39;d published. The cabal wouldn&#39;t let the public get away with having vaccines without consequence. Sure the vaccines might prevent cancer, tetanus, polio, and others but at a cost. It&#39;s rediculous how people think vaccines are this untouched saint. The companies who make the damn things like Baxter fuck up all the time. There&#39;s even a pro vaccine thread on the front page of this Sub right now. Nothing wrong with likeing vaccines except people blindly accept them like they are an untouched god and it&#39;s rediculous. Obviously they are fucking with the vaccines rofl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally am not against vaccinating. I find it&#39;s a good idea on the paper. What I am against is vaccines the way they are sold, with all the junk they add into them, despite evidence they cause much harm. I&#39;m referring to aluminum in particular, but also mercury, squalene, polysorbate 80.</p>

<p>With such an opinion on vaccines, the big pharma shills will put me in the anti-vaccines camp, which is a strawman. Again, no, i am NOT anti-vaccines, I am pro-safe-vaccination. </p>

<p>I have gathered a good 20 reports <strong>from medical research</strong> by actual researchers, about the effects of aluminum on health. Not research about vaccines on health, but about aluminum specifically. And again, not info from some random blogs, but from research reports by qualified and experienced researchers. They are American, British, French, Canadian, Chinese, Italian researchers. Do they form an international league of vaccine conspiracy theorists altogether or could they be simply reporting the truth ? The research of all these guys converges to the same conclusion that aluminum is basically very harmful. </p>

<p>In other subs, I have been downvoted to oblivion and insulted for commenting plain facts, such as the recent decision by the Swedish gov not to make vaccination compulsory, due to the side effects of mmr vaccines that they observed on their population, and due to the fact it is anti-constitutional. This behavior that I observe on social media only reinforce my personal point of view on vaccines, which is they are unsafe the way they are commercialized today.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks OP for sharing all this.</p>

Everything has side effects, but vaccine side effects are much rather than the harms of vax-preventable diseases. Which is why actual epidemiologists don&#39;t advise skipping immunizations.</p>

<p>FDA conceals serious research misconduct–fraud, deception, even deaths
FDA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the FDA has been concealing from the medical community and the public serious research misconduct; including fraud, deception, avoidable risks for human subjects — even deaths — that occurred in clinical trials. The FDA documents were obtained by Charles Seife, a journalism professor at New York University, and author of several books about deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get caught up in it too when I see people intentionally lying or trolling others by feigning ignorance, and it makes me mad at times.  Then I realized that the anger I felt was actually what the person was trying to achieve, so I have been trying hard to realize it&#39;s ok to not respond sometimes.  I have enough things to worry about in my everyday life without getting worked up about some comment on the internet, so I&#39;ve really been working on letting things slide and not taking the bait.</p>

<p>This is part of the reason why I support Rule 10, and will say so whenever I see it mentioned by people who want it gone.  Just go through any current political topic posted here, of which there are many, and look at the interactions between people.  They&#39;re at each other&#39;s throats in there and the only thing stopping those posts from being just a bunch of people screaming pointless insults at each other is the fear of a Rule 10 ban.  I fully understand the arguments saying it should go away, but I personally support it as a way of cutting down on just thread after thread of people attacking each other.</p>

<p>Good talk though, have a great day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) People can and do sue the manufacturers. See, i.e., Holmes v. Merck. It&#39;s a myth that it&#39;s impossible to sue.
B) The program is funded by a tax imposed on manufacturers. Pharma writes the checks. And they can&#39;t just pass the cost on to the consumer. (The analysis on that one is more complicated, but basically, if they could just raise the price of the vaccine to compensate for the tax, then they would already have been charging the higher price.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holmes is a great example of why the &quot;no one is allowed to sue pharma&quot; myth is false. The Ninth Circuit analyzed the question, following Bruesewitz, and held that plaintiffs (including Holmes) may do so.

<p>They did lose the case, but not because of the VICP. They lost because they didn&#39;t have evidence that supported their claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not accurate. Holmes sued under multiple theories (which is very common). The appellate court explicitly held that they were able to sue on those theories the VICP doesn&#39;t preclude: </p>

<p>&quot;But despite Plaintiffs&#39; protests to the contrary, applying Section 22 to their claims <em>does not leave them without a remedy for their injuries.</em> Plaintiffs alleged eight claims plus a claim for punitive damages in their state wrongful death action. Application of Section 22 <em>affects only two of these claims</em> — the strict products liability and negligence claims to the extent that they were based upon allegations of design defect and failure to warn. Therefore six of Plaintiffs&#39; claims remain unaffected by the Act and each of these provide a possible remedy to the injuries that they suffered as a result of Jacob&#39;s illness and death.&quot;</p>

<p>(Emphasis added.) They lost on those other claims, because they did not have evidence to support their theories--not because they weren&#39;t allowed to sue.</p>

<p>You fell for an anti-vax urban legend. The facts don&#39;t support it. You can let your opinions change to fit the facts, or scream at the facts to shut up--your call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re amateur legal attempts are hilarious. The case says basically you can sue outside but the court is going to push it straight back to section 22 which limits the liability which is the whole point. You are the one falling for pharma propaganda saying there are no systemic problems with the vaccine safety. You also try to take control of the argument as usual by miss labeling someone. Its not anti vaxx its pro vaccine safety get it right and stop with your propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, it&#39;s not amateur. I&#39;m lawyer with trial and appellate experience. You are misreading the case. The court wrote, &quot;Plaintiffs alleged eight claims plus a claim for punitive damages in their state wrongful death action. <em>Application of Section 22 affects only two of these claims</em> — the strict products liability and negligence claims to the extent that they were based upon allegations of design defect and failure to warn. Therefore <em>six of Plaintiffs&#39; claims remain unaffected by the Act</em> and each of these provide a possible remedy to the injuries that they suffered as a result of Jacob&#39;s illness and death.&quot;</p>

<p>The court is not saying &quot;you can sue outside but the court is going to push it straight back to section 22.&quot; It&#39;s saying that you can sue, and only some of those claims are going to be subject to section 22--in this case, only two of the plaintiff&#39;s eight claims were. </p>

<p>The trial court had also held that the plaintiffs had state law claims that &quot;were not preempted by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s the anti-vax myth about the law, and there&#39;s the black-and-white language of the case itself. You&#39;re choosing the myth. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of problems with that. A, as far as I know, he never did any research into whether the vaccines actually caused cancer. So it&#39;s not very persuasive to just post the YouTube video. But since I don&#39;t think there is any good research showing those vaccines caused cancer, I guess you couldn&#39;t find anything else?</p>

<p>B, going back to the same clip raises the same question. Why is this one person&#39;s opinion persuasive to you, when the opinions of all epidemiologists aren&#39;t? Seems like the only distinguishing factor is that he agrees with you. I.e., you&#39;re picking which scientists to trust based on whether they agree with you, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a great vaccinologist, and a great scientist. He was not an epidemiologist, he did not advise parents to avoid vaccination, he didn&#39;t conclude that SV40 in vaccines caused cancer in people, and he was not an anti-vaxer.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t even taking one scientist as credible and discarding the rest. You&#39;re taking one out-of-context video and discarding the rest of his beliefs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s belief-protection. You&#39;re hunting for sciencey snippets you can hold up as support for your beliefs, and discarding all the science that disagrees with you--the vast majority of it, including all the experts, including Hilleman--as not credible. And the criteria you&#39;re using for credibility doesn&#39;t seem to be anything more than &quot;does this guy agree with me?&quot; So Len Horowitz? Credible. Hilleman? Credible unless you look at his work in context. Every other vaccine expert? Not credible. </p>

<p>What would happen if you did what the experts do, and started by looking at the best science rather than hunting for snippets that supported your preconceptions? I think the same thing that happens to the experts--they wind up agreeing that the evidence is overwhelming that vaccines are safe and effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You mean a bunch of people educated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I mean a bunch of people who are educated. Science is complicated, and understanding does require education. Not just a college education--PhDs can spend <em>decades</em> studying to develop their knowledge about even one aspect of the immune system.</p>

<p><a href="https://violentmetaphors.com/2014/11/30/yes-doctors-know-what-theyre-talking-about-refuting-a-common-anti-vaccine-argument/">Here</a> is a piece that illustrates how much there is to know:</p>

<p><em>Without even counting the related fields of physiology, the respiratory system, gastroenterology, histology, neurology, etc, *</em>I came up with 920 hours of graduate education in immunology, microbiology, and infectious disease** – and that’s before ever hitting the wards in 3rd and 4th years.... </p>

<p>And all of that is miniscule compared to the amount of education involved for biomedical researchers in the field who are the ones figuring out these principles. We doctors need to know how to understand and apply those principles, since we don’t have to derive the background information ourselves. A PhD in the field would have easily spent 70-80 hrs/week in class, labs, and reading, at least 45 weeks per year, for about 4 years.</p>

<p>That’s 75x45x4= <strong>13,500 hours of graduate education,</strong> not including Bachelor’s or Master’s Degrees. For a researcher with 10 years experience, that’s a minimum of 13,500 + (2080 hrs/yr x 10 yrs) = <strong>34,300 hours of education, training, experience</strong>.*</p>

<p>Knowledge matters. Expertise matters. You don&#39;t need a college education to be smart or successful, but pretending that actually knowing things isn&#39;t key to understanding fields as complex as microbiology, immunology, and epidemiology is absurd.</p>

<p><a href="https://violentmetaphors.com/2014/04/20/how-the-immune-system-works/">Here</a> is another piece where the author did a very quick overview of how one part of the immune system works. It illustrates how complex the field is, and why google research isn&#39;t adequate to really understand the material. Remember, this is just the overview--each fact unpacks into multiple layers of additional information that an expert would have to understand.</p>

<p>From that piece: </p>

<p>*[T]he immune system has developed two separate arms-the innate and the adaptive immune system. I’ll talk primarily about the adaptive side of the system in this blog-but bear in mind that the innate system also exists and interacts with the adaptive side.</p>

<p>The adaptive side has two arms: the T-cell side (these are cells that were derived from the thymus- a immune organ that sits right above the heart. They have a number of markers that we can identify them with) and the B-cell side. B-cells generate antibodies that recognize antigens in that are floating around in the body; they don’t necessarily have to be interacting with proteins from the body. T-cells, on the other hand, recognize antigens in the context of specialized proteins called the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).</p>

<p>There are two major types of T-cells–CD4+ and CD8+-which we’ll come back to in a minute. The MHC proteins are fairly divergent-there are lots of different types of them.   You may also know them as the “transplant” antigens, because they govern who can be an organ donor and who can be a recipient. For example, identical twins have identical MHC’s and can give organs back and forth with no problem. A child will have MHC antigens, half from the mother, half from the father. If the MHC’s of the parents aren’t too different, they may be able to donate to the child-but another child from the same parents has about a 1:4 chance of matching well with the siblings.</p>

<p>To make matters more confusing, there exists within the MHC, two separate classes- named Class I and Class II.   MHC class I is found on almost every cell in the body, MHC class II is found mostly on cells called Antigen Presenting Cells, however their function is basically the same: they present peptides (small protein fragments) from the inside of the cell to their respective T cell. MHC class I presents to CD8+ cells, MHC class II to CD4+ T cells. The MHC class II primarily presents peptides that the cell has internalized from the outside of the cell (think bacteria and viral fragments), while the class I presents peptides from the inside of the cell (think proteins from viruses replicating inside the cell), as well as “normal” proteins that are being turned over in the cell all the time.   T cells recognize the complex of MHC molecule plus the peptide.</p>

<p>From: Immunity, Vol. 7, 473–481, October, 1997 (Andre´ a Dessen, C. Martin Lawrence, Susan Cupo, Dennis M. Zaller, and Don C. Wiley). 
X-Ray Crystal Structure of HLA-DR4 (DRA<em>0101, DRB1</em>0401) Complexed with a Peptide from Human Collagen II</p>

<p>Here we have to stop for a moment. How does the T-cell or B-cell “know” how to recognize the antigen? It takes roughly 2000 bases of DNA to code for a single T-cell or B-cell receptor (a protein that responds to a signal). There are about 3 billion bases in a human genome, so if every single base of the genome were dedicated to B-cell and T-cell receptors, we could encode about 1,500,000 receptors-which sounds like a big number, but now we are left with nothing to encode the rest of the body. In fact, we have sequenced the entire human genome, and it turns out that it only encodes about 20,000 different genes. Obviously, we have a problem here. We know that there are far more than 2000 antigens, if we dedicated 10% of the coding sequences to specific antigens. The other problem is that if there were only 2000 antibodies available, pathogens could quickly “learn” to avoid those sequences, and the immune system would be quickly overrun-and you would die. This doesn’t happen, so how do we avoid this problem? It turns out that the immune system uses chance to generate diversity. There exists within the genome a series of gene fragments that are recombined to generate a multitude of different specificities. It then sticks these antibodies on the surface of the cell.</p>

<p>How does the body “know” which one to use? It doesn’t. The body eliminates some of the antibodies that react with the body (a process we are still figuring out), the rest are waiting around, waiting for an antigen they recognize to float by. This is not as random a process as you might think. Your body has a secondary circulatory system called the lymphatic system. Fluid that is squeezed out of the blood vessels comes back to the heart via the lymphatics, where it is filtered through the lymph nodes-where the B-cells reside, so anything that is out in the periphery of the body is brought to the B-cells. If a B-cell binds an antigen, even at a low affinity, a remarkable thing happens. The B-cell activates, becoming a plasma cell, cranking out large amounts of the antibody. At the same time, it starts to mutate the genes that make up the antibody. A lot of the mutations reduce the affinity and those cells are no longer stimulated-but some of them increase the affinity for the antigen, and those cells are stimulated even more. As the antigen disappears, the cells are less stimulated, and some die off, but others just go quiet. They are now “memory cells”. The next time the antigen comes around, they are there with a high affinity antibody, ready to be made within a few hours-instead of the several days to weeks that it takes the first time it sees the antigen.</p>

<p>T-cells go through a similar recombination process, but then go through the thymus, where cells that can’t recognize the MHC in the body are eliminated, as well as those that recognize it too well. What we are left with is cells that recognize the MHC with an intermediate affinity. When the appropriate peptide is bound to the MHC, that increases the affinity, allowing the T-cell to “activate”. When CD8+ cells are activated, they release signals that cause the target cells to die, either by their own hand (apoptosis) or by the actions of the T-cell.</p>

<p>This is the mechanism by which we clear most of viruses that infect us that are replicating. What about the CD4+ cells? They are out scouting around, checking the cells of the innate system, as well as the B-cells. When they recognize their peptide antigen, they stimulate the cell that is presenting it to grow and proliferate, as well as stimulating themselves to grow. These cells are at the heart of the immune system. A recent search of Pubmed for CD4 T-cell only returned 86,445 papers on these cells, so it is hard to summarize all that is known about these cells. There are multiple subtypes of these cells, and they are at the heart of the immune system. If anybody remembers when AIDS was first reported, back in the early 1980s, you have a perfect example of what the CD4+ cell does. Without them, (since HIV actually binds to the CD4 molecule and slowly eliminates these cells) you slowly succumb to a variety of nasty infections and tumors that the normal healthy person brushes off without a second thought.</p>

<p>Where do vaccines fit into all of this? The best analogy that I’ve heard is from Dr. Lauren Sompayrac. Think of vaccines as of them as war games. You show the immune system what the enemy looks like, get the troops ready for battle, generate all the weapons you need to combat the enemy, but you hurt your own troops as little as possible by giving them a weakened enemy (like the Sabin vaccine), a dead enemy (the Salk vaccine), a disabled enemy (tetanus toxoid) or, more recently, just a portion of the enemy (Gardasil, acellular pertussis). That way, should they ever encounter the enemy, they don’t have figure out how to fight the enemy and how to make the tools, they just have to pull them out of storage.*</p>

<p>When the subject is that complicated, you&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39;t have much respect for your &quot;college kids are dummies!&quot; response.</p>

<p>It actually does take a college degree, and in fact more education than that, to assess the scientific truth of that claim. The people who have done so, and who have the education, experience, and tools to do so with the greatest odds of accuracy, have found it to be false.</p>

<p>It made zero sense to me that the standard advice is to introduce foods carefully after the age of six months, one at a time, leaving a few days between new introductions, in order to observe for reactions...and then to also recommend that you shoot your infant full of several chemicals in one go, before you even leave the hospital. How are you supposed to tell which one the kid had a reaction to, if they do have a reaction? </p>

<p>(also, the mechanism for vaccine induced autism has already been identified.  gg china:    <a href="https://healthcareinamerica.us/did-chinese-scientists-find-autisms-missing-puzzle-piece-2d50be5b9122">https://healthcareinamerica.us/did-chinese-scientists-find-autisms-missing-puzzle-piece-2d50be5b9122</a> )</p>

<p>CDC&#39;s own data found causation to aluminum/mercury as late as 1999.</p>

<p><strong>7x the rate of autism when exposed at 1 month vs non exposure.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/8zufG7E">http://imgur.com/8zufG7E</a></p>

<p><strong>3 month exposure still showed high associations, even after heavy data manipulation.  ha.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/SbD3U">http://imgur.com/a/SbD3U</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten [CDC], pg. 40:</strong> “…we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes. First, for two months of age, an unspecified developmental delay, which has its own specific ICD9 code. Exposure at three months of age, Tics. Exposure at six months of age, an attention deficit disorder. Exposure at one, three and six months of age, language and speech delays which are two separate ICD9 codes. </p>

<p><strong>Exposures at one, three and six months of age, the entire category of neurodevelopmental delays, which includes all of these plus a number of other disorders</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten [CDC], pg. 44: “Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten [CDC], pg. 76: “What I have done here, I am putting into the model instead of mercury, a number of antigens that the children received, and what do we get? Not surprisingly, we get very similar estimates as what we got for Thimerosal because every vaccine put in the equation has Thimerosal. So for speech and the other ones maybe it’s not so significant, but for the overall group it is also significant….Here we have the same thing, but instead of number of antigens, number of shots. Just the number of vaccinations given to a child, which is also for nearly all of them significantly related.”</p>

<p>Dr. Guess, pg. 77: &quot;So this essentially is a 7% risk per antigen, an antigen is like in DPT you&#39;ve got three antigens.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten [CDC], pg. 77: &quot;Correct.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Egan, pg. 77: &quot;Could you do this calculation for aluminum?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten [CDC], pg. 77: &quot;I did it for aluminum…Actually the results were almost identical to ethylmercury because the amount of aluminum goes along almost exactly with the mercury one.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>congressman weldon detailed CDC&#39;s verstraeten&#39;s subsequent falsification of data by including faulty data sets from completely different regions of the US, in violation of their own study protocol.  LoL.</p>

<p>*=====================================</p>

<p><strong>CDC immunization safety director admits it’s a “possibility” that vaccines rarely trigger autism but “it’s hard to predict who those children might be.” (They’re not even trying.)</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-possibility-that-vaccines-rarely-trigger-autism/">https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-possibility-that-vaccines-rarely-trigger-autism/</a></p>

<p>Leo Smith&#39;s vaccine induced autism is arguably the same as Hannah Poling&#39;s. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;amp;v=3lj5euanY4Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;amp;v=3lj5euanY4Y</a></p>

<p><strong>Research has identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the specific cytokine responsible for autism; IL-6 is stimulated by vaccine adverse reactions (fever, seizures). IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both prenatal and postnatal surges of IL-6 can cause autism. Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.</strong></p>

<p>*=====================================</p>

<p>In scientific experiments, dosages of 100mcg/kg, 300mcg/kg, and 550mcg/kg Al adjuvant cause neuron death, muscle weakness, learning and memory impairment, and pathological behavior changes in animals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735</a></p>

<p>Dosage of 550mcg/kg also caused excessive weight gain (a sign of metabolic disorder). All 3 dosages (100, 300 and 550mcg/kg) also caused numerous signs of nerve damage (observable by microscopy and biochemical changes) and/or abnormal anxious behavior.</p>

<p>All these results together are conclusive evidence of brain damage caused by the same dosages (mcg/kg) human infants receive according to the US vaccine schedule.</p>

<p>Vaccine advocates argue that injected Al adjuvant is safe, based on studies of ingested Al salts. This is unscientific because ingesting Al salts and injecting Al nanoparticles present very different risks. Both the route of administration and the chemical forms are different.</p>

<p>Recent experiments prove that Al adjuvant is transported into the brain by white blood cells. This explains why injected Al adjuvant can be more dangerous to the brain than ingested Al salts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144</a></p>

<p>Vaccine advocates like Paul Offit make false statements about Al toxicity studies. The studies show that ingested Al is harmful at dosages less than half of what advocates claim to be safe.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Immune Activation</strong></p>

<p>A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.</p>

<p>In early life, the brain and immune system develop together. Communication chemicals (“cytokines”) used by the immune system also guide brain development. Immune activation causes surges in cytokine production; cytokine surges during brain development cause permanent brain damage and mental illnesses. The brain-damaging effects of immune activation have been studied extensively. The science is high quality and there is a lot of it. It is well-known that vaccines cause immune activation and can cause surges of many different cytokines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hepatitis B is the &quot;WTC 7&quot; of vaccines. It&#39;s where even normal people should realize that &quot;something is very wrong here&quot;. </p>

<p>Many states force you to pump this 150mcg aluminum containing nightmare into your 7lb baby - which is more aluminum than the FDA says it&#39;s safe - even if mom doesn&#39;t have Hepatitis, making the risk basically ZERO in the US.</p>

<p>It is given by default at birth, unless you have a birth plan specifically denying it, at which point some states may take your baby away.</p>

<p>Oh, and the long term efficacy of this vaccine is shit, so by the time your kid <em>might</em> need it (ie when he starts sharing needles and having dirty sex), he&#39;ll most likely need to get it again anyway. </p>

<p>This vaccine is simply unnecessary for newborns, and discussing it is the easiest red pill for most normies.</p>

<p>After that they can go down the rabbit hole and hopefully choose a proper delayed/selective plan at the very least.</p>

<p>Anyone who defends mandatory aluminum hepatitis B vaccine for ALL kids immediately at birth is an uneducated maniac and they should have no business near your child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, if you do believe in a &quot;grander plan&quot; such as every Pharma company putting hidden carcinogens in <em>all</em> of them.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how you sound like a nutjob when talking to regular people (same goes for 9/11 stuff). This is why you question the lowest hanging fruit to at least open some eyes -- WTC 7, or in this case, Hep B to <em>every</em> kid? What on earth for?!</p>

<p>If we&#39;re just dealing with straight science, and what&#39;s in the vaccines is what they <em>say</em> is in the vaccines, then you need to treat each one on an individual basis.</p>

<p>There are some vaccines I am personally not as against as others. But if you want to stick mercury, aluminum, live viruses, or multiple vaccines at once in a child... I am going to object.</p>

<p>I try to be level-headed and scientific. If there were a <em>solo</em> pertussis vaccine with no aluminum/mercury, for instance, I&#39;d be all for it. Same goes for a solo measles vaccine.</p>

<p>But why aren&#39;t there?</p>

<p>This question does indeed open up the greater conspiracy, but it doesn&#39;t help a young parent with their <em>current</em> decision making, which is highly under time-pressure on top of the 10000 other things to worry about.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let&#39;s say you want no vaccines and your spouse wants them all. That&#39;s a HUGE argument and I wish you the best of luck. My recommendation at that point is read (together!) a book such as The Vaccine-Friendly Plan. It&#39;s at least a decent enough plan to lessen chances of autism, if <em>only</em> for its recommendation of delaying MMR and spacing all this bullshit out.</p>

<p>So it depends on your spouse and how many battles you&#39;re willing to wage, all while trying to eat healthy when pregnant, exercise, pick out car seats, find a decent pediatrician, plan breastfeeding and care, etc etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it looks like the first hepB vaccine given shortly after birth does not contain thimerisol. Children are not supposed to be given vaccines with thimerisol until &gt;6 months of age. </p>

<p>A person can be infected with hepB and have no symptoms of the disease. 9/10 infants that contract hepB are going to be infected for life, as there is no cure. HepB spreads through simple contact - like sharing a toothbrush (or contact with the mother during birth) - so the vaccination makes sense to give to protect an infant from the chance of the innocently contracting a potentially hidden disease that can never be cured and can destroy their liver.</p>

<p>I would recommend getting this first one for sure. I only see benefits. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to look into the effects of thimerisol in the later vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually a reason why there aren&#39;t many &quot;solo&quot; vaccines. It&#39;s literally done that way to boost vaccination rates and reduce costs.</p>

<p>It boosts vaccination rates because someone does not need to make multiple appointments for each and every vaccine, that much is simple.</p>

<p>It reduces costs for parents in the US per doctor visit since you make less trips. It also reduces costs in storage, especially when they are brought to the third world. Is it easier to store 1000 vials that have a mix of 3 vaccines vs 3000 vials(1000 of each solo vaccine).</p>

<p>Finally, because you&#39;re getting a mix, you&#39;re getting less of the &quot;scary&quot; chemicals in total. I put scary in air quotes because having learned about immunizations extensively, most of the stuff in them isn&#39;t scary. Even virus vaccines aren&#39;t usually that scary, a good bunch are NOT live or attenuated virus. A bunch of viral vaccines include proteins from the virus shell...meaning there&#39;s no chance you can get the virus from that vaccine because there wouldn&#39;t be any DNA to do it with.(HPV vaccine is an example)</p>

<p>I know the post is 3 months old, but I didn&#39;t know if you were still interested in this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Safety concerns largely depend on the long biopersistence time inherent to this adjuvant, which may be related to its quick withdrawal from the interstitial fluid by avid cellular uptake; and the capacity of adjuvant particles to migrate and slowly accumulate in lymphoid organs and the brain, a phenomenon documented in animal models and resulting from MCP1/CCL2-dependant translocation of adjuvant-loaded monocyte-lineage cells (Trojan horse phenomenon). These novel insights strongly suggest that serious re-evaluation of long-term aluminum adjuvant phamacokinetics and safety should be carried out.| </p>
