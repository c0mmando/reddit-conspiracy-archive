       I’ve been reading a particular
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210016-5">
        CIA document released under the Freedom of Information Act
       </a>
       , and not only is it pretty darn fascinating indeed in and of itself, but I just came across a particular section that has some downright astounding information when you consider the source of the data and what the data itself says and means:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        27.  Consciousness in Perspective.  Having ascertained that human consciousness is able to separate from physical reality and interact with other intelligences in other dimensions within the universe, and that it is both eternal and designed for ultimate return to the Absolute, we are faced with the question:  “So what happens then?”  Since memory is a function of consciousness and therefore enjoys the same eternal character as the consciousness which accounts for its existence, it must be admitted that when consciousness returns to the Absolute, it brings with it all the memories it has accumulated through experience in reality.  The return of consciousness to the Absolute does not imply and extinction of the separate entity which the consciousness organized and sustained in reality.  Rather, it suggests a differentiated consciousness which merges with and participates in the universal consciousness and infinity of the Absolute without losing the separate identity and accumulated self-knowledge which its memories confer upon it.  What it does lose is the capability for generation of independent thought holograms, since that can be done only by energy in motion.  In other words, it retains the power to perceive but loses the power of will or choice.  In exchange, however, this consciousness participates in the all-knowing infinite continuum of consciousness which is a characteristic of energy in the ever present.  Consequently, it is accurate to observe that when a person experiences the out-of-body state, they are, in fact, projecting that eternal spark of consciousness and  memory which constitutes the ultimate source of their identity to let it play in and learn from dimensions both inside and outside the time-space world in which their physical component currently enjoys a short period of reality.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what all this means is that this is the C-I-fucking-A - an agency that, as everyone knows, is about as cut and dry and “sciencey” and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       given to bullshit and hodge-podging and coming up with weird “woo woo” theories if it doesn’t work and the data’s not real/doesn’t lead to real-world results.  The CIA is into
       <em>
        real shit
       </em>
       .  They may not be the nicest or most service-to-others organization on the planet (read “not at all”), but they don’t fuck around when it comes to pursuing things that have proven themselves to
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       - for better or for worse.  If it’s not real, then it doesn’t benefit their pursuits of accruing more knowledge, more data, and more information that can be used to surveil on and have a decided advantage over whatever citizenry they might be working on or taking down whatever government, country, or corporation they’re interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, this CIA document gives a very clean, cut, and dry, very nuts and bolts calculation…
       <em>
        of the soul
       </em>
       ; of that very phenomenon that, although utterly twisted by the majority of religions, has nonetheless been contentiously touted by so many religious organizations throughout the existence of human civilization.  The soul - its possible existence and the continuance of personal identity independent of the physical vehicle (i.e. the body) - is a topic that has been fiercely raged over for as long as can be remembered, and an entire subculture of die-hard atheists have come up that have defended their perspective with just as much fervor and ardency as the craziest religious zealot.  To be sure, both sides lie in the far extreme of the spectrum, and both sides it seems are pretty far off-base when it comes to arriving at what the truth really is, but the fact of the matter is that both sides have still garnered an absolutely massive following among the population throughout their respective histories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I for one feel that the vast majority of religion is pretty toxic to real and true spirituality and understanding, my point behind posting this OP is to present everyone with a very dry, very academic, very logical, very “sciencey” assessment of a finding which appears to 100% affirm the existence of personal identity independent of the physical vehicle.  According to this info, personal identity does in fact seem to continue on past the expiration of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d at least go with the intel that a FOIA-requested CIA document offers over the proclamations of many other sources anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, the above-referenced CIA document, interestingly enough, says pretty much
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the same thing that a poem I ran across a while back by an esoteric poet named Freeman Broiler says.  His piece
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iQdTpzq.png">
        “The Raindrop And The River”
       </a>
       mirrors to a tee the very thing that this CIA document concludes in its own investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       …Very,
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       interesting indeed.  At the end of the day,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Vk1F2bY.png">
        another poem Broiler wrote
       </a>
       cannot be any more correct as it relates to this particular dynamic in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay.  I guess that’s it.  I found this information absolutely fascinating, to say the least, and just wanted to share with everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers,

       Huh so they suggest upon death our soul loses free will and independent thinking that it gains from our physical body? Sounds fishy, I don't want to lose control of my soul and have it pushed in line with all the other souls out there only to perceive and do what it's told? Not sure I fully understand that.

       I don't think there would be any telling or doing. None of the great consciousness would have free will by my understanding. Maybe a dream would be a close approximation of the experience. You experience it and maybe influence it but aren't in control.

       No it doesn't say that at all. When you die, you retain your thought forms and they still remain independent but it becomes connected to a larger network if you will.  The report over simplifies &amp; glosses over points that makes it seem confusing. &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point in your personal progression, you lose the ability to incarnate as a human (although you can, supposedly incarnate as other types of life, but which, I don't know). But because you did not previously know about the "levels" of existence, that information did not make sense.

       You don't have a soul. You ARE a soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could never "lose control of your soul", because "Soul" is actually referring to what you call "Me". It is your consciousness itself, which will persist, even after you lose your body.

       We are all connected to this source! All connected to a mass consciousness. Carl Jung has done much work on this.

       100%.  Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s actually a bit exciting as far as I’m concerned because of the very straightforward, no nonsense manner that it addresses a dynamic that’s been historically bogged down with dogmatic “because I say so” dogma for so very long.

       If every "spark of eternal consciousness", once disembodied, merges with universal consciousness (which absorbs its memories), and universal consciousness is everywhere and observes everything, then how can it not influence events?  Perhaps because it is so vast as to have no self-interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it's everywhere, akin to pantheism, it is so diffuse and impartial that it cannot be considered to have "free will".  And it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       accommodate the expressions of will of the individuated sparks of eternal consciousness that we call "beings".  The universe has no choice but to remember you.  Everything you do and choose gets encoded into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If free will only arises through embodiment (we are all walking double slit experiments, as the same light particle cannot enter both of our eyes simultaneously), then consciousness can only express free will when it is lensed through living beings, which is implicitly a separation from - or fractal reduction of - the greater eternal consciousness, which, because it is so vast, cannot be said to have free will, or agency (at least in the sense that our limited powers of individual perception can grasp), it simply IS.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to imply that seeking to merge with the eternal universal consciousness - through meditation, or prayer, for example - necessarily relieves us, if only temporarily, of our free will and agency, which can be a relief; but, in order to express our individual will, we must undergo (often painful) separation from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, ominously, those who avoid communion with eternal and universal consciousness, would appear to be the most thoroughly ensconced in their own private world as directed by their personal will (until they die, I suppose).  Taking this further, and seeking to harness and manipulate the greater consciousness in service of one's personal will, would appear to describe the "left hand path".
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems a tautology but what this appears to be implying is that embodied beings, containing (or lensing) sparks of eternal consciousness, enjoy a special property that the vastness of unindividuated universal consciousness can only experience
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And furthermore, that some individuals choose to live a life of voluntary recursive ecstatic communion with the greater consciousness (which is blissful), but this necessitates separation to exercise one's will (which is painful).  Others may choose to avoid or even manipulate this communion and focus their will on a causality bubble of their own making until they die, when, presumably, their consciousness and memories are inexorably absorbed anyway.

       It would seem that universal consciousness necessarily influences events.  After all, universal consciousness

       the events.

      <p>
       I do not see how pantheism has anything necessarily to do with free will one way or the other, but I’m also not sure I’d say that free will exists either.  Regardless, however, although I don’t happen to feel that free will exists, it does not mean that human beings would ever be able to reach the boundaries or limits of our limitations in this life regardless.  As such, I’d say free will exists for humans “for all practical purposes”, but not in actuality.

       It would seem that everything has
       <em>
        already

       been encoded in it from the beginning.  There is nothing to encode if the universe is already everything - which, definitionally-speaking, it is.

      <p>
       I think the greater eternal consciousness indeed simply IS, but I also think, as I said above, that free will is an illusion.  I don’t see how there possibly could be free will in the face of cosmic existence.  God/the universe/whatever you want to call it, being “everything that is”, already IS everything that is or can ever be.  It seems free will cannot exist in the face of this cosmic perspective, for if it did, then that means that it would be existing outside of the influence of the Cosmic Identity…which would then, of course, undermine the existence of that Cosmic Identity as such - i.e. it
       <em>
        wouldn’t
       </em>
       be the Cosmic Identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that there is truly nothing that exists or can exists outside of “everything” (i.e. the Cosmic Identity or whatever one wants to call is) - including free will.

      <p>
       Seems to me that the separation is ever only a separation in “seeming”.  The All is everything there is.  It seems that there is no state under which a thing can do anything that is
       <em>
        outside
       </em>
       of “the everything”.  If there was such a state, then “the everything” would simply not be “the everything”.

       Seems to me The All is both the yin and the yang, the light and the dark, the left and the right hand path.

      <p>
       It’s only a separation in seeming.

      <p>
       I wouldn’t doubt that within a certain context this may indeed be the case.  I further wouldn’t doubt, however, that this isn’t the full story behind the dynamic overall.

       Observers have been asked to concentrate on the double slit experiment to see if they can influence the outcome.  The answer is yes, shown statistically over many tests with different observers.  Experienced meditators exert the greatest influence.  This whole paper is very interesting.

       No information on Freeman Broiler or these poems exists online. In fact, most searches lead back here to you, on Reddit. How esoteric is this poet? Could you post any of his work outside of imgur files? How did you come across his work.

        Who's to say your book ain't like Pynchon? :)
It looks to me like your book was nearly erased from history. Normally books like yours show up on eBay, Amazon or antiquities vendors online, even if only a handful of copies exist. Yours shows up fucking nowhere else, except on the IMDB page for "The God Project". That smells fishy to me, especially when factoring in #1 as a possibility. I don't know how the book fell into your hands, but it seems quite possible that you got really lucky.
B)
Got a smartphone? Evernote has a damn good document scanning feature built in, it uses camera pictures to turn them into scans rapidly.
C)
Some public libraries have scanners! (Bonus: Some of them have proper book scanners!)

I'm not sure what obsession it is that you have with a point that is actually tangential to the main point of the CIA document.  It's a bit weird, and kind of beginning to approach "stalker troll" territory.

       If you have something to talk about directly about the CIA document, then we can get into that.  Otherwise, there's no point in continuing on in this tangent.

       I may be quick to judge here, but perhaps this document of which he cannot refute challenges the very religious beliefs that he was brought up on. Therefore, the only thing that he can go up against is a poem that he can not find reference on. Perhaps they can come in here and reply, if otherwise.

       Sounds like that is indeed what is going on, sir.  This information may be frightening to some.  It lays to waste some of the dogmatic notions that many religions depend upon (whether "bible" religions or "science" religions) to secure faithful adherents.

       I’m not sure because your initiating comment itself is so vague and open ended.  It could mean anything.  You said “This isn’t really new to me.  Actually I understand even more.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean…what does that mean?  What are you referring to?  What do you mean?  What is it that you say you “understand even more”?
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be a doozy of a question that I'm asking, but you made a pretty big (a doozy) of an open ended comment, so I can’t specify what I’m asking about specifically since you didn’t qualify what you were referring to in your own comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what did you mean and were referring to when you said “I understand even more.”?

       Knowing about the soul to a great degree
       <em>
        implies
       </em>
       knowing “about what happens after and such” - at least to some degree. 
 What is it that you say you know where it regards “what happens after and such” as it relates to the soul in particular?  Have you some direct, personal experience with OBEs of some sort (something like
       <a href="https://www.btci.org/consciousness/archive/2012/videos2012/vid3.html">
        Dr. Eben Alexander's experiences

      </p>
      <p>
       For my own part, though some of my own understandings of the soul and of personal identity have come by experiential means, most of my understanding has been accrued via the avenue of logic and rationally thinking things through.  I much prefer the former method, but absent that, I have to contend with the acquisition of information from a slow and methodical sifting through the latter method.

       Well then we’re in the same boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your sources come mainly if not exclusively from your own intuition, intelligence, and logical reasoning, then it seems you don’t necessarily know any more than I do about this dynamic overall.  I mean, of course, your logical reasoning might be far, far superior to mine, and as such, you might have been able to discern far more about the truth than my intellect has afforded me, but it doesn’t appear that you are all
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much further along than myself in terms of your inquiries into the intricacies and inner workings of this cosmos we find ourselves in.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I’m not sure that the response you initially posted when you first commented (“This isn't really new to me. Actually I understand even more. I hope you guys use this on your quest for greater understanding though.”) was entirely fair or balanced.  Perhaps I misinterpreted it, but it seemed to come across as very condescending - implying you knew more than others - and I’m actually not sure that’s really the case.

       The former helps the latter for sure.  I’ve been part of a remote viewing group for a while now.  Won’t pretend I’m any sort of adept at it because I’m not, but I know enough about it to know that remote viewing is a 100% real phenomenon.

I know that one has to be careful, as one can be vulnerable to outside (spiritual) forces while in that state - forces that may not have good intentions and that may take advantage of vulnerable identities - but it seems the ability that the OBE affords one to explore far outside the normal rungs of our abilities is something I’d like to be able to nonetheless do.

       Do I not know more than others? I know that we progress to the 24th to 27th level on death.

       I know that on Earth we have to live our lives as positively polarized as we can. To do this, it breaks down into many different smaller things I'd rather not get into, but you get the gist. &amp;nbsp;

       I believe it's real for sure. It's weird. I think I had a moment of clarity where I had the search query in mind (cleared my thoughts first), focused and then it returned an impression. It was an amazing experience but I'm not sure if I can recreate it. If I could, that's exactly how I'd like to use the ability.

       Yes.  That’s totally fair, and is a concern that should not be taken lightly.  However, if one properly readies themselves intent-wise, spiritually, and with the proper level of focus, it’s said one can be significantly protected against such possible attacks.

       Ah.  Very good to acknowledge and recognize that in yourself then.  Good on you.  I’m personally not sure how adept I would be at staving off any real attacks - although I feel I have enough experience to be able to ward them off to at least some extent.

       Of course you do - but that’s such a moot point.  It’s academic given that
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       knows more than others depending upon the subject being addressed and looked at.  Do
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       know more than others?  Yes - In certain areas.  Do others know more than me?  Yes.  Of course.  In certain areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s what’s called a trivial truth.  As such, it’s something that shouldn’t necessarily be touted or aggrandized because it ends up appearing as an attempt to make oneself seem better than others - a thing that can not only come across as off-putting and antagonistic, but is usually incorrect since we are all part of the same Unity.

       Again, some do, some don’t.  These are generalizations - and the latter generalization you made here, although it seems like it may be accurate enough given how many times it’s been referenced by many sources throughout the ages, still has some serious exceptions that should be acknowledged.

       Of course. That's free will. But it's a trick in and of itself. You shouldn't choose to do bad things to yourself or others. It's the fact that you chose that is what makes you or something bad. &amp;nbsp;

       On one level, I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this.  On another level, it’s the case that some things are considered bad even if the initial intention which set the course of events going wasn’t itself negatively intended, influenced, or initiated.  I don’t disagree with you ultimately, I’m just saying that there are exceptions to the overall rule is all.

       This is tremendous, thank you for sharing.

      <p>
       Also important to note, this report was compiled in 1983. Which means the CIA and Deep State have had this knowledge for almost 35 years, and have probably had time to weaponize psychic cognition and ability into something that could control the population.

      <p>
       By having a large number of Hemi-Sync trained agents, the CIA could be actively shaping and distorting the "Hologram of Reality" (as defined in the document) to show us a manufactured, false reality. The more we allow ourselves to exist in a hypnotic state, the more likely we are to see the illusion and perceive it as real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.... basically the plot of the Matrix. Except the Deep State are the machines.

      <p>
       If you haven't yet, please dig into this document and arm yourself with knowledge. They have a 35+ year head start on all of us. All we can do now is learn fast and try to use their knowledge against those who would seek to enslave us.

       Exactly.  Heck, it’s been said that the CIA has known about the existence of off planet people’s on Earth since at least as far back as Eisenhower’s time.  That’s another subject altogether, but the point is that the CIA’s known about some
       <em>

       deep stuff for quite a long time indeed.

       Exactly this, sir.  Exactly this.  It’s really very unfortunate because these are technologies which could revolutionize the civilization almost overnight if it were released to the public.  Instead, the population has been kept quite far behind in our advancement because of the sequestering of this information and these technologies.

       Bingo.  Problem is that most of us are not aware of the extent to which we live in a hypnotic state.  Most of us think that we are “awake” and take for granted the information we receive is “A okay” when the truth is that we’re usually entirely unaware of the fact that we are often being deleteriously influenced by the constant, bombarding data stream of information around us.

       and the fact that that literally

       that keeps you from being clear-minded, focused, and 100% sober is ultimately harmful to the progression of the individual.  If you can’t maintain a disciplined mind and autonomous level of personal will power - i.e. doing things of your

       I…kind of am too, to be honest.  It seems to give amongst the strongest and most potent validations that I’ve come across for the continuation of personal identity independent of the physical vehicle.  Outside of one having direct, personal, first hand experience, this seems pretty darn solid information.  This is no small thing as far as I see.

       Well, it should be in the mainstream for everyone to know, no?  Yes.  Indeed.  It seems, however, that this is in fact a prison planet we live in - controlled by extremely powerful forces (not all of which are from this planet) who are intent on A) making sure that we remain retarded in our upward growth and forward, spiritual evolution, or B) those forces are making sure that we are driven

       Amazing stuff. Can you imagine what the CIA has figured out since this was written in 1983?

       <em>
        Exactly
       </em>
       .  Hell, if you listen to any talks or lectures by Marine Captain Randy Cramer, or Andrew Basiago, or Corey Goode, Alena Kapulnik, Tony Rodriguez, or Kevan Trimmell, you'll realize that the CIA and other organizations of the like have figured a
       <em>
        loooot
       </em>
       of things out.

       "We already have the technology to take E.T. home."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben Rich said that - former head of Lockheed Skunkworks, home of some of the most high tech, experimental craft known to the civilian population...and that's quite different and far inferior to the craft that are known and used by the SSP - The Secret Space program.
       <em>
        Those
       </em>
       craft have been said to have the capability of going out into the far reaches of the solar system and possibly beyond.

       Amazing stuff indeed.

       As far as the Ben Rich quote goes, do you have any source for this? I can't really find much.

       Of course. Everyone's circumstances are different. It will depend on each individual's personal progression.

       Of course. That's free will. But it's a trick in and of itself. You shouldn't choose to do bad things to yourself or others. It's the fact that you chose that is what makes you or something bad. &amp;nbsp;

       If you're actively making the choice to not live positively towards yourself and towards others, you're essentially making the choice not to ascend, locking you into another reincarnation.

       On one level, I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this.  On another level, it’s the case that some things are considered bad even if the initial intention which set the course of events going wasn’t itself negatively intended, influenced, or initiated.  I don’t disagree with you ultimately, I’m just saying that there are exceptions to the overall rule is all.

       I wouldn’t disagree with that much (if at all).
