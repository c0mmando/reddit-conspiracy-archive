<p>It is overwhelming how much this exact phrase is spammed ad-nausem and it is used so frequently that it looks more like blatant bot-spam. Shareblue levels of spam.</p>

<p>And no, even is the Hersh audio is legit (I&#39;ll wait for a statement from Hersch himself) it doesn&#39;t kill anything. You can scream left and right all day but it doesn&#39;t make it true. Maybe the people endless screaming this at every opportunity are fucking terrified that Russia is real.</p>

As of yet, no part of the Rich narrative has conclusively disproven anything about it. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s true, but if you expect it to disappear anytime soon, you&#39;re just setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>

<p>Ooooh, Don Jr. had a meeting that absolutely nothing came out of, that was set up by FusionGPS, the DNC linked firm.  Ignore Hillary getting special treatment from the DNC and ignore the <em>proven fact</em> that the majority of the MSM talking heads were helping her as much as they could.</p>

<p>Oooh, just a meeting....... Yeah, with a Russian operative that promised to give the Trump campaign damaging information obtained by the Russian government &quot;as part of their continued support&quot; for Trump.</p>

<p>And Manafort and Kushner just happened to attend, they just happened to discuss the sanctions, and a few days later Trump started publicly talking about the secret information that he had about Hillary that was going to be revealed.</p>

<p>Nothing came of it though, lol....... That&#39;s a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, factually speaking, even the possibility of an alternate source of the DNC emails is enough.  </p>

<p>Not to mention we have the recent Awan arrest.  A guy who&#39;s apparently worked on capitol hill for years, and is a criminal who had access to secure systems.  </p>

<p>I keep going back to the bar you set with this whole thing.  Think of the repurcussions of picking a fight with Russia.  First of all, MSM has hurt the Trump administration and the country with it&#39;s repeated parroting of unproven russia histeria.  That in itself is ironic because the accusation is that Russia sought to undermine the US.  We&#39;re doing it ourselves!  </p>

<p>Second of all, consider how a normal criminal trial works.  A person is given the benefit of doubt.  In order to be found guilty of something, a person has to be proven beyond reasonble doubt of guilt.  If you&#39;re accused of a crime, and there are multiple other people who coudl have possible committed the crime and not you, you can&#39;t be found guilty.  </p>

<p>Russia has not been found guilty of anything.  And yet we&#39;ve put sanctions on them and set some very dangerous precedents here.  </p>

<p>There are people so heavily invested in muh russia that they would stop at nothing to prevent alternate narratives from coming to light.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the story here.  You have seth rich, an un proven possible source.  It&#39;s not debunked, because you can&#39;t simply debunk it without knowing the source.  </p>

<p>You have the Awan brothers who are sending people&#39;s emails offsite to their personal server, and committing various felonies while bleeding the government of money... That stuff is documented.  Foreign actors breaching secure systems, documented... That should be the #1 story in the news.  </p>

<p>All of that without claiming any conspiracy theory at all, just simple facts and logic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why Hello, friend.  </p>

<p>Trump Jr?  Totally seperate from other allegations of collusion or hacking.  Actually quite the joke when somebody brings it up.</p>

<p>Flynn?  Oh man... he got paid 50k to attend a russian event.  Of course one then goes to how Bill Clinton got 500k at a russian event, but in any event, Flynn is as these kids are saying a &quot;nothing burger&quot;  </p>

<p>Flynn talking sanctions isn&#39;t quite as nefarious as some make it out to be.  Consider that there&#39;s still no basis for the sanctions.  There&#39;s no proof of russia doing anything.  Nothing is proven... And therefore the sanctions are illegitimate to begin with.  Flynn is put in a position where he&#39;s got to interface with counterparts from around the world, so of course that topic is bound to come up.  </p>

<p>Just as you can easily pull up that video of Obama telling some diplomat &quot; i cant do anything now, but when im president...&quot; GEEZ&gt;... I don&#39;t remember Obama being put on a cross about that, do you?<br/>
  Exactly... non issue.  NEXT.  </p>

<p>Manafort + Kushner.. you know, I have nothing to say.  I&#39;m not even a staunch Trump supporter and I don&#39;t know anything about either of these guys.  </p>

<p>Suffice to say that if there was evidence of wrong doing, it would be known now, but alas... We&#39;re still waiting on evidence to prove any of these allegations.  </p>

<p>So tell me again what I was not even close about.  Nobody has proven the source of the dnc emails.  Nobody has proven seth was not the source.  And then we have the awan brothers caught breaching secure systems...  Quite the shit show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump junior? No, you see it wasn&#39;t just Trump junior, it was also Trump&#39;s campaign manager 
( Manafort ) and his closest advisor Kushner going to a meeting because they were promised damaging information to use against Clinton that was coming from the Russian government. It&#39;s just a coincidence that the sanctions were also discussed at the meeting, and that Trump started talking about secret information about Hillary that was going to come out shortly after the meeting? </p>

<p>Flynn offered evidence for immunity. That speaks for itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we&#39;re basically talking about to catch a predator.  Except instead of showing up to diddle kids he&#39;s showing up to get a certain kind of information, but they don&#39;t have that information.  </p>

<p>And let me guess, the sanctions you mention have nothing to do with the ones for the alleged hacking or crimea?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly amazed people are still talking about that considering the dirt on hillary and the dnc that also came out of it, and how the lawyer was linked to fusion gps.  </p>

<p>Then of course the co founder of fusion gps was slated to testify before congress but backed out.  Weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except you and I can&#39;t say if they had any information or not. I mean, you could just take Juniors word that there was no information but is that a reliable source? They only lied about not having ANY contacts with Russia like what, 50000 times? The fact that he showed up at all proves collusion, and the fact that he brought Trump&#39;s campaign manager ( Manafort ) and Kushner with him proves that everyone was in on it. </p>

<p>The sanctions involve billions worth of Russian assets in America that are frozen, and potentially hundreds of billions more that could be frozen under the Magnitsky Act.</p>

<p>Fusion wasn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>And this has nothing to do with Hillary. Nobody here likes Hillary, you guys need to understand that...... But Hillary&#39;s corruption has nothing to do with this, this is a seperate issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sorry... If your story is BOMBSHELL!!! TRUMP JR MEETS WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER TO GET DIRT ON HILLARY!!!</p>

<p>And then you immediately have to pivot away to another topic because nothing happened with Hillary, it&#39;s a dead end as far as smearing Trump.  Now, the idea that the whole thing was a setup.  Tha&#39;ts pretty fucking juicy.  </p>

<p>Makes alot more sense than b b b but he went to meet a r r russian!</p>

<p>Actually would make perfect sense if all the russia shit is fake.  DNC gets breached.  They come up with a plan to blame russia and smear trump at the same time since he&#39;s been speaking highly of putin.  </p>

<p>Makes more sense than alot of shit we&#39;ve seen in recent months.  I mean, it&#39;s worked... look at whats happening 8 months after the fact.  </p>

<p>THE DNC got caught running a rigged election and possibly all sorts of other nasty shit.  COMPLETELY undermining us democracy.  And they&#39;ve effectively kept people from taking a few seconds to contemplate that the election system is a sham and these pieces of shit are exploiting it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Hillary...... Blah, uranium, blah Clinton foundation, blah blah Pizzagate....... Lol.</p>

<p>All investigated to death ( without Obana stepping in and firing the FBI director ) with no criminal charges. Oh, but that&#39;s not good enough, because anything that doesn&#39;t go your way is obviously a conspiracy........ And that is the definition isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>No set standards, if Trump does it there is no problem big if Hillary does it she&#39;s guilty! Lock her up! Just imagine the howls of outrage if Obama had fired Comey when he was investigating Hillary, but when Trump fires Comey there&#39;s nothing but excuses....... Why is that?</p>

<p>Oh well. If you&#39;re still defending the indefensible at this point, I suspect you&#39;ll still be crying Pizzagate when orange Donnie is headed to prison....... Sure, he&#39;ll try to pardon himself, but it&#39;s not going to work and it&#39;s going to provide some great laughs when he&#39;s trying desperately to do anything he can to stay out of prison.</p>

<p>The only real question left is what the indictment is going to be that brings him down? I mean the obvious guess is the assistence he received from Russia, perhaps even from Flynn&#39;s evidence that he is giving in return for immunity....... But personally, I think his past business dealings is going to be his Waterloo. Here&#39;s a guy that refuses to release his tax returns, with decades of business dealings with some very shady characters. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Bayrock group? You will when Mueller is finished his investigation...... And that&#39;s just surface level shit, just wait until Mueller and his all star team of prosecutors starts digging in...... All of those Russian real estate deals, Trump university, it&#39;s all going to be sifted with a fine toothed comb. That Florida mansion that he bought for $40 million, then sold four years later to a Russian oligarch for $100 million? Well, good ol Mueller is looking at that too..... And we&#39;re going to find out why that Russian oligarch spent $100 million on a mansion that he ever even visited, and is now going to tear down.</p>

<p>So yeah, Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets get an important thing clear here. Im not a Democrat, Ive never liked Clinton, I did not vote for Clinton or Bernie, and yes she should have gone to jail. This isn&#39;t a one side or the other issue like all the Trump supporters are dying to make it. People can think both these groups are corrupt. </p>

<p>Moving on.... Trump is the president now. Not Clinton, Lynch, Brazil, Blitzer, or Cuomo. He is the one thats leading the country and making decisions that influence everyone. Someone thats not involved in the Gov anymore can take a spot in line behind the people in office RIGHT NOW. If your house is on fire you don&#39;t ignore it to fix the bathroom pipe thats been leaking. </p>

<p>My proof is literally everyone that matters saying it happened. I can also see the gaslighting, brigades, disinfo campaigns, etc all over social media. 2+2=4 not 5</p>

<p>Yeah you&#39;re right, lets forget about the illegal unmasking, deleted subpoenaed emails, DOJ/FBI collusion, and focus on something that is completely unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>You have no proof of anything which is why you claim you don&#39;t need any.  Well here you go son, here is some actual proof that the intel agencies saw ZERO collusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t even attempted to explain your comments to me, you disappeared then started posting the same unfounded garbage in other threads.</p>

<p>So you have seen no evidence that Putin and the Russian government were directly colluding with Trump to undermine Hillary Clinton and &quot;hack&quot; the 2016 election, because according to you that&#39;s how investigations work.  </p>

<p>But, whoever ignores this evidence that you haven&#39;t seen (because according to you thats how investigations work) has half a brain.</p>

<p>You just rattle off a bunch of names that mean absolutely nothing and expect people to be impressed?  Have you heard of any of them?  Quite a few have gone becore congress and were found to have <em>not colluded with Russia to help Trump in the 2016 election</em>.</p>

<p>The only evidence and testimony that has been presented in all of this has shot down the collusion narrative at every turn.  The heads of all major intelligence agencies testified before congress that not only was Trump himself not under investigation but that there is zero evidence to show any Russia-Trump Campaign collusion.</p>

<p>And you say you never heard of those names but also that they&#39;ve testified there&#39;s no collusion?  They haven&#39;t testified because they have lawyers and they&#39;re all trying to get immunity.</p>

<p>No current official has testified that there is no collusion. There was testimony that Russia interfered, and no one is disputing that. Comey said Trump wasn&#39;t being investigated til Trump bragged about obstructing justice.</p>

<p>Really, I can&#39;t understand why people in a conspiracy sub could so staunchly defend an authoritarian president. </p>

<p>Implying that this isn&#39;t exactly what this sub does whenever some vague he-said-she-said tidbit about Rich comes out, in lieu of any actual confirmation from Wikileaks (who claim they need to stay true to their client confidentiality policy, and yet have no problem with strongly hinting he was the leaker). </p>

<p>I realize that you <em>want</em> the Russia narrative to be dead, but just look around you and it should be pretty obvious that it&#39;s alive and well. As of yet, no part of the Rich narrative has conclusively disproven anything about it. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s true, but if you expect it to disappear anytime soon, you&#39;re just setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why Hello, friend.  </p>

<p>Trump Jr?  Totally seperate from other allegations of collusion or hacking.  Actually quite the joke when somebody brings it up.</p>

<p>Flynn?  Oh man... he got paid 50k to attend a russian event.  Of course one then goes to how Bill Clinton got 500k at a russian event, but in any event, Flynn is as these kids are saying a &quot;nothing burger&quot;  </p>

<p>Flynn talking sanctions isn&#39;t quite as nefarious as some make it out to be.  Consider that there&#39;s still no basis for the sanctions.  There&#39;s no proof of russia doing anything.  Nothing is proven... And therefore the sanctions are illegitimate to begin with.  Flynn is put in a position where he&#39;s got to interface with counterparts from around the world, so of course that topic is bound to come up.  </p>

<p>Just as you can easily pull up that video of Obama telling some diplomat &quot; i cant do anything now, but when im president...&quot; GEEZ&gt;... I don&#39;t remember Obama being put on a cross about that, do you?<br/>
  Exactly... non issue.  NEXT.  </p>

<p>Manafort + Kushner.. you know, I have nothing to say.  I&#39;m not even a staunch Trump supporter and I don&#39;t know anything about either of these guys.  </p>

<p>Suffice to say that if there was evidence of wrong doing, it would be known now, but alas... We&#39;re still waiting on evidence to prove any of these allegations.  </p>

<p>So tell me again what I was not even close about.  Nobody has proven the source of the dnc emails.  Nobody has proven seth was not the source.  And then we have the awan brothers caught breaching secure systems...  Quite the shit show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t even attempted to explain your comments to me, you disappeared then started posting the same unfounded garbage in other threads.</p>

<p>So you have seen no evidence that Putin and the Russian government were directly colluding with Trump to undermine Hillary Clinton and &quot;hack&quot; the 2016 election, because according to you that&#39;s how investigations work.  </p>

<p>But, whoever ignores this evidence that you haven&#39;t seen (because according to you thats how investigations work) has half a brain.</p>

<p>You just rattle off a bunch of names that mean absolutely nothing and expect people to be impressed?  Have you heard of any of them?  Quite a few have gone becore congress and were found to have <em>not colluded with Russia to help Trump in the 2016 election</em>.</p>

<p>The only evidence and testimony that has been presented in all of this has shot down the collusion narrative at every turn.  The heads of all major intelligence agencies testified before congress that not only was Trump himself not under investigation but that there is zero evidence to show any Russia-Trump Campaign collusion.</p>

<p>Go watch more CNN and be comforted by anonymous sources clinging to a dead story.</p>
