For the same reason the drastic climates so close to eachother in california snow, desert, forests, all in the same state.  this also proves flat earth. </p>

<p>If the sun is so far away I dont see how moving a few hundred miles on earth is going to change our perspective. It&#39;s hard to fathom how big 93 million is. 93,000,000.
thats 1000 x 1000 x 93.  the 800 miles distance between california and oregon is less than 1% of the distance to the sun supposedly. </p>

<p>try it yourself you can scale this experiment unlike the earth globe with water sticking to it. Take a light source and line it up with another object blocking the light source, like an eclipse. now measure your distance from the &quot;total eclipse&quot; now move left or right 1% of the distance from the light. did the eclipse change? probably not. </p>

<p>Yes, it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the same reason the drastic climates so close to each other in California snow, desert, forests, all in the same state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is due to changes in altitude and weather patterns which move both heat and moisture around differently. Also the extreme latitudinal length of California.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the sun is so far away I dont see how moving a few hundred miles on earth is going to change our perspective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sun might as well be fixed in the sky at that distance, it&#39;s the <em>moon</em> that appears to shift.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s another experiment. Put a penny on the floor on the other side of your room then come back to your computer. Now, look at the penny with 1 eye open and hold your thumb out at arms length to cover your view of it Now switch to the other eye. Is your thumb still covering the penny? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres what I want you to try during the upcoming eclipse. </p>

<p>When the eclipse is at its apex the sun will be completely blotted out and stars will be visible. </p>

<p>When this happens look North and phone a friend in Asia (Where it will be night and stars are visible) have them also look North. Compare what stars you two see. </p>

<p>On a globe earth the both of you are looking in the same direction and will see the same stars. </p>

<p>On a FE you will be facing opposite directions and will see different stars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>good question. it&#39;s questions like this that everyone should be asking there are so many flaws in the globe earth model. I think regardless of FE or globe if we are both looking north we are looking at the same stars.</p>

<p>How about this one.. why haven&#39;t the constellations changed shape over their existence of 1000s of years? you would imagine that the stars are not connected to eachother in orion or the big dipper why do those constellations still draw the same image? naturally things in space are flying around freely, but now they are also in formation? it&#39;s too complicated to be true. occams razor</p>

<p>Not if you subscribe to the typical FE map. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why haven&#39;t the constellations changed shape over their existence of 1000s of years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say look up bernards star, it moves dramatically over just a few years. </p>

<p>The constellations have changed, alebit slightly. There are records of there being no North star for example, there was just empty space. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you would imagine that the stars are not connected to eachother in orion or the big dipper why do those constellations still draw the same image?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of drift would you expect to see?</p>

<p>Imagine it like this, because the distances involved are so large. If you want to hike to a mountain 5 miles away and you take one step forward would you say you havent moved because the mountain appears to be the same?</p>

<p>Same deal here over a thousand years we have barely moved in the reference to cosmological scale. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>naturally things in space are flying around freely, but now they are also in formation? it&#39;s too complicated to be true. occams razor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they arent, just look at our closest celestial bodies. The Orbit of mars is a prime example of this in action, its actually one of the reasons geocentrism was abandoned. On a FE Mars takes an orbit that does dramatic loops through the air. On a globe heliocentric model its path makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>So occams razor, is mars doing insane loops or is it orbiting a star in the same solar system as us?</p>

<p>No... We have started being able to view extra solar planets orbiting those stars and the gravitational effects they have on their neighbors, much more than balls of light. </p>

<p>You can buy a consumer telescope that will let you see that the planets in our solar system arent balls of light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so about stars you see what you think is moons orbiting a planet. I agree that can appear to be what you see. But how do you know. I see things on television all the time, thats a projection. It&#39;s not really there. it&#39;s just an image in the sky,  or on my television for example. 
what I&#39;m getting at is what you see may not be what is really there because you can&#39;t get closer and touch it. Mirages are another example of this. The bible says the earth is realm of Satan. So it&#39;s not far fetched to think that the sky is a projection of sorts to collaborate with nasa&#39;s stories because after all they are getting their order from Satan. not directly of course. </p>

<p>I find it funny that your whole  belief in the earth being a globe is resting on something you saw in a telescope? you are ignoring vast other amounts of evidence we are on a flat plane not a globe. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t see the curve.. for one. water doesn&#39;t stick to globes. where is the experiment for that one? do you know the radius of the earth? it&#39;s only 3900~ miles. we should be able to see the curve at 100,000 ft with amateur balloons but we dont!!!!!!! answer that one. thats the biggest thing not some telescope.</p>

<p>so about stars you see what you think is moons orbiting a planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bible says the earth is realm of Satan. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im a Jew... awkward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it&#39;s not far fetched to think that the sky is a projection of sorts to collaborate with nasa&#39;s stories because after all they are getting their orders from Satan. not directly of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its actually very far fetched. I honestly dont know how you made that jump...</p>

<p>Please look up bernards star. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find it funny that your whole belief in the earth being a globe is resting on something you saw in a telescope? you are ignoring vast other amounts of evidence we are on a flat plane not a globe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not the only reason, Im just pointing out I can see other celestial objects and they are round. You have yet to <strong>prove</strong> anything, you just keep saying things and expecting me to just believe them on faith. </p>

<p>How do you know is Satans realm? How do you know NASA is receivng orders from Satan? How do you know the sky is a projection? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can&#39;t see the curve.. for one. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah you can... Why do boats disappear from the bottom up? Curvature. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we should be able to see the curve at 100,000 ft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for when it does, but I have a feeling you ignore that. </p>

<p>Just so we are clear you have no response to Bernard star, the orbit of Mars, the fact that every celestial body we can see is a globe, boats disappearing over the horizon? Am I missing anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked up bernards star. I dont think that proves anything. I told you anything through a telescope is not proof. Because you are making an assumption of what you see. Since you cant go there and touch it. get it now?</p>

<p>did you really just say the thing about boats going over the curve? do you know you can use any camera or your beloved telescope to make the curve disappear? if you zoom in a boat going &quot;over the curve&quot; it will reappear again. also your peripheral vision is alot wider than your forward vision so we should be able to see the curve  in our total field of view, but of course we do not.</p>

<p>About you asking how I know it&#39;s satans realm, or how I know this or that.. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m questioning everything and these are what my questions have led me to. It&#39;s ok to not know things for sure, thats why the nasa story is so appealing. They claim to know everything. The point is if mainstream media told us we dont know everything about our world . more people would turn to god and this is the opposite of what satan wants... obviously he&#39;s trying to fill up hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right, it makes no sense unless you&#39;ve been indoctrinated successfully. they also try to pretend that the shadow from the moon is going to get smaller somehow, even though no shadow in the history of shadows ever did that</p>

<p>but to be honest it does not prove the earth is flat. it only proves something is drastically wrong with the model they trying to feed us</p>
