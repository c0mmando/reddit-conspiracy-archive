They will be called to answer, but only if we keep calling them to answer.</p>

<p>But they haven&#39;t been called to answer. Most abuse was hidden away and abuse is still happening. Some cases eventually came to light but others were covered up with priests being moved, victims paid off, records destroyed and worse. Just because a strand of light was shone on a tiny corner of the church&#39;s darkest secrets does not mean everything was revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These so called elected leaders should be followed and hounded until they&#39;re so scared and ragged that they&#39;ll do the jobs you think you elected them to do? </p>

<p>Quit giving them money? Take away their cars, jets, their mansions? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how you stop Pederasts in your religious sanctuaries - stop attending. The faster those church seats empty out the faster you neuter the source of prey, money and power.</p>

<p>The movement of your spiritual life is much more mobile than your witch doctor priests would have you believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate your opinion on this. So many people are stuck with the idea that you need a go btw to talk to God. People can pray in their own home and become closer to God that way, especially if churches are so riddled w horrific bad actors. 
This is part of the power struggle though. There&#39;s the learned and the ignorant. The ignorant need the learned to bring them closer to god. I&#39;d say 90% would wake up if they took a psychedelic but that&#39;s another rant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a creator is all powerful then creation itself makes a much better place to worship. Spirituality shouldn&#39;t have walls, doors, locks and language that requires interpretation, IMHO.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want to derail the gist of the thread but we could reduce crooked politicians by removing crooked religious people in our communities. </p>

<p>In our small community we have a mayor voted in that doesn&#39;t even live in our community! He got more votes because his religion is crooked as hell and his crooked flock would see business thrown their way thru their church! To hell with the law, right?</p>
