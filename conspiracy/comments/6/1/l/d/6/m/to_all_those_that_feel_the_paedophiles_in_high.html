       Have a look at what is happening in my church at the moment. 30 years ago people in power were molesting children and people without power were doing their best to stop it. If a powerful multinational organisation like the Catholic church can be called to answer by their least powerful adherents then so too can the political elite of the west.  They will be called to answer, but only if we keep calling them to answer.

       If you have money and have power you can do anything without fear of being tried, include raping children. You just have to see the Church, how many rape cases are silenced, and see what happens with Pizzagate. It's disgusting, this world is going to shit and we really do not know how to stop it.

       But they haven't been called to answer. Most abuse was hidden away and abuse is still happening. Some cases eventually came to light but others were covered up with priests being moved, victims paid off, records destroyed and worse. Just because a strand of light was shone on a tiny corner of the church's darkest secrets does not mean everything was revealed.

       These so called elected leaders should be followed and hounded until they're so scared and ragged that they'll do the jobs you think you elected them to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quit giving them money? Take away their cars, jets, their mansions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how you stop Pederasts in your religious sanctuaries - stop attending. The faster those church seats empty out the faster you neuter the source of prey, money and power.

       I really appreciate your opinion on this. So many people are stuck with the idea that you need a go btw to talk to God. People can pray in their own home and become closer to God that way, especially if churches are so riddled w horrific bad actors. 
This is part of the power struggle though. There's the learned and the ignorant. The ignorant need the learned to bring them closer to god. I'd say 90% would wake up if they took a psychedelic but that's another rant

       If a creator is all powerful then creation itself makes a much better place to worship. Spirituality shouldn't have walls, doors, locks and language that requires interpretation, IMHO.

       Don't want to derail the gist of the thread but we could reduce crooked politicians by removing crooked religious people in our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our small community we have a mayor voted in that doesn't even live in our community! He got more votes because his religion is crooked as hell and his crooked flock would see business thrown their way thru their church! To hell with the law, right?
