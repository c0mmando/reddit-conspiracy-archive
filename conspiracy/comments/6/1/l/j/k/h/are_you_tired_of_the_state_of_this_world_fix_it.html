       As we all know majority of the populous is still asleep and unaware of what's going on in the world. Their daily lives are consumed with working to live, bubbles of entertainment, social media, and whatever else TPTB give us as distractions including Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple ideas and the spreading of those ideas will surely nudge and open the minds of many that are closed. We all must do our part to waken everyone others to the injustice, war crimes, slave labor, indoctrination that has been set forth. Many people already feel bogged down through classism, and confused as to why they can't get to the next level. Many were purely set up to fail, and on rare occasions you'll have people who break through their circumstances to "succeed."
      </p>
      <p>
       Others seem to just go with what they've been given and stop dreaming or trying. The world is harsh sometimes and so are the inhabitants living in it. To fix the world you must start with yourself, and realize you cannot do this alone. Start with your family, community, state/country, then the world. We are all more alike than we are different despite ideologies created to separate us, like religion, skin color, tax bracket.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite way to open up a discussion is by talking about things that are just plain strange. Why was there another building that fell on 9/11? Why did they throw Osama in the ocean? Why would Stanley Kubrick confess to creating the moon landing? Things of that nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must bring up topics that make people question what they've been told whenever and wherever we can. Slowly, if people choose they will go down the rabbit hole. You cannot force others to wake up before they are ready, but you can open a door to help them really see what's outside. Start in places where large amounts of people gather, forums like Reddit, live channels on YouTube, write on your money, create stickers for your coins, MEME, create art, write out post-it's and leave them on the train or in other areas people gather in large quantities. If you're comfortable, go to the middle of times square and hold a sign. Go to a resistance protest with a megaphone and ask them questions. If you have the money, take out a billboard in an area with tons of traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people are already half way there and fed up with the system. Fed up with the broken promises, lies, and constant spinning from their governments. I truly feel like there is no better time than now, when the US is so divided to make an impact so we can come together. It's all up to you. If you want to watch the world burn that's fine too. I know we can all make great changes and bring peace to the world, and live in better societies. It just depends if you want to or not. Thank you for reading this, and if you have any ideas as to how we can nudge people out of their slumber please leave a comment.

       They will always find a way to silence us. How can we fight that? If even in this forum is censored or not interested in reading certain things. When someone asks questions, when someone questions the official version, he is directly crazy, a paranoid, and is not taken seriously. I'm not one of those people who always think of conspiracies, but there are things I think are obvious, like 9/11, or the latest ISIS attacks in Europe. Even Pizzagate.

       You're absolutely right they will try, but so many people right now already know that. Which is why MEME warfare is so effective, if one thing goes viral hundreds of thousands if not millions of people will know. TPTB has held our perspective  in their hands since they are the promoters of agendas and control our thoughts. What we need to do is listen to our intuition, and point out where things seem shady. Some will always think you're paranoid/crazy and that's ok. They will wake up when it's their time. What I like to do personally is drop hints in various Twitter trends. Or if I get censored/shadowbanned I just make new accounts. They can try to stop me but until I'm dead I won't.
      </p>

       As Bob Marley said, "How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look."  There have been numerous people throughout history, like Lennon/Marley/Shakur/Jackson etc. who have promoted ideologies of peace and have been silenced for them. Millions of their fans already know this, I feel like many of them are in hibernation and still remember what they taught. If we could find celebrities willing to speak on some of these topics we gain more credibility. A large percentage of people now believe the news is fake thanks to Trump, we can shift the perspective against them. Tell people that government has been using propaganda against them. Ask them why they work for $12 an hour knowing they'll never be able to pay off their school loan, mortgage etc. It's all a rigged system. Paying for land that they ultimately own, a home that is owned by the banks, going to school for a piece of paper that tells society you're specialized in a certain area. I think most people see it but they won't say it out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to truly stand up and stand together. Build tight knit communities in all areas of the world. Naturally, if you're a certain type of individual who cares about the world and wants to make a change you will attract people who do too. You will attract people who will protect and look out for you. We just need to start putting in effort, I've woken up a few people in my family. My grandmother seems to be the hardest because she's glued to the television and what the news says. But things our government does have great impacts on society, whether it's your wage being reduced, or benefits. People care about that kind of thing so I try to slip in other questions. We can't promote fear, but we can show them that they have been conditioned to be fearful/anxious/to buy things they don't need. It's not going to be easy, but I think it'll be worth it.

       I know there are many of people like me out there, and I'm sure that's why you were attracted to my post. Making a little difference by opening one mind at a time is the key. Try to live being fearless for we can do anything we set our mind to. Be happy. There are energies and forces that use our negative state to benefit themselves. And I know it's hard, I definitely have my days where I want to give up. Then inspiration comes and I see or hear something that fires me up again. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond!

       The only thing that could possibly save the United States from becoming a completely tyrannical third-world nation (Bill Gates predicted that the U.S. would become like a third-world country) is if the states use the "null and void" provision in the Constitution. That means, that a state can vote against; declare "null and void", and refuse to obey any "law" coming out of Washington that isn't in the Constitution, or is in violation of the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the states don't do this, the U.S. is finished.

       I feel like many of the predictions made by the upper echelon are to fuel their desires and wants. Subliminally giving us their ultimate agendas. I'm personally just tired of them controlling us. Through media, their "opinions" that drive us to believe in a future world of fear. Whether that be Netflix shows promoting an agenda of killer futuristic bees, total society collapse, or terrorist coming to get us all. I could see the potential of that happening, but since government just continues to print more fiat currency and raise the debt ceiling I don't see it happening anytime soon. Unless China gets sick of us. They like that we are docile, complacent, and easily distracted. I feel like a whole new constitution needs to be created one where the inhabitants are truly free. As of right now we are merely given the illusion of freedom while they continue to shape our perception. For most if not all in government don't care about the actual constitution. They continue to misuse our tax dollars and not truly take care of the people they serve. We have the money to do so, we could be creating homes for the homeless. Instead we buy war planes that cost 300 billion dollars and fuel the military industrial complex. There are vast amounts of land available and merely sitting there but we are condensed into areas of the East and West mostly. Where the rent is too high and the pollution is terrible. This is to keep us sick, running to their pharmaceuticals which they have stake in. Everything needs to be revamped and it's possible. We just need to come together.

       I believe in all that stuff; I was just offering a counterpoint, with an "IMHO" and everything.  You sensed more criticism than I intended, made some assumptions about what I meant and needlessly leapt to a level of vulgar personal attacks like a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose I should have worded my post better and I'm sorry if you felt under attack — tbh I think you made a perfectly fair point, and for many people your advice is the best thing to accept.  Even activist-minded people need to take that advice in many ways and focus on the simple things right in front of them that they can influence most immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, in a sub dedicated to conspiracies, I would like to encourage people to be optimistic about the possibility of actually enacting change in the world.  Maybe that is hopelessly optimistic.  I don't know.

      <p>
       Anyway, I wish you the best.

       Or just don't waste your time and try to live a decent life. Worrying about convincing idiots of things is an excercise in futility.

       Good post. I actually "planted a seed" into someone the other day with the WTC 7 building (3rd building that fell) and also about "no plane evidence" at the pentagon. This person is older (like me) and watched all the original coverage.

       I could tell that this person was intrigued too.  So, like I said, I "planted a seed".

       You don't need to nudge people out of their slumber, you will do so by being the change you wish to see in the world. This can be accomplished through daily meditation, reflecting on your daily choices and thoughts so that you can create a positive feedback loop in which creative actions are encouraged while allowing  you the mental space to dispel negative energies. Practice unconditional love, think about the people you feel ill will towards and turn that emotion into compassion. Bring about awareness of the injustices that people turn a blind eye to like human trafficking but don't get bogged down in trying to "fix" it yourself. You can only focus on your life and improving your thoughts (thoughts are more powerful than people give them credit, hence the effort to get you to focus on the political drama which provides cycles of false hope and frustration) and actions , but if you consistently work at transforming your world in a positive way you will find the people around you reflecting that back to you. Nothing is as it seems.

       So in another words you don't want to live in this pyramidal scheme anymore. Me too. But it's also good to be realistic. Some people will do anything to stay in the "top" position to keep the lie we live in going. I think the key to change is to accept all things, all different people and that could simply mean be just ok with your neighbors. They voted Hillary or Trump ? Don't reduce them to politics. Don't reduce yourself to a choice. Fix the issues with the ego. Within, in your heart, stop with norms and labels. The real war is not only in our minds but also in our souls, I saw that a couple years ago and I'm not even religious.

       Excellent Post and I wish I could buy more upvotes for it to be seen as it is very informative and important to the unlearned. I would recommend that we start going into our own communities and discussing the ideas of issuing community and possibly state issued currency rather then continuing to rely on the failing US dollar that is dependent on Saudi and Middle Eastern oil. Eventually the money masters will collapse our dollar and we will be forced into another form of currency that I don't think most of us would enjoy as it may come will certain stipulations that aren't in our interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       During those tough times it would be smart of us to use community banks and community money to get by and reject the new money backed by fuck knows what and keep the local economies going. That could set an example to other communities and they could follow this idea until it gets to a point with the web of communities helping the state getting by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also start thinking about going off the grid, sustaining yourself and your families with your own foods that you and the community grow and cultivate for yourselves or simply growing your own gardens in your backyard by going with elevated greenhouses or something. Power will continue to centralize itself and can only be stopped if we the people become aware of it and try to fight by decentralizing ourselves to the "collectivist fascist totalitarians" on both sides.
