    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you can&#39;t see the dramatic difference between Clinton and Trump -- where Clinton is actually qualified, competent, experienced and has the right temperament for the job and Trump is the exact opposite -- speaks volumes about how you project when you look at them.</p>

<p>Exactly what do you think &quot;prejudice&quot; means?  You literally don&#39;t see the person for who/what they are as your biases prejudge them.</p>

<p>Most of you are like that.  And you will continue to be fine with Trump&#39;s incompetent and dick moves no matter what he does, just like the narcissistic fools in Nazi Germany who pretended to not understand what was going on.  Because caring about what he does isn&#39;t really what it&#39;s about with his supporters.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you personally seen it?&quot; referring to 7 million...</p>

<p>Nope, of course I haven&#39;t. Can you be any more disingenuous?</p>

<p>The fact is your girl took a page right out of typical establishment politics and bit from serpents fruit. </p>

<p>Maybe if Jill Stein was able to articulate her platform and not bumble on forever people would listen?</p>

<p>Where did the 7 million her campaign took in come from? </p>

<p>Did you really follow any of the story or has your blind loyalty to a fraud like Jill Stein really clouded your judgement this badly?</p>

<p>You&#39;re relegated to shooting your mouth off about stuff which you have no clue.</p>

<p>Have fun wasting your vote for Jill in 4 years, I&#39;m sure the attention whore will run again. </p>

They are still acting like they are the opposition party and have not planned to have this much power.

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed this and I wonder why. Like sure Hillary is a bad candidate. But her voter base will criticize the fuck out of her for everything she does, sometimes she deserves it. Hell her voter base didn&#39;t show up to vote for her because of it. But Trump I think was right when he said he can stand in the middle of 5th avenue and shoot someone and wouldn&#39;t lose a vote. I&#39;ve asked Trump supporters what he can do to lose their trust and its always nothing or next to nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the things that get upvoted to the top now are almost exclusivly anti-Clinton, Pro-Trump, and/or Pg and that is it. I guess the overall trend seems to be pro-Trump.
