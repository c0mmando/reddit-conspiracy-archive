    <div class="md"><p>Over my head on a technical level... but if yer gonna try to reignite the whole Trump server talking to a Russian bank thing then ya better get out in front of the idea that maybe trump-email.com is not a domain actually owned by anyone connected to Trump. </p>

<p>I think it was a couple weeks back that it was circulated around here that someone else registered that domain as part of the &quot;set-up&quot;. You should start there, cause that is what anyone is gonna use to dismiss whatever you say about the communications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>trump-email.com is a legitimate Trump Org domain that&#39;s been around since 2009. The Emily McMullin appearing in some records for the domain has no connection to Evan McMullin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s used for hotel marketing. <em>The Intercept</em> was able to obtain copies of some of the marketing communications, thereby debunking in its own way the story. For months I&#39;ve been happy to leave it at that, but after CNN tried recently to reignite the story, I decided to examine this in much more detail.</p>

<p>Those who have debunked the story so far have assumed that the logs are genuine but that they&#39;re not necessarily indicative of nefarious activity and could mean any number of innocuous things. I can demonstrate with very high confidence that the logs have been forged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking at the DNS lookup log. It is peripheral to the point of almost being laughable. It has null effect on any communication or data transfer between servers. I mean sht, I almost have to laugh. Here is what you get, you can try it for yourself --&gt; <a href="https://www.ultratools.com/tools/dnsLookup">https://www.ultratools.com/tools/dnsLookup</a>
You get</p>

<p>-MX records which are the named address of the mail servers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Domain Name Servers which index .com type names to IP addresses so that your browser knows where to go when you type xyz.com into a browser
(Google uses 8.8.8.8 for it&#39;s DNS) </li>
</ul>

<p>-A site verification code which will probably be used for SSL certificates, which put the little HTTPS encrypted lock in your web browser address bar when you have an encrypted HTTP session</p>

<p>-Other text sht like banners and aliases that the server might have as subdomains like spf-a.hotmail.com -- spf-b.hotmail.com --- homebase.hotmail.com etc. </p>

<p>In other words, garbage. Crap. Stupid sht. Idiocy. To think that this kind of  network communication - DNS Lookups and NSLookups have any relevance to anything are ridiculous. I mean dumb. Dumb. As in flat out fking ignorant on a level that is almost mind boggling. </p>

<p>They are yanking your chain holmes. This is some major BS. I always thought the FBI were a bunch of retard ever since they could not (or said they could not) root a damn terrorist iPhone. I can do that sht in a couple of hours on the weekend while drunk. </p>

<p>So I am seeing this and thinking that it means nothing. And if it means nothing, then WTF are these guys getting so juiced over? A bunch of standard BS lookups that can be scripted or cron jobbed to run at set intervals to MAKE IT LOOK like &quot;communication&quot; is going on, or connection, or  whatever. BUt what is it? It is the functional equivalent of me opening my window and yelling across the street to the neighbors &quot;Yo, what&#39;s up?&quot; And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>TO think this is some National Security BS is just BS. Flat out BS. </p>

<p>So yeah, I think it could have been planted. It could have been possibly hacked and scripted. Some Yoad on lunch break could have gone in with a USB stick and comp-ed it. Some standard routine maintenance could have slipped it in. But at the end of the day, the nature of the communication is inconsequential. Ridiculous even. I mean, it&#39;s a level of insulting that so bad to even take this as serious even for a momentary microsecond. </p>

<p>If anyone else has other ideas or interpretations, I would sure like to hear it. </p>

<p>I struggle to believe anyone who knows half his weight in networking would use free online lookups.</p>

<p>All in all, you haven&#39;t exactly spread confidence that you know what you are talking about beyond using some buzzwords/semi-applicable words in the context. Couple that with a new account, and you have an excellent spread of misinformation :) Congrats, you got a gullible sub to believe you.</p>

Your analysis was relatively easy to follow by someone who can handle &quot;ls -l&quot; but only knows -of- sendmail, never having been tossed into those code mines. Other comments were removed likely because of doxing info therein. I hate to see such good analysis swept away by the wind, but there&#39;s no way I could post a rewording of your work that didn&#39;t show my gaping depths of lack of background. Would you consider posting something? I&#39;m not sure whether there was any actual rule-breaking in the OP, so tis hard to figure what might be allowed. Hm.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know, any more than you know that there wasn&#39;t anything &#39;reacting to something on the other side&#39; of your home internet connection. Are you a russian agent? I guarantee that over the corse of a few months, the average internet user does <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of DNS lookups. I&#39;m confident there is a 99.995% chance YOU HAVE LOOKED UP RUSSIAN DOMAINS because at some point you or someone who lives with you went on a porn site or torrent site or maybe even saw an advertisement for Yandex.ru on a blog or any number of millions of things.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the logs too and as a systems engineer of 15+ years I can confidently tell you you&#39;re being duped. The logs are missing most contextual information and could have been forged by someone like me in about 15 minutes. Perhaps if they had provided a tcpdump capture file or some <em>real evidence</em> we would be slightly less skeptical but what they&#39;ve provided so far is a pathetic attempt at fabricating a controversy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stuff going through PTR is more garbage. What is this? strumpor.idiomdrottning.org ?? electrumpartners.com ?? trumpet.band.nd.edu?? This is crap, yo. Grade D minus BS. </p>

<p>The MTA relay might be more consequential, but at it&#39;s absolute weirdest, it would be one computer using another to relay chat messages that it sends to a chat client instead of doing that itself. So what could that be? Alpha bank&#39;s computer is being used as a relay helper by a trump computer to help take the load off the Trump  computer&#39;s CPU? Or would it go the other way around? Not sure. But what is the crime here? Chatting? If so, you&#39;d need to find some serious terrorist BS coming  out of Alpha bank for that to be relevant. </p>

<p>Anyway, according to Snowden and Binney, NSA should have all records of NOT the chat relay,  but the actual chat data itselfcopied off at the outgoing MAE-East switching station in Virginia. So I am not sure what the hell is the problem here. Or why this is taking so much time. </p>

<p>ANyone should be able to look at the chat data and say Ahha there is some XYZ crap that is indictable. I mean they could look at a text file in front of their face and SEE immediately what indictable edgy sht was said. And here we are 1/3 of a year out from the election, and no indictments have come out. No court filings. Nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stuff in 
<a href="http://www.ljean.com/NetworkRecords/README.txt">http://www.ljean.com/NetworkRecords/README.txt</a>
is taking standard ISP Domain name maintenance and trying to turn it into something nefarious. BS. There&#39;s nothing weird about repointing a domain name, changing a DNS record, or cancelling a domain name. </p>

<p>This sht: &quot;Suddenly after 7 years of stable operation, Trump Organization
    orders their vendor CDCServices aka CenDyn.com - to make
    the host Trump-Email.com disappear&quot;</p>

<p>This is, again, some hopped up garbage. All they did was remove the NAME from the IP address. The IP stayed the same. The server stayed the same. Nothing changed except the superficial domain name, which was canceled. </p>

<p>There can be multiple, even dozens of names pointing to the same computer and IP. Having one canceled amounts to some sys admin at the Trump ISP changing one line in a text file. It takes less than 10 seconds. I did this all the time, every day at an ISP. And names and IPs are always changing, transferring and swirling around. </p>

<p>But the other stuff in this file is so hopped up and written to sound like EBIL, EBIL BS is going down when it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just standard ISP work. </p>

<p>Again, the problem is not THE NAME. Who cares about the name? It is a domain name, and it is not a computer, or an IP, or a data transfer, or a tangible record. It means nothing and has nothing to do with anything. It is the computers under the name that would have to change for this to mean anything at all. </p>

<p>The way this is written just sounds like DailyKos freaking hysteria. Which immediately makes it suspect for trying to gin up a bunch of BS from standard procedure. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s fine for a recursive DNS server (that is, a DNS server receiving recursive DNS queries from a client) to send recursive queries itself to external DNS servers, but I&#39;m still trying to find a DNS server implementation that actually does so. All the literature says the recursive DNS server will send iterative queries, the BIND9 source code (at least as far as I can tell) indicates the same, the few people who&#39;ve tested it for me with sniffers have indicated the same, but I&#39;d like to examine a few obscure corner cases tomorrow before doing my ultimate post. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;researchers&quot; themselves have accepted it as benign DNS traffic. I will say this: I have a lingering doubt in the sense that if they were going to forge the logs, they could&#39;ve just gone the whole distance and forged something more damning. </p>

<p>Note that on <a href="http://gdd53.wordpress.com">http://gdd53.wordpress.com</a> (which I didn&#39;t mention, because it&#39;s difficult for me to establish the link to gdd.i2p in a public manner), there&#39;s the following:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;ts&quot;: &quot;1475005735&quot;,
&quot;src_ip&quot;: &quot;217.12.97.15&quot;,
&quot;qname&quot;: &quot;trump1.contact-client.com&quot;,
&quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;ams-ix23&quot;,
&quot;qdcount&quot;: 1,
&quot;qtype&quot;: 1,
&quot;rd&quot;: 0
</code></pre>

<p>The &quot;ams-ix23&quot; is a node on the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. This is one of the Russian DNS servers in question sending a query to a root server. In this case, the &#39;rd&#39; bit is clear, which is what one would expect. But with everything that goes on at the AIE, there&#39;s not really anything that can be concluded from that as is, so I can&#39;t use it as evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>You can use DNS in a lot of ways. What about base64 then just tunneling through iodine-like stuff though. what about base64 encoding? There is tons of proof of concepts of ways to use it to mask stuff.</p>

<p>The issue I see is more that the data is just plaintext so it is easily tampered with, and no one has been able to provide any evidence to corroborate some of the stuff tealeaves said-- like it only ever recieving traffic from the ip for alfabank and the health place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure they <em>could have</em> the same way they <em>could have</em> hired a Navajo code talker or <em>could have</em> secretly sent messages inside of image files and posted them on imgur.</p>

<p>Or– ya know, they could have used an Enterprise VPN with AES-256, which is extremely common and widespread among large corporations, and simply used that to communicate with Russia or Europe in a secure manner (the same as thousands upon thousands of corporations do) that can&#39;t be cracked or detected in a hundred million years with a supercomputer. But hey– that wouldn&#39;t sound as sexy for propaganda purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TeaLeaves is singlehandedly responsible for causing the Trump server scandal, which in turn is a large chunk of the foundation of the Russian scandal. He sent DNS logs to multiple news outlets and managed to hook one or two (such as <em>Slate</em>). The public details are quite foggy, but ljean, a professor at Indiana, started raising more noise about the DNS logs and claimed Tea Leaves as her own anonymous source she didn&#39;t know. It turns out, though, that her colleague Tim Kelley, who&#39;s written papers with her, has an ancient Internet presence with the username t34k3ttl3. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does help, but the middle vertical line is confusing at first. I understand that it is showing us vs Russian logs.</p>

<p>I suggest putting the us circles first and then removing the vertical line (put &quot;us server&quot;, &quot;us client&quot; &quot;russian server&quot;, &quot;russian client&quot; inside of each circle.</p>

<p>Make the red conclusion at the bottom right left-justified, then follow up with an alternate explanation - if the presumed conclusion is impossible, what is a possible explanation?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s possible to show that the results prove there was a fabrication, I&#39;d then show the date of the denied FISA warrant, the date the fabrications began, and the date that we know they began using this as a pretense for spying on Trump.</p>

<p>Keep the minimalist theme and black and white color pattern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Timothy Kelley is unlikely to be a real person. </p>

<p>His interests/subject matters are too disparate and unconnected. It is doubtful whether or not someone who could be this technically proficient in network-engineering could also have a keen and profound interest and insight into human medical practices and economic theories. </p>

<p>My guess is that this &#39;Timothy Kelley&#39; is an amalgamation of various individuals writing under a pseudonym. It is most likely a government-run operation. </p>

Perhaps the deepest field of talent in the USA really, doing actual real world research work that isn&#39;t purely theoretical.  When you want real research by smart people; governments, companies, and all kinds of organizations hire IU researchers.  For research purposes it&#39;s like a more practically minded Harvard.</p>

I&#39;m convinced I&#39;ve identified TeaLeaves, but as for the forgery, this post is preliminary in the sense that I need to see whether it can be shot down with something I haven&#39;t considered (hence the bold claim). There are way too many variables in play (server implementation, server version, custom vendor patches, configuration, network devices, etc.) for a single person to test exhaustively, but I&#39;m not comfortable enough with only the literature and the theory and a couple of source trees agreeing with me.  </p>

<p>TeaLeaves kicked off the whole Russia-Trump server thing with his DNS logs.... this server has been mentioned in connection to investigations...
nobody knew who TeaLeaves was... some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess... it turned out to be a colleague of hers... see the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread for the damning proof... tealeaves... and her colleague has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle... i dont think so... thats him... btw i dont believe that emailmistake guy found it the way he says... i think he had to present it in a more eh public safe manner if you get my drift... based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this
the dns logs contain + signs... meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen... even if we say the russian nameservers have some weird setup... well the american medical nameservers have the same weird setup... every damn nameserver has the same weird setup... terribly unlikely...
the guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#39;reasonably confident&#39; based on the indicator above... but its pretty fucking damning all by itself... my suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of ttls and cache behavior</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit to not sifting through the logs, but I have a question. Would it not be a fair assumption that an organization within Trump tower uses the Bloomberg platform, and if Alfa bank is as significant as they say, that they too would use Bloomberg? Wouldn&#39;t that make a simple, contrived, and expected link between the two? </p>

<p>I understand that data would flow through intermediaries given that Bloomberg is a closed platform, but would some of these intermediaries be &quot;misnamed&quot; in order to hide identity?</p>

<p>Additionally, as standard OPSEC, shouldn&#39;t Trump&#39;s organization have a whitelist/blacklist of IP addresses in their firewall/routing table? I know on my home router I have the IP tables setup to automatically reject anything from China, Russia and Brazil; wouldn&#39;t you think that a professional organization like Trump have that insight too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From <a href="http://www.ljean.com/NetworkRecords/intranet/index.html">here</a> regarding the queries for<br/>
<strong>mail.trump-email.com.moscow.alfaintra.net  [x6]</strong><br/>
<strong>trump-email.com.moscow.alfaintra.net [x1]</strong><br/>
They say,  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;This query is unusual in that is merges two hostnames into one. It makes the most sense as a human error in inserting a new hostname in some dialog window, but neglected to hit the backspace to delete the old hostname.&quot;</em>  [...] <em>&quot;The hyrbid hostname suggests that Alfa was attempting to accomodate
    the Trump host in its network.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a FUCK-ALL explanation, and in no way makes the &quot;most sense&quot;. They are DNS-newbie paranoid dingbats for saying so.  I was a top level country domain DNS administrator in the days of BINDv4. For one thing they are saying &quot;moscow.alfaintra.net&quot; is a <em>hostname</em>.  If it&#39;s a large network it would more likely be a <em>domain</em>, as in one containing [host1,host2].moscow.alfaintra.net.  Plenty of client resolver libraries, especially old ones, do NOT assume queries are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name">fully qualified names</a> by default, unless you gave it a name with a trailing dot already. For example,<br/>
mail.trump.email.com  &lt;-- NOT a fully qualified name, NO trailing dot.<br/>
mail.trump.email.com.  &lt;-- IS fully qualified.<br/>
What these do is when they are given an actual Internet name that was (yet, missing a trailing dot) not fully qualified (and this is very often!), is append the client machine&#39;s own domain and look for that first.  Then if that fails, try to resolve the actual thing given <strong>as if</strong> it was trailing a dot.<br/>
I&#39;d expect to see queries like this originating from an older machine such as a Solaris, whose domain is set to &quot;moscow.alfaintra.net&quot; running Sendmail.  Thus, the log does not indicate funny business, only an email trying to be sent back to the Trump server, it could even be a non-human cannot-deliver bounce from &quot;postmaster&quot; -- and was stuck in a queue somewhere.<br/>
PING has a specific meaning. People who characterize DNS queries as &quot;pings&quot; because the foofy cop shows written by DHS wanabees now use the word &quot;ping&quot; for everything cyber, should be taken out and dipped in shit.</p>
