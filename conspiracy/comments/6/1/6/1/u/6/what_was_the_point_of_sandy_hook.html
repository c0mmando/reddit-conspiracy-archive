<p>Sandy Hook was, from multiple and obvious standpoints, staged. But, it didn&#39;t bring us a new war, like Pearl Harbor and 9/11 did. There was no monetary gain from it. My only theory is that it was staged to make Americans deny their own gun rights so that the government could gain more control of them at their own will. I don&#39;t like guns but using a bunch of dead preschoolers to advocate for gun safety seems like a good move. </p>

<p>Another theory I heard (still not sure about) is that the whole thing  was staged to measure the nation&#39;s emotional responses to certain tragedies.</p>

<p>Can I get some insight? Google doesn&#39;t have a lot.</p>

<p>Both of the nationwide efforts died on the floor and:</p>

<p>&quot;As of April 3, 2013, only five states had passed stricter gun control laws, while ten states had passed laws that weakened restrictions on firearms.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t ignore the historical context. There was no huge gun control push during GWB&#39;s administration and Obama wisely stayed away from the issue during his first term (notice how Sandy Hook happened one month after he was elected to a second term). Sandy Hook happened, and suddenly, there&#39;s an assault weapons ban in Congress and many states attempting to pass their own gun control measures at the same time. The gun control issue had largely been ignored for over a decade, but Sandy Hook brought it back. And they kept making serious attempts at gun control all the way through the summer of 2016 with the Pulse Nightclub shooting.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t succeed in all of their efforts to crack down on guns, but they certainly tried hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress has failed to move the needle on gun control, many states have taken up the fight. In the wake of Sandy Hook, lawmakers in New York and Connecticut banned the possession of semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines, for example. In fact, over the past three years, 39 states have passed at least 117 new pieces of legislation that make gun laws more strict, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonpartisan group that tracks legislation across the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t happen?  <a href="/u/horridCAM666">/u/horridCAM666</a> said &quot;push&quot;, not &quot;pass.&quot;  There was certainly a <em>push</em> for gun control legislation.  However, when gun control is <em>pushed</em> at the government/political/media level, gun sales go up.  </p>

<p>During the Obama administration, mass shootings occurred at a truly alarming rate and coincided with record breaking gun sales.  </p>

<p>I watched President Obama&#39;s press conference where he cried as he spoke about the children who were massacred, I&#39;ve heard him complain about having to talk about mass shootings and gun violence in general too much and the result is, as you said, nothing &#39;substantive&#39;.</p>

<p>Other than record breaking gun sales of course.  </p>

<p>So to break it down once more:
1.  Mass shootings go up
2.  Gun sales go up
3.  Legislation is not &#39;substantive&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, my whole stance on guns changed recently. I used to think that if other countries didn&#39;t need widespread gun use to be safe, why did we?</p>

<p>Then I looked at the way those governments treated their people and I changed my mind a little. Not much, but just enough. </p>

<p>I still think the whole &quot;rednecks fighting a tyrannical government&quot; thing is laughable, though. What kind of tyrannical government is going to let its citizens have the same caliber weapons at itself???? Your AR-15 won&#39;t stand up against a tank my dude</p>

<p>Standard of living is great as far as I&#39;m concerned, but I lived in the heart of Frankfurt which is quite expensive for housing and such (2.700€ a month sooo yikes, I know). </p>

<p>For general things it&#39;s not much more expensive than your average city.</p>

<p>If you have a specialist skill set (coming from the US this would require a degree and significant working experience) then it is a lot easier. But as you describe yourself as semi-professional I&#39;m afraid it is not possible. Oh, and working here in the EU as an illegal?

    <div class="md"><p>That and people are zombies. I woke up on 9/11 because of the effect.</p>

<p>I was in school when 9/11 happened. Now, for some reason my junior high was the only school in our district that didn&#39;t roll out the televisions and turn on the news all day. We knew a little what happened but it wasn&#39;t until I got home and talked to my parents that I knew. 
 I was on a train from Portland, Me to Boston, MA on the day of the Boston Bombing. They didn&#39;t stop the train from entering the city when the &quot;bombs&quot; went off. IN fact, we picked up passengers in boston! Didn&#39;t check tickets until the train was on the way back! I&#39;ve been screaming false flag since day one but nope I get a look.</p>

<p>My point being. The television is their to show everyone around the world specific events so everyone can share in the same feeling so the world can be shifted in a certain direction. Fear is a powerful tool. Especially when pointed at those that love falsely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve never looked into Sandy hook bc it depresses me too much. All my insight is second hand. But I saw that this idea before and it was not represented in your thread. it&#39;s the wildest one I&#39;ve heard so i posted it. All i can give is a basic background.</p>

<p>First you have to accept that mkultra evolved into ritual abuse of children in order to give them multiple personality disorder. The idea is that one of the personalities is sort of mind controlled by the cia. This was the ultimate sleeper agent they wanted for the cold war. This claim had been made about a lot of the child abuse cases like Franklin, mcmartin, even heard  it about dutrox.</p>

<p>The following idea is that Sandy hook was an mkultra programming center that got its cover blown. So the dead kids were basically the ones that for whatever reason the cia could not trust. The dead adult was probably the guy who busted the ring. All the families were agents of the cia and all the reporting was cia.</p>

<p>Personally i think both conspiracies are salt in the mine directly from the cia itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">read this,</a> especially starting on the bottom of page 3 (though the whole thing is very much worth reading). </p>

<p>There actually was an enormous gain from Sandy Hook and similar hoaxes (which continue until today and started LONG before Sandy Hook and 9/11). </p>

<p>Sandy Hook led to a HUGE boost in gun sales as people became afraid that Obama was going to &#39;take our guns.&#39; Well he didn&#39;t. And in fact that argument, along with blaming the hoax it on Obama, is one of the key things that kills the credibility of the argument that it was hoaxed. &quot;Oh, well if it was hoaxed to promote gun control, then why didn&#39;t it work?&quot; </p>

<p>At the same time, Sandy Hook boosted efforts to militarize the police, which of course requires buying lots of military equipment. So it also boosted investment in the &quot;police state&quot; and DHS. </p>

<p>That paper talks about who profited from increased guns sales. Same people who profit from the militarization of the police and DHS spending. </p>

<p>And on top of all that it became an extremely divisive issue between left and right, further promoting the divide-and-conquer strategy of the powers that be. </p>

<p>There are additional ancillary benefits for our rulers in keeping us afraid and traumatized, as it makes us easier to rule and also keeps us turning to tranquilizers, anti-depressants, booze, weed, or whatever to help us get comfortably numb.  </p>

<p>You can also never know who the message of the event truly was targeted at. It might have been some competing elements trying to frame something and that can only be understood from the inside. It might even be a message by foreign forces which nobody wants to thematise(Mossad,..).</p>

<p>Or it just might be a terror/entertainment complex trying to justify their budget with another event. Somebody with some political agenda might then piggyback it and suddenly you wonder what amateur theatre you&#39;re just watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cut and dry like that. If they wanted to just kill everyone, they would have already. It&#39;s about having your army ( US citizens with friends and family ) be okey with detaining Americans. They won&#39;t go to battle with those rednecks. So thank them gun loving hillbillies. If not for them who knows what kind of shit the gov would be rounding people up for. Remember, the rich don&#39;t fight the wars. They talk us into it. How are they going to talk a soldier into fighting other Americans and vets. If we didn&#39;t have guns it would be just a standard procedure &quot;I&#39;m just doing my job&quot; kinda thing. </p>

<p>Get it?</p>
