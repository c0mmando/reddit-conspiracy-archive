<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of ghosts/had plenty of experiences with and without people. I&#39;ve 100% seen a UFO - whether that was human operated, or not is the question. I feel I&#39;ve definitely see some odd things in my day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not afraid to share . .  . Just my experience. How often do you remember noticing people that seem <em>different</em>?</p>

<p>In an office building (of multiple offices), on the way to an elevator, walking with a number of people. There were two <em>extremely</em> tall white men, <em>both</em> were bald. If I had to guess I would say they were <em>over</em> 6 Ft tall. Tall white men are not &quot;odd&quot;, but they could have been perceived as &#39;twins&#39;.  From what I&#39;ve read &#39;tall whites&#39; aren&#39;t bald, but it was disconcerting that <em>two&quot; men of the same height that looked so similar just *happened</em> to be at the same place at the same time. Thinking about it now, it&#39;s even <em>more</em> strange that none of the other people took notice of it!</p>

<p>Another occurrence: in a store, a tall blonde woman with (what I assumed was her daughter) both had &#39;light blonde&#39;, not white blonde hair. The &#39;daughter&#39; looked <em>exactly</em> liked the mother (a &quot;mini-me&quot; version). I was on my way out of the store. I would not have noticed them, but they both looked at me at the same time, as I was leaving... I thought that was a bit strange. What are the odds that a mother/daughter look (almost, exactly alike, both were tall, comparatively).</p>

<p>The first story tho, that reminds me of the <a href="http://realmib.tripod.com/hopkins.html">Dr. Hopkins&#39; Story</a>. Notice the similarities in what you described the person looking like. Creepy.</p>

<p>Also, I like hearing these kinds of things, hence why I asked for you to share, so thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Magic mushrooms amongst others are notorious for giving people hallucinations out of the blue days or weeks post-usage.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve eaten plenty of mushrooms and have never once had an onset hallucination. DMT in mushrooms is a molecule your body produces naturally. Eating mushrooms is the equivalent of taking supplements or vitamins. (Assuming you&#39;re eating the right ones) there is an excellent documentary about it on Netflix.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bring cannabis into this. THC and CBD are beneficial to your body. the way you introduce it to you&#39;re body can cause harm (e.g., smoking harms lungs) or if you ingest these chemicals before you&#39;re frontal lobe has finished developing at ~25.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  What I&#39;ve seen and heard is definitely alien in relation to me/us.  This has been going on for a while now, 4+ years.  </p>

<p>After I asked him about his cows/horses/six working dogs going abnormally ape shit sometimes at night, my neighbor across the street, an old farmer, told me that he knew what I was talking about but he didn&#39;t want to talk about it - what sealed the deal for me is when after he had already nodded at me and said &#39;have a good day&#39; he said &#39;I just mind my own business, and I don&#39;t ask questions.&#39;  He then tried to joke about being married for 50+ years to his wife, but I understood perfectly what he had meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saw a strange man in the hall during the day when no one was supposed to be at my mom&#39;s house (I was about 20 &amp; raiding the house for food). He was not transparent but opaque. When he saw me he got startled, turned and ran. Why I ran towards him, I still do not how but it was ice cold in that hall when I hit it (100 degrees outside). I bolted outside, ran around the house, looking up, down and all around then hauled ass out of there!</p>

<p>Asked my mom about it months later and she had no clue what I saw and was a bit doubtful, then my little sister came home from school - asked her if she had ever seen anything unusual in the house: 
She said other than the man in the hall, nah nothing. We both freaked a bit: she told a very similar story but when he saw her, he smiled and walked towards the end of the hall. When I saw him, he was startled and ran. Two different people, two different days, two different reactions.</p>

<p>This year my older sister told me our mother (now passed) had called a Catholic priest and had an exorcism done on the house. My little sister is super religious now and refuses to talk about it.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t get over the fact that &quot;he&quot; reacted to the environment differently. I say he because it was very detailed and was obviously a man dressed in regular workman&#39;s clothing, belt &amp; work boots - detail was very clear not some dust cloud or wisp. </p>

<p>Time traveler, ghost, alien. - who the fuck knows but middle of the day on a clear day - no alcohol or drugs involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m usually a total lurker in this sub, but this post compels me to share what happened to me. I&#39;ve shared this before, but didn&#39;t go into too much detail. I think I was abducted. Anyway, here goes...</p>

<p>This happened in late 1997, like October or November. I was staying with a friend/colleague in a condo. We worked at the same company. I had been staying with him for about a week or two while I was working on getting a place of my own. I woke up at my usual time, around 5:00 or 5:30, got out of bed, grabbed my shaving kit and headed to the bathroom to do my morning routine.</p>

<p>After my shower was done, I was using a towel to dry off and I noticed what looked like a hole in the skin on my left arm. I don&#39;t mean a pin prick, but an actual hole. This was back in 1997 and I didn&#39;t have a camera, much less a smart phone, so I don&#39;t have any pictures. I later measured it with a transparent ruler and it was exactly 3.5mm in diameter and 2mm deep. It was a perfect circle. </p>

<p>This freaked me out so I checked my other arm and did a quick look around my body and checked my back in the mirror to see if any other marks were there and didn&#39;t find anything. Next thing I did, I grabbed my stuff and headed back to the bedroom and checked the sheets. I figured maybe I bled or something, but the sheets were clean and no sign of blood anywhere on the carpet either. </p>

<p>The hole itself was totally clean with no scab and no pain whatsoever. At the bottom of it, my skin was bright pink but dry. The inner walls of the hole were dry too. I used a tooth pick to touch the skin at the bottom of the hole. The sensation wasn&#39;t painful but incredibly sensitive. Like I was pressing a large piece of rough wood on my arm. </p>

<p>This totally weirded me out but I figured I&#39;m not feeling any pain and I don&#39;t have any mobility problems so I guess I should just get on with my day and get to work. Once I got there, I showed my boss, who was also a friend, and asked him what he thought this thing was. He was in the middle of typing an email and I clearly remember him leaning over his desk to take a look as I presented my arm and he just said, &quot;that is... a bite.&quot; And he sat back down and just kept on typing but wouldn&#39;t make eye contact with me anymore. </p>

<p>I remember saying, &quot;come on, man, there&#39;s no way that&#39;s a fucking bite. I&#39;d at least have some sort of scab and would&#39;ve definitely felt something take a chunk of skin that big. Plus, it&#39;d be sore as hell and probably swollen.&quot; </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t respond and I could tell he was feeling uncomfortable. Around that time, my temporary room mate arrived so I called him into the office and showed it to him too. He took a look and didn&#39;t seem too concerned and just changed the subject by saying, &quot;hey I found a potato bug in the kitchen and had to throw it in the yard.&quot; I&#39;d never heard of a potato bug but figured I wasn&#39;t getting any answers from these two so, again, I decided to get on with my day and get some work done. </p>

<p>It healed over the course of the next two weeks as the hole filled up with skin to the point where it was perfectly smooth with the rest of the surrounding skin. I can still tell where it was because the skin there is a little paler than the surrounding skin. It&#39;s not scar tissue, just lighter colored skin. I look at it almost every day to remind myself that it really happened. I don&#39;t have any conscious memory of alien abduction but I suspect it happened and I hope some day that memory will be unlocked. </p>

<p>Other than that, I did have a really vivid dream a couple of years ago of being in a white room sitting at a white table across from a non-human that had a head shaped like an inverted cone. I clearly remember he had a really thin forehead, like just one inch of forehead above his large eyes, and the top of his head was totally flat like a table top. He told me my learning had stagnated and I needed to work more otherwise I&#39;d have to recycle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen UFOs and orbs too many times to count. Sometimes with other people but they never seem to want to talk about it afterwards. The only time it was indoors I was playing guitar after work with a friend in an office and when we walked out we both saw a bluish orb that looked like the planet Uranus spinning. It flashed and disappeared. We both were like what the fuck? He ran out the door freaked out and I had to set the alarm and close up. Strangely I felt like it was listening. I also had dreams with tall chalky white aliens that look like the engineers from prometheus and that was way before the movie came out. I have lots of weird shit happen to me. Dreams about stuff before it happens. Long extended deja vu. I dunno. It&#39;s fucked up.</p>
