       <strong>
        The Narrative
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The narratives we're  embroiled in are synthetic:  manufactured by think tanks &amp; media -then delivered by politicians and presenters for you to debate within. Whether you're for it or against it, matters not- your very participation in defending or attacking whatever you're being pushed to focus on, ensures you remain trapped within the Overton Window that's been created for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wether you were for Hillary or Trump, the fact remains that both candidates were/are under federal investigation. Obama was a war criminal as far as I'm concerned. As was Bush. The poppy fields that American soldiers guard in Afghanistan, produce the heroin&amp; opium that kills Americans back at home. Clinton was running drugs as a governor, and observing as CIA ruined American communities importing Crack to fund Contras (terrorists)in Iran. Etc, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite whose in power things never seem to change do they? Oh the dialogue is always change, but funnily enough the results stay the same. But when you look at decline in middle class, vs the  increase in wealth of the top 1%, it makes perfect sense?
       <strong>
        They don't want things to change.
       </strong>
       Quite literally, the policies they're implementing are making them richer at the cost of everyone else- why in good god would you have the  Media,banks,Politicians,Schools,Police, Army,Celebrities, Judges that you own outright or control, ever allow fruitful and concrete solutions to manifest, when to do so threatens your position
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do politicians have the answers? No.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop looking for answers in politics or the news. This world is full smart, resourceful, creative people with good hearts and strong wills. Sadly, these people tend not to be employed in the institutions that would allow them to manifest what we all know to be possible- that isn't a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Politicians display different traits depending on how advanced they are in their political career, but common behaviours include superficial charm, a grandiose notion of self-worth, the need for stimulation and impulsiveness, pathological lying, the ability to manipulate others and a lack of remorse and empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Political observers claim new voters  usually find this intriguing, but canâ€™t put their finger on why.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is down to incongruous behaviour because politicians tend to do a lot of acting to deceive, or mimic normal reactions, sometimes changing their views and reactions quickly.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Did you notice anything at odds with that? If so, you were right to. It's an
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3379996/How-spot-psychopath-Expert-reveals-traits-look-charm-eccentricity-manipulation.html">
        excerpt from an article discussion Psyocaphtic traits
       </a>
       (Daily Fail sorry!) - I just amended the wording where necessary to give it a political context -
       <em>
        politician
       </em>
       to
       <em>

       <strong>
        What makes a leader?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We see leaders assassinated who have the bravery and vision to articulate a new way. That's when you're most dangerous to the powers that be. Individuals who can bridge the gap between now and what we all know to be possible - dreamers, visionaries, revolutionaries - have a magnetic attraction because deep down we all know we should be so much future along as a people. I truly believe, if not for the limitations imposed on us by those who'd maintain control, Mankind would be well on our way to the stars. The manhattan project was accomplished through sheer will and resources. No costs spared. The best minds were put to work to ensure American hegemony continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that same effort allocated to a solar based energy system for example? An orbital Ring Space Elevator (see Paul Birch, Tesla) is constructed, massively reducing the cost of sending payloads to space. Solar panels are sent into LEO, free to harness luminosity unencumbered by atmosphere as we are at present. The resultant energy would increase the energy throughput of society, introducing trillions in novel wealth into global economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now - I'm not a scientist, or even too sciencey. But I came across these ideas a few months back and have diligently research around the claims, to assess its viability. Short of some technical hitches which appear to be easily enough addressed with sufficient investment, this is a perfectly viable proposal. And furthermore,
       <em>
        has been achievable for decades
       </em>
       . It certainly isn't a project that will be beset with as much complications as the building the first nuclear bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we'll never hear any of it from polticians and alternative media or whoever is in front of you this week, promising they have the truth that you need.
The "truth" they offer is always more of the same, it's either a) lies or b) things you already know
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       JFK wasn't killed for his speech on secret societies. At that point, it was known freemasonry was rife in the US and that even some of the founding fathers were masons. No biggie. He  was assassinated for the same reason as Lincoln: the creation of usury free currency. Such a simple act in practice, a few strokes of a pen to sign the executive order. But what they did symbolised a vision and the conviction to ensure that vision manifests: consequences be damned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than judge our leaders in comparison to the status quo, they should be judged on their service to the people that elected them. Until we see leaders who do that, we need to look to each other for truth- not those who'd maintain control by deceiving us.

       And now mathematical models show Earth's population peaking at 9 billion in the next two decades and then rapidly declining. Doesn't sound much like the "over population is the greatest threat to humanity!" line many of us have been fed our whole lives does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Margaret Sanger's history. You'll get a lot of stuff about women's rights but she was more concerned about keeping poor people and black people from "breeding". You can find her popular pamphlet online, "Eugenics and The New Race!".

       I don't think anyone's bodily autonomy should be infringed, but I don't think we should live in a world where people see having children as irresponsible either. Regardless, the future of contraception is in reversible chemical vasectomies. Developed at least ten years ago now in India, but of course there's a multi billion dollar industry feeding hormone filled pills to women that doesn't want to lose it's empire.

       Trump is Israeli controlled. The Russia and CIA are pissed at him and are trying to have him removed. Israel is pissed at both and are using Wikileaks to discredit the CIA. Pence has been burned due to Flynn and Turkish spying. That means its anyones game and people like Bush are being rebranded maybe to help Jeb Bush get elected. Biden might run also.
