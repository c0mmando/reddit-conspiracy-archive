    <div class="md"><p>Agreed it is heavily censored, disagree it is unwittingly.  Look at all the hurdles put in front of men.  Less than 1% controls a majority of the wealth, meaning they are the ones that control competition.  Big time players like Reddit, FB, Twitter, Google, Netflix, etc etc all exist for a reason.  This isn&#39;t a free market.  Entities as giant as the aforementioned are allowed to exist.  Think about it, they own it all, how can there ever be any genuine competition.  We still have the bar too low and we still think too small.  If greed and corruption is allowed to go unchecked what would be the motivation to stop?</p>

<p>I thin you are actually overemphasizing your role as a consumer. People in this subreddit are not the usual target for reddit for instance. They will ban people for posting inflammatory shit that can run off advertisers-- Because advertisers are how reddit make money. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why FPH and CoonTown were banned for instance, it looked terrible for Reddit, who makes money through advertising. You are nothing to reddit, they wouldn&#39;t miss me or you if we left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that you are the minority, not the majority. It is likely the guys from writing prompts dont want their sub flooded with political crap, is that so bad?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even attempt to refute my argument, you seem to want to just stroke your own biases. Where do the owners of reddit and the likes rights end and your right to post here begin?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it is in their rules. My point is the admins there control the subreddit. You have no intrinsic right to post anything you want on it without retribution. </p>

<p>It&#39;s shitty admin abuse to ban you, but that&#39;s it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t prove a negative. By that logic no private firm could do anything because they may be secretly owned by the government?</p>

<p>The keyword would be secret, meaning they appear to not be owned by the government, which is why this can continue. It still doesn&#39;t address the whole &quot;right&quot; to use platforms people feel they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an obvious and concerted effort to prevent anything subversive from reaching the front pages of r/all.   R/videos created a new sub &quot;political videos&quot; to quarantine dangerous ideas.    Only content that conforms with the mainstream Democrats and to a lesser extent the mainstream Republicans is permitted.   A handful of subs still manage to leak through, but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s only a manner of time before subs like r/conspiracy are neutralized.   Interestingly, the posts from this sub that make it to r/all tend to be the LEAST credible, suggesting a sophisticated counter-intelligence operation involving black propaganda.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I&#39;d believe it. Reddit has gone to shit in the past few years... Especially after Reddit got sold and Especially after the intelligence leaks, several years back. </p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your information. </p>

<p>There is DEFINITELY a systemic, mass, Co-intel apparatus on Reddit. Utilizing misdirection, deliberate cultivation of ignorance, &#39;meme warfare&#39; and black propaganda. It is so glaringly apparent.  </p>

<p>I think they will keep r/conspiracy as it is so they can see what people know and &#39;threat-matrix&#39; them. </p>
