       What game are we playing? The one where you pretend to be concerned about someone while achieving an agenda to make me look dumb? While you attempt to demoralize another human being again? That game? Or the one where you say it's just your opinion, knowing that if you get enough people to share your opinion you are the majority and can use that to silence the minority. Back to censorship. You've already lost.

       Agreed it is heavily censored, disagree it is unwittingly.  Look at all the hurdles put in front of men.  Less than 1% controls a majority of the wealth, meaning they are the ones that control competition.  Big time players like Reddit, FB, Twitter, Google, Netflix, etc etc all exist for a reason.  This isn't a free market.  Entities as giant as the aforementioned are allowed to exist.  Think about it, they own it all, how can there ever be any genuine competition.  We still have the bar too low and we still think too small.  If greed and corruption is allowed to go unchecked what would be the motivation to stop?

       Apparently so. It is sad. I actually have respect for some of the moderators there. But still, every rationalization they come up with to excuse why they target the deletion of what they very liberally define as 'political posts'  seems like utter BULLSHIT.

       Writing prompt: You find yourself watching the slow insidious creep of censorship into every facet of your life while being gaslit by elected government officials and a complicit corporate media that claim to be fighting for democracy. Just going to work creates panic attacks because you're not sure who you can talk to about it. Surely some of them see it too. They can't all be mindless sheep. They can't all be the new Nazi informers. But how do you find them?

       Doesn't matter that it is still the truth. That isn't even an argument, the fact of the matter is that you don't have a right to be on reddit, I don't know where this entitlement people have came from.

       I thin you are actually overemphasizing your role as a consumer. People in this subreddit are not the usual target for reddit for instance. They will ban people for posting inflammatory shit that can run off advertisers-- Because advertisers are how reddit make money.
      </p>

       That's why FPH and CoonTown were banned for instance, it looked terrible for Reddit, who makes money through advertising. You are nothing to reddit, they wouldn't miss me or you if we left.

       The keyword would be secret, meaning they appear to not be owned by the government, which is why this can continue. It still doesn't address the whole "right" to use platforms people feel they have.

       There is an obvious and concerted effort to prevent anything subversive from reaching the front pages of r/all.   R/videos created a new sub "political videos" to quarantine dangerous ideas.    Only content that conforms with the mainstream Democrats and to a lesser extent the mainstream Republicans is permitted.   A handful of subs still manage to leak through, but I'm guessing it's only a manner of time before subs like r/conspiracy are neutralized.   Interestingly, the posts from this sub that make it to r/all tend to be the LEAST credible, suggesting a sophisticated counter-intelligence operation involving black propaganda.

       Fascinating. I'd believe it. Reddit has gone to shit in the past few years... Especially after Reddit got sold and Especially after the intelligence leaks, several years back.

       Thanks for sharing your information.

       There is DEFINITELY a systemic, mass, Co-intel apparatus on Reddit. Utilizing misdirection, deliberate cultivation of ignorance, 'meme warfare' and black propaganda. It is so glaringly apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they will keep r/conspiracy as it is so they can see what people know and 'threat-matrix' them.
